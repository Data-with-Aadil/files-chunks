either bad mounting or not enough thermal paste.,"common mistake people make is using the pre applied thermal paste with the excuse ""oh its worked before"", but what they don't do is there research about the bend when mounting lga1700 socket chips, specifically the amount of bend & area of the bend which requires slightly more paste.","beyond that people fail to tune the fans, if you hit 80-90c+ when gaming lower the point they kick in at 100%, noisy yes = so?!?","!, you get the temps you want.","edit: oh & the asus lga 12xx mounts on boards for 12 gen, they cause the cooler to sit a little higher, so once again more paste or buy the correct mount like you should of in the first place... it's not rocket science on this one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that seems highly unlikely given your cooler.,it's more likely that disabling or detuning turbo boost is just a band-aid for the problem.,it's much more likely that your 240mm aio isn't contacting the ihs fully.,there have been many cases of aios (even with lga 1700 conversion kits) not properly mounting and contacting the ihs.,the best way to determine this is press on the aio and see if you can watch your temps drop.,you also can then pull the pull the water block off and look at the thermal paste spread.,"if your thermal paste isn't spread properly then consider adding more using the ""noctua large cpu method"".","ultimately though, if your water block isn't sitting properly on the ihs and you have it fully tightened then you may need to contact the manufacturer or just purchase a more compatible model.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what voltage you are using?,"here i canâ€™t get stable on r23 with 5.1 oc p cores, 3.9 e cores, and ring on 3.9 with less than 1.340 v. the temps immediately rises to 100c.","the specs, 1.29 v i can manage the intel xtu stress test (not the memory one) and keep max temp around 82. i donâ€™t know which kind of magic you guys do it to keep it cool on cinebench r23z",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what part is funny?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thermal paste application doesnâ€™t matter if your cooler isnâ€™t making complete contact with the ihs.,multiple nzxt aio owners have reported problemsâ€¦ the issue generally lies in the cooler mounting system not clamping tight enough on the cpu and no amount of tightening can fix that because itâ€™s often an actual problem with the standoffs or mount.,what are your temps with turbo boost back at defaults while running cinebench r23 multi-core for a few minutes?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i doubt that a 12900k that's ""overclocked heavily"" only reaches up to 85 under continouus full load.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nothing higher than 70c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
define continuous for me.,i ran prime95 and then ran linx both for an hour.,didn't see any reason to test further than that.,"haven't had a crash yet, peak temp was 88c on my hottest core, lowest core was 84c.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cb r23 multi-core runs at <70c with turbo boost enabled but games are running at over 90c?,at intel defaults a typical 12900k should be running 70-80c during cb r23 multi-core,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with it enabled it runs at 94c.,"disabled it wasnâ€™t going over 70c for anything, games were well under that at like 50c with it disabled.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you know what i think this is one the most valuable pieces of advice i have ever got for that i just see the ppl all the time do these test so i thought it would be a good to just optimize your settings accordingly.,and no i won't do that it would be gaming/streaming with minor to medium video editing.,but i have another question if you can kindly help me out and answer:so for cpus to get best performance with lowest voltage and wattage(and lower heat so this is the most important part for me) you need to tinker around cpu lite load and things like that but when you do that you need to test if it is going to be stable or not so if i am not going cinema 4d and things like that should i do the tests while gaming or should i use something like cinibenceh to test stability?,i really hope you answer that question for me because these things give me anxiety when i think i need to tinker around carefully until i find the sweet spot and i am almost completely illiterate in these kinds of stuff,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"hey there, i think you have the same problem i had when i built my pc when the 12th gen cpu launched with an msi 360r aio that had dirty water inside that thermal throttled and under performed.",- it is not the thermal paste.,"- it is not the cpu or ihs

the problem most likely is the aio itself having quality issues with the water inside, and if you have the same msi aio i had then that is your answer.",get a new cpu cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nah, i'll bet on a failing aio any day than a bad mount",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it looks like the top right corner (and maybe the top left) of you cooler isn't making very good contact.,is the cooler possibly hitting any of the heatsinks or anything on the motherboard?,i know that some coolers have clearance issues with the vrm heatsinks.,my aio clears the vrm heatsinks by 1-2mm.,"i have the bending issue with my cpu, and my aio has a flat coldplate, the pattern of the thermal paste doesn't look like what you have in the photos.",the paste on my cpu puddles across the center horizontally where the cpu is being held down.,top and bottom edges should look like how your bottom edge looks like.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this isnt bending.,"bending has the opposite effect, where the corners are raised, but center is sunken, so if you had a bending issue the thermal paste would be pooling in the middle, not the edges.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
make sure to verify that your water cooler is actually working properly.,recently there have been a lot of cases of clogged up aio's (manufacturing defect).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the issue is with your aio not seating correctly on the motherboard.,are you using an lga1700 bracket?,i was using a 1200bracket with my asus board and had the same problem.,also try spreading the thermal past your self to get an even coat on the cpu.,i did both of these and dropped my temps by 10degrees while idle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™ve read some stuff about alder lakes bending, itâ€™s actually â€œnormalâ€.",at least thatâ€™s what intel said,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
making sure you apply thermal paste correctly and in the right amounts is crucial.,"and you should have it built up on one side, it should spread from the center.",somethings wrong and it's either your mount or the way your applying the paste.,and you definitely need to clean the unit before you apply anything new to it or it won't make good contact and help transfer heat.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

perhaps it could simply be poor case airflow?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would make sure you have all the correct components for the aio to mount correctly on the cpu.,a lot of companies (imo) half assed their mounting solutions for alder lake.,the stand offs being shorter is the main thing.,if you did everything correctly i would look into doing the â€œwasher modâ€ which is cheap and easy to do and will fix your problem if it is a bending cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

looks like a bad mount plus intels ihs being curved/concave.,i saw others mention the cooler hitting other parts.,that is especially true with lga 1700 since they increased the socket to 78mm.,i would try your aio again with new paste.,gently push it down and then take it righ back off to check.,if it happens again then you might need to change coolers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"it's 100% not the aio, seeing it on air coolers/water blocks/aio's and even phase change units.",the big overclockers were lapping the lids to the extreme pretty much ruining lids that once corrected have a big hump in the middle.,"the issue is intels design of their lga mounting bracket there are three pieces of mental that are putting too much pressure onto the latch and lid that is then transferred down to cpu lid at two points, also the other side of the mounting kit on the board is lower than the side with the latch and lid cover also not helping the problem.","its why the washer mod was first discovered, followed by the creation by two bigger companies with their lid correction brackets.",it's an issue on every single lga 1700 board with intel's cpu mounting hardware.,"i just know about it as much as i do because i had been dealing with the issue for four months, spent a lot of money trying to get two perfect 1mm m4 washers perfect in both thickness and no imperfections.",then thermalright came out with their solution and yeah that took care of my issues.,temps/vcore went way down immediately then over 2-3 weeks my lid corrected fully or at least as good as its going to get.,my temp sensors all fully worked again as well.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=isoiusugm7s,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's also contacting directly over the cpu die so it's not the concave ihs issue at all.,op needs to tighten up the top right a bit more but that's off the hot part of the ihs so it'll be a few degrees c of difference at most.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

tldr.. intel's incompetent engineers managed to make so bad socket design that it bends cpus.,seems like every new gen from intel is of worse quality than the previous one.,"first it was security issues, then power consumption going to 250w, then games not working because of stupidly releasing new core design without making sure it won't cause problems for sw, now this crappy issue with badly designed socket.",more people should consider buying ryzen instead so it will push intel to become better again by affecting their sales.,i don't like intel going to shit like this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

even with the contact frame it would still be better to also lap the cpu.,edit: also for the op is not an aio problem.,it is just the fact that the cpuâ€™s are more rectangular than a square and the pressure is applied differently.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it happens no matter what cooler you use, air/water/aio, the bow happens to the cpu lid due to intels lga mounting hardware there is a flaw at three points where it forces the lid and the latch to apply too much pressure to the cpu lid.","[https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=isoiusugm7s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=isoiusugm7s)

"from cpuid hw monitor while most cores are 100â°c, there are two that are 88â°c so that could be a similar problem, yet i think it's not because the edge is too far but because the mounting clamp applies too much pressure in the middle bending it away from cooler edit: oooor temp sensor is fucked on that two cores",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no itâ€™s three points in the lga 1700 mounting bracket that forces too much pressure on two spots/points on the cpu lid causing it to bow.,it starts the second you latch the cpu down for the first time and gets worse over time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the ilm bends the cpu, nothing to do with the cooler.","you don't see people with i5's complain as much because they're less likely to be enthusiasts, and it's a cooler chip less likely to reach very high temepratures anyway.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think you don't understand the point we are talking about.,"if you have a 10th, 9th, 8th or any other intel cpu and you get bad temps the first things you do is check your cooler, thermal paste application or mounting pressure.",but people with 12th gen they just jump to say that they have a bending problem when they could have the other problems.,i'm not saying there are bending problems what i'm saying is that the other problems are more commons and people should check those first.,"i'm a current user of sff subreddit and most people post their 12th gen builds without problems and low temps so i don't think the bending problems is an issue that happened to 100% of people, but a bad aio, bad thermal paste or bad mounting pressure can happened to any build.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no problem, i hope you find the issue.",even just being 1-2mm off will cause something to look like this.,"i've also seen some people accidentally mixing up the standoffs for lga 1200 and 1700, which has a height difference of 1-2mm, causing the paste to look something like this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i ordered the lga 1700 conversion kit from corsair for my h150i and ran into what appears to be a similar problem.,i think some of these lga 1700 conversion kits aren't getting the stack height right.,i moved to an asus aio and my temperature problems immediately went away and i moved my corsair h150i aio to another one of my systems (9900k) where it is working great.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes... just get one or the other.,you will probably have better luck getting thermalrights.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i would argue you should use the frame for a few months before lapping.,"if the cpu is bowed and you lap it before the bend is corrected by the frame, then once the frame has corrected the bend the bottom and top will be way lower than they should be, because they were lapped while they were higher than they should be",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yup.,they say itâ€™s something with the ihs too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i never had bending issue.,"as i said, bending can only occur when force is high enough.","if you don't have too much pressure on your cpu lid, how can it bend the cpu lid, it is as simple as that...

lga1700 original kit or retrofit kit adjusted the height of whatever you are talking about, to make the pressure high and cooler|lid interface as tight as possible.","**this is the possible reason why most people have bending issues**...

but i use the original lga1200 holes on a asus z690m mobo (this mobo has lga1200 and lga1700 holes at the same time).","people said if i use lga1200 holes, then the height is not suitable and the pressure at cooler|lid interface may not be strong enough to make it tight enough.",**good!!!,so it also cannot be strong enough to bend my cpu lid.,** this is what i want.,"and btw, **i've never seen the cooler|lid interface not tight enough due to lga1200's height concern, at all**.",i am running my 12600kf at 5.1ghz all p-core and 4.0ghz all e-core.,"cpu test 15min reached 67â„ƒ, and fpu test 15min only reached 80â„ƒ.","after 3 months, i tested them again, very similar results... so, **i don't know why people bother switching from lga1200 to lga1700 mounting holes when the latter give the chance to bend your cpu lid**... probably most people bought the mobos without lga1200 holes??",?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i very much understand.,yet itâ€™s an issue if your cooler works correctly or not.,"you could swap out a ton of coolers, apply tim over 30 times and still be left going whatâ€™s wrong.",because you didnâ€™t address the main issue that is on all 1700 boards cpu mounting hardware bowing the cpu lid.,i can tell by the pic what the issue look at the tim where itâ€™s going as i have dealt with it.,if this was not an issue the lid correction frame would not exist.,watch the gamers nexus on the video they even show the bows at various different contact patterns.,also being someone who has dealt with this each time you remove the cooler to take the cpu out the worse the bow gets as well as everything else that goes with it.,"like temps/vcore flying up to insane levels, to even your cpu temp sensors cutting out.","https://youtu.be/ysb25vsnbqi

"hi to all just to add a few details about what happened,

the processor at the top is an i7-4770

i was suppose to swap with my friends motherboard that is a h97m-e asus, and i am using an ga-b85n phoenix-wifi motherboard, i guess what it makes me happy is to see how many ram slots and capabilities it has for overclocking and supporting many ram types and even higher clock rates although its still ddr3, but im fine with it, i dont have money so he agreed to swap,

now when i tried swapping it, all is good but when i tried opening it up, it doesnt boot, so it opens, lights, fans everything.","i tried checking maybe its one of the ram slots issues, so check with my rams, and his and honestly its like half a day to troubleshoot with everything we have, we even have his processor i3 4th gen to test and it works,

then suddenly i checked the bottom of the processor, then thats i conclude its my processor is the problem, i dont have a picture but imagine that part i marked is missing, but before that i saw and touched it like its spongy and soft, and i check on the net there was suppos to be a capacitor there,( as some of you mentioned that was a capacitor)

right now i am using it, but honestly it my pc feels slow and sometimes as i mention on the top it doesnt boot when i tried doing things like tight timings on ram or undervolting, sometimes may gpu doesnt work as well, but right now as we speak i am still using it to chat,

so overall it is repairable?","i live in the philippines and intel shops are like we will send your processor away but will take 3 months to arrive, which i think is not true cause some mentioned half a year., im broke im really sorry to ask but i am thinking to find an old processor to swap it back or maybe yeah find someone who has it and let them repair it, is this the right choice?",thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

>z690-a pro wifi.,"actually, the main reason that i want to change my overclocked 6700k to 12700 is my issues with my m2 speed(wd sn 850 is the fastest m2) i think if i can get a better cpu and a better m2 i can work faster.","i do not play video games too much, i am a photo editor and a creator of content that work with photos, not videos.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it really depends on which cpu you are getting.,if it's the low powered ones e.g.,"12700, 12600 or 12400 then it should be fine.",but if it's the k series e.g.,"12600k, 12700k and 12900k, you need a lot more cooling for that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not great.,if there's no increase in ipc it will be a weak product unless the clock speed is ridiculous.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

normal on early engineering samples due to very low clock speed compared to final retail units.,early 12900k engineering samples performed worse than 7700k did in single threaded tasks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there's no point in adding more p-cores.,applications that rely on them the most (games) rarely use more than 6. multithreaded applications like blender will benefit more from double or triple the amount of e-cores than just a couple more p-cores in the same die space.,"also gracemont isn't as slow as people assume, it's better than a skylake core (i7 6700k for example) while using less power.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

e cores don't slow down cache.,each e core comes with a slice of last level cache that actually makes the cpu faster in most applications including games.,it's possible to have scheduling policy that always schedules threads on a particular type of core.,so.you can have all your gaming workload run only on p cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

honestly 16 efficiency cores seems a bit excessive.,imo they should bump up the performance cores to at the very least 10 then have 8 efficiency cores.,boggles the mind why they dropped the i9 chips from 10c to 8c and kept it there.,"i know 11th gen was a backport in node hence the change, but to continue it seems dumb imo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">now my question:

for the second question 
having an rtx 3080 with a 11400f is gonna have crazy bottle necs (especially at 1080p) if you want a 3080 you should at least have an i5 11-10th gen k cpu and also if you want to switch your cpu see if you can find good deals on maybe a 10700/k 10900/k  or 11700/11900 i believe all of those should be better with your system than your current cpu

good luck",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just upgrade the gpu then see it there are bottlenecks(not much tbh) then and only then shoot for a 11700k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do neither and wait for am5 and 40 series.,or else you will be messed again by buying a platform which is killed in  just 2 year.,your combo is great.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a b560 motherboard can run a k-suffix cpu without any problem.,however you cannot overclock and boost tends to be lower in comparison to z590 boards.,"paying extra for a k-suffix cpu just to use it in a b560 board is kind of a waste, you may as well get the non-k version and save some money.",a core i5-11400f should be able to keep a rtx 3080 happy.,the primary bottleneck would be on the graphics card at any rate for higher resolutions.,should you be dissatisfied by the performance of your i5 an 11th generation i7 is a drop-in replacement.,i wouldn't bother with the 11th gen i9.,it draws quite a bit of power under load and gets rather hot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it all depends on the games you play and at what resolution you play.,"i had a 3700x at ultra wide resolution and the cpu what sleeping, rarely went over 40% usage.","we need more information but be careful but be wary of all that bottleneck talk, most people donâ€™t understand it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"thanks man, i think the same way.",i think imma get a 10900,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i mostly play warzone, which as i see.. uh.. how should i put it.. the higher mhz your cpu runs, the better the performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you have the money for the 10900k and the 3080 just spend the extra money and grab a z490/590 mobo so you can overclock it.,just my two cents.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh yes exactly like it took 2 gen for intel to finally match ryzen 5000 performance yet again they got destroyed by a 5800x3d.,sad.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you want an i9 the 10th gen would be the better option compared to the 11th gen i9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i looked at some benchmarks and the 11400 is bottlenecked by a rtx 3060 at 1080p.,fps explode on a rtx 3080 and performance is really good.,"if you are confortable with over 100fps, i see no point in upgrading.","you can wait a year or too easily, it is not a bad cpu.",because a new cpu comes out does not mean your cpu is to be updated.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this works as well lol.,"i can tell you even with a 10900 you will be very cpu bottlenecked with a 3080. 

i have my 3080 paired with a i9-10850k ocd to 5.2ghz all core and only get 60-70% utilization on most games at 1080p sometimes less but i can't easily push 240fps or higher",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what if i increase the render resolution?,for wxample in warzone my monitor set to fhd but my render resolution is 120% which is basically 1440p.,"and i kid you not, i have more fps",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in cases where utilization is only 60-70% with a 5.2 ghz 10850k, it still won't be worlds better with 12th gen (and especially not with a mid range chip that would be comparable in price with upgrading to 10900), definitely not 100%.",it's just not that much faster...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you buying this cpu new?,"if so, go for a 12400f instead and a decent b660 board.","if you already have the cpu, a z490 or b460 board will do the job",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"they mean, why donâ€™t you use google and find out?",but hereâ€™s part of the first result: â€œcentrino is a brand name of intel corporation which represents its wi-fi and wimax wireless computer networking adapters.,previously the same brand name was used by the company as a platform-marketing initiative.,"the change of the meaning of the brand name occurred on january 7, 2010. the centrino got replaced by the ultrabook.â€",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it didnâ€™t help that â€œcentrinoâ€ sounded so close to celeron, which also existed at the same time as a mobile cpu.","though centrino specified a pentium m or, later, core cpu, and iâ€™m not sure that celeron m was a valid centrino combination, which would have just made centrino seem like a celeron competitor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
really?,"so this was a technology to make the early 00s laptops wireless instead of being stuck with wires, particularly in the beginning of the wifi era?",pretty cool!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"celeron still exists as a mobile cpu, in the low end market (cheap hp streams, tablets, chromebooks) and even in the higher end markets (business class machines) *not so popular in the higher end tho*.","i think that any kind of laptop that had intel wifi, bluetooth and chipset/cpu, is a centrino based machine (the only non centrino being the super low end celerons of the time).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"uh, noâ€¦ wifi existed long before then.",it was just a collection of requirements set out by intel that manufacturers could use to market their product as meeting that â€œidealâ€.,"exactly like how ultrabook is used today, and in fact it was just the first version of that.","it was trying to get away from chunky heavy laptops with crappy battery life, so centrino models had to include a specific series of power efficient intel cpu, intel wifi, longer battery life, maybe some weight requirements, and so forth.","none of the parts were special, it was just a guarantee to consumers that the model would meet the â€œcentrinoâ€ minimums.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i'm not entirely sure what intel's stress test does, whether its a mix test or just 100% load for 5 min straight.",this behavior would be very weird if you were just idling but high temps during a stress test could be the test asking the cpu to do heavy work load suddenly then dropping it to see how the cooling capability keeps up with the throttle.,"if you wanna test this further, i highly suggest going into power settings , advanced, and setting your max cpu load % to \~95% and running the test again.","i've changed this for many computers, rarely see a performance drop off and make a huge difference when it comes to stress load temps",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"laptop cpu can sometimes suffer from insufficient thermal paste or insufficient contact pressure, you can try to repaste and tighten the heatsink, if that doesn't solve the issue its probably heatsink qc problem, which is unfixible on our end, and you might want to ask the oem of your laptop for repair.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i've been buying thermal grizzly for a while now.,never heard of fake sellers.,stick with first parties and not marketplace resellers and you should be fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
anything to be concerned with about temps above 80c?,just reading in places on reddit that it degrades faster.,and itâ€™ll definitely be over 80c iâ€™m assuming haha,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thermal grizzly did have a bunch of fake sellers a few years ago.,"it's a premium priced product that all counterfeiters had to replicate was the packaging/tube and then fill them with half decent bulk paste, most people would never know.","it was a big enough problem that me and others just stopped buying it, as there are other pastes that are just as good but less popular.","https://www.google.com/search?q=thermal+grizzly+counterfeit

"80c has no factual basis for being a concern, the intel spec is 100c, so anything below that should be safe.","obviously lower is better, but with laptops sometimes that's just the way things are.","also for the record, voltage is more damaging than temps, and most laptops are binned and run at much lower voltages than desktop chips.","it's very rare for a cpu to die, you're far more likely to experience issues with your motherboard or power supply long before the cpu itself dies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i guess intel is going to attempt to position these as premium priced alternatives when they really shouldn't be.,"i don't mind alchemist mobile gpus being 10-20% slower than their ampere mobile counterparts **at equal power** as long as they're priced accordingly, but it seems like they're taking the disingenuous benchmark route again with unfair power configurations",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tldr: arc a770m (120-150w) with a next gen cpu actually trades blows with the 3060 mobile 85w version with a last gen cpu.,"the a770m also has 12gb of vram, a welcome spec to be sure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

considering on the desktop side the aib a380 consuming 92w cant even beat rx 6400 at 50w, im betting these numbers are from the max power limit being compared to these bottom tier nvidia gpus consuming almost half

well at least something is better than nothing, and more gpus in users hands is more data points to improve drivers with",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's great, but the a770m looks to be 40-70w higher in terms of power consumption (85w vs intel's claimed 120-150w for a770m).",that's a huge difference in a laptop.,all that and it's less than 15% faster on average?,yikes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wow this is really underwhelming.,i didn't expect intel to really compete in high end desktop graphics space (anyone that thought they would have a card that can trade blows with a 3090 or a 6900xt is a fool).,"but i did expect them to have really competitive mobile offerings, since the tile nature of their design, and the fact that their actual experience in igpus should translate well.","if their gpus are only trading blows with nvidia and amd mobile gpus at far higher power levels, then that's pretty much a disaster for intel.","power consumption is generally not a major consideration in high end desktops, where intel isn't going to be able to compete.","in mobile, power consumption is a huge consideration.","if alchemist gpus are being aimed in competing in segments where they are consuming nearly double the power draw, there's not really any chance they gain significant market-share they aren't simply buying their way into (think quota orders, kickbacks and bundled deals).",disclosure: i own intel stock,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's way lower performance than expected.,intel needs 400mm^(2) of 6nm tsmc to beat 276mm^(2) samsung's 8nm?,it's 12 billion transistors for nvidia vs 22 billion for intel.,"almost double the gpu, on a better node and they can barely beat nvidia, and likely the same for the upcoming  laptop rx 6650m xt which uses like 11 billion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that is shockingly bad.,pretty shameless to compare them with totally difference power specs.,why didn't they do the 115-130w variant of the 3060 so that it's more even with the 120-150w a770m?,[here's an example of how a higher power budget 3060 stacks up against the one intel used in their testing.,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9us9caniom&t=727s) they'd likely be dead even.,and it isn't like there aren't any 12 gen alderlake cpus being paired with 3060's.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

according to intel a380 was faster than rx 6400. however based off 3rd party benchmarks rx 6400 is 15-20% faster.,intel compared against lower powered 3050ti and 3060. in short take intel claim with a grain of salt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

intel never said a380 was faster than rx 6400. they made a price for performance claim but most tech news sites were too dumb to understand.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel might have actually priced their paper launch high to prevent people from buying it because they knew it was unfinished.,"""the longer intel waits to launch the worse it is for them.""","i disagree, it has to work well from day one.","intel's reputation for average consumer reliability is at risk, which is different than paper launches and blowing through launch dates that only tech people and gamers care about.",desecrate low end graphics cards should be an easy up-sell to the average laptop consumer buying a u-type i-7 processor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"water cooled, on 360 arctic liquid.","i upgraded to 420 arctic liquid, but i am yet to test it.",i believe that now it will be possible to go to 5.0 with normal temps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah it's perfect, under load it sits around 55-65 degrees.",you have a great air-cooler so i'd say your temps would be roughly the same.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don't get fomo about 12thgen.,you can say the same in 2 years about 12th gen when 14thgen comes out.,that 10thgen i7 chip is an excellent chip..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 10700 is a great processor.,it has enough oomph to run an unraid server and still have the power to run a gaming machine as a vm within unraid.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i mean, don't worry about it.",the 10700kf is totally fine and honestly if you're not playing at low resolution any semi-modernish cpu will perform about the same for gaming because you'll be limited by the gpu.,"if it's still in return period and you can be bothered, and the options locally are good, maybe switch.",you can also consider bumping down the cpu for the gpu (i.e.,10600kf/12400f + 3060 ti/3070).,it's no big deal if you don't.,"12th gen has its fair share of teething issues like motherboard pricing, retention bracket bending issues, funky e-core scheduling in some oses, etc.",they're great cpus still ofc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10700kf is still a really solid cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"theres nothing to worry tho, 10700kf is still a great cpu

just use it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

motherboards are a killer too with z690 in particular.,honestly 12700k is awesome and a step up over 10700kf but the 10700kf is excellent value given you can save like $300 or so just on cpu + motherboard and it'll fit lga-115x coolers without issue its tough to look past.,you'll no doubt enjoy the 10700kf it's a solid choice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

saying something is obsolete when in real terms youâ€™d struggle to tell the difference between 10 and 12th gen. my 10900k ocâ€™d is only 5% less performance gaming than a 12900k.,enjoy ðÿ˜ž,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>the 10600kf sadly is about the same price i paid for for 10700kf.,"because there's no active supply for products this old anymore; whatever stock is left in stores/warehouses gets initially discounted to clear as much as possible, but some is always left around to sell at randomly gouged prices to people buying replacement parts for their old systems.",you can probably find the 12600kf or 12700f for not much more (or maybe less?),than what you paid for this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10700kf is a nice chip and should have more than enough performance.,won't have some of the features of the 12th gen...but odds are you don't need e-cores anyway.,"i'd always recommend going for the best you can afford, which you've done - buy cheap, buy twice, after all!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the descriptive explanation.,do you have a gpu that has a great tdp?,i assume there is positive air pressure inside the case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah z690 prices are huge, unless you go for a low/mid-range board which might not have all the features you want.","i ended up going b660 on my build, does mean i can't oc my 12600kf but doubt i'll need to given it already boosts to 4.9ghz",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the 10700kf is still an amazing cpu.,iâ€™m gonna keep it as i donâ€™t wanna go through the hassle of upgrading motherboards also,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah itâ€™s still a great cpu.,some people recommended a 12th gen rather than what iâ€™ve got.,i can always send it back if need be.,what other cpu would you recommend?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, i have 3080, it goes to 70c under full load.","i have 420 rad as intake, and 3 140 as exhaust, but exhaust ones are slower, because they are tied to system temps which are naturaly lower than cpu temps, so it creates positive air pressure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice!,they're a top notch air cooler!,the load temps will be great too!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's nuts, even low/mid is pricey the msi z690-a pro d4 wifi was what i opted for as an entry level z690 that wasn't garbage and thats ~$330.",biggest thing that stopped me going a cheaper chipset was limitations on ram oc but it was pretty tempting.,yeah they're beasts and there's always bclk if you want a few extra mhz i think it's got at least some play and maybe a lot of play on some boards  :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i've got a 12600kf, but then again here in the uk the price difference is literally zero compared to the 10700k.",it depends on what you want to do with it but if like me you'll mainly/only use it for gaming then a 10700kf should be more than enough - at that level of performance the gpu is more important anyway (and the 3060 you're getting should be great!),"people on the internet will always recommend you buy the very latest, most expensive kit, but 9 times out of 10 it just isn't necessary for most users' needs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you shouldnt return it, but if you decide to return it, wait for 13th gen",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™d see if something like a 12400 + b660 mortar is a similar price or not.,given youâ€™re in the return window i would strongly suggest considering.,"12th gen will give you access to faster i/o, single threaded performance, and greater longevity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's great temps!,those gddrx modules get pretty hot from what i heard that's why they came up with custom copper pads to lower the heat by 10 to 15 or even 20 degrees!,"anyways, you have a great system.",glad to hear you have a 420mm rad.,thanks for answering my incessant questions and not getting annoyed.,have some awesome gaming or whatever you do with your new cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think it is a bit of luck of the draw.,"i've sometimes seen some luck with manually switching from the 133mhz memory strap to the 100mhz one (3600mhz happens to occur on both, and i think many boards default to 133mhz instead of 100mhz).","worth trying that, or possibly trying to see if 3500mhz works.",it's at least most of the way between 3200 and 3600.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"and to add to that, besides looking better on paper, the actual performance might actually suffer with more performance cores.",because cooling 10 or 12 p cores properly would be a challenge that no cooler could do.,then you'd have throttling which would make it feel slower than a cpu with less cores.,"e cores, by contrast, have a fantastic thermal profile.","anyone with 12th gen can tell you, the e cores never get hot.... so if you want more cores... ye shall receive more e cores ðÿ˜…",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i agree.,"&#x200b;

all my cpus were intel since 2007 and core 2 in my main computer.","then with zen 2 and zen 3 and the desire for more than 8 cores, i switched to amd.","&#x200b;

intel on their hedt recently did not have gpu slot pcie gen 4 even on cascade lake x which was released after zen 2. it took until rocket lake for pcie gen 4 and rocket lake was kind of meh and still stuck at 8 cores.",now we have to wait until next hedt to get pci gen 4 or above with more than 8 p cores.,"&#x200b;

i wish alder lake would have been the conroe moment but not even close.","yes ipc is a little better, but trade many more blows with much higher heat than amd.",where as conroe had much higher ipc uplift to k8/k10 and it was almost universal across the board for everything but memory latency and power consumption was less and could overclock so much easier and equal or more core counts.,those were the days.,"i wish there was another conroe like moment, though with some more competition from the other end to keep advances like that going rather than eventual stagnation for years due to no competition,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hedt may be an option.,but will it cost an arm and a leg.,and no i do not mean it just being more expensive than mainstream like before.,i mean the point of like motherboards costing $1000s and cpus costing $2000 for less than 16 core variants.,"&#x200b;

like broadwell-e and haswell-e cpus cost a lot more, but they were still sold in stores as super enthusiast and could be had mobos for $400-$500 and cpus for $600 to $1k

&#x200b;

and will hedt do you think be good for gaming the way alder lake p cores are.",or is the arch going to be different to reduce gaming performance kind of like threadripper has worse gaming performance compared to its mainstream ryzen counterparts.,"&#x200b;

where as on other hand intel hedt through broadwell e had as good or better gaming performance than haswell/broadwell or even sometimes skylake even though it was overkill.",but once intel switched hedt to skylake-x mesh and cascade lake-x it was modestly worse for gaming than the ring bus.,"&#x200b;

will hedt cpus of saphire rapids and the like have a similar issue to threadripper and intel skylkake-x and cascade lake-x for gaming or will they be more like haswell-e and broadwell-e equivalents to mainstream raptor lake and meteror lake?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah.,rumours point toward we being stuck in 8 perf cores for a few years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah agree.,i do not care for hybrid arch.,"yeah maybe intel can get more performance out of it in some cases, but the arch is incompatible and buggy and such a radical change form how multi processing computing has been done on desktop and server platforms on x86 for 2+ decades.","&#x200b;

have true parallelism and compatibility with low level windows schedulers and their corresponding apps is extremely important.",and no just because most apps seem ok with e cores does not mean problems are not there.,some apps can get assigned to e cores even on win11.,never such a problem the past 2 decades for dual cpu systems or multi core cpus.,"&#x200b;

there has inevitably been lots of change in architectures over the years in computers.",but generally archiecture changes have not created issues with how radically different apps and windows have to behave with low level windows scheduler and such which is almost as big of a deal as going away from x86.,its like an arm design.,"&#x200b;

do not have a problem by itself with some of it, but more than 8 cores should be offered.","&#x200b;

i went back to a 5900x as such and am happier.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes i agree, thats why i went back to amd.",its not like golden cove has that much better ipc anyways vs zen 3 and they often trade blows in ipc depending on software even if golden cove overall has a slight to modest edge at same clock speed.,the golden cove cores do have the ability to manually overclock much higher than zen 3 though which will give much better performance.,though you need super good cooling going above 5.1ghz and sometimes even above 5ghz even with e cores off and it will run way too hot even on a dual tower noctua.,"so to get that far better performance almost run into a heat wall, though you get a 300-500mhz advantage over amd zen 3 with similar to slightly better ipc.","&#x200b;

zen 3 cores on other hand very hard to do all core near 5ghz or even 4.9.",4.8 sometimes can be barely in reach and 4.7 and 4.6 often is within reach manually with almost if not 100% stability at least on one ccd and usually 4.5 on other from my experience with smt off on a 5900x.,"&#x200b;

but yeah the e cores screw things up.",supposedly only background tasks are suppose to use them and in theory that would work.,"but even on win11, the actual p cores were being used for background tasks not the e cores for even av.",and sometimes a foreground app would get stuck fully on one e core which was bad.,and every core was parked when they were not in use.,"&#x200b;

if the e cores are off it works like a normal 8 core cpu and no cores are parked ht on or ht off.","but with e cores on, win10 parks the p cores and e cores are not parked.",win11 parks everything not in use which causes performance to be reduced.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well actually they technically have alder lake cpus without e cores like the core i5 12400f, but it only has 6 p cores.",i think you mean like me you wish they had more than 8 or at least 8 on a node without the e cores.,cause the best 8 core you can do without e cores is 12700k/kf and that has 4 e cores you would need to disable in the bios.,and even that has 5mb less cache than 12900k.,the only best way to get full p core experience and it does make a difference is to buy a 12900k and shut off e cores.,then you have 30mb l3 cache and no e cores.,"&#x200b;

intel should release a cpu with 8 po cores and at least 30mb l3 cache if anything.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hedt will likely use a mesh interconnect rather than a single fast ringbus, which will mean worse gaming performance as per-core memory bandwidth is lower with mesh.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> hedt may be an option.,but will it cost an arm and a leg.,and no i do not mean it just being more expensive than mainstream like before.,i mean the point of like motherboards costing $1000s and cpus costing $2000 for less than 16 core variants.,"if they're really going to split it into mainstream workstation and highend workstation lines, i doubt the prices are anywhere near that level for mainstream.",my guess is probably less than $1000 for a motherboard and 12 core processor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tr doesn't have zen3s unified cache yet.,they will most likely be slower in gaming because of the quad channel memory.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">but will it cost an arm and a leg

not really relative to the server ones

those hedt boards also have a fuck ton of memory, io

>and will hedt do you think be good for gaming the way alder lake p cores are.",or is the arch going to be different to reduce gaming performance kind of like threadripper has worse gaming performance compared to its mainstream ryzen counterparts.,"it will be like threadripper

hedt is for people who need higher multicore performance, more memory, more io than consumer ones, not for gaming",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you actually **tried** 12th gen?,or are you just repeating the perceived problems some naysayers have?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">i5 12400f

yea the thing is they usually come with lower cache/lower boost and lower everything like you said :/

\>the only best way to get full p core experience and it does make a difference is to buy a 12900k and shut off e cores.",then you have 30mb l3 cache and no e cores.,think thats what i'm gonna do honestly if i ever buy a cpu at this point because i don't think they're gonna rid of e-cores for their high end cpu's.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so even though they are both golden cove cores, it will still use a mesh to connect them.",unlike haswell-e and broadwell-e which used a ring bus??,"and were skylake x cores on x2999 hedt exactly the same as the cores on a 6700k/7700k, they just used a mesh instead of ring bus to connect them??","&#x200b;

and is a mesh that intel uses like infinity fabric on ryzen or not the same?",?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it looks like they are going to have mainstream and special or something.,mainstream will have up to 24 cores and special like up to 56 cores.,"&#x200b;

but darn it looks like is gonna be on a mesh.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not yet as threadripper based zen 3 i do not believe exists yet but is coming.,though even threadripper 3000 was worse for gaming than ryzen 3000 cpus as they had worse latency between chiplets for all the cores i think and ram access.,"&#x200b;

is the golden cove cores in saphire rapids going to have similar issues?","&#x200b;

are you saying saphire rapids will be slower than alder lake golden cove cores for gaming because of quad channel memory??",even though both use golden cove cores saphire rapids just has options for more than 8.,"&#x200b;

is that only because of quad channel memory which will make it be clocked lower and thus worse for gaming?",there will not be a dual channel equivalent motherboard for sapphire rapids to run ram at as fast of speeds or low of latencies?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its not designed for gaming and in fact overkill in general.,but will it actually be worse for gaming that does not scale over more than 6-8 p cores due to the mesh archiecture?,even memory bandwidth starved high end games?,?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have tried it and it is great for an 8 core cpu with e cores off.,but with the e cores i get issues with tasks being assigned to them that should not be.,and windows sometimes does not even know how to use them.,and i cannot stand win11 either.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and the 13th gen i9 is going to have basically 2 i7 9700s (or similar to 2x10400f) in the e cores alone... while it doesn't have a lot of cache for games, it's still impressive stuff",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yup sadly.,"and even worse, they are not going to add anymore p-cores on non-hedt and even hedt if it does come back is only going to be a mesh which will suck for those gamers who want a little more than big cores.","&#x200b;

if they offered a cpu with more p cores even if it also had e-cores it would be great as you could buy it and just disable the e-waste cores and you get more than 8 big boy core only cpu even though you would pay more than a hypothetical more than 8 big boy core cpu with no e-cores at all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah intel usually was more reliable as they have a lot more resources and are bigger so they should be.,"&#x200b;

its quite frankly sad they have had these issues with their process node and heat consumption given the resources they have.",and cannot get more than 8 p cores on a node on mainstream ring bus based cpus.,"&#x200b;

i mean when amd was winning over intel back from 2003 to 2006 with athlon 64 over netbust pentium 4 even at much lower clocks due to 70-80% ipc advantage over netburst, intel had to do something.",they evolved their pentium m arch into conroe and released it and rest was history.,it just blew amd out of the water.,"&#x200b;

today they have not been able to do that.",yes alder lake does win on most ends but it is no wear near the knockout punch conroe was to amd k8-k10.,"it tops out at 8 p cores, ipc is only 12% better on average and not even universal across the board and trades more blows.","i suppose in a similar way it does clock to 5ghz and 5.1ghz much easier on golden cove cores kind of like conroe overclocked much easier than k8-k10, however power consumption is worse and it hits a wall at 5ghz before power consumption becomes really really bad that air cooling is no longer possible on 8 core golden cove parts beyond 5/5.1ghz all core.",where as conroe could overclock beyond 3ghz easily and still use less power than amd k8 at 2.4- 2.6ghz and has 20-25% higher ipc universally in everything unlike golden cove only 12% and not nearly as universal in that 12% ipc advantaged compared to conroe's universal 20-25% ipc gain over k8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i mean like 4.8ghz across all golden cove cores on a 12900k vs same exact 4.8ghz across all golden cove cores on a sapphire rapids cpu.,"&#x200b;

will the latency be much better than gracemont cores in raptor lake?",like will it be able to set affinity and run a game on 6 or more e cores on raptor lake with far superior performance to the e cores on alder lake.,so like gaming performance would be like coffee lake but clocked lower but same at same clock speed without ht.,"or will the e cores not be near that good, but good for what they need to do?",?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it shouldn't be having latencies as low as the 9700 family (e cores' cache isn't big enough.,"), but if you do something like rendering i assume it will be efficient.",edit: it will be interesting to see zen 4's memory latency too.,"because right now it doesn't seem like we can pull off imc:memory 1:1 with ddr5, and zen isn't known for having particularly good latency.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"for 99% of people, no.","for people that have coolers (usually custom loop blocks) that dont have good contact because they are flat instead of convex, and want to to push their chip harder, yes, you can shave off 6-10c, though the washer mod can do around 5c in the same setup, though the washer mod is less reliable and will probably deform overtime.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if your cpu is core i5 (150w), changing to this contact frame wouldn't make any different.","for i7 and i9 (above 200w), i would recommend this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i use custom loop water cooling with cheap barrow cpu block (30 usd).,"the contact frame is ordered from aliexpress, took about 2 weeks.",they have option to combine order with their thermal paste but i found that it's hard and difficult to spread.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thermalite is a high density polymer foam.,thermalright is a company known historically for their high quality custom pc cooling components.,"easy mistake, yo!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just installed one after using the stock clamp for 10 months.,i have gone from throttling in a cpu stress test to not.,"huge improvement for me, so there's hope if you have already used the stock clamping mechanism.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my cpu has been clamped with stock frame for 2 months.,ihs's still flat when i removed from the socket.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so if it gets bent what do you do ?,?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it can be a little hard to read paste patterns.,"a different way to test the contact between ihs and cold plate is use dark lipstick, which is semi-transparent and not so sticky:

clean both surfaces.",get a lipstick in a darker color.,"put small pieces (not smears) about the same size on at least five areas, middle and near-corners, on the ihs (easily cleaned off).","clamp together, take apart, and look at the *density* of the spots (not the size).","you can see whether you have a cavity at the middle, or any bias overall.","it may take a few times, but i adjust clamping geometry and pressure for a vanishingly thin spot at the center, with the corners equally slightly more dense.",then cleanoff and paste.,one thing i found on my asus hero mb was a falloff of contact at the top rear corner.,the reason probably is that the board is pretty warped in the socket area.,had to custom-adjust the post/washer heights to compensate for this.,"now using the tg plate and hk iv pro with their 1700 backplate and getting asus cooling rating of about 185 initially upon assembly, but don't have enough radiator yet, so it decays to about 170.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
was tr or tg frame better?,and wow you saved an extra 10c compared to washer mod?,i already saved 10-15c (coolest to hottest cores) with just washer mod.,if it's this good i'll pick up a frame today!,probably the tr because tg isn't in stock anywhere,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"can happen with many coolers, nothing new or unique about this product to worry about.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just tighten it until you can no longer turn it with your finger tips (with the tool).,its not scary at all.,make sure you tighten in a star pattern.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's unusually low.,you should get at least 210-220 w with undervolt.,what mb are you using?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that cpu has an all core turbo already.,"then a higher 2 and 1 core turbo, all at stock.","you can go up to 5ghz on all core, just don't let a motherboard profile dictate too much voltage.","something like 1.3v should be the max static voltage applied,  if you can see that in your bios somewhere.",basically it's a learning experience if you just don't want to pick a profile like you did before.,"if you like the performance of your first merhod, and the temps are manageable, that's probably perfectly fine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the stock settings are 4.6ghz turbo all-core, 4.7ghz for 4 cores, and 4.9ghz for 1.  that means you are already getting a mix of high ciocks no matter what you do.",overclocking would just be setting the all-core to something higher than 4.6ghz.,in your picture it looks like 5ghz was selected.,that's probably a max overclock on all 8 cores you should be trying to achieve.,"yes, you will need more voltage for higher clocks.","if you are selecting a premade profile,  it is setting that voltage for you.","whatever it is, it shouldn't be over 1.3v.","if you try to set your own voltage, the same rules apply.",you will need to monitor temperatures as a condition of overclocking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"frankly speaking, i don't think there's a clear cut answer to that question.",we don't really know how much performance is left in the tank in the first place.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"people have used ""the drivers aren't ready"" excuse for intel for the past 15 years of gpu issues.",they started hiring to improve drivers (for like the 8th time) in 2017 when they decided to push into dgpu.,why anyone thinks the drivers will turn everything around at some point still i don't know.,"the big problem isn't that it's behind, it's that it's almost 50% more transistors and and what, a 53w card vs a 92w card, and it's slower.","if it was 20% smaller and used less power and performed 20% less, that's great.",this thing should be drastically faster than a 6400.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so, i donâ€™t work on the arc gpus but work on upcoming cpuâ€™s.",i do a lot of â€˜biosâ€™ flashing and os installs and work on a ton of drivers; different drivers can *easily* cause a 20% uplift in performance with similar or lower power draw.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this isn't intel's first gpu and they had quite a bit of time to work on drivers.,i don't buy that it's held back significantly by drivers.,"and if it is, there is no reason to think updates will magically improve the situation any time soon.","intel has a huge driver development team, they've been working on dgpus for years and this isn't even their first dgpu product.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's probably not really about stability.,driver optimizations are made for gaming in general and even on per game basis and that's a lot of work that needs to be done over time.,nvidia and amd have years of work done already.,and game engines also make optimizations for different graphics architectures which obviously hasn't happened for intel yet since there have not been intel gaming gpus in the market.,considering the card can do a lot more in the 3dmark tests than the competition when everyone has application optimized drivers i wouldn't be too worried about the actual performance of the hardware.,but it is probably a good idea to wait a year or two before expecting a solid performance in all games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
will intel finewine be better than amd finewine?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel couldn't roll out a stable set of drivers to save their life.,this is starting to look like a spectacular flop from where i'm standing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel promoted raja to executive vp recently..  clearly he's got a fix for the performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this gpu has been 'finished' forever and waiting for manufacturing right, how are drivers so bad and intel drivers for gaming have been bad for years.",their push to improve drivers started not months ago or a few years ago but when they started this program like 5 years ago now.,if the drivers aren't good on a massively delayed project with massive resource increases to the driver team for years then they aren't suddenly going to get good.,"the real killer here is it's slower on the same node with a 50% larger die and using close to double the power over a 6400.

i mean the reason it came out in a market that would limit it's impact and availability is that's what intel does with products that suck but they are compelled to release.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably because they know they are capable of more than what is shown right now.,the $150 msrp is also apparently not a proper calculation since it's including the tax for intel gpu but not for the amd one.,"another 2-3 months of driver improvements, and it'll likely be ahead of the 6400. it already has encoders, and 2gb more vram.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think you mean *encoding*, the rx 6400 also does decode (excluding av1 decoding).","[also, the drivers xe are broken for encoding too currently](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/682674504878522386/984701519603564544/unknown.png) lmfao

edited for sake of clarity",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
doesn't it have av1 encoding?,"that might be the saving grace for arc, since intel is the only one currently offering that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes it was using ""only"" 65w while being significantly outperformed by one using 50w",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what are you referring to specifically when you say that?,i don't speak chinese so if something was said then fill me in.,"if you're referring to [the power draw reported in software like this](https://abload.de/img/12qsjp9.png), then no, that's entirely expected.","arc drivers don't report full tbp of the dgpu, they only report asic power.",the 75w tdp for reference and 92w tdp for this after-market card are for the entire board power.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if that were the case the 6400 would be way worse off.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if we go by synthetic benchmark, it still got some.",though synthetic not necessarily reflect real life condition.,well at least people who bought this can still hope.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes i agree completely,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they're properly working on gaming drivers for like 2-3 years only tho.. meanwhile nvidia and radeon 20years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no one's going to care.,i just hope battlemage development is coming along much better and that it comes out 1h next year for the sake of competition.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well this first generation is ruined, it should have come out with good drivers at the beginning of the year to be really competitive, but they could not likely for the drivers.",hopefully with battlemage it will be another pair of shoes!,we need a new competitive gpu manufacturer to stop the nvidia and amd duopoly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> intel couldn't roll out a stable set of drivers to save their life.,the same used to be true for radeon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how do you think they could roll out a stable set drivers for first generation (xe max doesnt count) discrete gpus?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as i understand it, raja is more hardware.",lisa pearce is in charge of driver development.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or they just have long term faith in raja.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you buy a product for what it is at the moment, not for what it might be",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">except the drivers are broken for that (encoding i mean) too on xe

you're talking as if amd always has working video encode/decode.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it got one good result in the time spy result.,"the port royal score looks good compared to the rx6400, but both dgpus are severely bottlenecked by vram capacity, so that result can also be thrown out the window.",[as proof of that - both the a380 and 6400 are beat by this 6900hs igpu.,](https://www.3dmark.com/pr/1614213),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so after dg1 and this it's two failed generations of gpus then?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it kinda still is.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the interesting part is: their igpu drivers i considered usually very stable and this hits differently to tell the truth.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i mean, 20 years ago they actually did suck, then they've been fine but every time someone gets a bad card they have months of driver issues rather than replacing the card.",the biggest difference is that nvidia issues all get funnelled to nvidia forums while amd forums are dead so they post everywhere else.,nvidia has had numerous year long massive driver issues that go unfixed and affecting large numbers of people but it's mostly kept to one corner of the internet.,in general amd drivers have been stable and performed well since before amd bought them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
does xe-lp count?,that came out in september 2020 and xe-hpg is supposed to be building on that base.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's hilarious that all the ""it's raja's fault!""","people think raja does everything; he does the hardware, he does the driver, he mops the office, he takes out the garbage, anything that goes wrong is raja's fault!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fair but do we know for certain the delay is drivers only and not a hardware / manufacturing issue ?,isn't raja responsible for the effort overall ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, but you might not be able to buy it for another 3 months.",in the us that is.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"err, why would you need those cards for ""office stuff""?","that's where integrated graphics shines, you don't need a dgpu for that at all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
source: just trust me bro.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wow then the a380 really sucks at gaming if it can't even beat a gpu that's not for gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for 1080p medium, vram capacity (6gb) shouldnt be much of an issue.","i think if intel could give good driver, it could at least go toe to toe against 6500 xt.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dg1 is just an igpu in a separate package.,so cannot even call it a dgpu.,so essentially this is intels first dgpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel's?,their igpu drivers are still very stable for everything *besides* gaming.,"but that's also kind of an issue when building dgpus aimed at the gaming market, you ideally want rhem to be able to... game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
their gen6-gen11 igpu drivers were never good for gaming.,"often buggy and glitchy, fixes took forever if they came at all, and sometimes games wouldn't even launch.",i personally found that out a few years ago when i had to go temporarily without a gpu for a few weeks due to psu issues.,gen12 xe-lp which debuted on tiger lake *20 months ago* showed the same issues we're seeing here.,it looked good on canned benchmarks but substantially less impressive when running actual games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the guy in charge of hte project is at fault, always, that's what being in charge is.",you can't accept the pay without the responsibility.,"he's been there since what 2017 and it was his responsibility to push for better drivers and to hire better devs, make hardware that is easy to exploit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's raja's fault if he ignores engineering concerns.,it's his fault if the people reporting to him are straight up bozos.,"it's a culture thing at intel, every manager just want to look good, so they hide issues and never raise concerns.","when shit hits the fan, they switch teams internally.",allegedly...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
raja is a mystery to me.,i've seen him go from company to company but every major product launched under him was a disappointment or it didn't even launch.,"like, i was eagerly awaiting vega and it really wasn't that great.",and now arc.,"i don't know which product built his reputation, but i've seen nothing since 2017 that was impressive to me.","to me, superficially, he appears to be a reverse jim keller.","he hops companies, but whereas keller does it after hitting it out of the park, raja always seems to do it after a big disappointment.","now please let me state that i'm aware that this is a superficial impression, that there has to be more to it and that keller didn't single handedly achieve al his successes, yada yada.",i'm also aware that sometimes the work done doesn't get into the hands of the public until well after these people leave.,"still, i've found plenty of sources on what the actual factual achievements of jim keller are, and even some sources on which skills enabled him to be successful.","with raja, it is clear that he is held in high regard.","but he's weak in pr and the actual achievements or personal skills he has under his belt, it's not transparant to me.",i'm definitely wishing to be schooled though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if intel can ship cards out in china right now, that means the hardware has been done for maybe 6 months now, and was put to tape further back than that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but they're offering it for 150$ now in china.,and now it gets beaten 22% by rx6400 which costs the same and every game works on it with no bugs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, ""office"" is perhaps not the most accurate word here, but for the same reason you have gt1030s inside those low end oem builds :)

interesting how their score is so much higher than the one in the review in the topic here.,something clearly odd is at play here.,"still, that's a considerable amount better, so a good thing nonetheless.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it is a discrete gpu, technically, it has its own local memory.",but i agree that it was more like a proof of concept.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that might be true but didn't they have already several touches on gaming?,"maybe not to that degree but still, i thought that only the architecture itself would maybe end up bad, not both parts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the insight!,i wasn't really to aware of the matter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and it seems like he's done a decent job, which other company is thinking of getting into the discrete graphics card market?",people are forgetting alchemist is gen 1 and there are 3 more coming up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or it could just be that it's intels first attempt at a mass market discreet gpu.,wasn't this gpu in development longer than raja has been at intel?,"for all we know, battlemage might have raja tweaks baked in that makes it go wrath of khan.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[it's $131 according to ian cutress](https://twitter.com/iancutress/status/1537024507751563264?s=20).,"if it were 10% worse performance per dollar, which it doesn't seem to be given the price, it would still be a better gpu than the 6400.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
where does intel say the 6400 is 10x worse?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's not proof of concept, it's just all they could manufacture.",intel specifically told everyone even up to in 2020 that xe discrete gpus would launch for all segments basically on 10nm intel node.,"the only reason there wasn't a whole range wasn't because dg1 was a prototype or it was a proof of concept, they couldn't manufacture anything else.",these gpus are coming out 2 years later on a different node with updates to the architecture.,dgpu or not is pretty irrelevant as the same architecture can be used on igpu/dgpu easily.,"in fact in general a new gpu architecture will come later to igpu because cpus have a longer tape out process than gpus, so normally we would have seen xe based desktop products before they did the igpu versions.","they also should have been at the point of having good drivers for xe architecture by launch of dg1, let alone all this time later for these gpus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, they have.","they rewrote the dx11 driver in general just a couple of years ago, as one example.","despite that, they're actually even worse off in dx11 vs their competitors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"people aren't forgetting that, also he's been there 5 years and this is fundamentally gen 2. they had an entire stack of gpus supposed to be ready to release in 2020, these gpus are on a significantly superior node and releasing in 2022. this has 2 years of extra both driver and hardware improvements on it.","cancelling most of hte products rather than releasing them then waiting 2 years to release a true desktop card doesn't make it still first gen.

the 1650 is a 75w card on a 12nm node with a density about 1/4 of that of the 6nm tsmc node.",despite the drastic 2 full node advantage it uses more power and is only about 20% smaller the a380 still gets beaten easily.,it's several generations behind in performance already.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
honestly we don't know what the rest of the lineup is gonna perform like either.,"i'm hoping the a7xx line does alright, but we'll see.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"dude, i was there.","it was pretty much a poc, basically a tgl lp made discrete.","as soon as dg2 was the main target, nobody cared about dg1.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's also just a flat out lie, intel never claimed anything of the sort.","also, the 6500xt ties the 1650 on a pcie 3 paltform and pulls ahead on pcie gen 4.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
now you're outright lying.,"intel claimed it was about about 25% better performance/yuan, but it's msrp is also about 20% lower.",in terms of actual performance that gives you a lead of about 5%.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no company intentionally tells their investors that we are intending to launch a range of cards on this node at this time, miss it all and it was just a proof of concept, massive fuck up absolutely, node issues and performance issues likely combined but their intention was clear.","xe1 was slated for a full line up of products, that isn't a proof of concept.",just because they could only produce an igpu size unit and it wasn't good doesnt' change what the initial target was.,"also yes when everyone realises you can't release a range of products on 10nm and you're relegated to an igpu release, no one cares about it.",what's surprising about that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,intel did not tell investors that dg1 is a full lineup of graphics cards.,not sure who's telling you these.,dg1 was targeted to be on 10nm and it was launched in 10nm.,it was targeted to be a very basic entry level card before their dg2 which is a mid range card.,battlemage is the first one targeting enthusiast segment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"mine does that (reproducible noticeable delta, though not as high), so i wouldn't be worried.","in fact, not much should worry you.","worst case scenario, that core reaches 100c before all others in a very synthetic benchmark on a very hot summer day and they all clock down a bit.",but that's never really a concern in actual usage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no reason to be too worried.,"if you are still looking for troubleshooting, you can try a different method  of applying the thermal paste to your block",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
core zero is always core 1. if you have a good board you can probably push the lower temp cores by increasing their frequency individually while leaving the more hotter cores alone.,"so to be short, overclock your first 2 cores (the ones with lower temps because those are better) and second to last and increase frequency by 100hz or 200hz because you're leaving performance on the table.","r23 has some avx variation while running, so naturally some cores will stress and run hotter than others.","go back to your bios, and fix your overclocking and adjust or fix your voltages according.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there are several channels like this one on youtube that are all bullshit.,"it is incredibly easy to fake these benchmark runs, all you have to do is just change the name of the gpu in each and presto, you net yourself a bunch of clicks.",this one's a dead giveaway though because of the power draw on the gpu.,"arc gpus report asic power, not the full board power.","full board power for the after-market card launching first is 92w, so the power draw reported in software should be around 65w, not the 90w you see reported in some of the games there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
go with the 11700k.,minimal difference with the 11900k.,unless you like the sticker,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
should have went 12th gen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ugh.,stop listening to these people.,"get your 11900k, slap it in your board.",boot up bios.,turn on abt and turn down the voltage till you're just stable enough.,you'll have a killer pc.,"when tuned right , 11900k is a beast.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"biggest problems :

1 - its a 11700k

2 - you paid 370$ for a cpu that loses to a 250$ 12600k in almost everything while using more power.",3 - new generations are launching in 6 months.,for the same money you will be getting 50% more performance.,but its an i9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
prime is a shit board for a 11900k.,"get an evga dark, gigabyte tachyon or at least an asus strix e-590.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you are wasting money, wait for 14gen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you made a mistake.,11th gen isn't even worth the upgrade over 9th generation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah thatâ€™s hardly an upgrade.,youâ€™re just throwing money away.,the correct thing to do was upgrade to 12th gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cancel that order bro.,get the 12900kâ€¦.,so worth it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"its barely a upgrade

return the 11900k and wait for 13th gen or beyond",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you wont have any bottleneck even with the next generations of gpu.,ppl that trash this cpu are just dumb techtuber cultists.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they have arguably the strongest memory controllers but why not get an 12th gen or wait a little and get 13th?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"great cpu, youâ€˜ll have avx512 unlike the 12th gen crap",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"tbh i didn't even realise there was a sticker lmao, i've already ordered the 11900k though",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12th gen is too expensive for me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m not good with over clocking or messing with different voltages so i donâ€™t want to mess around with it as i donâ€™t know what iâ€™m looking for in terms of what is â€œstableâ€ or â€œunstableâ€,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pretty much this.,as 9900k is still a great cpu by today's standards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't believe it is going to be much of an upgrade either.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean i see it as an upgrade from what iâ€™ve already got,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i would but the 12900k is well over what i'm willing to pay, as aren't they in the â£500 region?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
may i ask what â€œavx512 is?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you could sell the z590 motherboard and the old setup and go with a 12700 based build.,much better than any 10th or 11th gen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how much did you pay for the 11900k?,12600k + ddr4 mobo canâ€™t cost much more than your 11900k combo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes it is, but not with an asrock h310cm-hdv lol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ipc should be about 25% higher, but hard to justify the upgrade, changing motherboard will be good tho",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"okay, but what is it that youâ€™re doing that a 9900k canâ€™t handle?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
idk how they do it in europe.,but at my local bestbuy in the usa.,"i was able to buy a 3080 ti , 12900k and finance it with 0% interest.",i pay 177 a month for a 2400 dollar buildâ€¦.,same amount just spread out over time.,losing all that cash in one go makes my heart hurt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that a cpu instruction set.,"basically high level program code will be ""translated"" into a sequence of instruction so the cpu can execute.",i guess if you asked this basic question you probably don't make many use of it.,"about your config, many comments here have pointed out that you should have gone for 12th gen for less money and more performance.",(for the same amount you could have a 12700k combo and get more performance than 11900k).,"but, since the shot has been fired, just enjoy your new system.",it's still a beast.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcifbx5bqyc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cpu was â£369.98 and mobo was 199.98,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
true.,op is in need for a better mobo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™d say streaming in vr as it kinda lags, so i felt going for an upgrade was the better choice as iâ€™ve been streaming desk top games and wouldnâ€™t mind streaming vr games as well",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"according to pc parts picker, 12700k is â£360 and msi pro z690-a is â£160.",wouldâ€™ve been faster for less money.,"iâ€™m honestly not sure why folks are so fixated on buying 10th or 11th gen systems in 2022, when 12th gen is a lot faster at the same price point (or cheaper for the same performance with more upgradability options).","if 10th/11th was significantly cheaper, then sureâ€¦ but itâ€™s not!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe european pricing is different but iâ€™m pretty sure you could have gone 12th gen for same price.,"â£370 for 11900k is kinda expensive when 11700, 12600, 12700, & 5700x exist",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oooh i thought you were meaning the i9 12th gen series, and i got very confused as i was looking it up, but i see what you mean now.",i'm not overly sure i guess i wanted to stick with the i9 series for some reason,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
something to remember: i3/i5/i7/i9 is entirely marketing.,"there is no quality, design, or technical difference between the chips that makes an i9 branded model inherently more â€œdesirableâ€ than an i5 (like comparing lexus to toyota, where one is clearly more luxurious than the other).","the only difference between them is frequency, core counts and cache.","and fact is, the 12th gen i7-12700k is faster than the i9-11900k, and even the i5-12600k is about the same speed.","and i donâ€™t know about you, but to me newer and faster beats older with â€œprestigeâ€.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would personally recommend m.2 for main/boot drive :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nvme m.2 all the way.,"remember you can get sata m.2 as well, which is why iâ€™m clarifying.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
please note i will be keeping the spare drive for games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
m.2 period,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s a adapter right?,just to clarify,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
adapter?,"noâ€¦ m.2 is a form factor / connector, nvme (otherwise referred to as pcie) and sata are interface types.",sata is also a cable type.,but the point is you can get sata m.2 ssds and install them in m.2 slots that have sata support.,theyâ€™re typically a bit cheaper than nvme/pcie ssds as sata is a lot slower.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh ok thanks for the info.,just looked it up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
does this only happen when playing videos in a browser?,gaming?,have you tried running both the cpu and ram at stock (no xmp) and installing different drivers?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
installing different drivers version.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
buy a cheap graphics card.,"an old 7750, 750ti, 650,â€¦, should be fine to replace integrated graphics.there was a time such cards would be trivial in expense, but now prices are still not sane.","i saw an old gtx-1050 box at zmicrocenter and assumed it would be under $100, being so old, but i was mistaken .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i had a look see for cheap modernish gpus, radeon 550 which i got for â£53 is still over â£130 brand new, and cheapest second hand was â£65 eugh.","if its just for video playback and not any gaming, maybe look for an even lower spec one, but the radeon 550 used to be the cheapest gpu with display port 1.4.

seems like a pretty solid little machine.,"hdmi 2.1, dp 2.0, tons of io, av1 encode, 16gb vram, 12700h.. it all depends on how mobile arc alchemist actually performs higher up the stack.",i'm curious how much better this will be compared to the 2060 from its predecessor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"according to notebookcheck the gpu should perform close to a 3070 mobile, somewhere between a 3060 and 3070 mobile",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea its a great cpu.,"although the new generation mid-range beats it now, there's still no reason to upgrade until we see like 13th gen intel or am5",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
still hugging my 8700k firmly.,"i've regularly had spotify, a aaa game, multiple chrome tabs, installing something, even running screen recording and video editing software, all at the same time and i couldn't identify it being any slower than normal.",when i have a reason to upgrade i'll be equal parts shocked and emotionally distressed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love my 9900k 3090 setup but sad to think it's far enough out of date that's its getting shown up by mid tier chips.. at the same time think it's awesome things continue to advance at the rate they do.,probably going to keep running it for another gen or 2 unless the upgrade becomes a necessity before then.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love my 9900k but it was like the top muscle car right before a big period of competition and innovation.,"still fun, especially overclocked, but you have to ignore the fact that it gets smoked by a mid range kia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my 8700k still kickin runs idle low 40s unfortunately due to 2 years of oc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my 9900k is still going strong too.,the fact that it's been overshadowed so fast is just amazing for how good current processors are.,"i see little need to get rid of it at the moment, much like the haf x case that it's home.","as long as it's still doing its job well and capably, i see no reason to rush it into retirement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"love the build, love fractal cases.","they always remind of me of one my builds from my earlier days, though.",not my most perfect build.,years ago a buddy of mine gave me a budget figure to do my best with and build him a rig.,he said he didn't want water cooling.,"the fractal case i got him was smaller than that one, and i didn't fully read the specs on it or some fans would've been larger.","anyway, ordered overkill on fans.",overkill enough that there weren't even enough headers to power them (i even had one for the super optional bottom right one if you remove the plate).,"since i was under budget...  ""hey buddy i forgot to order a part, my bad.""","then i ordered a sata powered fan header hub that just *barely* fit on the back side (after checking power limits for it, wasn't going to not read specs on something so unusual and start a fire or something.","anyway, it got em all spinning and it has been running fine for him for many years now - at least they were quiet fans.",i think the only one that hit a motherboard header was the one on the bequiet hsf.,"[fans](https://i.imgur.com/z4zohis.jpg)

no reason to upgrade unless it's not performing to your liking with the settings you prefer to work/play with.,if it is still meeting those requirements you are golden.,i keep a machine running 5 to 7 years and only recently upgraded my i7 6950 to 12900k because the previous went to digital heaven.,"we tend to compare what we have and measure against the new and sometimes there's no real significant benefit other then a faster reboot,  or maybe your rendering is faster.","measure your needs against your wants and see how much the real benefit would be, of course calculated.",in most cases the offset is not worth the cost layout.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

8700k here too.,great cpu.,barely cracks 50% usage on most games.,"personally just ready for a rebuild; new mobo, etc.",but performance-wise it would be fine for 1-2 more years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what voltage are you running at 5.3 ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

itâ€™s been over 3 years at this point.,the previous high end must become low end in the shortest amount of time possible to see quick evolution in technology.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

in comparisons years ago in gaming, 10th gen intel was beating ryzen 3000, i don't know the scientific answers as to why exactly but i heard game devs seem to code for intels better, and, in the diagnostic software videos were showing, the intel 10th gens had quite a bit lower latency than the 3000 ryzens, i'm sure the better latency played into it as well.","i'd wager even a 6 core 12 thread 10th gen i5 would be fine this console gen.

"k can overclock, non-k cant, also k versions tend to be better binned.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there are some reports of non-k cpus having trouble with xmp.,"donâ€™t remember the details, may be a myth, but better look into it anyway before pulling the trigger.","also if iâ€™m not mistaken, with a k cpu and a z-board you can not only overclock, but undervolt for better thermals as well.","with some cpus, k-vs-non-k means more than just locked/unlocked.","the 12600k actually has more cores than the 12600, for example.",but i donâ€™t think it applies to the 12700(k).,iâ€™m planning a combo of the 12700k and the msi z690 tomahawk for my next build.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"locked 12700 needs the cheapest ddr5 at or above 5200. the locked system agent voltage gimps ddr4, so the money you save on the cpu just goes into something else.",this mostly benefits gaming above 60fps.,at 60fps it's a non issue.,personally i got a ddr5 platform anyway because raptor lake,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i don't why, but a lot of people seem to be forgetting that this time around, the non-k cpus also don't boost to the frequencies as long as last generation.","it has lower cinebench scores, because after a while (can't remember how long) it will downclock to ~~95w~~, 65w whereas the k versions can boost to max clocks forever.",https://youtu.be/ydgn4w97esk?t=283,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, its not worth 100$ for the k.

contains all network adapter of the system.",key \\009 contains problematic ax200 card with all driver config.,"only thing related to filters here is \\009\\linkage\\

multi string:  filterlist

data:  many class guids

i'll have to investigate this more...

last night - i did identify with driver explorer + autoruns that two drivers were listed within startup.",netwtw10 + netwtw08.,identified lastest driver [22.140.0.3](https://22.140.0.3) using netwtw10.,"purged netwtw08 + netwtw10  out of hklm\\system\\currentcontrolset\\services

delete netwtw08.sys from system32\\drivers

reinstalled driver and verified re-created startup  in hklm\\system\\currentcontrolset\\services

still unreliable initialization though.",i don't really feel hardware issue.,once initialized it appears to be working fine.,connected to wifi network for 7.5 hours now over am hours.,feel is software.,mix of possibly combo mb bios or 21h2 / win updates with driver.,i have opened a ticket with asus.,i'll be looking into bios downgrade.,or possibly trying install of older win10 21h1 on another hdd and seeing what ax200  / driver do.,bah - really do not want to disassemble for rma.,built in fractal meshify 2 case in storage mode with kraken x73.,great case but some very tight space tolerances for many connections.,took me twice as long to build than a full tower would of.,everything else with this build is sound and ready.,system screaming fast too.,typical i find driver / ax200 initialization issue when system is \~98% complete.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what about windows refresh before you disassemble?,"go for as clean as possible in case of a conflicting guid from a (way) prior driver install, sucks i know but if you are going to rma & take it all apart at least you know the o/s is clean when you put it back together.edit wow you are right no filters listed there anymore, must of had those commands for this issue a very long time... sorry

found this, only thing suggested of importance i guess is disable fast boot.",power settings - what the power button does & in bios.,i'd do this before refreshing windows & keep it off.,also i just tested an older driver just to be sure & yes a newer driver will supersede it on restart.,so makes it kind of pointless because windows will get a newer driver unless you disable that too.,so keep this in mind.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for suggestions.,using driver explorer and reviewing device manager i was staying consistent with 3 different driver versions that i had indented to try.,asus version + 2x intel versions.,would retain at boot.,the older drivers would keep a startup entry in hklm\\currentcontrolset\\services.,netwtw10 + netwtw08 - i had tried removing 08 manually thinking it was perhaps trying to use both same time but no go.,all drivers gave same behavior.,"as did a fresh install of older win10 21h1

i did try disabling fast boot.",same thing.,also did bios flashback downgrade to previous bios.,asus tier 2 didn't really give it any time of day and went immediately toward labeling a hardware issue and going for rma.,their rma only offers refurb boards despite this motherboard being less than week old.,said no thank you and did a replacement on amazon.,replacement be in tomorrow.,+1 for amazon replacement.,lets just say i'm going to be bouncing off the walls if upon rebuilding system i get same behavior and this is a asus uefi mb / microsoft / intel software problem.,the net is riddled with ax200 + 201 code 10s going back 2 yrs.,i hope i'm wrong and its hardware issue that is getting resolved.,see what transpires - will share result of mb replacement.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good luck!,you definitely have ruled out more than enough to say its hardware at this stage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
umâ€¦ so whatâ€™s your gpu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what's your alternative?,ryzen 5000?,wait for 13th gen?,(which will also be optimized for win 11).,probably your best bet is just to embrace that you will eventually have to move to win 11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you are going to get 12th gen there is no reason not to go for windows 11. i really don't understand this pointless stigma over w11.,windows 11 is optimized for 12th gen p/e-cores so you're hamstringing yourself for no reason if you're on 12th gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have 12th gen with windows 10, not a single issue",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"12700k and 12400 on win10, the i5 is problem free, the 12700k has some compatibility and performance issues until
i just bagged the e cores with the 12700k... wish the 12700 non-k skipped e cores in favor of cache or a lower msrp... a plain 8 p-core / 16 thread alder lake would be a great option.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would go alder lake (12th gen) with windows 11. windows 11 does not have any real issues anymore.,i've been using it on alder lake for the past 5 months with no issues.,it also gives you the ability for an in-socket upgrade to raptor lake (13th gen).,"it'll only have modest single-threaded gains over alder lake, but more impressive multi-threaded gains with increased e-core counts",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what issues???,im on the 12700kf and w10 and have 0 issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"12th gen is impressive, if you are debating either to sacrifice windows 10 or performance i would say that you are making a bad mistake , 12th gen with windows 11 is better than 11th gen with windows 10, also i donâ€™t think that you will be running into issues with 12th gen and windows 10, to be honest i think 12th generation is even consider an upgrade for 11th gen, not that 11th gen is bad or slow but 12th gen cpus are impressiveâ€¦",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my 3rd gen i5 is still doing wonders.,won't upgrade for atleast a decade,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"12700k on win10, also zero issues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when is windows gonna just trash itâ€™s design and start over?,on another noteâ€¦ i really donâ€™t see intel catching back up as of yet.,"they killed it with the intel core i7, it went crazy at ivybridge, better yet haswellâ€¦ gen 8 got a pinch better.","it really hasnâ€™t progressed even remotely linear 

ryzen is just too hard on top",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
z690 or b550/x570.,5800x3d is the top gaming chip and well positioned cost wise.,canâ€™t go wrong with 12600k plus the ability to go 13th gen later this yearâ€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what cpu are you looking at?,"you only need win11 for better the better scheduler that copes with p+e cores - if you're looking at buying a 12600 though, there is no reason you can't run win10 - the others too but you'd be better off disabling e-cores for win10 (12600 has no e cores)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all this silly debate over win 10 and 11. when it is so easy just to set up a dual boot and just have both.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

well i'm using 12th gen with windows 10 for quiet a while and it's been working great and snappy.,so i would say go for it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
since 13th is a couple of months away you can wait but there are 0 issues with alder and w10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have used windows 10 on 12th gen and it seems to work fine.,the performance improvement of 12th gen over 11th gen is huge.,the i7-12700 is an amazing cpu.,it crushes the i9-11th and has more cores and threads.,you will have to cross the bridge eventually and upgrade to windows 11 eventually.,another option is of a dual boot for windows 10 and windows 11 (both i different ssd's),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"at this point my bet would be am5 if you can wait a little longer because the platform longevity will likely be (much) longer that the intel one, just look at am4, released in 2016 and still relevant today.",that doesn't mean am5 will be the same but it sure is not the case for intel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no issues with 12600k on windows 10, and that was after switching from my 6700k that i had since 2016 on the same installation.",my benchmarks are great too ...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, you should get a girlfriend.ðÿ˜‚",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just stay on windows 10. if something really has issues, disable the e-cores.",by now most things should be fixed.,"a 12400f is probably as good as an 11700k in most cases, so get that instead of an 11th gen if you're afraid of the e-cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, at this point i think the problems with 11 are overblown, they've worked out the initial bugs.","i hated windows me, vista, 8, etc (well actually, vista's aero interface was pretty cool, it was just more demanding for the pcs of that time).","generally clung to 98, xp, and 7 in those days.","i've been on w10 for my gaming pc ever since it came out, and i really didn't mind the switch to 11 at all.","granted, i first did it just last month, when it was already updated a fair amount.","it's basically the same thing as 10 but with a different taskbar and start menu, which can be easily modded to resemble 10 if desired.","the disparate control panels/settings locations can be annoying, but that was already an issue in 10, where you still have to go back to the classic control panels to find many settings.","the fact that the i5 12600k crushes an i9 11900k while using less power makes it a no-brainer to go 12th gen, i think.",don't lock yourself into old technology when you're starting fresh.,"you'll never be able to get faster than an 11900k, whereas if you start with a 12600k you'll presumably be able to get up to a 13900k in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i hated it until they let us move the taskbar.,not having the taskbar on the left is a 100% dealbreaker for me.,"now that ms allows it, i moved (though i also dislike the new context menus and some of the shell changes, so got startisback)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what rpm does the bios report the pump is running at?,this level of overheating sounds like a non-functioning pump to me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, clearly if the cpu reaches 100 just sitting in bios, your cooler isnâ€™t doing much of anything - like the pump isnâ€™t running, none of the fans are running, thereâ€™s no thermal paste, plastic left on the block, zero contact, etc.",does the radiator get warm?,you should be able to feel where the heat is or isnâ€™t going.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have the same exact cooler with a asus prime z690-a board and i plugged it in the cpu_fan header like it says in the manual,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is your sata power working ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have this aio are you sure the commander is plugged in properly and you used all the connections?,not sure on a gigabyte mobo but on my asus there is 1 header specifically for aio pumps and it shows on bios.,the pump should be at 2300-2700 depending on setting on icue.,maybe see if any wires are missing one wire from the pump goes to the mobo and another should be going to the commander that is powered off sata and has a usb header to go to the mobo.,also when you say brackets do you mean the stand off screws?,"the 150i bracket is adjustable and will fit either 1200 or 1700, however the stand off screws are not interchangeable you will need to buy those from corsair if they werenâ€™t included.",they are slightly shorter than the 1200 screws.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you connect the sata cable of the pump?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"get a thermalright 12th gen lid correction bracket, an ek elite 280 or 360 aio, and ic diamond 24 tim and call it a day.",make sure the aio if it has a hub is getting power.,set the header the aio is on to 100%/full blast not smart fan.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the pump rpm shows n/a, but even trying a different aio it showed the same thing, i unfortunately don't have an air cooler lying around to test but have ordered one.","i recognize the pump isn't functioning i just don't know why, unless i got so unlucky as to pull 2 non functioning aios back to back, which i suppose is possible.","just searching out my last ditched efforts here, thanks for the time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no plastic on block, both case fans running, all 3 radiator fans running, but the bios fan readout shows pump as n/a so i recognize it isn't registering, i just don't know why.",bios version f7 forgot to put that in op.,thanks for the time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ssds register on same sata connection  if i connect them, so the cable is fine, did try multiple cables though.","did move cable to the ""perif"" connection on psu to no avail.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you plugging it into the pump header and not the cpu fan header on the motherboard?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what header did you plug the pump into?,can you hear the pump running or feel vibration?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"idk, either you didnt connect the pump wire all the way in or you have a defective unit",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3 pin lead into 4pin header cpu opt and cpu fan both tested, neither give different results.",as honest as i can be i can't really tell if the pump is running.,"i've never genuinely had the need to touch one that was running to see what i should be feeling for, though i can say the leds on the block come on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, if youâ€™re looking for the pump value to actually show something, then you should plug it into sys_fan4_pump, bottom right corner of the board.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"right, it was my understanding the 4th pin is the rpm value display so that's why it was showing n/a, the pump should be just pumping.",i still don't know why the cpu continues to overheat.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, 4th should be pwm fan control.",3 pin headers still have rpm.,"for example, look at the pinout on top of page 22 of your user manual.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so if that 4th pin isn't connected will it keep the pump from functioning correctly?,"and if so, do i need to just get an 3>4pin adapter?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if the pumpâ€™s header is 3 pin, that should be all thatâ€™s needed for correct operation.",an adapter would do nothing with the 4th pin.,"3-pin can also have speed control, but it would be old-fashioned voltage vs pwm-based.","i would say the sys4 header should work by default, but if thereâ€™s no auto fan detection, you might want to look for a bios setting that could switch the header between normal/pwm mode?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"moved the lead to the sys4 pump header at the bottom of the board, same issue, checked the normal/pwm mode it was on auto set it to normal.",the pump just isn't on.,i guess it has to be i just got two bad aios in a row,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
use an offset voltage instead of a static voltage.,that way there is little to no performance loss in the undervolt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"static voltage is not a good way to do anything except test for overclocking potential, as now youâ€™re applying a high voltage even on idle (which would normally automatically be a lot lower than that).","thatâ€™s also probably way less than the 12900k actually needs for itâ€™s stock turbo boosts, which could be why youâ€™re performing like a 12700k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i use a -0.07 offset and set both pl1 and pl2 to 125w.,i just tip over 25k in cbr23 with a max temp \~68c using a noctua nh-d15 and fractal torrent case with all fans at default.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why the hell did you sell the 5950x?,not only is it an outstanding cpu (i still prefer intel tho) it also works better with a amd gpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the i5-12400f would be able to do that no problem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 12100 would also easily be able to deliver more than 60fps in wz.,even a 10100 can do it.,"the game isn't too demanding, just unoptimized.","but it has gotten better since last year, at least it doesn't microstutter every 1 second anymore.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wouldn't 12500k or 12600k be better and more stable fps considering they have slightly more cache?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is a 12500k?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s actually what iâ€™m leaning towards.,the 12600k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

well since the 10th and 11th gen will bottleneck and kill the potential performance you will get on a 3070/3070 ti/3080/3080 12gb/3080 ti/3090 and 3090 ti.,you know those 30+ extra frames amdâ€™s 5900 and 5950 cpus gave gamers?,along with the even more frames the intel 12900â€™s giveâ€¦ itâ€™s safe to say an 8700 is going to not only bottleneck a 30 series card but a 40 series card as well & even more.,fyi if you are on an ultrawide 1440p display you need at least 12gb of vram on a card to play any game without issues.,a 3070 is not going to do hit on any game on your display.,i have a 34â€ ultra 1440p display   that 3070 is going to struggleâ€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4800 is the official supported speed anything above that is an over clock even if you are using the xmp settings.,but with that said my itx build i just put together with the 12600k has no issues at 5200,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12600k can easily do 7000 mhz on ddr5 if you got the right ram kit and motherboard.,"5200 is nothing and intel guideline is only guaranteed to work, not ""won't work above"", as mentioned by debello.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as you learned from another poster, officially intel supports just 4800mhz ddr5 speeds, and everything else is technically an overclock.","interestingly, as a 2 dimm board your apex is one of the few boards that actually does officially support 4800mhz.","all 4 dimm boards top out at 4400mhz even with 2 dimms installed, and go as low as 3600mhz official speeds with 4.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

asus apex is the motherboard used to break oc world records.,i have no idea why he has it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm pairing the 12600k with ddr5 simply because i've got a ddr5 mobo (asus rog z690 apex).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why so?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the biggest issue currently is having more the a single pair of ddr5 sticks and going above the base speed.,"those who try an run four sticks at xmp speeds are having stability or boot issues, but running a single pair is fine.",it is either a memory controller limitation or a bios/motherboard issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i ain't sell it... i decided to get the i9 12900k instead with the rtx 3090 ti.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got it from asus authorized seller on ebay ($730),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol... why so?,?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"high, mid or low, it is just an issue with alder lake",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, but even ignoring the whole overclocking aspect (if thatâ€™s possible!","), its design and overbuilt construction is quite appealing.",like back when asus tuf boards really were something special (like my old x99 sabertooth) and just not a curiously named budget line.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
except that it can come with wifi and audio stuff.,by no means does it seem like a barebones overclocker board.,only thing i can see is that it just has only 2 ram slots and really robust power delivery.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i decided to get the i9 12900k + 3090 ti so i will keep the mobo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'd still get an asus, just not the apex.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just... return it and get a $300-350 mobo instead.,you will not even notice the difference and you'd use savings on getting a dedicated audio solution.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the sole purpose of apex and other single dimm per channel motherboards is to use them under liquid nitrogen or to overclock the living snot out of what you have, losing weeks of worktime by dialing in voltages and debugging.","i assume in advance you will not even think about these, given you ask about i5 12600k and its ram compatibility lol.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh i see.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it is appealing and allâ€¦ but at some point you just hit a price ceiling beyond which no motherboard, no matter how loaded it is, makes any sense.",the apex is *well* above that price ceiling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh boy, thatâ€™s quite an expenditure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
â€¦ iâ€™d say the same about the 3090 ti though.,"anything above the 3080 is a waste of time, imo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes i asked about the i5 12600k and its ram compatibility!,"however, thanks to the guys above i knew that the apex is much more powerful than the 12600k so i i'll get the i9 12900k instead cuz it'd be the best choice!","as for the gpu, i ordered the rtx 3090ti since i do filmmaking and graphic design.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i agree itâ€™s expensive for the level of â€œnicetyâ€ features, but not nearly as bad as some of those watercooling ones.","i mean the local store wants $700 (canadian - oddly it just went on sale in the last hour for $60 off) for the z690 apex, but $2500 for the extreme glacial.","like, holy f*ck.",even the normal extreme is $1330.,"i thought my hero was stupid expensive, but those take the cake.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yep, agreed.","as much as i rail about gpu pricing, the real insanity is in the motherboard market.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"this kind of questions, make me feel like the part with ""don't look up"" it's coming soon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 'loudness' of a computer is typically measured in decibels from a certain distance.,the fan noise from a laptop is specific to each laptop model.,so you need to specify exactly which laptop you're considering.,"lastly, it's safe to assume that any high end portable that can sufficiently cool a 12900hx in a laptop chassis is going to be quite loud at full power.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably really loud while benchmarking or encoding video.,probably not super loud while gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on the architechture.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was hoping to get feedback on people who used a laptop with.,i've googled again and found a youtube video and a guy measured about 68dba.,i'd presume that's quite loud.,"not quite a jet, but yeah.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you might have better luck asking on stackoverflow with the \[x86\] and \[avx512\] tags.,the snippet that you posted doesn't make much sense.,"how can type_j be a const value declared, used as a parameter, and assigned to, on the same line?","it would only give deterministic output if r2mask was all 1's, or type_j was implicitly zeroed before use.","also, i'd point out that the performance of avx2 gather isn't very good.",you're sometimes better off doing manual 32 bit loads.,depends on the chip you are using though.,"i'd download it and look my self but these ass clowns want me to [register to download](https://gitlab.com/tcbguiuc/namd) their ""open source"" code.",academia is so far behind in some ways :(,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

could you add a zen 3 to gracemont comparison?,because i remember seeing somewhere that they are fairly close.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes yes, we know intel isn't space-efficient",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
golden cove  is a powerhouse,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and this is why intel is switching to hybrid.,"amd has to be both performant, power efficient and area efficient with the same core.","they have been doing great at this to be honest, but i think in the long run, intelâ€™s and appleâ€™s hybrid architectures are going to win.",itâ€™s hard to build a single cpu core that is simultaneously the best at everything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is this caused by avx512 ?,?,how much area is used for this ?,or this is related to tsmc node advantage of zen3?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
isnâ€™t tsmc 7nm denser than intelâ€™s 10nm?,how much of this can be chalked up to a node disparity?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
now include the i/o die instead of just the compute chiplet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
early meteor lake redwood cove core die shots look to bring the whole core size from that 7.5mmâ² area down to around 5.3mmâ² while also bringing a sizable increase to cache size and hopefully some other benefits to performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they have two labs in dallas and plano tx, running custom boards to run test and troubleshoot and verify compatibility.",i worked in the team that was swapping out procs for the testing to sell to early customers.,meta just took shipment of 200 procs for that lab to go to a lab in ft worth.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have personally been hands in with the zen 4 and zen 5 chips from amd, they are gonna be bigger than the golden core.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh no!!!,the physical size of the chip is larger!!!!,what a useless observation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
where did you read that nonsense?,gracemont by locuza is 1.59mm2.,that's half the size of zen 3. the cluster of 4 cores with the l2 cache only takes 8.3mm2.,"a cluster of 4 gracemonts are only slightly larger than golden cove with l2, hence the 4:1 claim commonly touted.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is but it is also at the expense of performance/die efficiency.,this chasing for ipc is inefficient.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i am willing to bet amd will put diff architectures into 2 diff dies, if they go chiplet route.",intel probably do the same.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,avx512 does not take huge amount of area in the die.,it makes simd registers double wide but that isnâ€™t huge compared to other components.,"edit: if you look at the image, avx512 makes the â€œfpuâ€ a bit bigger but doesnâ€™t affect the other parts significantly.","editedit: â€œfp regsâ€ and also â€fmaâ€ probably a bit, i didnâ€™t notice he had separated them from the fpu.",so what would be somewhat bigger due to avx512 is everything to right from â€œfp regsâ€ in the image.,golden cove is in general a lot bigger than the competing architectures.,it has more of pretty much everything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
avx512 doesn't add that much area (in the big scheme of things) since it reuses fus that are already present.,it does add size to the register file though.,"golden cove is a slightly wider core than zen, so it has to increase a lot of the ooo resources to keep the extra fus fed.",plus it uses an older node.,these two factors conspire to create a larger core in terms of area.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not much, the density is similar, that's why they renamed the 10nm process to ""intel 7"" to make it more aligned with what tsmc considers to be 7nm and so they dont look out of date.","the upcoming ""intel 4"" node is really 7nm, but the density puts it around tsmc's 5nm.","the numbers dont mean much, its more of a marketing thing.","amd's main advantage is having a chiplet design instead of a monolithic one, it lets them have better yields by separating the ""compute"" die from the i/o which they can produce using 14nm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel claims they are comparable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"golden cove and zen 3 are extremely different cores

you want *exactly* same cores to compare nodes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hard to compare due to amd using the less dense, and very cheap, 12lp process at global foundries, so you would need to use the io area from their 7nm apus... but amd's io definitely seems pretty bulky.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"source: ""trust me bro""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh no!!!,"it's not like larger core sizes means less cores, higher costs, worse yields, etc etc

what a useless comment",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is like saying zen 3 is inefficient compared with e-core.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's really not how it works though, and certainly not the conclusion locuza came to either...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah.,i'm thinking 24c on desktop is possible with 8c zen4 chiplet + 16c zen4c chiplet with two 8c ccxs in it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fp registry files are also doubled.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wonder if alder lake has space reserved for amx like skylake had for avx-512.,thats 4kb of register space.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">editedit: â€œfp regsâ€ and also â€fmaâ€ probably a bit, i didnâ€™t notice he had separated them from the fpu.",fma was already 512 bit wide in skylake (to do 2x 256 fma per cycle) so i don't think it had to get much if any bigger.,it's more or less the same thing to do 2x256 as 1x512 in terms of hardware complexity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

>""the upcoming ""intel 4"" node is really 7nm, but the density puts it around tsmc's 5nm.""",is incorrect.,"this [node density comparison](https://semiwiki.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/slide14-768x432.jpg.webp) outlines that the ""nm"" names don't really match up for every single foundry.",the full [article](https://semiwiki.com/semiconductor-services/ic-knowledge/310900-can-intel-catch-tsmc-in-2025/) is a good read which gives a more accurate perspective of the history of the nodes and their names as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">that's why they renamed the 10nm process to ""intel 7"" to make it more aligned with what tsmc considers to be 7nm and so they dont look out of date.",what kind of customer actually pay attention of node name over actual performance of the chip?,"it cant be casual user, because they just look at simple performance chart or youtuber.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

intel also claimed 10nm node almost a decade ago.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the point of my comment was to illustrate that comparing die sizes is a stupid approach and doesn't mean anything here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"5950x is 286.4 mm^2 (2x 80.7 + 125 (i/o))

12900k is 215.25 mm^2

and the 12900k absolutely smashes 5950x in cinebench and matches it in chromium code compile & blender.",i'd say that's pretty area efficient,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"exactly, i find that so hard to believe.",mostly because they have separate design teams for zen 4 and zen 5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
smh another man who doesnâ€™t understand basics about computing.larger dye sizes????,call 911!!!,!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tsmc should have the edge for awhile.,"starting with meteor lake, future intel cpus will most likely have at least one die from tsmc, probably for the arc graphics, while the cpu core itself would be made on their own 7nm node (intel 4)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, that's why i said that the numbers dont mean much and its a marketing thing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm guessing it's more for their shareholders.,"the new ceo (pat gelsinger) has been trying to shift intel's focus on opening their fabs to clients like apple or nvidia and becoming a foundry service like tsmc/samsung/globalfoundries, that probably plays a role too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ok, brainiac",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they are comparable though.,even locuza [himself](https://twitter.com/locuza_/status/1538873755514114052?s=20&t=gaokqauwqesq1jjs4rofbg) says it.,"please man, go back to the r/amd_stock.","you have been spewing wrong, anti intel comments all over this thread lmao.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
comparing densities of design and process can be very informative.,"intel gets 5.5ghz+ on a die that spread out, which is amazing, but they need more power to carry signals due the distances involved.",a large part of that is intel's use of rather old routing techniques which results in everything being on a grid in tracks.,"meanwhile, amd uses rather advanced techniques to route their logic, which makes for dense designs and looks like a mess on die shots.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there is nothing ""stupid"" about comparing the size of actual cpu cores.",it gives you insight into logic density and over design complexity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this comparison is apples to apples; i.e.,they are comparing the sizes of the actual cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which is completely incorrect from every perspective as intel's large die size is causing them havoc with respect to yields and expenses.,which gets worse the more advanced the node gets.,which is a clear illustration that intel is far far far behind amd.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"12900k doesn't have 16 full cores, either.","the e-cores and intel's uncore are very area efficient, the p-cores are not.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"uarchs are rarely designed from scratch, even separate design teams always end up doing incremental cores.","specially amd, since the last time they tried to do something ""from the ground up"" they almost went bankrupt.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"bro why do you have economics in your username when you can't understand larger die sizes means higher costs, lower margins, worse yields so another reason for higher costs....

man you can't even spell die right, it's die not dye, dye is for adding color to clothes and other material, cmon dude.",it's so ironic you say i know nothing about basic computing lmfao.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"an 8 core complex of golden cove is 25-30 percent larger than an 8 core complex of zen 3, and has near 20 percent higher ipc as well as higher clocks, as well as support for avx-512.",it's not die size it's lack of chiplets for intel that is making stuff more expensive for them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"good point, even zen borrowed code from i think bulldozer?",according to an interview with jim keller.,"but wasn't zen a near ""ground up"" architecture, which allowed to gain such huge ipc gains?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it was ""ground up"" in the sense of it being an mcm design (which i don't think amd had ever done) and isolating the cores into a chiplet.",but the cores themselves were relatively incremental taking the fetch engine from 15h and the execution engine from k10.,with obvious improvements and additions to those bases.,"there are a lot of elements of a uarch that once designed and refined, you try to keep reusing for as long as you want.","usually most of the design goes into resizing and or re configuring how some of the basic blocks you have been using over and over get ""composed"" into the final core.",plus adding the newer libraries/process tech and packaging.,"also, people don't realize that most of the ""design"" effort for a core/soc is spent on validation and bring up.",which is also why nobody wants to risk starting any design from scratch and the eventual pandora's box that leads to.,"&#x200b;

there is stuff in zen that probably tracks back to the original k8, which maybe even keller worked on his first time around amd.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i find it really hard to believe that zen was just an incremental improvement over past amd architectures considering the massive 40-50 percent ipc improvements zen brought over compared to excavator.,"obviously some stuff was reused, even keller said that himself, but it really seems like zen was a overhauled family for amd.","but hey i'm no expert, so i'll take your word for it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">it was ""ground up"" in the sense of it being an mcm design (which i don't think amd had ever done) and isolating the cores into a chiplet.",hammer scaled out to 8 dies 20 years ago.,the mcm design is actually directly descended from it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a lot of the core was overhauled from previous designs plus newer structures.,"the point is that it is very rare to start a core from scratch, since most out of order scalar designs are really doing the same thing.",it's mainly about refining the sizing of structures and where they want to prioritize the area/power budgets (usually driven by use case studies).,"think of it more in terms of rearranging a living room with what's already there and adding a few new things, and maybe changing the paint of the walls and update some of the decor.","rather than rebuild the room from scratch and buying new furniture, etc.","most of the ""art"" in uarch is about getting the sizing of structures just right to get the performance you want to achieve per clock cycle for the target area.",and then from there you can scale the clock cycle to whatever power budget and process allows.,"excavator, for example, wasn't that bad in terms of integer compute.",but it was not balanced well when it came to fp.,so amd clearly focused on sizing the fp resources.,also zen introduced smt to amd.,"so they also had to work on sizing the register files accordingly, etc.","they also put much more focus on the caches, etc.","there are also a lot of internal parallel past designs happening that organizations get to ""poach"" whenever they need to apply some lesson they have learned already.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the protocol comes from hypertransport, but there was a lot of other physical stuff that has to go with mcm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not really.,"i guess you weren't around in those days, but prior to zen their mcm designs where essentially just multiple dies linked by ht:

hey yâ€™all.,can i upload a picture here?,i want to show you my laptop i just took apart itâ€™s an nicosia acer gaming laptop i had for a year almost to the day when i suddenly started smelling something strange like burning rubber and my laptop stopped working i took it in not to acer as my warranty just expired of course so i too it in to a local shop and they passed it to 3 different technicians who all diagnosed my laptop dead!,so now if like to recycle the parts.,"heat gun i heard works, any advice?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why?,got the mobo for a 120â‚¬ and the cpu for a 230â‚¬ whats wrong with that at all?,the 12400f its no where near the 11900k performance to be completely honest with you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i mean i got it for a 230â‚¬ as a brand new one and the mobo was around 120â‚¬.,in here the 12600k is around 300â‚¬ and a good mobo around 320â‚¬ so i dont think thats worth that money all i do is only gaming nothing else and i think the 8/16 will stand for a while but thats just mine opinion.,in cinebench r23 it draws around 170w which is not that bad at 1.15v seems to be a good silicon everything on auto didnt do any undervolting yet.,"it runs at 4,8ghz all core during the test and the score is around 15600 points in a multicore and the single core is 1691 which is pretty good i think.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have 10900k and a 3080. never had any microstutters.,ever.,you say you are using a fresh install of windows - but is it on a ssd -so it is not a clone correct?,im betting it is not your gpu or cpu.,i think youâ€™re barking up the wrong tree.,sounds like a driver issue or possibly one of your drives.,maybe your boot drive.,try a new different one.,and donâ€™t clone os.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ive tried updating bios and still have the problem and ive tried on a new ssd yes the problem still persist.,but ive come to the conclusion that it could be my ram,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ram is not for a specific chipset.,but the newer cpus need faster ram to performance better.,for intel is 3000mhz and up.,i have a 10700k with 32gb of 3200mhz and performance  perfect with my 3060ti.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you should always install windows fresh every time you change  motherboard/chipset.,this will give you one less thing to troubleshoot if you have any issues.,and you should always have a separate windows drive.,"even a cheap 64 gb or 128 gb sata ssd to boot windows, that way you can install windows whenever you want and not have to worry about ""backing up drives"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

for what you are running your idle temp should not exceed 33c.,"i would recommend checking your air flow first make sure you have good unobstructed flow, then you can try a custom fan curve that pushes more air if your flow is good.",you wonâ€™t sit at ambient unless your running a good water loop either custom or aio.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"on a closer look, both the asus and gigabyte use a realtek 2.5g lan port, the msi has an intel 2.5g.","if you plan on using a wired connection, that would make the msi the best pick out of the three, also intel 2.5g ports are generally a lot more expensive than realtek, and rarely found on <â£200 boards.","msi and gigabye boards also have 4xm.2 slots, the asus only has 3.

tuf nowadays is somewhat entry to main stream level board.,"itâ€™s actually worse than asus z690-a, and yes, the codec is pretty meh.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and that's why it's expensive.,it's pretty evident that you're not aware about gigabytes record breaking overclocking motherboards and would squash anything out there: the tachyon is one of them.,"yes, asus and msi are fairly good and reliable, but i would take gigabyte any day any time and would challenge anyone to out up against any overclocking board.",even for my 5950x the auros master is enough.,been using their soc ln2 boards for a while.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i got mine launch day so probably a bad apple, and there may have been a board revision since.",i did find it generally ran my 12900k at a high vcore than this gigabyte board does.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for msi rewievs a lot ppl saying doa comes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
he already has ddr4 and is looking for a ddr4 board dummy.,"and no motherboard is ever worth that much money, what more does it do exactly?",cook you eggs in the morning?,also you must work for gigabyte right?,what does having a record breaking oc board' matter if you happen to only get a chip that will do 5.1-5.2 ghz?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you'll find examples of doa mobod from all brands.,but if you think that's a reason to spend extra money then you do you.,overpaying for a motherboard is one of the easiest ways to overspend on a build and makes absolutely no difference as far as stock performance is concerned (within reason of course).,an ultra cheap b660 board will not be the same as a z690 board but all z690 boards are overbuilt.,hence why there isn't any super cheap options.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
uhh you do know you can ship things back or if you buy used go through ebay so you have buyers protection or save up your money and get a nice board thatâ€™s what i did instead of getting a shitty board,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

can you check the board's current bios version?,maybe ask the seller?,"9400f support started on 7b22v24, if the board was never updated, initial version i think is 7b22v21, it probably won't boot with your cpu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can you go to bios?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i tried hard resetting bios, removed cmos, different rams, different gpu, insuring pins are not bent",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok thank you all .,"it got solved, the mobo is busted previous owner scuffed the pcb lanes with cooler screws.",i got it refunded,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"keep in mind that when comparing against benchmarks, other components could be different between your system and theirs, too, which could affect results.","but yes, your 9400f can bottleneck your gpu in cpu-intensive games or if you're going for high framerates.",the lack of hyperthreading and slower cores are the biggest weaknesses.,"a 12600k would be more than enough for a 3060ti, but personally, i'd go for the 12700k (if it's within your budget) for the extra longevity you'll get from having more cores.",it will theoretically last you across more gpu upgrades.,keep in mind you'll need a new motherboard to upgrade your cpu as well.,and double check your psu can handle it.,"lastly, check to make sure your cpu cooler is compatible with the new socket.","if you're using the stock cooler with the 9400f, you'll definitely want a beefier one for the 12th-gen cpus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yea your processor is limiting your 3060 ti

if you want to negate it try just go cheap and get a 12400f with a b660 or h670 board, youâ€™ll get a sizable performance uplift from that old coffee lake i5 so your processor isnâ€™t being the main limit to your graphics cardâ€™s performance",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have a 12600k with a 3080 and at ultra wide resolution, my cpu is just sleeping",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the generic nature of the question makes me wonder if people understand what a bottleneck is.,every pc has a bottleneck.,that is inevitable.,"ideally, the bottleneck should be the gpu while playing a game.",the cpu usage is irrelevant.,"as long as the gpu utilization is above 95%, the gpu is the primary bottleneck, which is how it should be.",if it's lower than that then some other component is holding back performance.,usually it's the cpu but at times it can also be the vram or system ram if either is full.,in your case it would most likely be the cpu since it's pretty old at this point and handily outpaced by the 3060ti.,"depending on your resolution and settings, you can get away with just a 12400f or a 5600x.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not really discussed (in part because it was never really documented) but part of the reason the 2nd gen netburst (as opposed to less unbalanced first gen) was such a mess was the design process and launch.,during the 1st gen netburst amd64 was announced and then had to be added to the (already in development) 2nd gen on short notice.,"then intels 90nm process did not perform quite as expected, resulting in the core going over power budget.",i knew someone on the design team.,they were scrambling to get power and especially leakage under control right up to tape out.,they never really succeeded.,"just speculation on my part, but the glitchy, clumsy ""replay"" mechanism was probably not intended to have a lot more optimization that never happened because so many engineers had to put out other fires.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this was a really good analysis and retrospective on netburst gen 2..

i liked where they talked about what technologies were re-used on later chips:  trace cache adapted for sandy bridge (6 years later), and some other features that showed up in westmere (4-5 years later).",very impressive is that some aspects of the branch capabilities werenâ€™t actually met or exceeded until zen 3 / 2021 intel chips.,one choice that i guess weâ€™ll never see again was the â€˜replayâ€™ feature discussed to keep branch penalties down.. where the cpu just executes multiple paths of branches knowing itâ€™s going to throw away those resultsâ€¦.,thatâ€™s very power intensive because youâ€™re constantly wasting energy no matter what..  but can also give you per thread boosts beyond a chip that only executes â€˜we think this isâ€™ good branches.,"i am curious about those alus â€” some old articles hinted that williamette/northwood had double pumped alus - that actually ran at double the clock speed, and that this somehow changed with prescott/cedar mill.",was that actually the case?,or were they just double wide in some special way?,i also hope some day we get a real architecture overview of the cancelled tejas/jayhawk chips from intel.,itâ€™s been 15 years â€” there canâ€™t be too many secrets of those chips left..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am curious about this..  was it really the intel 90nm process or was it the physics related to dennard scaling breaking down?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
breakdown of dennard scaling i think.,they also had some issues with leakage current which didn't help with the huge core and lack of power gating in those days.,(just my opinion i did not work for intel and no one told me anything confidential),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just to be fair, 90nm was a shitshow of a node for everyone, not just intel.",leakage and thermal issues were becoming 1st order limiters and the industry was still using old flows that were not considering them properly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
really interesting that this is all surfacing after so many years (oh god).,"i had, or still have somewhere in the attic, a northwood p4 system.","i think it was just around the best moment for netburst, actually faster than the p3 and before things went silly with the later prescott.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
back off your overclocks and/or reduce your negative voltage offset if you set one.,"using software such as cinebench, cpu tests in 3dmark and prime95 can help you find where youâ€™re stable under high load.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm personally a fan of running prime95 small ffts and ensuring you can run stable for at least a couple minutes.,i find this often requires increasing voltage on the v/f curve.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
man the only kind of stability doing that will guarantee is thermal stability.,15-20 minutes prime 95 small ffts is a good start to determine if you can cool that wattage and very early preliminary stability validation.,i can crash out my system thatâ€™s only prime95 small fft stable in 5 minutes with occt large data set or asus realbench.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my first thought is backup your important files to an external drive then do a clean reinstall of windows on the computer you already have.,a lot of prebuilt computers come with garbage bloatware and it's likely when you turned it on after 2 years all of it started updating at once and slowed your pc to a crawl.,"it's possible if left on for a while this crap will sort itself out, but it shouldn't be there in the first place.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what you should really do is to stop thinking in marketing terms like ryzen 7 or i7.,"they literally make no sense, as there are different models of different generations.","for example, thereâ€™s ryzen 5 3600 and thereâ€™s ryzen 5 5600x, which belong to different generations, and the 5600x is significantly better.","then there are i7-11700k and i9-11900k, but they are almost the same, with the 11900k being just an overclocked version of the 11700k, which itâ€™s why it was called a waste of sand or something.","then there are desktop and mobile cpus, which are very different in both performance and heat they produce.",so look up *a specific model* and consider how good it is for your specific purposes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"then there's me (*with my short attention span*) and my 4770k, which i used until recently, and a hundred+ tabs in mozilla (*that i'm definitely gonna read/watch till the end... sometimes later*) and a game running in the background...

p.s.",never buy pre-builts if possible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ryzen 7 and i7 are meaningless numbers.,ryzen 7 can be 5 generations of cpu including mobile parts and i7 spans the better part of a decade.,"an i3 12100 is equal to or faster than an i7 6700, and a ryzen 7 5700x isn't even in the same ballpark as a 1700x.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's very high for jasper lake to have that package power at idle.,idle package power for jasper lake is 0.5w.,and the full platform power is around 3w which display panel consumes about 1.8w.,maybe you should check for bios upgrade.,sometimes oems tune it higher to get better performance.,in that case you should look at bios options for anything that causes this added power consumption.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

speedstep isn't going to cause this.,"likely your charger is defective or you have too small of a charger, so the laptop is throttling back the cpu so the computer doesn't exceed the power budget.","the alternative is, either the cpu is overheating and the fan needs cleaning, or you have some corruption in the windows power plan settings that you can fix by resetting every power plan.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, check the windows power plan settings.","if you have the energy saving or whatever it is called, it will drag down the hz.","if it happens immediately, it's most likely power plan setting.","if it happens slowly, it may be your pc over heating, mine did while in charger.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no bro ,i dont think speedstep is behind this
probably either your charger is damaged or their is some problem with power circuit 

tell more about 
is your fan running?",what is your cpu temperature ?,u did any bios update ?,"check in safe mode ,cpu should run at base frequency ,if cpu is still locked at 0.20 then try fresh install but before reinstalling windows , confirm your firmware is upto date

it's not great but also not abnormal for laptops nowadays.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
generally laptops are very limited by their initial design.,you have 3 options to improve cooling.,1. cap fps.,2. update to the latest bios.,often they will improve the fan curve profile.,3. switch out the thermal paste for a higher performing paste.,maybe mx-4.,4. purchase a laptop mat.,having a raised pad can help improve airflow.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"any gaming laptop should have a laptop cooler imo, even for my work laptop with just firefox running i use a cooler that has one 120mm fan.",there is just not enough space inside the laptop for enough metal/fans to dissapate 150-200w of heat.,look at the size of desktop coolers rated to cool 200w.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
while it's no temperature that will fry your hardware instantly it's definitely at the upper limit and will degrade your hardware faster.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how long have you owned the laptop?,do you live in a dusty environment?,"principally, the tj max for most intel chips lies at 100â°c, but 95â°c is really approaching that upper limit.","not dangerous, but your cpus lifespan is at risk of being shortened if it regularly runs at such temps.","back to the length of ownership and household dust, you should consider cleaning up the hardware inside, as dust buildup would be what primarily causes extreme temperatures.",there will be plenty of guides on how to clean up your specific model.,"if your laptop make doesn't allow for easy cleaning, then don't buy that brand again, as that's anti-consumer.","if that doesn't help, get yourself a good laptop cooling stand, they aren't expensive and usually work wonders.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"due to less space for spreading out heat , cpu temperature often reaches >90 degrees
modern cpu can throttle when they reach tjmax ,but constantly above 90 degree will degrade your laptop faster 

since your cpu is 6 core ,you can try to disable turbo,it will drop down you temperature to less than 70 degree,but you cpu will run at max 2.5ghz ,it enough for basic work,and in ganes no such decrease in performance , because most of load is handled by gpu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for a laptop itâ€™s fine.,could be better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the fps is capped pn 144 via the nvidia controll  panel.,"i dont know anything about bios .. to add new and better termal paste i need to open the whole laã¼top , remove gc and remove some cabels, with that im not comfortable.",i try some ectern coolers.,"i have the laptop atm higher on the back that the airflow is better (backed up 5cm on the backside)

"and first of all, use a debloater on it, there is a tool called ""this is w 11"" that does both",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it may sound counterintuitive, but making software backwards compatible encourages planned obsolescence.","when something new is developed with new features and the old is no longer supported, it is natural obsolescence.","by doing backwards compatibility, companies can plan when to release new features, when to discontinue the previous version, and start doing lazy releases, as there is no rush to stop selling the old product.","instead of making you buy one big upgrade, you buy many small upgrades and technological development becomes slower",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yea, but dont compare the switch from xp to 7 to the switch from 10 to 11, the w11 is an unfinnished product + its loaded with bloatware, so as an user its better to stay on the 10, or even switch to linux when microsoft starts to cut support for w10",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, using w11 with a cpu without e cores is just asking for trash performance, w11 is filled with bloat, and since the i5 12400f does not have any e cores to handle it, you will get worse performance in games",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"windows 11 is not any more bloated than windows 10, and gaming performance should be virtually identical.",i don't understand your argument that reverting to an older operating system with less features and support is a better decision for the op.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"probably around the time you could buy a 4090 the 13th gen products will have released, so waiting for the 13900k would probably be best if you are spending that much money.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it will lose to 13700/zen4 in 4 months while costing double.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a 12900ks.,i use it for photo processing with lightroom churning jpgs and tiffs etc.,it runs at 241w at 5.2ghz.,and it runs hot at 98c with 27c ambient on a h150i corsair when i'm pushing it for 15-30min at 5.2ghz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, everything, lol.","it's literally the same as 12900k, only a higher chance of getting non-dud for your competitive overclocking needings.",there's absolutely zero reason to buy 12900ks outside of competitive overclocking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well itâ€™s more power hungry and will put out proportionally more heat.,thatâ€™s basically it compared to a normal k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
by the way if you buy best available every 5 years i think it's now worth it to already wait those 3 months for raptor lake and zen4 release.,those will be a lot better than what is available now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hot.,12900k isn't exactly cool to begin with.,ks is gonna be hotter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it needs a beefy custom loop to not throttle.,even a big aio cannot keep it under 100c in something as simple as cinebench.,even the stock 12900k pushes a 360mm aio to its limits.,the ks is pushed way harder and will easily exceed 300w to maintain 5.2 ghz on most samples.,241w is wholly insufficient to even maintain 5.2 ghz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you need the cpu right now i would say 12900ks is a better binned 12900k, for me i would go for the ks because it is better silicon and i would be benchmarking it, cooling wise both chips the 12900k and the ks are hot so getting a beefy cooler is important to not miss any performanc, however if you are not needing the cpu right now, i would say other previous comments are correct and you should be waiting for next year release",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"probably not, but even though you want the best in the line, do you really need it?",would you ever utilize the whole potential of the cpu apart from overclocking?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"buy ryzen 5800x3d, this cpu is the best in terms of smooth gameplay without stutter right now.",also it takes only up to 140w of power meanwhile i9 12900ks takes up to 260w.,also it's cheaper.,12900ks achieves the same average fps as 5800x3d but the ryzen has a little bit less stutter.,so unless you're super brand loyal to intel and just don't want amd then 5800x3d is the best cpu for you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"uh, yes.","itâ€™s nearly impossible to cool without a custom loop, and intelâ€™s 13th-gen chips are coming out soon and will make it look silly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes.,my arctic lf 280 handles the reg 12900k like a champ but z73 should be fine and you can always undervolt.,https://pcpartpicker.com/builds/by_part/sn4ycf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

would be difficult.,techspot used a similar cooler (msi coreliquid s360) and the cpu peaked at 102 degrees.,(21 degrees ambient with ac control).,if you do some undervolting you probably could bring it under 90 degrees.,though at that point it would be worse than a regular 12900k.,though if you are just gaming it's probably fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"13th gen will slot into the same socket and probably be noticeably faster in vr and simulation games due to a lot more cache..

one other strategy is get a 12700/k now and a year later slot in a 13th gen..

that aside 12900ks is fine and just get good cooling for it and have awesome game performance..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
think of it as how much do you want to pay for a extra 100-200mhz.,real performance is negligible.,it makes more sense to buy a best k sku upon each generational leap.,either chip needs the best cooler you can get.,no aio will beat a nh-d15 in performance over the course of years.,"trust me, they steadily decline.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
here's what i've figured out.,it's the lga1700 retention clip.,it warps the cpu and the cooler doesn't get a good fit.,"check out the ""grizzly contact frame"" --

to test his new 12th gen contact frame, der8auer stressed 14 cpus cooled by an ekwb magnitude (lapped) cooler and noted that the cpus enjoyed benefits of up to 7.1 celsius.","one of the cpus ran a 0.3 celsius hotter, which is odd, but the average benefit was between four and five degrees.","&#x200b;

so i've decided to use the contact frame out of the box.",i have my motherboard coming and already have the ks.,i was thinking about going 13th gen then i heard about nvidia pushing back the rtx40xx gpus and i can't imagine that intel hasn't been hit with silicon shortage .. so i don't see i9's coming out right at release?,... something tells me they are going to have to augment supply of \_reallllllly\_ high end silicon.,honestly i just didn't want to take the chance of dealing with supply chain disruption and having to wait for all the tech to come out to match.,right now i can get decent stuff that will be a 4 year machine ... sure you're buying a 13th gen i7 ... in a 12th gen jacket ... but c'est la vie.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i just looked it up and the reference design is up to 75w and the aib is up to 92w.,so even the oc aib model barely draws power compared to most current gpus.,so if it is 10-20% faster thats obviously worth the trade off of a few more watts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the rsu's are in addition to the yearly cash bonus and are assigned based on grade.,your manager can decide to give you more or less than the recommended 100% payout at the given grade.,"so, for example, when you receive your first raise (this happens yearly and automatically) you'll receive a pay letter and on it will be your rsu award.","it'll say something like rsu $5,000 (100%).",which means you're getting 5k in rsu's and that's inline with what everyone else is getting at your grade level.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"you have something using cpu cycles, the cpu is getting hot and transferring heat more efficiently because you replaced the thermal paste... now you are feeling the heat more.","weird, i know, but the junk paste typically used keeps the heat in the cpu and it throttles more, which makes the feel of the laptop cooler.","it's a common thing i experience, and i do this daily.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe heatsink is out of freon.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the problem is, though, that the paste was only replaced on the copper plate between the heatsink and the cpu.","just north of the cpu is the pch, which is connected to the aluminium heatsink slab by a thermal pad.","the cpu temperatures are good, but the pch temperature is so hot i can feel it through the trackpad.",would a replacement thermal pad address this?,"if the heatsink is hot, then the heatsink is connected adequately, right?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's funny, i never realised the heavy duty copper bit was filled with gas.",i always just thought the thing was a big lump of copper.,"but no, heatsink is functioning, as cpu temp is good.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

should i try re mounting it with new thermal paste ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
try that.,maybe your water block is not making correct contact with the cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes and no.,you need an expensive big heatsink to run cooler and a lot of airflow in case.,edit: its possible to underclock the cpu in an standard motherboard not in oem motherboards.,you could undervolt the cpu but you need to stress it after a bit of a undervolt .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
may i ask why youâ€™re trying to do this.,"if your answer is â€œto make it quietâ€, then this is the wrong way to go about it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
under power it by 50%??,or just buy a heatsink 2x the stock one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"undervolt , don't underclock.. or rather undervolt as well.",with the right bios it can all be done :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i want to run a server at low power producing low heat to keep the ambient temp of the room down and power consumption lower.,3.10 ghz is overkill for what i'm doing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a heat sink merely transfers the heat out of the cpu chassis and into the room where the computer is.,i want total heat in the room to go down.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"first, i would suggest you buy a bigger heatsink (the stock one will perform very poorly without the required fan), and donâ€™t actually go fanless.",just get quiet fans and run them at low rpm such that you canâ€™t even hear them.,even very low airflow is a lot better than trying to rely on convection cooling.,"as for reducing performance, know that your not going to get the power consumption and heat output from the system unless something is actually demanding that level of work (in which case you do need the performance).",an idle system (that isnâ€™t gimped by disabling all the default power saving features) runs cool and quiet.,my 12900k downclocks to 500mhz and uses just 8 watts of power while idling.,"or, it can chew 250 watts when the workload wants it.","if you want to throw a heavy workload at it and still prevent high performance and heat output, i would suggest that configuring the pl1 and pl2 power level limits would be a better way to go about it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i metered my alder lake server at 3w (powered down) and 15w (idling at desktop).,how much cpu load are you looking at?,can easily run with the fan off if the cpu load is low.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
buy a nuc!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, but in modern efficient systems heat is a result of workload, not merely being powered on.",donâ€™t use the system and it wonâ€™t make significant heat.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, but given a situation where there is a choice between doing in 1 second a task at 3 ghz or doing in 2 seconds the same task at 1.5 ghz, i prefer the latter if it produces less heat overall.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then i would suggest to just set up your power limits.,"typically high power draw = heat output, so limit the power draw and let the cpu manage its own frequency.",before doing this i would also suggest configuring an undervolt to maximize the heat reduction.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i guess gen (15th or 16th) when they release powervia and ribbonfet .,it should be the biggest performance jump in last \~15 years .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's really tough to say, but for desktop - 13th gen i7 should be a really good chip given the cache increases.",we're also entering the territory where we probably have enough cores for a while.,"14th gen is shaping up to be a bit faster but i haven't heard of any new technologies though we may see usb4 on the chipset with 14th gen.

if you believe leak sites, 15th gen is supposedly the first of the ""royal core"" project chips with ""revolutionary changes"".","..

otoh  you could argue the time to buy is end of year - and go with amd/am5.",amd supported am4 and replacing first gen ryzen (1000 series) with a modern 5000 series chip is a huge upgrade.,it looks like amd will end up supporting am5 the same way - for multiple generations.. so easy to upgrade and gain a lot of performance later.,"..

i don't think you'll go wrong either way - but i'd say go intel 13th gen or amd am5 at the end of the year / into next year.",performance will be close between both but amd will have a much better upgrade path in the same socket going forward as 13th gen is the end of line for that socket.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thank you.,"yes i'm fully aware amd is much more advanced when it comes to their tsmc partners and fab processes, but i've been impressed enough with what intel has done being so behind (power draw be dammed lol.)",i have no issue what so ever waiting a year or two to find the right time.,"i may be romantic about some of their chips, but when i bought my 2700k, that was one of the absolute best cpus ever.","it was one gen ahead of their completely new architecture, much more powerful than the previous one, overclocked extremely well, and lasted me almost the entire decade.","the 9700f was a massive upgrade obviously, but the whole hyperthreading thing is frankly embarrassing now with only being on 8 threads.",imo just buying their offerings now is a huge mistake because they are clearly on the edge of something more and ddr5/pcie5 is in it's infancy.,hopefully the answer will be more clear soon.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's sounding exactly like what i'm wanting.,still a bit depressing since i thought they would be caught up by now.,i much rather wait a generation or two more than get stuck with their current offerings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

most of the network issues posted here (ie with z690 boards) relate to the intel i225-v adapter which is a buggy mess.,"however your board has realtek lan, so youâ€™re looking more at generic networking or a realtek issue, versus something intel specific.",what are the link lights showing on the port?,does device manager show any issues with the adapter or elsewhere?,have you rebooted your router?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's not the intel i225-v that is the issue it is people not doing the research.,windows 10 driver would be version 1.x.x.x & you can use proset.,windows 11 is driver version 2.x.x.x & you cannot use proset.,or you get a buggy mess.,"does it work, can you disable proset in services e.t.c.",yip but you would still not doing it right hence background issues.beyond that you have isp now using ipv6 since static ip's are a thing of the past & other using just ipv4 but once again no static ip's causing issues which in turn means you need to disable ipv6 protocols regardless of lan adapter e.t.c.,"also the fiber issue with ipv6.then you have the forum users who are actually using wifi on windows 11 because they didn't turn the option off in settings, but think they are not because ""sunshine & rainbows"" & they didn't disable it in bios, they didn't disable it in o/s & they didn't add the antenna so how could it be working when its the default because it usually has the lowest priority number which makes it the default.",literally all this is available on the internet for people to read & half of this is on the intel website.,"sorry if you think this is directed at you materidan its not, its at everyone whose has an issue with i225-v & not looked it up.",also unidentified network = router issue usually.,"if you play around with lan settings in windows to much you can also get it, but a pc restart usually fixes it.",edit: [https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000057261/ethernet-products/gigabit-ethernet-controllers-up-to-2-5gbe.html](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000057261/ethernet-products/gigabit-ethernet-controllers-up-to-2-5gbe.html) this is obviously not taken into account as its older.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i225-v issues existed long before windows 11 came onto the scene.,"â€œa network cable is unpluggedâ€, â€œcannot start - code 10â€ happen regardless of o/s or driver version, and itâ€™s known that it doesnâ€™t always like to communicate with certain other network ports (on switches / routers).","at least in the case of my z690 hero, upon certain random reboots, or sometimes after accessing the bios, or sometimes after a bios update, the network adapter can lock up into a state where a reboot or powering off does nothing, the link lights are messed up (itâ€™s like itâ€™s stuck in standby mode), and the pc must have power physically removed to restore operation.",that seems beyond a mere driver/software issue.,"anyways, iâ€™m using windows 11, driver v2.0.1.3, and do not have proset installed.",note that for me it works 99.9% of the time brilliantly - itâ€™s only randomly and sporadically that it breaks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"**overview**

in light of recent announcements, rumors, and other data, i decided to try to conglomerate all the info into a new roadmap.","note that for the foundries, the date for each node is based on when the products of said node would enter the market, not when they are considered ""manufacturing ready"" or ""starting ramp"".","additionally, for the intel foundry, the node date is corresponding with when an intel product using said node will be released in volume.",so stuff like loihi 2 does not count.,the data for the node characteristics is based on intel 7 and tsmc 7nm having similar performance and density.,power characteristics are not included because of the scarcity of data on them for intel nodes.,"of course none of the timelines and products are guaranteed to match the timeline above, but based on the information we have i think this is the most likely scenario.","**sources**

\- zen 4 is launching with 5nm tsmc;  that's from amd's own press slides from just a few weeks ago (one line below).",\- another reason zen 4 and zen 4 with vcache are both 5nm as amd epyc genoa is listed as 5nm by amd.,genoa will include vcache models that'll trickle down to zen 4.,\- zen 4c will also launch on 5nm per amd's charts but could port later to n4.,\- tsmc n4 / 4nm will probably be used for the amd phoenix apu coming sometime in 2023;  while zen 5 is aiming for 3nm but could fall back to 4nm if there's not enough capacity on n3 when needed.,"\- context note - historically apple's demand is so high for tsmc's bleeding edge nodes that it takes \*at least\* a full year for anyone else to get access to that node..  since apple won't be launching any 3nm products until at least 2h 2022,  the earliest we'll see an amd 3nm product is 2h 2023 and probably later.","apple hit tsmc 5nm way back in 2h 2020, and it's only 2h 2022 that amd hits 5nm.",\- i agree with zen 6 being 3nm.,"https://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/notebooks/news/\_nc3/amd\_zen\_roadmap.jpg

lmao what's the deal with spr?,"maybe spr that was intended to launch in 2021, is not the same spr that's launching this year?",or at some point they started from scratch with the chiplets and stuff and their initial q4 2021 release target was too ambitious?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i disagree on intel3 and put that in 1h24.,"hitting published timelines for it will be a priority since it's externally available, it's a 40% performance increase over 7, and with 4 using fewer masks it's likely be very cost competitive compared to non euv.",without solid updates on euv machines etc i don't think it's justified.,"a dense design like sierra forest also targets a different market and could be released earlier without cannibalizing sales, and releasing it earlier than granite rapids would work well with slow ramp or limited volume.",matches my spreadsheet apart from that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

spr delays are going to cause an issue but i think there's a good chance they'll go for a staggered launch.,there was an intel roadmap shown by adoredtv long time ago and sapphire rapids was shown for 2s and 4s but emerald rapids only for 4s+.,"so they can skip emr for 2s and get gnr 2s out in h1 and bring 4s+ in h2 of 2024. the 4s+ platforms are enterprise and always came out slower(xeon dp vs mp, e5 vs e7), so coincidentally or not so coincidentally they can go back to that cadence.","because 4s and enterprise is intel territory and amd's strength is really in 2s, that would be the way to go.","in the meantime, i assume spr will be sold pretty cheap by intel standards and they can use icelake to fill gaps left by spr and spr will take over that duty when emr arrives.","i think their desire is to get process nodes coming as fast as possible so bringing sierra forest early would be the way to go if no gnr can make it h1 of 2024.

you are right about the zen 5 part, although they did say both server turin and mobile is end of 2024. perhaps that means desktops a bit earlier.",with new leaks i wouldn't be surprised arrowlake and 20a launching spring of 2024 so amd would want to address it if that's what they are doing.,"the leakers saying staggered lineup with meteorlake-s for low/mid and arrowlake ""almost same time"" as high end would be the way to go.",so jan/feb for mtl-s and say april for arl-s. if that's what they are doing it's going to surprise a lot of folks.,"arrowlake: [https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-technology-roadmaps-milestones.html?wapkw=arrow%20lake](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-technology-roadmaps-milestones.html?wapkw=arrow%20lake)

vcore.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think you should check your pump speed and make sure your radiator is taking away heat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have found that doing dots in the corners and x in the middle seems to give the best results for the thermal paste on alder lake.,[:x:],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"first off, stop mentioning idle temps its worthless.","you mention cinebench then fail to give the temps from it, the one bit of info that matters here",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all i have is corsair xtm50 will that be good enough to do my own thermal paste?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you have an idea what the pump speed should be?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah that works.,if anything it's honestly probably better than the stock stuff.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not sure but i would look for above zero rpm and that the pump is 100% powered at all times and temperatures.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you can't overclock the non-k cpus, but the i7-12700f is essentially the second fastest cpu for gaming you can have right now.","you can't measure cpu performance in just ghz, but the 12700f boosts up to 4.9ghz and 4.5ghz all-core when in use.","also the recommended (not minimum) system requirements for boneworks is a 7700k, so the 12700f is way above above the system requirements.","**tldr;** no you can't overclock, but the 12700f is way more than boneworks (and most games) needs, don't worry about it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"boneworks will run fine, as will pretty much everything else.","don't get too hung up about specs, with steam you can just give it a shot and if it really doesn't run well you can refund it.",your 12700f will run almost all games really well for the next couple of years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"well tbh, the amount you already spent on your rig so very high, and hence id say get the 12700k.",to balance it out i gess.,keep in mind you dont need to change 12600k at all.,its already plenty powerful for what you want to do now and future.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
get 12700k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"alright, i guess i'll stick with the 12600k then.",appreciate it!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"okay, appreciate the reply.","so you are saying that i'll be fine with the 12600k for everything i want to do, but the 12700k would've just made a better build to balance out with the gpu performance?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12600k and 12700k have hardly any difference in gaming.,but i can see the benefits in production work loads.,plus it eould suit ur already high end build.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 12600k is a beast, even for multithreaded workloads.","so honestly, its up to you, if the price difference is going to mean youll sacrifice some other part of the build, get the 12600k, if you have the spare cash get the 700k",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"new amd cpu would force an upgraded cpu, mobo, and ram.",just something to keep in mind.,i believe iâ€™ve heard rumors 13th gen intel might allow ddr4 and ddr5.,i recently got a 12700k and it is a monster.,but 12600k is also.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8600k is still a pretty capable cpu.,i would wait for ryzen 7000 or 13th gen at this point.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
better get new gpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9600k and rtx 3070 here at 1440p and its a very strong combo.,"i'm going to wait until ddr5 becomes affordable, no reason to upgrade to another ddr4 platform or to an expensive ddr5 one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if it aint broken dont fix it.,no harm waiting for the next generation of cpu's.,ddr5 prices should drop by then.,your gpu is kind of out dated by now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you'll want to upgrade both your cpu and gpu.,"12600k is good for gaming, but if the streaming and editing is done often or for profit, get the 12700k or 12700f if you're on a budget.",pair it with a 3060-3080.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12600k is 10% cheaper now than it was at launch.,i'd guess the 13600k will be back to $320-$330.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i would upgrade when rtx 4000 and rx 7000 series come out to upgrade the gpu and wait until ddr5 is affordable and upgrade to either zen 4 or intel 13th gen, wait for benchmarks of course.",idk what kinda games youre into but i cant think of any games that are coming out before new gpus and cpus launch at the end of this year that your current system wouldnt be able to handle at medium settings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

wait for 13th gen if you can change mobos",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well you might then feel sad after zen4 with am5 releases and turns out to be faster and more electricity efficient in everything over intel raptor lake.,it will be using more advanced manufacturing process than intel that's already a fact.,"zen4 is confirmed to have boost clocks over 5.5ghz which means performance will be on par or a bit higher than raptor lake + am5 platform will last you much longer than intel lga 1700. 

likely am5 will still support cpus released in 2025/26 meanwhile for lga 1700 raptor lake is the end of line.",that means with am5 you'll save money by not having to buy new motherboard for an upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i just put together a 12700f and a 3070ti on a 690 board, happy with it so far.","i didnâ€™t want to wait, i already waited a year for the 30 series to come to a reasonable price",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12600k as it is still best for gaming and can easily handle davinci,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'd suggest looking for used i9-9900(k) online.,your current motherboard should be able to support it with the latest bios update.,you will get much higher all-core performance and a bit better gaming performance with noticeably more stable frame times.,in my opinion your current platform can do you just fine for a couple more years or so.,"and of course just switching a cpu will be much cheaper than moving to a new platform, especially if you were considering going with ddr5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you need new cpu now buy new cpu now.,there will always be the next generation just around the corner.,and unfortunately only you can know if the i5 is enough for you.,you can run davinci resolve on pretty much any cpu but faster is faster.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i would upgrade right away, 8600k is pretty bad for the current gen. 12600k or the 12700k will easily trade punched with the next few gens as far as gaming is concerned",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"im just going to ask here..

i can afford to get a 12700k set up right now, but i was wondering what are the expectations of price increase on 13th gen based on inflation?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"take the 12700f instead, shouldn't be much more expensive than the 12600k and will have almost identical performance to the 12700k.",but waiting for new cpus to come out wouldn't hurt if you can.,and even if they don't end up being that great the prices on 12th gen will probably be lower at that point.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hmm, i mean how much better is the 12700k over the 12600k, and how much future proofing would it be, i saw some tests that when both oc at 5ghz, they are very close in performance, i know the 12700k has more cores but how will that translate over to what i need it for?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if i'm not going to upgrade for around 4 years, would the 12600k still be good enough?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is the 13th gen also 1700lga socket?,or is it gonna be completely new ?,like do we need to get a new mobo too?,i was thinking about getting the msi tomahawk mag z690 1700lga mobo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
okay thank you!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my question is, should i get the 3080 12gb or the 3080ti fe, or wait for the 40 series?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what about the mobo?,"i was looking at the msi mag tomahawk z690, either the ddr4 or ddr5 version?",is it worth it to future proof with dd5?,also do you know if the 13th gen cpus gonna be 1700 lga too?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so the 13600k would be the same price as the 12700k, but with better performance ?",what do you think?,i think when the 12600k and 12700k first came out there were super expensive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i feel like i do need to upgrade my cpu, i play valorant and it does drop frames to like 90-100 fps, and it lags",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so the new intel chips wont be supporting 1700lga sockets?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what was your cost for your new build?,and what were you upgrading from?,"which mobo did you get, i was looking at the msi mag tomahawk z690 dd4-dd5 mobos",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"good question, i would like to know also",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i believe it's near the same performance once you raise the power limits right?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what mobo did you get with your 12700k?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 700k also has more cache.,"you wont see much difference in games, but if you are taxing the cpu with heavy workloads then yeah, the 2 extra cores are going to make a difference.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13th gen should also be 1700 socket.,so yeah i guess that would mean it should support ddr4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3080 is fine

waiting for 4xxx can be too long",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

wouldnt buy ddr5 for the next year or 2 untill the prices are reasonable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't know if it'll be the same price as the 12700k.,that's like $379 on pcpartpicker right now.,i'd imagine the 13600k will have more e-cores than the 4 the 12600k or 12700k has.,i'd guess 8. plus it'll have more single core performance than any 12th gen except maybe the 12900ks.,no idea if the 13600k will have more multicore performance than the 12700k.,might be close.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thats odd games like valorant arent cpu heavy and dont require many threads.,does it ruin your experience?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is not an issue with the cpu.,you should be getting 400fps without any issues.,gotta be something else.,check your process list in task manager.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[removed],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"valorant is primarily cpu heavy, one of the few games that is, and it does, i get lag spikes and frame skips",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
really?,"thats very interesting, most of the time when i check task manager, its valorant using 80-90% of process",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ah i see so intel moves onto a new socket after 2 gens, while amd stays on the same one for about 4-5 yrs?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not a lot of difference, you'd see a lot more difference with the k vs kf.",the kf does not have igpu which the k has.,you can offload video encoding to the igpu and save 10-20fps vs having the gpu or cpu doing the encoding.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cl is a latency rating on ram.,a big reason ddr5 isnâ€™t the hot commodity despite being new tech and higher frequency is because manufacturers havenâ€™t gotten the timings down yet.,"so sure you can get 5600mhz, but it will be something like cl36, whereas ddr4 can get down to cl14.",ddr4 is still able to match or beat ddr5 in benchmarks due to this.,"also keep in mind ddr4 isnâ€™t even fully utilized yet, so ddr5 as of now could be considered â€œelitistâ€ or â€œoverkillâ€.",ddr4 wonâ€™t be going away anytime soon.,but of course new tech is fun to get/have so your choice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ddr5 dont provide any adventage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
personally i think gpu prices aren't going to crash any further because of crypto.,"i think the grasp of crypto on gpu prices is already gone, and now it's just retailers unwilling sell gpus at low prices because they probably had to spend extra to get the gpus they have in stock, and they don't want to lose money.","but prices will still fall further regardless when new rtx 4000 gpus release, although it'll be another 6 months until you probably see sub $600 rtx 4000 series gpus in the 4070 or lower class release.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah but the 8600k should be more than enough to run it over 200fps at 1080p.,valorant doesn't require more than 6 threads to run smoothly.,something else is causing your game to stutter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m having this same issue on valorant and canâ€™t figure out the reason.,i am also in the process of upgrading for that exact reason.,let me know if you find a solution,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
amd stayed on am4 for 4 generations and they said they'll keep the longetivity with am5.,so minimum 3 generations should be supported.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hmm okay, so then a dd4 z690 mb would be good, what about the ram i saw something about the cl14 and cl16 which one is better?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hmm could it be the ram or gpu?,this is interesting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you think there will be supply shortages again?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so you really want new gpu and also new cpu?,"my point was to upgrade only 980ti to 3080 and keep your 8gen cpu for while, its not bottleneck for games",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"don't think so, idk what's going on with your frames.",i have a 1080ti and  9700k and when i play csgo i always hit a wall at 157fps and it dips below 157 at times so sometimes shit doesn't make any sense and there's likely a weird solution to it somewhere but you should be hitting 200fps easily with your rig in valorant based off benchmarks i looked at on youtube.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for zen4 cpus?,yeah there's kinda high probability for that because amds production capacities aren't huge and there will be massive demand for zen4 as many people are waiting for it and amd has high popularity.,"(it already happened for both zen2 and zen3)

for intel cpus?",no because intel has massive manufacturing capacity.,for gpus?,"well might be, but not more than a few months and it should be very possible to get them on launch day.","there is no demand from miners now, miners made 70% of the demand for gpus.","also most of new gpus will be priced high, and power draw above 300w which repels some people from buying.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i noticed this too.,so many hypocrites around.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there's nothing inherent about avx-512 which makes it guzzle more power.,"you can make an implementation of it that is slower if you want, depending on your needs.","the primary advantage of avx-512 is increased flexibility, which is why it's so nice even when you're doing 256 or 128 bit operations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i dont think the core design was the problem for avx 512. i could be wrong, but afaik it was due to too much heat",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
avx512 is literally less hot than avx2 on 12th gen. the issue is that the e-cores can't run avx512 and there's no easy way to ensure that the e-cores don't accidentally get given avx512 code.,so intel just disabled avx512 on the p-cores too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i re-watched it.,"the fact you were able to enter the bios = the computer was running, booting up, the whole time.",just the monitor didn't display it.,could also be a cable problem but the fact that the monitor was fine after entering bios to me still screams power problem.,"it could be that you are over-drawing from the wall / surge protector - when the computer first boots it likes to run at 100%, leaving nothing for the monitor to power itself.","then when you reach the bios, the computer settles back down to its idle state, allowing the monitor's power adapter to get what it needs and actually display that bios.","it'll be up to you to test and confirm, though.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'm using win 11 (home edition) since january.,"so far i can point out several annoying points:

* no drag-n-drop files on a task bar.","* stupid start menu layout, where half of the menu is taken by favourites.",and when you turn those off... it's just a blank slate where you can't place any shortcuts.,* there was a problem with increased cpu usage because of widgets menu.,had turn them off via command prompt.,i think it's been fixed since.,* other minor inconviniences like additional click to show full right button menu or sound+network combo (i mean really...,wtf?),overall: if you're ok with alder lake performance on win 10 - stick with it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
definitely stick to windows 10. i previously used windows 11 for a few months and it was not a good experience.,"constant bugs, glitches, and compatibility issues.","especially for gaming and schoolwork, stick to windows 10 for the best results.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you should be on windows 11 if you are using 12th gen intel especially.,w11 uses p/e-cores very effectively.,"i've been using w11 for a long time now and it's perfectly stable it's a great os, there is literally nothing wrong with it -- anyone telling you that w11 is a ""beta"" or ""broken"" is an idiot.",people can (rightly) criticize new design choices or functionality changes but unstable it is not and you should not be hesitating to upgrade with a 12th gen cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"windows 10 wonâ€™t fully utilize your cpu because it doesnâ€™t have the updated scheduler from windows 11.  thatâ€™s important because your 12th gen cpu has both efficiency and performance cores, which windows 10 is not even aware of.",also compatibility is better with windows 11 these days and will keep getting better because it is the current version.,windows 10 compatibility will only continue to get worse.,"please donâ€™t listen to people saying to stay on an old os when it will just make it more difficult to upgrade later, which you will inevitably need to do regardless.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i still think the i3-12100 is worth $25 more.,it's an absolute monster and a big step on from the 10100. but i guess if you're counting every dollar the 10th gen still does a decent job.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have both a 5600x and a 10100f and while there is a difference in cpu intensive games itâ€™s hardly worth 3x the money.,the 10100f is a beast!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's most likely the cpu cooler as the cpu itself doesn't have any moving/mechanical parts.,try to dust it off with a clean and dry brush or a can of compressed air.,also a photo of the cooler would be helpful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"based on your other comments, i'm starting to wonder if it's some sort of coil wine from the vrms, perhaps it's failing and is no longer able to supply the cpu enough power.",can you list your full system specs?,it's hard to diagnose without knowing what parts your pc is using.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
note: this starts to happen after about 15 minutes after iâ€™ve turn in the pc.,itâ€™s fine before that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is the fan stuck or rubbing on something?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is the first i hear of a cpu making a noise... are you sure it's the cpu and not any of the motherboard smds buzzing (inductors)?,or maybe the gpu/hard drive?,any of the fans?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you were running that hot youâ€™d be screaming too!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mechanical hard drive ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™ve cleaned it all through and it still makes the noise,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and would the cooler itself make the pc run really slow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1080 graphics card
i7 9700k

no the fans are fine.,iâ€™ve stopped the fans while the noise is happening and itâ€™s not coming from any of them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i put my ear in everything while it was making the noise and it was coming from the cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes the cooler it self is the issue.,probably the mounting mechanism broke or something and now it does not cool the cpu sufficiently.,that cause the cpu to over heat and throttle performance.,and the cpu cooler goes haywire due to the high temp,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just for the sake of testing, when you have time, can you take the gpu out and use the onboard igp?",to see if the noise still happens?,just to make sure the screeching noise is indeed coming around the cpu area.,another thing you can try is install hwinfo64 and monitor the temps the vrms reach when the noise happens.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you have stopped all the fans and still the noice persists, then it could be from 3 things, gpu fans, power supply or motherboard chipset fan.",maybe.,need more info,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there are motherboard surface components *near* the cpu that are under different load depending on the cpu's load (the components responsible for delivering its power).,"it could be heavy coil whine from them, look up some ""pc coil whine"" samples to see if it matches the sound you're hearing.",also if you're using an aio cooler it could be the water pump propeller on top of the cpu.,easy way to know is if you use a long tube and carefully listen through it from exactly where the sound is coming from.,listening with your ear only can be deceiving.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
could be bad bearings in the fan as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so a new fan would be recommended then?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you go on my page my newish video will show you what sound itâ€™s making.,i couldnâ€™t post it in this thread,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that alone wouldn't cause thermal throttling unless it's so bad that fan can't even spin properly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"while the pc is running, if you carefully stop the fan from spinning and the noise goes away, i would explore a new new fan or a new cooler.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well may i know what cooler you are currently using ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if what kiloswiss said is happening to you the  better buy a new cooler.,air coolers are nice.,"vetroo v5, noctua nhu 12s redux, be quite pro 4, syth fuma etc etc.","if you want another aio, then anything from artic is fine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that sounds like a faulty pump.,"you're using an aio and the pump is directly on top of the cpu, hence why you can hear it from there.",it can't move the hot water to the radiators so your cpu is most likely overheating and throttling to prevent any damage.,you'll need a new cpu cooler if the other suggestion to try shake it around to remove any trapped air bubbles doesn't work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
only suggested from experience.,"i have had bearings go bad in a cpu fan and start making noise like that, but the bearings went bad in a way that the fan was running at maybe half speed tops.",was vibrating to all hell as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
could you go on my page and check the newest video i just posted.,thatâ€™s the sound.,couldnâ€™t post here for some reason,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also i stopped the fans and it still makes the noise,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
^ this!,in op's video it sounds like a pump failure.,"https://www.reddit.com/r/pchelp/comments/vcy5mm/why_is_my_pc_making_this_noise_its_coming_from/

makes sense.,"but turns out the op has an aio, lol :-)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh goodness... that is a very strange noise!,i wonder if it might be your vrms (voltage regulation modules) it sounds a bit like your cpu might be trying to throttle up (and thus pull more power) and then failing to because of a possibly faulty vrm and throttling back (hence the noise coming and going).,"other than that, i have no clue where a noise like that would come from.","if you know how on your board, i would highly suggest checking your voltages in your bios and seeing if anything is off.","though, to that point i am not entirely sure where you could find common voltage values to compare to for your specific cpu and board configuration.","i suppose a failing psu could cause a similar problem, however usually if a psu if failing the system would either not work at all or have other glaring issues besides just being slow.","i wish you luck, friend.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my system has air coolers.,isnâ€™t a pump only on water coolers?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i should note that if it is possibly a power related problem, i would not use the pc if you have another option to get you by.","if it is a power related issue, continuing to use the device could cause irreparable damage to the cpu and possibly other components such as your memory and graphics cards.","i know that's probably not what you want to hear, but it's better to be safe than sorry.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that's curious.,"i suppose that sound could be the chip in the fan that is interpreting the pwm signal from the motherboard, however, i think my comment about power might still stand here as it is a possibility that your temperature sensor is reporting invalid data due to improper voltage.","i usually would never suggest this, but for troubleshooting sake, have you tried unplugging the cpu fan from the motherboard while the pc is running?","please don't leave it unplugged for very long, your cpu has built in over-temp protections but it's better not to rely on them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5600x looks faster in csgo.,12600k is even faster fwiw.,https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2022-intel-core-i7-12700k-i5-12400f-review?page=3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
amd has done a lot of work to optimize their 5000 series processors for cs:go specifically so that should be the one to go for if that's the only game you play.,otherwise the 12400f is the better option.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[removed],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>12600k is even faster fwiw.,is it?,those benchmarks are extremely thorough!,"in mean average though, a 5600x vs 12600k gets:

&#x200b;

|cpu|mean avg @ 1080p|mean avg @ 1440p|mean avg @ 4k|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|5600x|337.9 fps|330.05 fps|309.72 fps|
|12600k|305.16 fps|299.60 fps|298.56 fps|

&#x200b;

the only place a 12600k beats the 5600x is in highest 1% (which i imagine is a split second of looking directly at the ground) and lowest 1%.","as a matter of fact, the only intel cpu that beats the 5600x in mean average is the 12900k!",i think cs:go specifically is one of those games the really enjoys the extra ryzen cache.,"either way, both are good chips.",both will average well over 240fps so you can't go wrong unless you're trying to max out a 360hz monitor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes - i was a bit surprised actually.,i think it has to do with the cache - 5600/5600x has a significantly larger cache.,you could save a few bucks on the amd side by going 5600 (no-x) if it's available in your area.,it's got 5% lower clock speeds (so \~ 3-5% lower performance) and that's it.,"i think in games overall the 5600x is a little bit faster than 12400/12400f, but not by a lot:  [https://www.techpowerup.com/review/intel-core-i5-12400f/16.html](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/intel-core-i5-12400f/16.html) 

some may argue amd vs intel for upgrades later.",right now both have somewhat limited upgrade paths.,"on the amd side you can go to 5800x3d for amazing 8-core gaming performance (=12900k/12900ks), or 5950x for 16 cores in the future.",5800x3d also doesn't care that much about super fast ram.,"on the intel platform - you will be able to upgrade to 13th gen which adds a great deal of cache later, and these chips should compete well enough (within 5-10%) of zen 4 coming out later this year.",13600k/13700k should be serious beasts later this year.,good luck!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for a competitive fps - 1% low is the most important metric.,that said i agree both are pretty darn fast in this game..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe the fans aren't actually working,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you tried a repaste?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh no, the fan definitely works, it sounds like a jet engine all the time.","it blows hot air too, so the problem must be the cpu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i did, i used the arctic mx-4 i had lying around and it didn't make a difference to the idle temperatures.","the only thing that changed were temperatures under load, those seemed to have gone down by maybe 5 degrees.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if it's that loud, the fan is probably damaged, if the heat's not from the cpu, it's probably from the battery.",i'd see about replacing the battery and fan.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the fan might be damaged actually, it ramps up randomly and, after a heavy workload, it won't slow down along with the cpu temperature decreasing, a system reboot is always necessary.","as for the battery, it's dead, and i can feel the heat only where the processor and cooling assembly are located",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do the fan first,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gotcha!,i'd try that and also just making sure the airway is clear of blockage.,"sounds like it's just time for a new machine though, i know easier said then done stuffs expensive.","maybe give onlyfans a try for solving this fan problem, i've heard it's a good site.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no you're right actually, this thing belongs in the landfill right now.","i might try onlyfans though, for the fan issue, i heard they specifically specialize in fans, if you catch my drift",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bequiet dark rock 4 or scythe fuma 2 rev.,"b.

both very decent air coolers.",should also be alright for the 12700 non-k version.,"if you plan on going with the 12700k, check out the beefier dark rock 4 pro from bequiet or noctua's nh-d15.",dark rock 4 pro and noctua nh-d15 are among the best air coolers on the market right now.,"the bequiet is usually cheaper and tends to perform minimally better at the same noise levels, but the noctua has a bit more performance if you are willing to turn the fan all the way up and an easier mounting mechanism.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah if your amb is at 30c (mine is between 28 and 33 during the summer) it struggles a bit over 200-220watt.,at winter with ambient at around 20c its perfectly fine.,"i ran with an undervolt, peaks at 190w during cbr23, so temps are below 80 even with 30c ambient.",during the winter i remember it could handle up to 270-280watts without throttling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

with that said, youd get similar performance with the much cheaper ak620 or fuma2, so if you don't really care about the size consider those 2 as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you won't have any issues fitting an nh-d15 or any other large air cooler on that board.,"my guess is that the sagging issue is probably more due to the gpu than the board, if the gpu doesn't have a high-quality backplate to help stabilize it.",you can probably prop it up front underneath.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

are you actually using liquid metal as your interface material between the ihs and cold plate?,that should be fine as long as your cold plate isn't aluminum.,"however, you need to make sure you have a very good spread before applying the cooler.","also, because liquid metal isn't exactly usable as a thermal ""paste"", any ihs bending incurred by the lga 1700 socket will likely have a pretty large impact on thermals.","i'd suggest either replace your socket to prevent ihs bending, or (if you're not very experienced with liquid metal) just use normal thermal paste.",normal thermal paste is much easier to apply properly and won't cause any real issues even if done incorrectly.,liquid metal will,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you need more fans.,if iâ€™m understanding you correctly this means the only airflow is going out the back of your case.,if you add an intake fan to the side or the top so air flows over your cpu and out the back exhaust fan itâ€™s gonna make a bid difference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh thats neat that they combine it all into one plug, sure wouldve saved me the headache of routing all my cables for my ek aio.","with what we know about possible socket bending, you may see better results with standard paste over liquid metal.","i use arctic mx-5, though and good paste from a reputable brand should do the trick.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there are many things that can change your idle temps.,surface area of the aio really helps with heat soak but fan speed/performance matters as well for dissipating that heat.,not to mention what case your using can matter a lot too.,i have the same cpu as you and it's best not to expect degree for degree vs what you see in benchmarks.,as long as you're not going into the 90s when doing some light/medium loads it's probably fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah ppl with high end pc coolers that probably dropped a g on water ccooling my guy, but to the average joe those are normal temps.",so unless yu have the money to invest in water cooling or some crazy ass aio with a giant radiator.,its gonna cost u well over 500 $ .,"i have water cooling aio from corsair an my temps just broswing are like 30-35c , gaming never goes above 60c",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"it's bad from technical standpoint as you only get readout of fans rpm and you drive pump and fans with pwm simultaneously, which means you either get no 0 rpm mode on fans or you constantly have high rpm (and loudness) in order to not kill the pump.",it's necessary to split the control anyway.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i can't yet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the ilm is what causes the bending.,it's a larger ihs (which has a larger surface area = needs more pressure) but they didn't put a better quality ilm to hold down the cpu (like the ones we saw on the x-series cpus where it holds down the cpu on all sides).,with the amount pressure being used to hold down the cpu at just those 2 points of contact is what's making it bend.,"with the washer mod, it raises the ilm so that it doesn't clamp down on the cpu with as much pressure, but problem with that is that on some motherboards, the cpu is no longer making full contact with all the pins, which caused some to get a ram error.",this isn't as much of an issue with some coolers of convex coldplates like the asetek coolers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm using an antec df800 since heat goes up my radiator is on the top and blow the warm air,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

a good point.,i do much rather prefer seeing my pump knowing its actually running versus relying on an obscured controller.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you have any solution on how to split that then ?,i heard someone in the comments saying he had some issues caus the fans and pomp were on the same header,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there can be some bending with the 1700 socket yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no problem.,it performed 1â°c better than the washer mod for me.,i'm just hoping that the frame will eventually somewhat fix the bent ihs my cpu now has.,"i installed my cpu for about a month before the news about the bending ihs came out, and i applied the washer mod.","but it was already too late and my ihs was already bent, there was a thick puddle of thermal paste concentrated in the center area of the cpu.",arctic liquid freezers have a flat coldplate so the temperature decreased by 7â°c for me.,i'm also running an asus motherboard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dont worry man.,its not gonna get damaged unless u run it 24/7 at 95+c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i mean yeah, but like i said to the average joe thats normal , the only way yur getting crazy cooling temps like this is with liquid cooling.","i mean its almost impossible for a aio cooling block to keep yur cpu temps cool enough when yur cpu is drawing idk probably anywhere from 150 to 200 watts depending on yur cpu, thats alot of power draw man things are gonna get hot , unless u have this giant ass case that costed u probably a grand alone then to put in like 12 fans including one or two exhausts, an all liquid cooling, that the only way yur gonna get cool temps like that.","like not to be a dick but u do know power/electric/ wattage, it gets hot anything with power draw gets hot an unless u have some high tech cooling setup with a giant case with perfect air flow.",but yur fine dude yur temps are fine.,"i think u should be happy with those temps, an maybe start worrying about when yur cpu temps reach 90-95 just playing or browsing.","i mena havenâ€™t u ever wondered why computer rooms an server rooms have crazy a/c cooling setups , its because things get fricken hot an need the best cooling solution, that being exposed pc parts in a clean room with a/c cranking the room to 40 degrees fâ€™, i mean u could try going into the bios an just put everything to full speed an see if that helps, but depending on yur fans that u have , its probably gonna be loud an annoying.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ah, i didn't realize the bend was already there.",i took my cpu out 1 month later to add the washer mod and my cpu had this massive bend in it.,i don't lap my cpu or anything so i didn't bother checking if it was curved from the factory.,i eventually found that i could buy thermalright's bending corrector frame for under $10 ($7-8) on aliexpress.,"thermal grizzly also came out with one as well, looks like it's priced at $36 at titanrig (currently sold out).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if you already have 9th gen i9 you dont need upgrade especially if mostly you do is gaming,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"based on pure raw power, the i9 9900k is better then an i5 of 10th/11th gen, and it has almost the same power of an i7 10700k.","the i7 11700k is a strange one, but is for sure a bit more powerful then the 9900k.","but the i5 12600k is very strong and more efficent then the old i9 9900k, and the i7 12700k is even faster.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they newer models are better, however the 9th gen i9 is still a powerful cpu, it did not become weaker just because better cpu released, my advise is to wait a little longer before upgrading , unless your are cpu bound in games which is highly doubtful with 9900k and 1440p for example, always upgrade when you need to upgrade not when you want to upgrade , also i am hearing and reading really good things about the 13th gen cpus , better wait unless you have to",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™m in the same boat as you right now, wait till 13th gen before you upgrade, it will probably be actually worth it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"9th gen i9 = 10th gen i7 roughly (10700k a few % faster)

you got it backwards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its what most people think.,and they use stock cooler or a cheap cooler and a cheap video card.,then they complain here that their 12900k is idling at 60c and fps is low for an i9 like its not the video card that runs the game.,why do you think the 119000k sold units?,because it says i9 on the box.,doesnt matter its an i7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 9900k is basically a 10700k, which is basically an 11600k, which is basically a 12400.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12600k is even better than 11900k so...12th gen is a big step up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
alright.,part of me wants to upgrade but i donâ€™t really care to spend the 500+ on a cpu and motherboard for an 12th gen i9.,so if i went with a 12th gen i5 or i7 iâ€™m assuming that upgrade would be worth it if iâ€™m not wrong?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so the newer gen are better no matter if itâ€™s a i5 or i7?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on what cpu you are running right now.,the i9 9900k for example is still a great cpu and should probably hold on a little while longer.,"but let's say you're rocking an i5 8600k, then you'd benefit more from the multi threaded performance bump that alder lake has brought, and that is before we get into the single threaded performance gains.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i3 1220p is a hyerthreaded 2 p core with 8 e cores.,i3 1215u is a hyperthreaded 2 p core with 4 e cores.,"the igpu is the same, so it comes down to whether or not the e cores are worth it for you.",personally would go with the i3 1220p.,also the i3 1215u is rated for 15 watts while the i3 1220p is rated for 28 watts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"battery life will be similar on both with similar usage, so get the 1220p.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"battery life will mostly depend on the battery capacity and screen, while very slightly affected by boost power draw.","there are 1220p laptops configured for maximum 28w boost, and others with 64w.","similar for the 1215u, some laptops will adhere to a 12w limit, and others will boost to 55w.",the reason is that.,the reason why is because the highest boost frequency of these chips requires a lot more power than their rated tdp.,"in essence, i'd focus on battery capacity and a small screen if battery life is a concern.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am primarily confused with the battery life.,how much of a difference will it make and if the extra performance (from a long term perspective) is worth the the battery life trade off,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"here is the thing, p&e configurations is a great idea.","but at the end of the day you're stuck with 2 p cores and 4 e cores in 2022.

should really go with 2 p and 8 e if you plan to use this laptop for years to come.",it doesn't really matter if you are a heavy user or not; because the software you use is only going to become more resource intensive.,as far as battery life is concerned.,just make sure the laptop you're getting comes with a 40whr+ battery and run your laptop in power saving mode when you're just doing regular day to day tasks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if maximum boost power is the same?,probably the p-model as it has more cores to utilize that power effectively.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah like i said itâ€™s my first real pc build i wasnâ€™t really into it with the intention of oc so itâ€™s not something i looked into heavily when i got the board but no i was not aware of this thank you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you know if the noctua dh15 would fit my build?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you know, z690 isnâ€™t all about oc, it also allows you to *undervolt* your cpu for better cooling.","will require some skills, though, never did it myself, just a heads-up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your case manual or spec sheet should list the maximum height.,and the d15 specs list its real height.,"iirc itâ€™s 165 mm, so any case with bigger clearance will do.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i donâ€™t think overclocking or my board will be an issue i just donâ€™t know how to go about cooling i have a 3080 ti icx3 ultra hybrid which has its own cooling system if that helps any i was planning on air cooling so i didnâ€™t have 2 radiators to deal with,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i run one of the shittiest 3080 tis with a stock cooler no problems, even at stock settings.","and my airflow isnâ€™t even that great (not terrible either, though).","edit: damn, i misread your comment.",your card already comes with an aio.,"well, just put an nh-d15 or, better yet, nh-d15s on your cpu then.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes it should work should i get more than the 3 fans that came with it?,probably not something you would know unless youâ€™ve had the case but worth the ask.,my case should have more than enough room didnâ€™t even think to read the manual im not very smart.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
case fans are kind of hard to figure out until you actually try.,i had a lot of pain trying to make it both quiet and efficient.,the only way i was able to figure out is keep trying until you make it.,"i can recommend getting a second 120 mm fan for the nh-d15s, though, like the nf-a12x25.","unlike the usual non-s d15, it's optimized for better gpu and ram clearance and comes with only one 140 mm fan.",adding a second intake 120 mm one preserves that ram clearance and drops a few degrees without making it noticeably louder.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
youâ€™ve been a real help thank you so much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is the nh-u12a worth it?,looks like itâ€™s smaller than the nh-d15s but more expensive?,and has the 2nd fan like the regular nah-d15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the u12a is a new model that looks very promising, but i haven't any personal experience with it, and it looks to me that the d15 series is still a little bit more efficient.",i'm currently using a d15s for my 5600x and plan to do the same for my next 12700k build.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
im using the u12a on a 12900k.,it's perfectly fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i honestly might do the u15a for the size difference i donâ€™t think the little efficiency difference would impact me in any way and i donâ€™t want it to overhang on my motherboard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good to know thank you!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
personally i would recommend you focus on negotiating a higher grade rather than the base pay.,"in general, if you have 5 yoe with a bachelors you should be able to justify a grade 6, with a masters you should be able to justify a grade 7. if you were a grade 7 equivalent at micron then i would push for a 7 at intel.","don't worry too much about the base pay, it's adjusted every year and it gets reset when you get promoted.","promos are much harder to come by than base pay adjustments, so if you can negotiate to a grade 7 then that'll make a huge difference on your long term career development.","i don't know the exact job role you're being offered, but for a generic hardware role i would expect a base pay of $120-125k for a grade 7.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in pheonix?,intel is a good company and has good annual raises and promotions and a decent work enviroment if you dont mind the stair natzis making sure you have a hand on the rail.,"now if its your dream job that goes into play as well and it depends on where the job is and if its salary or hourley, (hourly is better because they will work you 60 to 80 hours a week)  but i would say its not reasonable to start, but 110k is a bit high, maybe 98 to 100k would be reasonable.",they will always low ball you expecting negotiations.,"now if they come back with a firm price lower than what you want you can always try to negotiate more time off or work from home, or car allowance if its remote work due to your 5 years micron experience, they are competetors in the job market.","take it from someone with over 40 years engineering experience, time off is better than money, but money is always king.","always remember its easier to negotiate if you are still employed by micron, play it like you could take it or leave it, you are still employed at a real good company if it doesn't work out with intel, they are on the hook, reel them in.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my dude, ur being lowballed as fuck.",this should be a hard pass.,either u completely flopped ur interviews or intel started playing a very dirty game.,ms+5 yoe is an easy grade 6 if not a 7 with base as low as 110k.,dont forget ur eligible for rsu grant of several tens of thousands of dollars upon hire over 3 years and a sign on bonus at these grades.,unless ur degree is in botany or some weird shit lol then ur being lowballed for a reason.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
grade 8 here.,i had g7 at bs + 5 yoe.,g8 at bs + 7 yoe.,g5 is a ncg/rcg role.,how bad was your interview?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i made grade 7 after an internship and 5 years of service (hired after internship as grade 5).,you should be at least grade 6 with your experience.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i feel it's harder to negotiate for grade 7 than higher base pay.,i noticed that almost all the team members are having a phd degree in the same role.,i only got a master degree though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it really depends on how the interview went.,yoe means nothing if he can't demonstrate the knowledge at the interview.,"trying to make 90k base after 5yoe is also embarrassing, even 125k is stupid low in this market.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in hillsboro.,i left micron for master study.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my degree is totally matched, rsu is included inside my first offer, but i never heard about sign off bonus.",is sign on bonus only applicable for grade 7 and above?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks for sharing, but i am not sure if my micron working experience is recognized by intel or not?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
masters + 5 yoe = grade 7 easily.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"phds start at grade 7, but it's certainly possible to get to grade 7 with a masters + 5 yoe.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
suggest to check the website â€œlevels.fyiâ€ for the grade -to-pay scale at intel.,"at intel, masters + 5 yoe is a grade 7â€¦if not, atleast a grade 6.
you might have been offered the grade 5 by hr if they assumed you just graduated from your masters and have no industry experience.",you can send an email to the recruiter explaining the yoe and reference a few websites including glassdoor and levels,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no its not for g7 and above and micron sure as hell considered as yoe.,"it is part of the negotiated comp and applicable to everyone iirc (especially in todays market)

whats the rsu grant ur given?",is it over 3 years?,any case ur being lowballed.,play hardball and tell them to significantly raise the bar.,at least g6 and significantly higher base and add a sign on bonus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ya, this is what i understand as most of grade 5 engineer at intel get promoted to grade 7 after \~ 5 years of service.",but not sure if my micron working experience is recognized or not?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, i already sent an email to the hr.","i noticed that the hiring manager did not interview me before, guess he might not know my yoe.",but i am worry if they recall the offer as they might just want a fresh graduate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rsu given is 10k in 3 yrs.,"i am outside of us, so a bit of cosy for them to do visa and relocation for me.",not sure if they consider these cost to cut down my pay to compensate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the likelihood is low for a job offer to be rescinded.,you can ask to speak to the hiring manager as well.,usually they do the first phone screen (after the first recruiter call) so surprised the hiring manager never spoke to you.,congrats on the job offer nonetheless and good luck :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ahh well that changes everything.,ur dependent on them for visa well no wonder theyre lowballing u. u could still negotiate and push for better rsu/signon/relo package and for sure h deserve a higher grade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks, it's a big department with many hiring managers.",the one that i mentioned seems my supervisor at intel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
100c is when the chip starts throttling.,note that even if it throttles this does not damage the cpu.,the cpu will not allow itself to be damaged by heat.,are you using the stock cooler?,"that would be pretty standard temperatures for that, a better cooler would help things greatly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why are people obsessed with temperatures in this sub,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> the cpu will not allow itself to be damaged by heat.,unless you have a board that raises the tjmax by default.,"i once degraded a 10900k because i was testing a cheap cooler on it and did a 30 minute stress test and i didn't realize the evga board i had raised tjmax to 125c

i came back to the computer completely frozen, and afterwards i had to reduce all-core speeds by 100mhz otherwise it wasn't stable",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i know this is possible, but why would any company make that a default setting?",might as well just pump 2 volts into the core and be done with it :/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

evga only makes overclocking oriented motherboards these days.,"with the dark series basically being only for extreme overclocking, not something a normal consumer should buy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think i might switch to 12600k but get a better cooler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
newer doesnâ€™t necessarily mean more expensive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"part of the cost might be that it isnâ€™t made anymore and if someone needs to replace their cpu but doesnâ€™t want to replace their mobo, then they might be willing to pay a premium to avoid replacing other parts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"buy 12th gen, they are even cheaper and more powerful than the 11th gen you are talking about.",kinda stupid but that's how the world is working so better take advantage of it while you can.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if your board is fine, just get a 9900k, and you'll get basically the performance of a 10700k which is more than enough for a couple more years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 9700k is around $200 on ebay, about 2/3rds of a 11900k.",you shouldn't be paying much more than that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is no i9 9700k i believe.,only i7.,the 11900k is obviously better.,but the 12th gen parts are cheaper,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's cause it didn't sell well.,they are trying to get rid of there left over stock,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"with a socket change every two generations, thousands of users with i3 and i5 systems are looking for a simple upgrade.",prices of (used) intel chips do not come down.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i heard that it had something to do with crypto mining, since it got its greatest boost around the time 8th and 9th gen were out.","a lot of mining motherboards use lga 1151,which has kept the demand for these cpus up.","and since they're not being made, that pushes up the price.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so the 11900k is better than the 9700k?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
absolutely.,but the 12600k is better than an 11900k and should be even cheaper.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with amd and intel at each others necks trying to out preform each other why would one of them put out a new product that is slower then their last?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh right okay thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 12600k is amazing.,"i have it in my computer and it rocks, solid as a rock",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"11900k was slower than 10900k, there's a reason 11th gen is so hated",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"do note that you will need a new mobo for 12600k or any 12th gen

12400 will probably be fine depending on how you use it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have mine overclocked to 5.3/4.0/4.2, gets around 20,500 cinebench score",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
like a rock!,oohhhhhh like a rock!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think it's pretty much a wash. 3d center meta analysis of 15 reviews puts it at like 3 percent slower in application than the 10900k and 5 percent faster in gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"11th gen desktop had a lot of new things: new core architecture with higher ipc, pcie 4,...........

11400 and 11700 were not as bad as 11900k",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tell me you are a dumb techtuber devotee without telling me you are a dumb techtuber devotee.,the 11900k has much faster ipc that it matches the 10 cores highly threaded workload with only 8 cores... in the same time of having pcie4 and 4 more lanes and a much better imc.,"if you want productivity and core count, go for amd.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
only because they had to transition to a new architecture.,they never intended to scale skylake to 10 cores and that kind of bit them in the backside with rocketlake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i've been sort of out of the loop regarding win11 news and stuff for the past few months.,i remember that -back then- some builds of windows10 had issues with the scheduler and the e-core/p-core architecture.,i suppose this is fixed now?,i'm genuinely consider buying a 12th gen cpu for either my productivity laptop or for my professional office workstation.,-i'd update to win11 without much remorse if our in-house tools and softwares would work flawlessly.,"however, working on a game engine dating from 2002~2003 doesn't help and as such we're locked with win10 for a fair amount of time until we update our whole pipeline.-

a linear voltage regulator works by introducing a variable resistance to the circuit to reduce voltage over the high power draw part in question.,you're essentially burning power in the dlvr to reduce the voltage over the circuit.,"while this might sound counter-intuitive, power consumption will actually improve slightly, as the increase in power draw from the introduced resistance is lower than the reduction in power draw of the integrated circuit.",you can verify this for yourself with basic high school physics using ohm's law.,"still, there's probably a reason for that 40a limit, as a higher current draw will make the dlvr run hotter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

came here to say this.,i am a senior software dev who plays valorant in his free time and ranked in immo 3.,5800x is a beast!,the cache memory is so good.,it even destroys the new 13400 easily.,13400 has only got 20mb cache memory and basically 6 cores.,those 4 efficient cores are not adding much to it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is upgrade path of 5800,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm using a 6750xt + 5800x, 32gb 3800mhz, 1440p 144hz, it's seriously good, you won't regret getting a 5800x, i only game too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you can get more cores with the 5900x or 5950x, or a huge increase in cache with the 5800x3d.","if this is for gaming, the 12400 will almost certainly give you a better upgrade path in terms of giving you access to the biggest gaming performance improvement once the socket is eol.","that said, if that's something you care about, you'll need to make sure to spend enough on the motherboard to get something decent that can support the higher-wattage cpus.","if you don't care about ever upgrading your cpu, an entry-level b660 board should be fine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hi, well if you are planning to stream while playing, i think you can get away with 9700k.",especially if you use nvidia nvenc to stream your gameplay.,you should not have trouble.,but it would be nice to have more ram in that case.,plus i think that motherboard should be able to handle the i9.,as long as you have appropriate cooling for it.,edit: you have enough ram.,i thought you had only 16. my bad.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"depends on what you're planning on streaming but as the other comment has mentioned, if you use nvenc to stream, you don't need to worry too much about the cpu.",i would even say your current system is enough for even the latest games at reasonable settings.,you'll be more held back by the stream platform's bitrate limit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"maybe try to stream with these specs first before making any purchase, chances are you'll be just fine, nvenc is great and barely takes any resources.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so would the 9900k be fine to get and wouldn't start throttling like i heard others say ?,"i do only have the one pc setup, and tried nvenc for a few streams but not much difference.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i mainly stream multiplayer games (fps, mmo) and latest games.","used nvenc for a few streams but not much changed, so i wanted a new cpu to be able to handle everything more efficiently then now",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have been streaming for years now.,"only thing that holds me back is my cpu reaching around 90-100%c when streaming, and multiplayer games tend to stutter (not all the time, just every now and then).",used nvenc for a few streams and not much improved,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so even after using nvenc you have experienced fps loss ?,"and yes, cpu will throttle, expecte to lose 10% performance.",you can try to mitigate it buy useing an aio from artic cooler that have a small fan for the vrm.,360mm aio.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"reading your other comment, is the cpu still maxing out on all cores when streaming via nvenc?",that doesn't sound right if that's the case.,"are you using streamlabs, obs or another streaming software?","i use obs with nvenc, bitrate at cbr 6000kbps, desktop connected to the router via ethernet, and it hardly touches my cpu, so only the game will stress it out.","you might want to fully list your stream settings and if you're streaming via wired or wireless, just in case it's something else causing the stuttering when streaming.",maybe even add some game examples too for others to test with.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm gonna stick with my noctua nh-d15s, until i upgrade next.","also, 10% sounds like quite a bit.","how would that impact overtime, make it overall go slower or?","would the 9700k be the same % drop, or is it because of the hyperthreading causing it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i use obs at 4500kbps, and am on a wired connection.","not all cores maxing out, mostly just one.","slobs was never good to my pc so stopped using it

when i streamed elden ring, for instance, it went between 30-45fps very commonly.","didn't get an encoding overload error on obs, however",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hyper threading is not the cause.,"its the power profile intel set for that chip to be the ""best gaming cpu"" back in 2018 i believe.","plus its 14nm, so you know.","and no, even with a loss of 10%, you will still see an improvement.",you can always under clock the cpu.,"2% less performance but temps under control

edit: you can check a video by gamers nexus of the 9900k streaming benchmark",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what about gpu usage?,is that maxing out too?,install something like hwinfo64 or hwmonitor and see what clock speed that maxed out core is running at.,also might want to check temperatures too in case the cooler you're using isn't keeping up.,you haven't mentioned what cpu cooler you're using as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

noctua nh-d15s is the cooler that i am currently using.,listed it in the specs bit in my original post,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my bad, missed it out.",should be more than enough to cool the 8700 and any 9th gen cpu you want to upgrade to if needed.,"check the temps first though when you're gaming + streaming, and the clock speeds the cpu is reaching, upgrading may not help much if the game uses only a couple of cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for the help!,"really do appreciate it

only wanted the upgrade because i feel as if the 8700 is bringing things down a bit, and having the upgrade would definitely help out until i decide to build a new machine.","will definitely check the temps and see what happens, because when i open task manager and see the high usage it worries be a bit",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this question comes up a bit, and intel is very vague on the matter, but no one ever seems to come back with a verified answer.",1080p @ 144hz is possible.,"however, i have never seen reports of anyone running 1440p higher than 120hz on integrated graphics.",note that you will definitely need to use displayport as intelâ€™s hdmi capabilities are not as extensive/supported.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
update - i got a business monitor that run it at 1440p 75hz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i googled around and can't find any answer.,"i was like surely there are many gamers with intel cpu with integrated graphic, thought people would know.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i run 170hz 1440p on old work laptop with 8th gen and with 12600k... both of these don't have dgpu.,it's all up to bandwidth (the lower number which can produce either processor or your dp/typec/hdmi generation port).,hdmi is limiting factor usually (on monitor side too).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i assume youâ€™re talking about store pricing, since intelâ€™s official pricing is $25 less.","($384 vs $409)

because the k is a higher volume part?",very often the k will be on sale cheaper than the kf.,iâ€™m not sure why people are so gung ho to save a few bucks on the kf and lose out on having a backup gpu for testing.,"i kind of think some folks think the â€œfâ€ means itâ€™s better or â€œfasterâ€, not merely a k with a â€œfâ€ailed igpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
definitely get the k and not the of.,even if the difference is 25 usd.,having an internal gpu in cpu is great addition.,and for 7 usd difference this is literally now a no brainer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"k have a ""gpu"" built in, the kf don't.",as for price difference that's subjective to the retailer.,"take it from a kf user, get the k - there are many issues with csm causing dp ports not to work out there on nvidia 900-3000 gpu's & modern monitors, the firmware patch doesn't always work.","of course if you run into the problem on a kf you can always enable csm to fix it, assuming you can get bios screen to show up on hdmi port, or swapping to a k processor & using that.",(long long story),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the regular k version for $7 more sounds like a no brainer.,"you get an additional troubleshooting tool/a backup gpu if you ever need it, and you also have access to quick sync if any of your software uses it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
coz both are the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no igpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in my case the kf was like 40â‚¬ cheaper.,also i got spare gtx980 in case my 3080 has any issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
f cpus are regular cpus where the igpu is defective.,"as the cpu die gets larger and the igpu takes a smaller fraction of the total area, relatively fewer defects will happen in the igpu and more in other areas.",thus intel will end up with relatively fewer 12700f cpus than 12100f cpus and so be able to charge more for them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the deal now for i7 is the 12700f which is is 100 usd cheaper than the 12700k, the 12700f have a all core boost of 4.5ghz which is good.",trying to overclock anything meaningful beyond that clocksppeed will need a nuclear reactor and a 280mm aio to cool it down.,not only u can save some money off the cooling you also can forget about the stupidly expensive z board because you won't need to overclock.,and assuming you'll be paring it with a nvidia gpu u can pretty much forget about the igpu because nvidia gpu comes with nvenc encoder which can pretty much replace intels quick syncs that requires a igpu to work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
buying a f sku makes sense on the super budget chips like 12100 or 12400 for price conscious builds  but yes i do agree that once you get into 12600k pricing that trying to save the 20 dollars for a 12600kf seems a little silly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this naming scheme always annoyed me, unlike amdâ€™s, which simply uses g for graphics.",now it finally makes sense.,it's failed!,"or fucked, up to personal taste.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
many of us have more than one gpu.,i have several.,from past generations of course.,i even still have a 680 in an old build.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'd read it, if you made a post about that particular issue you've had.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the only scenario it makes sense to go with a kf sku right now is if you're getting a 12900k but don't have the budget for a ks.,"because all 12900ks's have a working igpu, you're much less likely to find an impressive normal 12900k... but you could find a 12900kf that would have otherwise been a 12900ks if the igpu wasn't fucked.",same was true for the 9900kf because of the 9900ks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and you'll be able to test boot your new setup without moving gpu over yet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, i agree with that 100%.","at the budget end it makes sense where that $25 represents a bigger chunk of the actual cpu/system price (20% of a 12100), but for a 12900k youâ€™re saving a whopping 4.4%.","as someone with a long experience troubleshooting computers, when youâ€™re in that price bracket the convenience of having it far outweighs the minor cost savings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
amdâ€™s g series and intel using an f or non f isnt the same thing at all.,amdâ€™s g is a completely different chip altogether.,a 5700g is not just a 5700x with an igp.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you mean the 4k results?,they're gpu bound so the difference in cpu speed doesn't matter.,if you look at the 720 results the e cores are a lot slower than p cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
unfortunately this shows average fps only and not minimums.,also if they showed more complex games like flight simulator you'd see differences even at 4k on a 3080.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the cores are fine, the problem is power and heat - those cores might not use much power (and therefore not exude that much heat) but it's enough to rob budget from the p cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well yes lots if not most people are now playing at 4k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i play at 4k.,your statement is unfortunately incorrect.,"actual numbers from the steam hardware survey:

* 3% 2160p (4k)
* 10% 1440p
* 2% ultrawide 1440 / 1080
* 67% 1080p
* 4% 900p
* 7% 720p / 768p
* 7% other",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is so false.,"most people are most definitely not playing at 4k for pc

i would say most are playing at 1080p, a considerable amount at 1440p, and then a much smaller number at 4k.",this would also be reflected in recent steam surveys.,most people simply can't afford 4k monitors.,"even though they have been coming down in price recently, they are still very pricey.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's not about what you choose to play at but rather how fast the hardware is.,"if you don't care about how fast the cpu is there is no reason to buy alder lake at all, just stick with skylake or even sandy bridge.",put the resolution high enough and the gpu will be all that matters.,usually you look at 1440/4k benchmarks to see how fast gpus are and 720 or 1080 benchmarks to see how fast cpus are.,that will give you a system with good fps and good fluidity (high minimum fps).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well 4k gaming screens are cheaper than gpus and a lot are less than lower specced monitors.,also nothing i said was false 'if most' is a guess.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> most people simply can't afford 4k monitors

a 3060ti cost me as much as the two 4k monitors that i have connected to it.",and it can only play older games in 4k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
funny my 3080 ti is handling 4k 120 hz plenty fine.,newer games at 80 fps 4k is still better than 60 fps.,also have you heard of reducing settings and dlsr?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah only 2% play at 4k according to steam latest hardware survey last month.,"you are wrong

yeah totes dude.,i'll crank up the res so that i can degrade the visual fidelity with medium settings and pseudo-rescaling.,but hey at least i'm at 4k.,"the 3090ti isn't guaranteed to do 4k60 across the board and even if the avg fps is slightly above 60fps, the min's are probably well into 40's or lower which is unacceptable.",but here you are claiming that everyone and their dog is playing at 4k.,steam hardware survey says the most popular gaming card is gtx1060.,that thing can't even do 1080p proper.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wow i pity those poor sods still playing at 1080p.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
doesn't need medium settings.,"in most cases, there is no perceptible difference between 'ultra' and 'high'.",the games you mention going into 40s for the lows?,those are called console ports.,"in the case of most people having a gtx 1060, explain what exactly this thread has anything to do with that?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
around 85% of everyone plays at or below 1080p.,"screen size makes the difference, at 24"" or below anything over 1080p is really unnecessary and unhelpful (for gaming or media consumption).","as screen sizes increase, or distance decreases, higher resolutions start to matter more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

more pixels in less space = better quality.,its as 'unnecessary' as upgrading anything else.,"also performance wise, 4k results can also apply to ultrawide.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1. the cpu cooler isnâ€™t properly mounted.","if youâ€™re comfortable with it, i think it would be worthwhile to take it off, clean and apply fresh thermal paste to the cpu, and reattach it.",2. are there any programs that you recently installed?,"try checking task manager to see if there is anything running in the background, it sounds like there may be something creating a huge load on the cpu.","if this is a prebuilt, i wouldnâ€™t be surprised if one of the preinstalled programs (depending on the brand) is causing this issue.",you could try creating a fresh install of windows as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> idle temps were at around 80 celcius.,80 c idle sounds like something is wrong with the cooling.,normal idle is more like 30-40 maybe even 50 but not 80!,"another thing, one important basic thing to know about turbo and clockspeed is that high clockspeed alone does not make a lot of heat without heavy load (or a bad cooling problem).","it is normal to have clocks jump up and down all over the place 800, 1100, 4700, 5000, 800 etc just by watching a video but the load is so easy for the cpu it shouldn't get hot.",idling can have jumping clocks as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i find this to be far and away the most interesting of the emargoâ€™d overviews of their presentation.,"â€œconclusion:

i am very impressed with this process.",the more i compare it to offerings from tsmc and samsung the more impressed i am.,intel was the leader in logic process technology during the 2000s and early 2010s before samsung and tsmc pulled ahead with superior execution.,if intel continues on-track and releases intel 3 next year they will have a foundry process that is competitive on density and possibly the leader on performance.,intel has also laid out a roadmap for intel 20a and 18a in 2024. samsung and tsmc are both due to introduce 2nm processes in the 2024/2025 time frame and they will need to provide significant improvement over their 3nm processes to keep pace with intel.â€œ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am excited for mtl mobile chips.,base clockspeeds should go up big as they can operate at low voltage which should help with clockspeeds.,plus with much better battery life.,arrow lake should be a monster as it will come with ribbotfet (or gaafet)xtors for its cpu tile.,only hope is there are no major delays and which we cannot say until close to release.,i cant think of any chip closely monitored than mtl as it would be 1st new process tech from intel in ages as 10nm drama has been on going since late 2016 when cannon lake was initially supposed to release.,it took 3 years later before icelake released in high volume in 2019 and then another 2 years for alder lake to hit desktops.,hopefully we see an euv desktop product and granite rapids without any further delays.,amd also has a solid roadmap and apple is at the forefront when it comes to laptops and mobile.,its going to be exciting times for consumer for sure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pat gelsinger intel is no joke like the previous 3 ceos.,"if you read about him not only he's an engineer's engineer, he has incredible energy, and fantastic speaking, listening, and leadership skills.",his ceo rating has been increasing every quarter too.,and not being just talk is demonstrated by multiple sources citing vast changes coming in multiple areas.,"in addition to that they hired 17,000 technical(not sales) employees.",it does not guarantee success but he's the best chance of turning the company around.,"having a ceo leading a multi-billion dollar company able to say ""we'll sacrifice margins a bit for better products"" is extremely rare.",they cut share buyback completely and said multiple times that they'll be in financial pain for a bit to make the company's future brighter.,in technical fronts they are also going away from the somewhat needless focus on density.,intel's process was never about density.,it was about performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yup, if intel can execute on time and hit their density goals tsmc is in for a fight and soon.","i have a feeling that soon after intel foundry services opens up intel 3 and angstrom that clients will quickly be poached, someone like apple won't come over anytime soon, but companies like qualcomm and nvidia would love nodes competitive with tsmc that are a bit cheaper.",instead of being stuck with either expensive good tsmc nodes or cheap poor samsung nodes.,it's also going to put amd in a tough position too.,amd never uses tsmcs latest nodes.,but they have historically been a node ahead of intel until recently.,"so if intel catches tsmc, that puts intel a node ahead of amd and on par with apple.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"so basically, limited metal or finfet pitch scaling scaling but the switch to euv should enable better high density logic scaling while the materials upgrades should lead to better performance.",seems analogous to tsmc 7nn-> 7nm+ where they rolled out euv but didn't scale density much.,"seems like a good idea, especially if it's a short node.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no this is more like tsmc 7nm --> 5nm/4nm -   intel 4 is 1.8x-2x as dense as intel 7..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"alchemist = first gen, = 3070ti level

given the source it's a bit speculative but also reputable speculation.",given 2x density there's budget for more p-core,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it is 7nm-->7nm+ in what they are doing, not in raw performance or density jump",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't think u/saratoga3 was making the comparison with regards to density or performance.,"rather, it was about describing the node development strategy that is similar in idea to what tsmc did for n7 to n7p, where n7p was always planned to be the long-lived version of n7 and is what most of their customers will end up using rather than n7, which was mostly for early adopters who used it for smaller mobile chips like huawei and apple at the time.","intel foundry, as a separate business unit, now has to be more prudent than ever and seem to be adopting a tick-tock strategy for their node development so that they don't run into a situation where they are biting off more than they can chew, like they did with 10nm, ever again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i havenâ€™t heard of anything more powerful than the equivalent of a 3070ti coming out from team blue, yet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i absolutely agree.,intel sometimes does get stuck and i hope this isnâ€™t one of those times,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"we've already seen die shots and lots of specifics about mtl, and i haven't yet seen any indication of higher p-core count.","it's definitely possible, but i haven't seen anything to point to that yet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's complete speculation, and nothing public to date supports it.","known mtl compute tiles are 2+8 and 6+8, matching current core counts.","i wouldn't take it with a grain of salt, i'd take it with a truckload, or as complete bullshit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'm not sure we have a complete picture of the 14th gen product line.,"the 6+0 die of 12th gen was known only very very late, as a leak.",i can totally see them moving to add a die for a price premium class.,given the density reduction it may even be good financial on it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i don't work for intel.,"don't get mad because you were wrong, all i did was pointing it out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2x density scaling allows more e-cores *and* more p-cores.,"they can have a 16+32 cpu for the same silicon as tomorrows 8+16

but for cost savings it would probably look more like 10+32 or 12+32.","and a tangent, but if i was running their cpu div i would totally produce a 16+0 cpu for enthusiasts who don't need e-cores.",but the 6+0 i5 will probably move to 8+0 i5 (or 10+0 to bring forward 10850k users),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">they can have a 16+32 cpu for the same silicon as tomorrows 8+16

they can also have 8+64 in the same size as 8+16

so does adl's e-cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ugh, still no avx512?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thought that added to much heat?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, that's kind of a weird (yet, very minor) thing to get wrong.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i thought adlâ€™s avx2 on ecores was emulated and had terrible performance as a result.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea this is a bad article in many ways.,baseless speculations and some are plainly wrong.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
emulated means running a software program to simulate hardware.,"the e cores on adl do not emulate avx2, they do however have half the throughput of the big cores (1 256 bit instruction per cycle instead of 2 256 or 1 512 bit instruction per cycle).","basically, the big cores can do 512 bits worth of avx because they have avx512 hardware.","the little cores don't have that hardware, so only 256 bit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, the little cores are useless for a lot of use cases until they have the same performance on avx2 as the big cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they're never going to have the same performance as the big cores.,"that's the idea, they're slower but more efficient.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™d be fine with that if they werenâ€™t taking performance away from what the chip could do.,i would much rather have 10p0e for my workloads than 8p16e.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"check out sapphire rapids, which will be all p cores and no e cores for high end workstations and servers that don't care about battery life.",not sure what this has to do with avx2 though?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is exactly what i am looking at.,this has to do with avx2 because the performance of avx2 on e cores is nowhere near the same per clock as the p cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> this has to do with avx2 because the performance of avx2 on e cores is nowhere near the same per clock as the p cores.,"again, they're never going to have the same performance as the big cores.","that's the idea, they're slower but more efficient.","that isn't an avx thing, that is a consequence of the entire core being tuned for lower performance and higher efficiency.","as a result, *everything* is slower.","if you're expecting the same performance, you're missing the point!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are missing the point.,the avx2 implementation is worse.,it isnâ€™t just a clock speed difference or efficiency difference.,the efficiency cores are a waste of silicon for some workloads.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"even with a 60 hz monitor and an older gpu, you'll probably get a small fps boost.",i would think that the main benefit is avoiding stuttering and cpu-related bottlenecks in more recent games.,these effects vary widely from game to game though.,you should already know if you're experiencing them in the specific games you play.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that happens when you buy a 20$ cooler for a 400$ cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
case fans won't make much difference.,your problem is that you're not dissipating enough heat from the cpu itself.,what cooler are you using?,a massive tower cooler or large aio is a bare minimum for these cpus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
*for an intel cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my heatsink is the hyper 212 rgb black edition.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a 5800x would probably run hot, too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had a similar cooler on my 11700 and was over heating and or at 90+c.,i switched to this cooler which did well on a gn review and haven't had a problem since.,"deepcool ak620 high-performance cpu cooler, dual-tower design, 2x 120mm fluid dynamic bearing fans, 6 copper heat pipes, 260w heat dissipation https://a.co/d/3df0grv",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s a single tower cpu cooler.,"you either need a dual tower or an aio to dissipate the heat better

12700k is above the 212â€™s tdp",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"had a 212 black, 5800x, it was hitting 85-90 and that was in a 5000d with all fans, no way will it cool that 12700k",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5900x which is similar to 12700k in performance runs cooler than a 5800x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that doesn't make sense.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it makes sense because all of them run at same power draw.,those which have more cores spread the heat over more area which means more heat can transfer into the cooler and that makes the chip run cooler.,5950x runs even cooler than 5800x and 5900x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
update - it appears windows power management isn't working properly.,i tried tech powerups throttlestop quick to change the power plan and it seems to be ok now.,"however, if i go manually adjust say cpu power to 75% it has no affect on the cpu speed.","no idea why out of no where windows power management took a shit, but it did.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when you say no temp issues did you also check vrm/mosfet temps?,if those overheat the cpu will throttle to reduce the power load through them which would be consistent with the power management settings not making a difference.,there are also vrm/mosfet power limits in the bios you can\*\*\* set too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

man honestly i feel like 11th gen was actually pretty decent.,ran super cold for how much voltage it could take.,1.45v+ was no problem on a good custom water loop.,temps only in the 70s.,where as 10th gen or even 9th gen would hit those same temps at like 1.3v.,i haven't used an aio in a long time but i don't think you should be throttling at stock.,are you sure ur cooler is making good contact with the ihs?,use a big dab of thermal paste and spread it out over the entire surface of the ihs and then tighten the cooler down very very very snug.,don't bend the mobo but the hand screws (assuming your cooler has them) should be very very tight.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"alright so i think you ram is not good enough to run at gear 1, which could cost you 2% of the performance.",and then 280mm is not enough to stress the cpu to its limits.,"its well known how hot the 11th gen gets

now as for the other main reason your score is different is because of the test scenario.",reviewers have a clean install of windows and make sure the test conditions are perfect to test cpus.,"but we have different softwares running in the background, things installed etc etc that affect the performance.",hope this helps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

don't forget to set high/realtime priority for the benchmark application,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
turn off all the background junk when you benchmark.,your cpu is running hot because the mobo is overvolting the shit out of it for abt.,try lowering your voltage till it becomes unstable.,"i used an msi motherboard for this gen, they had some quality modifier that would adjust the voltage based on some generic binning info they had.","once i manually tweaked , the overheating went away real fast.","also, i found that frequencies stable at gear1 worked a bit better than frequencies stable at gear2.",this g1 vs g2 was really designed for ddr5 ram.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i mean contact is certainly an issue with an aio.,285w wouldn't break 70c on a big custom loop.,these bad boys will pull 375w+ easily if you have good heat transfer.,but that's an entirely different discussion.,my point is at only 285w if you're hitting close to 95c within 15 seconds of cinebench starting then that means you have a thermal transfer issue.,if your temps start at like 70c and then rise to 100c after the test has been running for a while then that means you're radiator is part of the problem.,bigger radiators only really help to keep water closer to ambient over sustained thermal loads.,most off tue shelf coolers biggest weakness isn't the radiator size.,it's actually the cold plate and it's ability to transfer heat away from the cpu.,so again they repasting the cpu.,spread the paste out manually.,cover the entire ihs.,then remount your aio.,see if it helps.,"otherwise you'll need to look at undervolting your cpu to keep temps lower, or look into a custom loop or something similiar.",a simple powerful custom loop can easily be built for less than $250.,feel free to reach out if you have other questions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

p95 might be overkill but r20/23 is not enough of a stability test.,your overclock wouldn't survive alot of applications if cinebench stability is your main barometer for stability.,"sure you probably can squeeze out an extra 100 mhz on cinebench vs something like prime 95 or linpack extreme etc, but without knowing what the op uses his pc for, i'd rather reccomend an overly difficult stress test that will all but guarantee he will never have any problems with stability in any programs in the future rather than understessing the cpu and giving him stability crashes if he ever tries to run blender, or transcode a video or something that hits the cpu harder than cinebench does.","i mean if the op is asking this question here, it's highly possible if not outright likely, he would struggle to diagnose and fix future system instability when his room heats up in the summer and the higher ambient temps make his cinebench ""stable"" overclock no longer stable.","or perhaps maybe he's someone who keeps their system for the next 5+ years and in that time his cpu degrades just a little bit and what was merely cinebench stable, now crashes randomly on occasion.",etc there's lots of reasons why novices should give themselves plenty of cushion and not run their cpus on the ragged edge.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh, then it's terrible.",how does your thermal paste spread pattern look?,all even or is there a low pressurized area in the center?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for your reference, my 12600k pull 200w during r23 and hit 92c, after washer mod, 200w at 88c

just wondering are you tighten up your cooler?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i assure you, video transcoding or blender does not hit cpu harder, than r20, as blender cycles on cpu and video transcoding is what i do daily.","there may be some server applications, where p95 or linpack may prove useful, but for regular usage there is no real world application exceeding avx 2 in r20.","it's not 100, it's at least 200 extra mhz, as e-cores tend to simply crap out in prime due to overheating.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

is your 12600k stock clock?,my 12700k only pulls 160ish watts during r23.,"my temps are all under 70 degrees, iâ€™ve noticed it only scores 22,300 on r23 and mid 15kâ€™s on timespy.","a little below average, not sure whatâ€™s up with it, on a asus tuf z690 mobo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i guess agree to disagree.,i used to use r20 as my main metric for stability until i starred doing alot of cpu transcoding.,i would get sporadic crashes from time to time.,and 200 mhz vs 100 mhz extra frequency.,neither really makes much of a difference in the grand scheme of things.,i mean every alder lake cpu can do like 5 ghz+ on prime 95 assuming good cooling.,so if you can now run 5.2 ghz instead of 5 ghz how much does that actually matter outside of a benchmark?,that's like a what 4% frequency increase?,"at that point though, unless you've got the best cooling money can buy, and super tight manually tuned memory timings, and rocking an rtx 3090 ti then odds are something else is bottlenecking you more than pure cpu frequency is, and your performance improvement will be limited to nonexistant.","if that improvement is worth it to you, then knock yourself out.","as someone who benchmarks alot of stuff and is very into extreme overclocking i can certainly underatand your justification for running cpus at the ragged edge, but i don't condone such things for more inexperienced users.",but at the end of the day the op is certainly free to make his own decision.,hopefully my reasoning makes some sense.,even if we don't necessarily see eye to eye,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

get a 12600k or 12700f instead of the 11700k.,they are much faster and should cost similarly unless you can get the 11700k on deep discount.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think you can.,"if its unstable at stock i'd find it hard to imagine disabling c states would fix instability though and if it did, then it might just be delaying the inevitable.",has the cpu been overclocked before?,"if not, might be worth increasing the voltage a bit and keeping power savings on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

never overlooked.,just all stock settings so it does naturally go a bit above base speed (3.60ghz i think is base speed and reaches up to 4.80ghz on its own).,but who knows how stable my stock settings are cuz i found my not overlooked ram voltage set to 1.35v and reducing that plus increasing speed from 2133 to 2933 increased stability.,silly mobo settings haha,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

your best bet is to wait for bios updates because you can't pinpoint if its the motherboards fault or the cpu.,you could try another cpu to rule it out.,just run base memory timings for now till you sort it out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"because asus is the best at hitting high memory frequencies on 4 dimm ddr5 motherboards, whether we're talking 2 or 4 dimm slots in use, at least for their high-end boards like the strix e and maximus",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
asus rog strix z690-f user here.....i'm pretty sure i'm done with asus after this gen and i might actually change my motherboard with raptor lake.,"the z690-f is ok, but i really wish i would have went with msi's carbon at the same price of $400 for various reasons.",asus bios appears to be well documented online and better than most.,i did hit some fairly high overclocks on the cpu & ddr5 dram with minor issues.,i used an asus x58 sabertooth mb for a long time.,"the z690 isn't bad, but i don't think i would be missing anything if i would had went with another brand.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why do people delid cpus?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
add some liquid metal on it and it will be good as new,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why though?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its funny how big the die is lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i did it to my i7 7700k so i could oc and keep temps down.,intel decided to use toothpaste as a thermal compound.,"so you delid, clean everything up and use liquid metal, then slap it all back together.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
curiosity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in this case curiosity as there aren't really any pictures of the die i could find online and if it weren't soldered you can improve temperature,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if the replace the paste inside they can achieve 0,1â°c lower temp, which is apparently worth the insane risk of breaking the cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
adding liquid metal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh wow i had no idea you can do this, this is next level haha",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if it's thermal paste rather than solder then delideding is well worth it like 20+c difference,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
temps underload went from 90c+ to 70c.,"with a aio cooler, plus i got to run at 5.1ghz.","that same i7 is being used in my unraid server, zero issues.",once a year a pop it open and reapply new liquid metal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

great to hear that your joing this pc building journey.,"you have selected good products, no issues found.",and all manufacturers have some or the other bios issues but most of them get fixed in time.,and 12th has been out for a while hence all bugs are probably ironed out.,i my self is b660 aorus master and love it.,you can keep the board you chose or buy the strix or master if you want.,depends on how much you want to spen.,"it does not really matter if you buy from amazon or microcenter, you will be leaving the country and wont be dealing with those companies either eay.",buy from which ever is cheaper to save some buck.,edit: forgot to recommend the other things.,"so buy the coolermater h 500 case ( it is the best option there, trust me)

thanks a lot my friend!,actually i am not from the us i am from lebanon but my friend is from the us and will bring some parts from there for me since you get them at a much cheaper rate than here.,as for the board i thought it's a reasonable price for what i need.,"i have not experience in overclocking and if i ever do it it is not gonna be something extreme, i think that board should be fine, what do you think or suggest?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

22nm 3.4 ghz to 14nm 4.4ghz will show good improvements.,"if you can scrounge up a bit more, you can get more performance from an i5 12400f.",intel 7 equivalent/sim to tsmc n7.,4th gen to 11th gen will also have significant packaging improvements.,this means lower temperatures overall.,12th gen is improved versus 11th gen as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes you will notice a difference,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
new mb for it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
definitely an improvement.,"i had an i7 4790, it was decent with my 1060, but when i upgraded to 12400, the quality of life improvements were very noticeable.",like running multiple software in the background and being able to alt tab with out stutter or freeze.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"gen 11 mb are cheaper at least here in argentina , nearly the same price 12 gen  is better , a 12400f and b660 made a good combo .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
will it be good enought to spent more then 300 euro for the upgrade =)?,what do u think?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes asus prime h510m-k  now my current one is h81m-k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and what about the fps in the games?,my gpu is gtx 960 =) will i get more fps in games too?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes it'll be.,"but if you're gaming, a gpu upgrade would probably be more worthy depending on what you already have.",i also don't see why you won't be able to go 12th gen instead of 11th with 300 euros.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sorry i do not think so, but it will help in the sence that you will have less stutters, you frame time will improve.",but average fps will remain same as your main gaming performance comes from gpu.,"on the plus side, you can pair a higher end gpu with the new 11400!",your old cpu will definitely bottleneck those.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the share an architecture each generation but they are clocked differently,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in the same generation, so like 12th gen, they share the same design architecture.",but they are not the same.,"the big difference is eu's (execution units, think gpu 'cores') that currently range from 96 down to 16. 

but there are also some other differences like frequency (speed), and multi-format codec engines (encoding and decoding acceleration engines).",you can see the differences between cpu igps on the intel ark database.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if we compare with dedicated gpu 12900k equal to which model?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s very hard to do a direct comparisonâ€¦ but maybe something along the lines of an amd hd 4870 from 2014?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the full 96eu g7 maybe, but i think it's probably more like a 4770. should be near half of a 1030 ddr5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it has to do with how much power the motherboard will allow the cpu to draw before it throttles the clock speed, and the lower limit is how low it will allow the cpu to throttle to when idle.","the trade off is better energy efficiency at the expense of responsiveness to heavy loads, like opening a program or starting a game.","if your processor state is very low, and then you try to open a browser, for example, the cpu will be running at a low clock speed for a split second while it ramps up, so your perception will be that the system is ""slow"".","if you set both to 100%, then the cpu will remain at stock clock speed all the time, improving responsiveness to spiky loads, but reducing the overall energy efficiency.","there's more to it, but for most people that's the tl;dr.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just leave it at stock if you want perfect stability.,otherwise if you have xtu and an unlocked cpu and a z series mobo you can try and undervolt a little for better temps.,if you don't have those things then just leave it at stock.,hardware is designed to throttle and shutdown long before temperatures can damage it.,just leave ur power plan at balanced.,high performance will keep ur cpu from idling.,but balanced let's int function the way it was intended.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same exact story every time this is posted: your cooler mount is bad.,redo it and make sure all the pegs are screwed all the way in and tighten the cooler down like you hate it.,i ran this same exact combo and idled at 30c while gaming in the low 50s.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,you should just set the power limits to values that suit your cooling and forget all the special boost options the motherboard adds for no reason at all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"its hot af but since you are running integrated graphics, the chip is gonna have to work harder.",i would look into a slightly better cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

clocks of mtl-s will be low if parametric yields are bad

there is also possibility of advanced packaging limiting clocks",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20% at lower clocks like 2.2ghz.,"it drops to 12% at above 3ghz, although 3.5ghz intel 4 is still lower power than 3.2 ghz intel 7.

who knows the gain at 5-plus ghz?",also forget about desktop enthusiast meteorlake.,high end is expected to be arrowlake by most reliable leakers and insiders.,arrowlake is what you want.,it should come maybe 2 months after low-mid mtl-s so timeline is not bad at all either.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it will be on lga 1700 so i assume it should stay 690 chipset.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the problem is that's like a 10 percent drop in frequency, meaning even a good \~15 percent ipc bump potentially from meteor lake is going to be effectively negated by the frequency drops.",mtl-s might have a hard time providing any meaningful st gains over rpl-s.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
timeline is definitely pretty bad.,"here are the two scenarios from the wide spread leakers:

raichu: mtl-s and arl-s arrive at a similar time, after 2024. 

mlid: mtl-s 2023 q4, arl-s 2h

in either time line, intel won't have a competitor for zen 4-v cache in mid 2023. mlid time line would mean we might see meteor lake compete, but that would be like 2 quarters later.","also, arl might be what everyone wants, but dude if arl is high end, most people won't be able to afford that.","i can totally see a scenario where a 8+32 and a 8+24 arl-s is the high end, with a 8+16 and below being mtl.",but most people buy at the mid-low end not the high end.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it has 2 good heatsinks and fans that move plenty of air.,for it's size it has some of the best cooling you can get and can sustain 30 watt package power in the 90's temps for hours and hours (which won't impress a desktop user or thicc-boi laptop user but for ultrabooks its impressive af).,"the x1 *nano* is the one with smol heatsink and barely a fan, and it can sustain about 17-18 watts package power for hours.","but you're nitpicking the part of my comment that was *not the point, it was just an establishing control variable*.","the point is, given a controlled test in the same conditions, 4+8 performs better than 6+8 under *any* thermal constraint.",so thicc-boi laptops would do the same thing at 45 or whatever package power and up since the chips really want to run 100+ watts if they were somehow truly unlocked and cooled.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
barnes for the win,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

will 13th gen be on the 600 series mb chipset or will there be a 700?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"p core count will stay same for some time, atleast until lunar lake judging by all the info out there, however e cores are spreading like wildfire.","currently, one e core is just slightly weaker than core in your 7700k but obviously much more efficient.",meteor lake (14th gen) will bring all new more powerful e cores.,"back to raptor lake (13th gen) ipc will increase by \~10%, cache size will be considerably larger and frequencies are rumored to reach 5.8 ghz for top of the line product.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel isn't increasing p-core count until 2026 at the earliest.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thing is it still will need ~40% less power than rpl-s to hit same clock speeds

it may not be higher performance, but it can be same performance at a much lower power draw",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mlid is wrong.,also historically raichu has been very reliable.,intel's priority is getting delayed process(and design) teams back in track.,"the staggered launches can achieve that, because it avoids delays from the past propagating into the future since they are skipping certain market segmenets.","so while successor to raptorlake k may be 15 months away, you are getting a much superior 20a process and also a better core.","if they stuck with meteorlake, sure you might have got it 5 months earlier, but a worse product.",the mid and the low end can easily be covered by meteorlake with pricing and proper segmentation.,having the halo product is very different.,think about it.,"if you could get raptorlake in april of this year rather than alderlake last november, you'd wait right?",but arrowlake gets a process upgrade too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah that sounds about right in which case i'll probably pull the trigger on one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"z690 socket is gonna last for 13th and 14th gen cpus that's been confirmed, but after that probably another new socket lool",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wow that sounds great, i guess it means 8 e cores may actually outperform the 8 threads of a 7700k?","i am also planning the same upgrade, eyeing the 13600k - anything above it feels like an overkill.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if the new e cores are faster than this cpu's cores (at my current clock speed, none of this 4.2ghz comparison i see all over the net) then that's cool.",but i really just want all p cores with solid performance uplift.,"if i end up with say a 10 p core 13th gen chip, i'd just disable the e cores.","i don't really need them, i just want all cores to be the same performance and be super fast.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seriously?,damnit.,i can't wait that long.,guess i'll have to settle for 13th gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"lower power draw is always a benefit, especially in mobile, but i think most desktop users would rather gain performance than efficiency.","obviously you don't want like 300 watt chips, but for most gamers the current power draw is acceptable and not an issue, especially since most of us just play games and not heavy mt uses.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yup >dlvr< but u need a 700 board in ordner to use that feature,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's good to know!,how often does intel change the socket design?,every 2 years?,i never thought about the frequency until now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
600 boards are compatible with the upcoming 13 gen but du need a 700 board if u wanna benefit from the new features like dlvr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> i guess it means 8 e cores may actually outperform the 8 threads of a 7700k?,"they will surely outperform it in mt tasks because the 7700k has just four physical cores + ht which at best gives a ~30% uplift, so there are ""5.2"" virtual cores, so to say.",and then there are mt tasks which barely benefit from ht or even show regressions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sapphire rapids hedt has entered the chat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel is all in on p&e, so software will support it.",same way software eventually supported amd's ccx's and chiplets.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don't worry about that.,you want to know why?,"if you stick with only p cores, then the designers eventually run into a situation where there has to be dozens of them in a single chip.","then they eventually turn into what's in essence, e cores.",having few p cores and large number of e cores allows the p cores to be \*larger\* than they would be otherwise.,so don't be surprised if the p core gains are greater than historical 15-20% gains.,this is the \*real\* hybrid advantage.,you specialize mt by having many e cores.,but you maximize st by enlarging the few p cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yep, they are going from 8 e-cores now to 16 e-cores with 13th gen and then 32 e-cores with 15th gen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's kinda random they had a socket last a year and some last 2 or 3 if your lucky but intel always changes it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"depends on workload, in some 8 e core can match 6 core skylake i5 with ht, while in others it is slower than a i3 9100, which has no ht.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
32?,that's absurd.,and they're going to have better ipc than probably even rocket lake by then?,i wonder what clock speed they'll run at.,if greater than 4.6ghz that would be absurd for multithreaded loads.,but yeah really i'm more interested in 12 ish p cores pushing max overclocks for gaming.,32 e cores doesn't really do anything for me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's anything but random.,"the pattern is every 2 gens, for more than 10 years now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7700k is a four-core part.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hybrid allows the p cores to be larger and more performant than if it only had p cores.,"in the future if you have say 64-96 so-called ""p"" cores then they are no longer p, but bunch of e's even if they would like you to think otherwise.","by having p+e hybrid combo, the massively multithreaded tasks are handled by efficient but still powerful many e cores, and few large p cores.",let me repeat: hybrid allows the st-focused p cores to be larger than they would be otherwise.,i am convince it's part of the reason why apple and rest of the arm camp progressed so quickly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
apple and arm progressed by churning down through the node shrinks faster than everyone else by throwing a ton of money at the problem from the massive mobile device industry.,"intel is server and desktop primarily, which is significantly smaller.",amd is even smaller still.,"once intel puts out a chip on 5nm like these guys, then they'll see similar gains.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

tl;dr - you've no idea what you're doing and you didn't even check alder lakes voltage list.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you should never tell amd/intel you're running xmp profiles as it just gives them ammunition to use against your case.,"judging by your comments here it wouldn't surprise me if you were rude to support and they used anything possible to stop you getting anywhere with them, or you've just made that up and you seriously cranked the voltage up and fried it which would void the warranty.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if i dont know what i'm doing then why does the ram work on z490?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
simply - you don't.,"you imitate other people, hence why it works.","there's no io voltage with alder lake and sa can go by quite a handful of names, in asrocks case it goes by vdd\_imc voltage, you only miss vddq voltage for some reason, most likely asrock decided to set it 1:1 with vdd voltage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
imitating?,"i've literally been doing this for over a decade:

we naming gpus after airplanes now?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
arc a380 probably has performance of gtx 1650super + currently the drivers are half unfinished so some games don't start or glitch out.,random instabilities are all over too.,"this is why intel launched it china-only, basically a big beta-test on chinese consumers before they release it globally at the end of the year.",not worth it at all even if it's 20% cheaper than something with rtx 3050.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
everything that intel has done up to this point shows me that they don't care for diy market and the entire focus is on mobile and oem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,we naming airplanes after gpus now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well to be fair, ryzen also had a chipset called a320",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean the 1650 super performs 78% as well as a 1660ti/3050.,that market segment has been stagnant for far too long - intel ought to fix that.,"if they don't, then i don't know what the selling point is.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the whole reason they are launching to diy last is because they know that segment is extremely demanding and vocal.,"if some games have stutters due to unfinished drivers, they would get crucified by the diy crowd, while prebuilt and laptop owners are far less demanding of perfection.","launching diy last is only going to be a thing for alchemist, due to the driver situation.",guarantee you battlemage and onward will be diy first/simultaneous.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i don't think that's nuanced enough; it's not that they don't care, but they have no confidence in their current product and they know the diy desktop market is a lot more critical than laptop/oem users, which is why they are making sure that the early reviews/samples are behind the great firewall of china.","the time to launch this product was a year ago when it would have sold itself and people would have been more understanding about software issues (if resolved quickly), so now they find themselves with an outdated product that has to compete against established players and their software stack likely cannot stand to even cursory scrutiny.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its so crappy that no one would buy it anyway.,maybe for some super low price.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ok, and?",they have never claimed to be diy-first,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well.. a380 is basically like a 1650super but with buggy drivers.,intel only did some kind of cheating code in their drivers so the 3d mark scores their gpus achieve are very high but in games it's not good.,arc a730m which is a high-end laptop 100w gpu (laptops with it were already reviewed) reaches about the same 3d mark score as rtx 3070 mobile but the actual gaming performance is about rtx 3050 mobile + some games don't run or glitch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you think battlemage will actually get launched??,at this point i feel like intel is gonna push the gpu project off their table soon as it doesn't generate any profit and only puts worse view on the company for releasing incompetent products.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">would it be possible, with intel foveros, to have a base die with just a bunch of cache that is connected to a compute tile above?","i am not sure that â« foveros â» is the correct name, but yes, it can be done, and amd will do this in cdna 3 according to [https://www.anandtech.com/show/17445/amd-combining-cdna-3-and-zen-4-for-mi300-data-center-apu-in-2023](https://www.anandtech.com/show/17445/amd-combining-cdna-3-and-zen-4-for-mi300-data-center-apu-in-2023)

nah dude 1.5 v is not.,1.37 aio 1.45 for full custom loops.,i personally wouldnâ€™t recommend 1.5 v for anything but quick benches.,the motherboards will all usually flood more voltage than is necessary for stability if youâ€™re leaving voltage on auto.,"you have to lower voltage manually and find the point of stability, the motherboard just floods excess to guarantee stabilityâ€¦.",not trying to be overly harsh but why do you have this many 12900ks chips on different boards and not know how to overclock them?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
any cpu running stock is perfectly fine.,current not voltsge is what usually degrades silicon.,voltage is certainly part of the equation along with temperature and amperage.,"i really wish the pc community would stop worry about ""is x voltage safe?""",its counter productive to having fun.,nothing lasts for ever.,all silicon slowly degrades.,"but if left at stock, the product is guaranteed to maintain fully operable for a period of up to 3 years.",if you have any noticeable degredation before those 3 years have elapsed then just file an rma with intel (or amd).,problem solved.,no need to fuss.,most chips will far outlive that 3 year warranty especially when left at stock operation (or undervolted) and not under high temperatures for long periods of time.,but again nothing lasts forever.,"there's no reason to think your cpu will die by running a few ""extra"" millivolts.","so stop worrying about it , and just enjoy your pc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you shouldnâ€™t have to overclock but iâ€™m telling you if you leave your motherboard voltage (cpu vcore) at â€œautoâ€ (stock setting) your motherboard is flooding at least some unnecessary voltage to keep it stable.,itâ€™s not intel itâ€™s the mobo manufacturers.,â€œautoâ€ voltage from mobo manufacturers is always way too high to err of the safe side for stability.,dial it down.,see whatâ€™s possible.,every chip will behave differently.,above 1.5v is going to degrade your silicon.,period.,how quickly?,who can say.,i leave my non-s 12900k at 5 ghz all-core at 1.28 v (llc 6) and this cpu will be around for a hot minute.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you really think 24/7 cinebench r23 singlecore will kill the ks after a year?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
auto voltages on a stock cpu are determined by the internal programmed v/f curve from the cpu.,that v/f curve is set by intel so if a stock cpu boosts to 1.5v then that's intel saying those voltages are fine.,atleast for the 3 years of warranty.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
uh huh.,i see youâ€™ve never used a gigabyte mobo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have one.,even gigabyte just follows vid.,any difference between mobos just depends on where they measure vcore.,"you know you can check your stock v/f curve, right?",that's how asus determines the sp value.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have read msi puts more voltage in the cpu than necessary.,i testet cpu lite load mode 2 and my ks runs stable.,"now, max.",vcore in hwinfo after hours (polling rate 500ms) is 1.38v.,multicore like cinebench runs 5.2ghz allcore at 1.2v.,29500 / 2155 points in r23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeaâ€¦.op listened to me and now itâ€™s stable at 1.38 v 

he woulda been pushing 1.5 v with whatever youâ€™re saying.",thatâ€™s voltage degradation levels over time.,i have never manual ocâ€™d a chip in my life with any voltage anywhere remotely as high as what the vid table was requesting.,"therefore i am correct in saying the auto voltage setting is generally flooding unnecessary voltageâ€¦just like this situation, auto voltage on his msi board was pushing 1.5+ v and heâ€™s rock solid stable at 1.38 v. this is not a surprise to me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, rock solid in cb.",from my experience there is very little margin in undervolting for intel.,atleast if we're talking about serious stability testing.,if you just want to run cb then you can indeed drop voltages quite a bit.,i've seen intel cpus that weren't even stable at stock.,no way is he anywhere close to stable at 1.38v for 5.5 ghz though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i mean right now iâ€™m rock stable at 5.0/3.9 ghz all core ring clock 4.2 ghz with 1.28 v llc 6 (1.296 v max) while my core vid is ~1.45 v. 

not just cb.","prime 95, cb, occt, asus realbench.",yea my board would try to push that crazy number if i left it on auto.,i was wondering if you knew how to approximate an sp number from a vid table?,i donâ€™t have an s just 12900k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you can go with either honestly.,mobo doesnâ€™t have any impact on performance so just choose the one that you like.,"the asus board has better vrm and looks better, but some users report having problem with the audio and bios (specifically xmp) so be on lookout for that.","the msi pro-a is a quality budget board that lacks the gamer aesthetic and inferior vrm, but that hardly matter.",personally i would go with the pro-a because you are paying less and donâ€™t sacrifice anything other than looks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

do not waste your time with pl1 at 65w.,double or triple that immediately.,set both power limits to at least 200w so these limits do not interfere with maximum performance.,only reduce the power limits if your cooling system cannot handle the extra heat.,intel sets the thermal throttling temperature to 100â°c.,their cpus can run comfortably and reliably at high temperatures.,reduce the core and the cache voltage by -50 mv (-0.050 v).,this is usually stable for the vast majority of intel cpus.,do some basic testing like cinebench and make sure you are stable.,no need to over think this stuff.,make some adjustments and do some stability testing.,the ts bench test in throttlestop is a good first test when setting voltages.,make sure the 960m test does not report any errors.,"if it reports any errors, the cpu needs some more voltage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"adding (or â€œmaintainingâ€) power limits will reduce power draw and heat output, however it will also reduce performance.","the goal of â€œundervoltingâ€ is to maintain the same performance at a lower power draw, but a chipâ€™s ability to do this will vary, and at some point instead of lower power draw, youâ€™ll start adding instability.",remember that cpus will protect themselves from overheating.,at 100 degrees celsius they start self-regulating power draw / performance to prevent from getting any hotter.,this does not damage the cpu.,"assuming youâ€™re putting your cpu into a good case with plenty of fans and a quality cpu cooler, i would play around with a modest undervolt, but otherwise not worry too much about it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you have air conditioners there?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
does higher cinebench points mean better performance?,"what i mean is, if it keeps going higher, i should keep undervolting?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok ty so much.,so should i do undervolting from bios or xtu or throttlestop?,and what would be a sweet spot to hit that undervolting?,"and if i just do max power limit at 150w for example would it ""severely"" affects performance(giving the idea that the i7 12700 tdp is 185w)?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"iâ€™m not an undervolting expert by any means, but iâ€™ll share what i can.","bios is usually best, but it involves a lot of rebooting.","personally, i like to use the v/f curve to undervolt high frequencies and leave lower / idle frequencies alone.","however someone recently pointed out that b660 boards may not have that capability, so iâ€™m not really sure there.",youâ€™ll probably want to start out at a -0.020 undervolt and then run a benchmark or stress test.,this could be cinebench r23 or maybe prime95 small ffts with avx if youâ€™re really dead set on a 100% rock solid system.,"if it goes for a few minutes without errors or crashing, try undervolting a bit more.","when it crashes, back off and test the prior setting for longer.","you might end up with an undervolt around -0.030 to -0.070 or even -0.100, however a lot of it depends on your silicon quality, your workloads, and what level of stability you want out of the system.","like, some people claim they have like a -0.150 undervolt and that may in fact boot, but iâ€™m pretty sure you throw prime95 at that and itâ€™ll crash instantly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is the v/f curve?,and if i make a very minor change like -0.040 would that make a good difference in heat management?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think it wouldn't make any sense to replace your perfectly good ram.,if you want 32gb just add another 16gb kit that matches your existing 4000/19 kit.,4000/19 to 3200/16 would probably be a downgrade in performance anyway.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4000cl19 is pretty decent.,"no need to replace it right now, most games wonâ€™t utilize over 16gb anyways.",i use 16gb of 4000cl18 on my system (downclocked to 3733 because my cpuâ€™s memory controller and motherboard had issues keeping up) and it runs great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

determine if you are running gear 2 or 1 with the cl19 memory.,"if you are gear 1 then go with a second identical kit, if it is gear 2 then sell the ram and get some 3600 cl16 no point in getting 3200 with the same latency as decently priced 3600.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"got u, ive have 2x sets at 3600 but keep getting bsod, my rig is strickly for gaming and alot of games seem to use all the memory, thats why i'm asking if 32gb would be better",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you're running your 4000mhz memory at 3600mhz?,if you're using up all 16gb then yeah adding more would make sense.,the bsods are probably a separate issue though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that doesn't make any sense... he is discussing ram.,i am running a 12900k with ddr4 3600 cl16 gear 1.  low the gear generally the better the overall performance when you are right on the cusp of changing gears like ddr4 4000.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no i run 2x8gb at 4000mhz, i have another 2xsets at 2x8 at 3600mhz but went put the 4x8 at 3600mhz i bsod as ther separate sets",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
he has 10900k.,it does not have gears.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"of course it bsod  

you have to run the slowest ram speed.","in your case, 3600, but 4x ram is less stable than 2x ram.",so if it doesn't work you have to lower ram speed until it is stable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that isn't my understanding higher speed ddr4 kits need to be run at gear 2 as the memory controller can't run at speeds of some of the top end kits.,i doubt ddr4 5333 would run in gear 1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so i can't run 4x8 at 3600 on advertised 3600 speed?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"generally ddr4 3600mhz cl14 is the sweet spot for current gen cpu's, going higher on amd isn't a smart idea but you can on intel, it'll give a fps or 2. ddr5 seems to be debatable but 6000mhz cl40 i'd say is the ""affordable"" (depends on your part of the world) sweet spot for z690.",next gen that will probably change.,i personally just run 5200mhz cl40 (kingston fury) & have no issues with gaming at half the cost of 6000mhz cl40.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how much was the kingston?,might be the same kit my dad just grabbed for his 12900k.,it has good overclock potentials and is $150 cheeper more or less compared to g skil z5 or teamgroup xtreeme,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"about $350nzd, it doesnt have any overclock potential though, 1.3/1.35v & you can lower the cl to 38, but when you change the mhz its blackscreen hell.",(from xmp),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ah he might have gotten a different kit then either slightly different cl or frequency.,but ddr5 has so much bandwidth already id just tighten the secondary tertiary and train the rtl iol timings and maybe see if it can do command rate 1 if you're mb supports cr1.,all of those will really reduce latency and also increase bandwidth with out changing freq and if your gaming that matters more than bandwidth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to be blunt i honestly only bought it to get the pc running.,"was going to upgrade to 6000 clxx when the kits came back in stock, but you know i messed around with it quite a bit trying to overclock & ended up just running xmp on it due to reasons above.","but for gaming & pc use its been perfectly stable at xmp, while i could use 1-2 more fps with the new 4k 144hz monitor i don't have stuttering, tearing or major negative frame dips.",hence why i'm probably going to keep it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the latency i was referring to could mean small hiccups or pauses in all types of scenarios, but again you shouldn't be experiencing that unless you turn on c states in bios and go beyond c7.","honestly even c8 probably isn't noticable, but if you look up a table about what the system does in each c state, it's pretty obvious that c9 and c10 in particular might slow system responsiveness down a bit and are probably only really suited for laptops / battery powered products.","if you do turn on c states, it's important you also enable rush to halt in the bios.","this actually increases performance as the computer tries to do work as quickly as possible to enter a deeper c state sooner, hence the name rush to halt.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this has nothing to do with 12th gen/the cpu itself but samsung's laptop.,you wouldn't see this big of a difference in boot times when changing cpus.,"my bet is that since the new galaxy book pro 2 is samsung's first ddr5 laptop/pc, they are doing excessive ram training at boot or some other weird behavior.",this would be fixable with a bios update from samsung.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thank you for your comments.,i agree my tests are not scientific.,what i am saying is that when i compare my i7 to my i5 with almost identical set-up i would opt for the i5 version if i buy another in the future because it boots faster and i cannot see any speed difference when i use the laptop.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i probably have to agree with you.,"i think personally that the spec, light weight, thinness, battery life, etc of the galaxy book pro 2 360 is better than the dell xps, hp spectre, lg gram, etc.","its just a bit disappointing that after spending so much hard earned cash on the near top of the range model it falls short at boot, but like you say the i7-1260p evo is much better overall.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
boot time is not a good benchmark to determine overall performance.,if you like comparing performance of different systems you might want to try some benchmarks like [cinebench](https://www.maxon.net/en/downloads/cinebench-r23-downloads) or[geekbench](https://www.geekbench.com/).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

- ... etc

another  thing, if you are going to be hosting 4k files you may want to transcode them on the fly (e.g.",to hard-code subtitles) which uses significantly more resources than a 1080p transcode.,"gpus which support even one 4k transcode are still fairly expensive since they're also beefy enough to play games, making them not cost-effective.","but if you absolutely need 4k, figure out how many 4k streams you expect to have maximum at any given time, and make sure the gpu you choose supports 4x that many simultaneous transcodes on this chart:  
[https://www.elpamsoft.com/?p=plex-hardware-transcoding](https://www.elpamsoft.com/?p=plex-hardware-transcoding)

(transcoding a single 4k to 4k will require roughly 4x the amount of resources as transcoding 4k to 1080p, so for example for example the quadro p400 will only handle 2x 4k-to-1080p transcodes at once, it will therefore not be able to handle even one 4k-to-4k transcode.","the cheapest cards which will support a 4k-to-4k transcode are: quadro m4000, gtx 980ti, or gtx 1060, so as you can see 4k transcoding will significantly increase your cost vs a lowly gt 1030. most people just forego 4k transcodes for this reason; they instead only offer non-hardcoded subtitles and hope that the client is capable of displaying them, or they restrict transcodes to 1080p.)","\---------------------

some additional things to consider...

amd has hardware encoding too, and plex / kod / jellyfish fully supports them (though soe competitors don't offer full amd support).","amd's newest encoders are comparable in quality to 6th gen (pascal) nvenc which is definitely good enough not to notice any artifacts when watching a movie, but it's not *quite* as good as cpu encode.","nvidia has 7th gen nvenc on turing and ampere products, which is the absolute best hardware-encode quality and uses the lowest power due to less calls to system ram.","in using it for my twitch stream, i honestly think 7th gen nvenc is better than faster cpu preset which is the best that my r9-5900x can maintain.",but since 7th gen nvenc is only on turing / ampere products they're not cost-effective to invest in yet for a streaming rig.,the lowest 7th gen nvenc is the 1650 super; vanilla gtx 1650 and turing-based quadro cards all use 6th gen nvenc from pascal.,quicksync is really good on more modern intel chips and uses less power than any dgpu.,"if you're not outputting any video during the streaming which would constrain your memory bandwidth, then using your igpu is an option for encoding.","it fully supports avc video (h264), but anything hevc would be decoded by the cpu rather than the gpu.","it may be worth it to return your 4th generation tower, invest take that money + your gpu budget into a low end modern intel chip.",i wonder if your budget could afford a more modern i3?,"intel 6000/7000 series you'd have hardware decode of hevc (that's what i'm planning to build into my streaming rig since they're so super cheap and i don't need encoding capability), and the 8000 series gpus have hardware encode (therefore transcode) of hevc h265.",[https://handwiki.org/wiki/software:intel\_quick\_sync\_video#hardware\_decoding\_and\_encoding](https://handwiki.org/wiki/software:intel_quick_sync_video#hardware_decoding_and_encoding),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">for leak 17 i heard that alder lake's l3 "" can also shift the l3 cache from an inclusive or non-inclusive policy based upon utilization.",intel's slides just say non-inclusive.,"i'm not sure what the protocol change would mean since non-inclusive non-exclusive cache would have the data duplicated until it needs to be evicted from the upper level (unlike exclusive ""victim"" cache).",inclusive would always have the lower level cache data duplicated to both caches.,the point of non-inclusive non-exclusive is that there is no special protocol needed since the caches don't really need to care if data is evicted from the other one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
34 intel ark shows launch msrp.,(even years later) retailers are always free to mark stuff up but some will sell at msrp.,12900k was $599 msrp at launch or within 10% of 5900x.,i don't believe microcenter had it above $600 but i maybe wrong.,good luck on this amount of work..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
some of those low value leaks don't mean  anything for customers or even competitors.,for example for the question of what comes after 12900k it's anyone's guess that it's 13900k.,but he gives it a name for example raptor lake or meteor lake.,ipc should probably be considered medium to high value coz its not well published even to oems.,i think most of his ipc leaks are guesses and not from an insider.,then for performance he usually gives very broad claims that you cannot say right or wrong.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"in regards to pricing, you just have to understand the way intel operates.","by all accounts, i3/5/7/9 are not performance tiers, but price tiers.","this has always been the case, and is a result of their oem focused business model, who expect to be able to put the next gen i5 in the same price class as last time, and most of this is probably locked in by long term contracts.",the core series has only ever adjusted for inflation and basically nothing else.,itâ€™s the safest bet you could make.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that is actually a really cool way to classify leaks.,the value of the leak is based on how hard it would be to obtain said leak.,"i think that could be a little subjective though, and honestly i am already classifying the leaks into performance, time line, efficiency, etc etc, so i really don't want to add another layer of categories lol.",but i appreciate the suggestion and might implement it in a later revision thanks!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"oh well, i am waiting for that rumored 24 core hedt sapphire rapids chip to replace my skylake-x, but intel keeps delaying it :-(",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel not delaying something would be unexpected.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is par for the course these days... i just expect timelines to slip at intel.,i hope it doesn't affect future releases.,datacenter is really taking a beating.,"spr (golden cove) was supposed to be a milan (zen3) competitor, not a genoa (zen4) competitor.",hopefully they can get back on track.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m starting to feel like my next cpu may be amd,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my guess is they are mostly focusing on consumer products for now.,the hedt and server space has much fiercer competition.,"amd there has a massive core count, healthy ipc, decent clock speeds and lots of cache on top of that.","it's probably easier for intel to start working on the consumer chips, which are simpler and can be more aggressive with things such as clocks.","power draw isn't the biggest concern, particularly when the flagship products cater towards enthusiasts who only care about raw performance.","everyone who isn't running on hopium knows that until 2024+, intel will be playing catch up to amd in the ultra high end stuff.","hopefully they will get there, but it will take time.",at least adl showed us they are eventually getting back on track.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don't read too much into these delays and assume sapphire rapids is going to slip.,volume ramp delay actually means not all skus of sapphire rapids are shipping to consumers right now.,there are too many different skus and out of which some are shipping in volumes where as some others are still being validated.,"volume shipment happens when all skus are shipping volumes, not specific skus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if you read the article they clearly state that production capacity is not the problem, they have some extra platform validation problems with their customers.",so basically that means that the customers who have already received chips have reported some issues with them and those issues are fixed before large scale production starts.,because server chips simply can't have problems after being deployed in customer installations.,what the problems actually are i don't think anyone is going to tell us.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

once the company realized it wasnâ€™t going to hit its initial 10nm projections back in 2015, it would have had to make a decision: did it try to de-couple process node and architecture to pull 10nm design changes back into 14nm, or did it keep going and bet on 10nm being available in the near-term future?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

intel raptor lake cpus support both ddr4 and ddr5 and it is an lga1700 socket.,will z790 support ddr4?,yes!,but the catch is motherboard manufacturers must make a ddr4 variant for these.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"most likely judging by the leaks, but another thing to keep in mind is in order to benefit from all the new features like dlvr a 700 series chipset motherboard is required!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not familiar with mobo market - does the generational change mean z690s will get cheaper?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, but no.",intel has told oems they don't want to see z790 ddr5 boards.,so any manufacturers that release them may face intel's wrath.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not massively cheaper, if at all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's highly probable.,"maybe ddr4 variants are limited to h770, b760, and h710 chipset motherboards.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if anything they will become more expensive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"liquid freezer ii, fits as it's supposed to.","only mobos that have issues with coolers are asus' mobos, due to how dumb their layout and vrm heatsinks are.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have mounted msi core liquid 360r v2 on my asus tuf gaming z690 wifi plus having lga 1700 socket,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't think you'll have any problems with name brand coolers on that motherboard.,"anything corsair, arctic, nzxt, asus should fit without a problem as long as it comes with lga 1700 mounting hardware.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think the aio that has had the most figment issues is the arctic liquid freezer 2, with the fan on the cpu block.",but it itâ€™s fine on the z690-a pro.,the latest one i bought even had the lga 1700 bracket kit in the box.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you are going to run an i9 12th gen there is only one that out performs all the other aioâ€™s on the market even the 420â€™s in cooling.,the ek elite 360 d-rgb aio.,"this is due to it having a high flow 3,300 rpm pump in a solid black nickel pump housing.",it uses the pump from the ek black nickel classic 360 d-rgb water cooling kit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and it fits good on the lga 1700 socket?,did you have to get an adapter?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"all the stock parts are good enough, i didnt buy anything else",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not sure where you live or what prices are like, but you'd be better off with an i3-12100f for $100+ $100 h610 board than getting a i7-7700 + lga-1151, both for gaming and multi-threading, and the 12100 will use less power too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not much.,better save up for something new in the mid range.,4 cores is kinda trashy and low end these days.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are highly unlikely to notice or gain any appreciable performance going from a 3770 -> 7700 when you have a gtx 1060 for gaming.,"you might notice the upgrade if your office work involves heavily cpu threaded tasks, but i doubt even there.","the i7-7700 is quite an old cpu at this point, i wouldn't bother especially since you have to upgrade from ddr3 to ddr4 anyways.",you won't see any gaming performance increase until you upgrade your gpu.,"at which point, then your cpu would be the weak link.","imho, you need a complete pc upgrade to experience any notable performance lift.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well if the 163$ is only for the cpu with out mother board and ram, then please do avoid it.",i3 12100 or 12300 is way better for the same amount of cores and threads.,plus you have a proper upgrade path.,with that add the cheapest msi motherboard (make sure its ddr4) you can afford and 2x8 gbs of ddr4 ram (3200 c16 is fine).,you are good go.,"now if for $163 you get motherboard and the cpu, then i think you can go for it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"go for 10th or 11th gen, don't waste money on that old cpu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is your question exactly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thank you so much for the advice, i'm going 10th or 11th gen",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the i7 7700 is faster, but honestly itâ€™s a dead end platform limited to 4 cores, so if you can, save up for at least for intelâ€™s newer sockets (minimum intel 8th/9th gen, those motherboards can accept 2,4,6 and 8 core cpus which are significantly better and you wonâ€™t have to upgrade so soon, or go ryzen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so should i go for that?,this is a second hand deal for $163?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seconded.,for budget 12100 is ideal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how much better performance will i have with the i7 7700 vs the i7 3770 with a gtx 1060 6gb?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,"the i3-12100f is better in basically every way, and the 7700 missed the windows 11 cutoff.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on the task.,"since you're not upgrading the gpu, depending on the game you might not see noticably better performance.",games/apps that rely heavily on the cpu will run significantly better.,i could tell you how much better the 7700 performs in synthetic benchmarks but it wont help you much in practice.,if it really is a good deal by all means go for it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"would a i3 10100f better, cause i can find in my region for just a little bit more brand new with 10th and 11th gen cpu support.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thank you so much, yeah it's quite a good deal so i'm planning on going for it, majority of my games that i struggled with were cpu intensive, so it should do me better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 12100f is the best i3 right now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i did a similar upgrade (8700k to 12700k) and it's definitely noticeable.,"the framerate isn't that much different, but the lows are smoothed out, any small stutters i had are now gone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my 9700k was bottlenecking me in quite a few games with my 3080. moved to a 12700k and that was fixed, also 1% lows are much much better.","however a 12900k isnt needed unless you do multi-threaded workloads and not just gaming, a 12700k is way more than enough, and even a 12600k would be a big upgrade.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you can upgrade to 9900/k/kf and save yourself the trouble replacing the mb, etc...and sell the 8700",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do u game in 1080p?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12700k is the better otpion imo especially for gaming since it is much easier to cool,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
appreciate the feedback.,gonna check into that one.,didn't consider it but everyone is saying that over the 12900 for sure haha.,wasn't aware the 12900 was as overkill as people have said.,i may game at 4k at some point but i really enjoy my higher frames at 1440 vs about half at 4k.,just like how smooth it is.,"i will say i have a ton of micro stutters in some games, mostly mmos but there are a few aaa titles as well.",i play xiv a ton so i'm looking to bump that some since it's pretty cpu hungry at times.,also saves me a ton of cash going 12700 over 12900 apparently now that i'm looking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i actually don't mind the mobo due to my wife needing upgrades so i plan to put both the 8700 and z390 into her pc.,saves money opposed to buying new stuff for both.,i would spend about the same if i just did hers so figured i'd take care of us both for the price of one.,lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1440,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
currently using a kraken aio.,would that counter it enough?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm very happy with the 12700k, i decided against the 12900k due to the extra heat it generates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is it a 120mm or 240mm?,"if it is any of that, i would stay away from the 12900k considering that it gets to 85c using a 360mm arctic liquid freezer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's a 240. the z63.,keeps my current under 40 but yeah that sounds like a nightmare so if it's truly overkill (even for future 4k) then i'll definitely go 12700.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i thought the z63 was 280?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"believe it or not, 4k is the least demanding on cpu compared to other lower resolutions",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i didn't bother requesting it, can't even tell it's not there.","your plan of buying and returning coolers is petty and a waste of fuel, shipping material and creates a loss for arctic that will eventually be passed down to us consumers.","yeah it shouldn't take this long for you to get the part, but there are plenty of other coolers you can buy if you don't have the patience and it bothers you that much.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i did contact them in february, received 1700 kit, was written on waiting list for cover.","and it's june now :p. i refunded the strix d4 and got a-pro instead, so it's a w/e for me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same here.,contacted them in january and was put on a waiting list.,"have contacted them a couple of times after that and the answer is still the sameâ€¦waiting for the production of the new coverâ€¦

edit: wrote to arctic again yesterday and now the cover is on the way ðÿ™‚",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why donâ€™t you remove the cover and use it without until the part arrives?,canâ€™t you read how to do it?,why should amazon get your trash?,they do destroy a lot of returned items for fucks sake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

im unable to run xmp on my 11700kf with 3200c14 on aorus master z590.,(2x16) g.skill.,"4*8 3000mhz c15, xmp runs fine at 2933mhz gear 1",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"mixed ranks are not ideal and sketchy to do anything with, but if you're only running xmp you'll be fine.","you've simply got different ics on your sticks, as the model doesn't come with predefined dies, like 3200c14 or such does.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it would matter if mixing the single rank and dual rank, but 3200mhz is not very close to the limit of imc for your cpu so it's unlikely a problem.",based on your trfc i blind guess the single rank set is a hynix mjr binned for 2666mhz.,"not sure what is the samsung one, might be a good idea to take a look using thaiphoon but i guess it won't be a good die, so it might be more difficult to stablize this one (two rank is usually more difficult).","if it is unstable, it may be helpful to put this ""weaker"" dual rank stick in the preferred slot mentioned in your motherboard manual, usually #2 / #4 slot.","&#x200b;

there should be very little performance issue if it is stable.",benchmark would likely follow the read / write number for the slower stick but the copy is usually not affected much as long as the cl is not too extreme (xmp is usually good for it).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wasn't sure where to post this.,"here are my specs:

mobo: asus tuf b560m-plus

cpu: intel i7 11700kf

memory: g.skill ddr4 3200 f4-3200c16d-32gvk x 2 (64gb total memory)

got one kit from newegg and the second from ebay.",they are the same model number so i figured they would have the same specs.,should i be worried about any performance issues with them having different ranks and timings?,"slots 1 and 3 are dual rank

slots 2 and 4 are single rank.","xmp is enabled in bios and the memory is reporting in windows 11 task manager as 3200.

bump system voltage and vccio to 1.25 v.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no *performance issues* iâ€™d say (but possible stability issues), basically the dual rank sticks will perform a bit better than the single rank ones.","however, it wonâ€™t really be noticeable unless you have a memory-bound workload.","keep in mind for the future that just because two kits of memory have the same capacity and xmp spec, doesnâ€™t mean youâ€™ll get the same ics on the sticks.","here youâ€™ve got hynix 16gbit ics on the sr sticks and samsung 8gbit ics on the dr sticks, not sure which ic type they are since almost anything can do 3200c16.",you might want to consider running a memory stress test to ensure your xmp oc is stable because of the mismatch in rank configurations.,as it may put more strain on the memory controller and your mobo might set unstable sub timings since it may expect all the sticks to be single or dual rank.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the only possible issue is memory channel number.,if you have dimms with different arrangements (size and/or rank) you should place them accordingly in the motherboard.,judging by your screenshot (it says 2x64 bit) you've already installed them in a suitable way.,i also just learned that intel relaxed their requirements for dual channel operation so probably all combinations will work in dual channel mode.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and here i thought only corsair did this bullshit.,"guess i'll hesitate on recommending buying g.skill as well in the future, unless it's a full kit and the person doesn't think of adding more later down the line.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thanks for the reply!,any stress test tools you recommend?,"if its not stable, do i need to replace these two kits with a single 64gb kit since it seems getting two kits exactly alike are rare.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's literally the business model of g.skill, corsair, crucial, team group, adata, and whatever other vendors i can't remember at the moment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ehh, yeah it works but it was kind of an excuse to get some rgb memory.",might have a couple people wanting to buy the two 32gb kits so i'm not really out much money.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'd use one of the recommended tests from here: https://github.com/integralfx/memtesthelper/blob/oc-guide/ddr4%20oc%20guide.md#recommended

in particular i like the tm5 test and use it personally.","also one pass is not enough, i'd probably run it overnight while you're sleeping/at work.",if it's not stable then just lower the frequency or loosen the timings on the xmp profile until it's stable.,if you don't wanna deal with that then you can grab a 2 x 32gb or 4 x 16gb kit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the 10900k has a pl1 and a pl2.,"the pl2 is 240 but at stock it lasts for 54 seconds, so for that amount of time it can boost to 4.9ghz and consume up to 240w.","usually, the reason you buy a 10900k is to have it run unlimited and consume as much as it wants.","anyways, you can change these numbers from the bios, so you can set the pl2 for example to 200 watts and have it last indefinitely",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"you've got a high quality 360mm aio, with the appropriate lga 1700 mounting kit.",the 12900k is a hot beast but it should be fine if you're keeping it stock or near stock.,isn't there a more airflow oriented version of the o11?,if you're concerned that might be worth looking into.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

110bclk is too high and is likely causing the cpu to go into a failsafe state or just downclocking plus the 110 bclk.,you might need more voltage for this clock speed too.,cpu downclocking under load is likely because of power limit stuff.,"because all cores are loaded, more power is being drawn and not as much voltage can be applied to each core.","thus, you get a lower frequency on high load.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what motherboard are you using?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"true, but in this case i assume that after not posting, instead of requiring a manual cmos reset the board is resetting the bclk to 100mhz so it can boot successfully.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just because the setting is exposed doesn't mean you can set whatever value you want.,"there's no external clock generator on your motherboard, and you likely don't have the option ""unlock bclk oc"" in ""extreme tweaker\tweaker's paradise"" which is necessary to enable in asus bioses.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"set power limits to unlimited before doing any overclock, also get rid of any avx offset there is.","yeet intel xtu too, if you use that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you are right, seems that i'm unable to actually do any kind of bclk oc on my mobo, that's why the change on bclk wasn't doing something to my core clock frequencies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what is your question?,"the ""cd quality"" and ""studio quality"" settings are for setting the sample rate of the motherboard audio driver.","cd quality is 16 bit, 44.1khz sample rate, and ""studio quality"" could be something like 24 bit, 96khz or 192khz.","if you don't know what these mean, or why you might want to choose one over the other, i'd leave it alone, tbh.","the highest quality audio most encountered is probably 24 bit, 48khz - dvd quality.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

keep the i7.,the hyper threading alone makes it that much better then the i5.,you only gain so much performance with increasing clock speeds.,(i had a 7600k running at 5.1 all day just to try and run games like bfv and oh boy the cpu was pinned at 100% all day long.,barely scraping by with an inconsistent 60 fps).,"also there's a good chance with i7 you can ""overclock"" it by locking it to its highest boost frequency.",depends on the motherboard but i've seen some very basic boards have this functionality.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

first time?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this socket is even larger than skylake x's lga 2066 with quad channel ddr4.,i think it's a wait and see until intel releases official information about meteor lake since this is still a rumor and lga 2551 could be for something other than meteor lake-s?,"this socket could also only be for 15th gen arrow lake, though intel's track record of sockets for every two generations suggests otherwise.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's baffling to me.,i'm no chipset/cpu designer but i can't think of a reason other than ripping users off a motherboard each year that intel couldn't over design and futureproof a socket/chipset to last more than 3+ years.,i genuinely believe it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not mlid, the source of the rumor.",he said lga1700 will last at least 3 generations.,if this is true it lasted less than the 2 years a normal intel socket lasts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep.,lga1800 is a curious topic.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"lga1700 does, in fact have 1800 pins and is future compatible with raptor lake (which will require the additional pins that alder lake isn't using for additional power delivery).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but how dare amd *only* support 4 generations of cpus on one socket.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've been on the same amd chip for a couple of years now: any upgrade for amd would also require new motherboard and ram.,"i have never kept a cpu for such a short period of time that i could just drop in a new cpu, even on amd.",i skilled pcie 3.0 entirely.,"so tl;dr it makes no difference to me if intel or amd keep a socket for two generations or five (although tbh if i had bought one of those shit am4 apus back in 2016, i might have bought a ryzen 2000 part to put in just because the difference was unusually spectacular).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13th aka raptor lake you can keep your mobo as it's usually the case :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"right now iâ€™m using a 5600 x, but i might get a 5800 x or 5950 x to tide me over until a matured generation is released for am5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i agree but also disagree.,i would love to get 3 cpus per socket to help with mobo costs.,the downside of that is it can stunt growth.,kind of like how the early ps5 games sucked become they devs had to make them compatible with the ps4 version.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"donâ€™t worry, they wonâ€™t, all you get is ""long life for socket am5"" which is just non-commital lip-service.","although even if they did commit, youâ€™d be stupid to believe them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why are you sticking to amd?,cause youll get support 2 years late for cpus that are now 2 years old?,lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i hope not pcie 6 and ddr6 are coming soon.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i sure do love recieving support for cpus when they are 2 years old,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
z690 supports alder lake and raptor lake.,the norm has always been 2 generations per socket.,this isn't a blow to anyone unless they were betting against an almost certainty.,"plus most people don't upgrade every other cpu launch, they buy and hold for 5 generations then rebuild.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel has been supporting 2 cpu generations per socket for 10+ years and it's no different with lga 1700/1800 (same socket, different name).",anyone expecting something different without intel announcing long term socket support is just playing themselves.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this is a completely normal release cycle for intel, further i have never built a new pc within the amount of time that the longest socket has ever been supported even amds.",lastly as the cpus change new sockets are required just to be able to properly support new technologies.,so to this whole multi-gen support thing means little to me and many other consumers.,an extra $250 every five to seven years as an adult is nothing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they will probably add a separate power rail for the e-cores, so that we won't have to feed the e-cores with stupidly high voltages to keep the p-cores at high frequencies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was really hoping that we would start seeing a trend in the opposite direction with meteor/arrow lake in regards to power consumption.,if this is the case that is extremely disappointing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
more pins doesnâ€™t necessarily mean more power.,these chips are hard enough to cool as is.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think there are so many pins because there are going to be a ton of cores.,need more bandwidth to make use of them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not necessarily higher tdp.,you just need more pins for more amps of power delivery.,if voltage has gone down more than amps goes up - more pins for power delivery with less tdp.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"more pcie would be awesome, it was something i really hated about the higher end boards is they lack pcie, and with higher core count parts people run more things like sfp+ and sfp28 network cards most take 8 lanes alone.",also this would make a better setup for low power servers if intel would just support ecc on all chipsets.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and even more cores.,32+,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pcie gen6?,we barely use gen4 and 5 is just new.,why?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ddr5 is natively 4 ch (half width) so you'd have to expand it to 8ch (as some lpddr5 uses in very high end laptops like thinkpad carbon at quarter width.,except half width 8ch on desktop?),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it dropped my top end temps by 8c so i'd say it was worth the investment.,do keep in mind my cpu cooler has a flat surface and because of that the warping cpu ihs affected me more than it would the majority of people who own coolers that ship with a surface that isn't flat.,"this isn't an issue exclusive to alder lake, however it's more pronounced due to the shape of the ihs and the way the stock ilm clamps it down which is why it became such an outspoken topic on alder lake cpus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

tom has stated for a while now zen 4 and raptor lake will be competitive.,i find it extremely hard to believe a 8+16 chip could compete with a potentially 32 core zen 5 chips that rgt claims they will be producing.,"even if they still remain at 16 cores, what is even more worrying for meteor lake is the clock speed regression.","an ipc increase of 15 percent sounds great, until you realize tom also thinks that clocks will just reach 5ghz, and that means clocks regressed by like 10 percent.","arrow lake will be at the 2h of 2024. intel themselves kinda confirmed this when they said intel 20a will be manufacturing ready by 1h 2024. assuming \~2 quarters for ramp, they will be launching mid-end 2024. 

i agree tho, arrow lake might end up having a node advantage vs amd zen 5/zen 6. 

it took them 2 years to get out zen 4, but it took them like 14 months to get from zen to zen+, 15 months to get from zen+ to zen 2, and then another like 15 months from zen 2 to zen 3. it seems like zen 4 is the outlier more than anything.",why zen 4 is coming so late is anybodys guess.,"could be them waiting for ddr5, waiting for better 5nm availability, or maybe there were delays who knows.","i mean i don't think zen 4 was delayed, amd always said 2022 to my knowledge, so i could be wrong.","but either way, it looks like the 2 year wait for zen 4 is more of a exception rather than the general trend.","and also, amd still released a 3-d cache variant in between that added 20 percent ipc in games.","with the additional resources, both financially and man-power wise, i would not be surprised if amd was able to shrink the 15 month time between generations to 12 months.",lastly i think it is safe to assume that amd won't have any hiccups.,their execution in the past couple of years has been exemplary.,he doesn't even say amd will crush the competition either.,"he ends the video saying this isn't what he promises will happen, but is worried could happen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if you want i suggest to try and undervolt.,you should be able to do around  75mv to 125mv or .075-.125v.,the people that get higher fps with that cpu probably have higher turbo power limits,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"unfortunately, overclocking is not possible with that cpu (at least officially)

as for power limit, that's something that is adjusted in your motherboard's bios.","unless you have a z490 or z590, it's quite possible that you are unable to adjust the power limit.","also, warzone is a cpu and especially gpu intensive game.","when you're playing your game, is either the cpu pegged at 100% or your gpu at or near 100%?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
warzone is a badly programmed game so i donâ€™t know what you expect more?,it needs more cpu and faster ram and a better gpu to get it to show more fps.,https://youtu.be/ohcuanpjcke,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
make sure yout mobo has good vrms.,hardware unboxed has a video on it.,my b560m aorus elite has a preset for a 85w long-term limit and 105w short-term limit.,its a good reference.,"but if you want max performance, setting both to around 100w should do the trick.",just be mindful of temperatures and power consuption.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"

the issue with your board is that your vrms aren't covered by heatsinks so they get hot fast, which means that your cpu can't maintain power limits for very long.","i couldn't find any guides on your bios for the msi h510m-a pro, so you'd have to check to see if you can change power limits on your cpu before you continue (usually called long/short duration power limit)

if you do see those options, you could buy some heatsinks for your vrms and either some thermal paste or thermal pads, then put the heatsink on top of the vrms.",this way your vrms will be cooled better than they are now and they'll let you hit power limits for longer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that motherboard will almost certainly not allow you to raise the power limits.,you're most likely stuck with what you have with regards to power limits.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea so what?,a 3090 on a 10 core 10900k has issues holding 240 in the linked bench.,a 3060 ti not that powerful on badly written game.,the six core has not enough ipc for 1080p.,maybe you could gain some frames taxing the gpu with 1440p to lessen the burden on the 11400. iâ€™d wager the benched chip is like a solid ghz faster and uses overclocked b-die to the wall to get above 200 fps.,your motherboard even might bottleneck the chip.,there is many ingredients to a build and getting everything out of a non overclockable chip on a budget is not gonna happen.,the worst thing is there is no real benchmark in warzone to verify the differences.,another factor might be player density on a specific part of the map.,is your game on a fast drive.,how much and what clock of ram do you use.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

so they offer really slutty prices.,amd did it when they couldn't compete with pascal.,the $199 segment is seriously under represented right now.,"that gets me a 6500xt, a card barely faster than an rx480 from 6 years ago?",yeah nah.,they can sell em at a loss at worst if they have to.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

arc is  a starting point not the end point.,we already know what mobile does.,nvidia and ati (now known as amd) all started with lack luster products and learn from there or went defunct.,intel doesn't have huge investments in this and their  backbone/spine systems are second to none for getting products to market.,there are more cpu/computers than there are copies of windows.,they will definitely find a segment in the market and make money.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"a lot of software that is supposed to run fast has this ""code change based on hardware"" feature.",it is there to utilize better the certain hardware it's running on.,"intel has much higher market share, so logically there can be more optimizations for intel than for amd.","or ryzen architecture just isn't as good at this certain workload, as i can see that all the 5000 ryzen perform basically the same it means this is pure single thread.","alder lake has significant single thread lead over zen3, and even tiger lake is slightly faster.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1/1800\*16=8.889ns, so actually a slightly longer time to respond.","in this specific case i would pick for the 'slower' ram, as it's actually faster to respond.","the clock speed mainly effects the total bandwith (how fast data can flow through), which generally only becomes semi limiting on high end (i7 overclocked/i9) cpu's.","&#x200b;

come on.,the demo was a game which saw multiple cores boosting to 5.5ghz.,they publicly stated that too.,and it was an engineering sample from april.,5nm is a pretty substantial improvement from 7.,20% speed or 40% efficiency gain.,that's pretty big.,amd is also using a custom version optimized for higher clockspeeds.,"even if doubled l2 increases latency a bit, which it might not due to smaller process node, it will substantially increase hit rate therefore increasing the chips performance.",and don't forget the v cache version which most likely will smoke intel in gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

they are the same frequency.,"but i don't think that's necessarily true, because the igpu power draw will contribute towards the 35w tdp limit on t cpus.",but i don't know how much igpu can draw in heavy workloads.,that is likely the biggest indicator.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> they are the same frequency.,no they are not.,refer to the ark page to see and compare full specifications.,"also, even if gpu specs are same, the power limits are limits for whole package, not just cpu, so gpu might end up being slower in combined workloads.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the igpu frequencies are the same, only the cpu frequencies are different.",i did check.,"ok if it's true that gpu eats into the 35 tdp, then i agree the gpu might be slower when it hits thermal limits.","but for pure accelerated workloads where the gpu is uninhibited because cpu cores are chilling, then i expect performance to be identical for accelerated workloads.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1) did op say he's only gaming?,so you basically assumed that?,right?,2) in my country mortar is 50$ cheaper.,also i told him about tuf b660 which is almost as good as mortar.,"why are you steering him towards expensive mobo, you can clearly see he's trying to save every buck by going non f and non k.
3) i didn't say anything about this.",i said about performance difference he'll get by getting 12700k which is about 10 percent when oced in production workloads.,"i also told him it's not necessary but to keep in consideration if he has some extra cash (i wrote this clearly)
4) i'm completely right about speed difference.",there are many benchmarks available.,check 3600 cl16 vs cl18.,it's not even 1 percent in most of the tasks.,here i'm trying to help and you're misguiding him.,keep in check what you say from the next time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep it has wifi 6. which supports speed upto 9.6gbps which is much more than you'll ever need so it's more than enough,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep these all 4 drives are cutting edge at the top.,so get cheapest one in your region.,it's the kingston for me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"lol, its not a bad board actually the only difference is the additional power filtering which tbh 99% of people will never need or use.",i like to play with oc settings outside of the pre configured settings.,one of my friends is running that same board with zero issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"depends on you, my 12700k is perfectly fine with 4000 mhz and boots with 4133 just fine too, but my kit is trash.",by far most locked alder lakes get stuck on either 3466 mhz or 3600 mhz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the tuf b660 motherboard allows to unlock power limits and is reasonably priced too.,the msi mortar does the same and is bit premium but costs more.,check the price difference between the two.,if it's 10$ get the mortar it it's more then get tha tuf b660.,they both performance exact same but mortar looks better and has some more usb ports.,not that you'll need.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
b660 is a bit more basic but i think you may want the h670.,you wanted the z690 for what reasons because if it was more ports and things like that then you can just get the h670.,[https://geekawhat.com/z690-vs-b660-motherboards-what-are-the-key-differences/](https://geekawhat.com/z690-vs-b660-motherboards-what-are-the-key-differences/).,that is a link that shows the differences.,the 690 also has better power delivery and cooling for the vrms but it doesn't matter because you aren't overclocking or really pushing the vrms hard with a not k cpu.,"basically, i would go for a 670 or 660 based on price.",if there is a big difference that go with the 660 but if there is a small difference or a 670 you prefer for other reasons then go for it instead.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you have a 12900k itâ€™s really up to you, honestly, though i still see no reason anyone should ever go above about $250 when buying a z690 board.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yup save money.,no need waste money,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's not just for overclocking.,you buy z series to get the feature rich board.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

need z690 so it is possible to upgrade cpu in the future.,i don't use wi-fi and usb only for mouse and kb.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes you still need them.,not all codecs are supported by nvedia.,even many h 264 and h.265 ones which are commonly used.,and they don't conflict with nvedia drivers.,it's long gone.,this used to happen 5-6 years ago.,many things have changed now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's much better to get ethernet.,won't cost huge.,the reception will be as good at external wifi chips.,don't worry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok then go for it man.,just out of interest what cpu will you go for later down the line?,12th or is it much later and 13th gen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok i need cancel my order and order k version with good p660m.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13 or 14.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"dude you're messing things up haha
non k b660
k with z690",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ehhh.,it seems like lga 1700 will only be for 13th and 12th gen based on what they showed us so keep that in mind with the idea to upgrade,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what's should i do then?,12700f shipped will be here after 3 days.,still i can return it and get !2700kf.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't think intel will change it too fast.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why are you getting kf or f. i told you get with 12700 or 12700k.,you'll regret later not having that igpu.,return that 12700f and get 12700. simple.,and you've have money get 12700k and be done with it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
on the socket cover it says 12 and 13 gen and also it would be normal considering the past and how normally every 2 years they switch sockets,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"temps in the 80s under load are warm, but fairly normal for an i9.",it definitely shouldn't be crashing due to those temps.,"to answer your question though, you can check out an overclocking guide for your motherboard, but just focus on the voltage aspect rather than increasing core clocks.","not sure what board you're on, but my asus board allows me to adjust the auto voltage cap, which is what i've done.",if you have a similar option that might be easier.,"your board may also default to a profile using multicore enhancement, which allows the cpu to exceed intel's specifications.",if you can find and disable that it may also help keep voltage/temps in check.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

>but i'm a bit concerned about the dedicated vram size in the intel uhd graphics adapter.,only 128 mb!,someone asks this every week or so.,you have an igpu with no vram at all.,"the 128mb listed there is for compatibility with very old windows software that expects all computers to have dedicated vram, which hasn't been the case in 20 years.",>is there any way to twitch my cpu so it can perform better graphics wise?,usually if you care about graphics then you buy a computer with an actual gpu.,"the igpu is serviceable for running normal windows programs, but the hardware is pretty limited.",not much you can do about that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

although, if you lower the color chroma to 4:2:0, with no hdr, you could get 120hz on hdmi 2.0.

"> msi stealth 15m a11sek

you need to make sure that the color format is set to 4:2:0.
your laptop is hdmi 2.0 which means it is only compatible with 4k @120hz at a compressed color format like 4:2:0. if you set the computer to rgb or 4:4:4 the higher refresh rate options will simply disappear.",you can check the table for hdmi versions and supported resolutions in the wikipedia article.,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hdmi#version_2.0

little hot but it's well within the safety margin so it won't damage anything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
normal and safe but you can get much lower temps with a better cooler.,"personally i like as  low temps as possible, but 70-80 while gaming won't significantly decrease the life of your chip.",you'll be onto the next build before that ever happens.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

definitely no problem.,but i do recommend for you to get a cooler to reduce the thermals even more for longevity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that really is hard to say without knowing your ambient temperature and what cooler you're using.,"if you're using the stock intel cooler, that's absolutely normal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you are good, however i'd recommend going for any budget cooler for $50/60, i myself bought a deepcool assassin iii for my 12700f and even maxing it out on heavy workload i get 55/60 degrees as maximun, quite surprising.",also if you undervolt you could probably get a lower temp as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my 12700k with the noctua d15 runs at about 50-60c while gaming.,the stock cooler is kinda booty.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

normal?,not quite.,safe?,"yes, very much so.",the maximum tdp for a 12700k/12700 is 100c.,just grab yourself a better cooler and you'll see a massive improvement!,good luck.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
disable ht while gaming.,cuts temps drastically.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the worst that can happen is minor thermal degradation which won't be noticeable except in benchmarks 5+ years from now.,i wouldn't worry about it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's okay but not really great for long term use...but when you get the chance, upgrade your cooler.",some good suggestions from the comments already given but even a cheap and cheerful cooler like the deepcool gammaxx 400 or cooler master hyper 212 will more than do a good job and drop temps significantly.,in fact anything is better than the stock cooler especially for a cpu like 12700.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the only ""peace"" to be had is if it's reduced noise level, maybe.",cpus are really robust.,take a look around you.,how many decade-old sandy bridge systems are still out there?,how many older still core 2 systems are still being used?,"i guarantee you the vast majority of them are stock cooled, or cooled with some prebuilt oem equivalent of the stock cooler.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

uhâ€¦you really want av512 for emulators just assign an avx offset (adjusts clock ratio when running avx..easy thing in bios) if itâ€™s too spicy.,processing errors can occur above 85 f in intel chips so thatâ€™s really where you want to keep the temps.,"itâ€™s not dangerous for the chip but yea, sub 85 f imo for daily driving.","obviously getting sub 85 w/0 avx offset in torture tests would be optimal for an overclock but yea, itâ€™s easily adjusted.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> just assign an avx offset (adjusts clock ratio when running avx..easy thing in bios) if itâ€™s too spicy.,"avx offsets are basically pointless on rocket lake and alder lake, as it's referenced against each core's boost limit.","if you run the cpu at stock, it's therefore only going to impact single-threaded workloads unless you apply a ridiculous offset.","at stock, the 11700k will single-thread boost to 5.1 ghz on 2 cores, 5.0 ghz on the other 6, while all-core is at 4.6 ghz.","you need an avx offset of **6** to even see it effect all-core workloads, the frequency will be 4.5 ghz on 2 cores, and 4.4 ghz on the other 6 cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

maybe it turbo boost too high on one core causing it to freeze because of too low voltage for said boost?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok. good.,you are on the right track.,next step is to go full custom loop.,you should be able to keep it under 60 with two 360 rads.,itâ€™s no that expensive if you shop around.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the undervolt is to large for idle stability you can get around this by locking idle clocks higher so u don't crash at idle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you find speed step in your motherboard it will have the same affect and turn off c states it will have the same affect.,i can't say for sure where they are on thay board though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"125mv is almost certainly too big of an undervolt, and thatâ€™s at least partially why youâ€™re seeing stability problems at idle.",iâ€™m sure any actual stress test isnâ€™t going to be happy either.,many of the â€œfixesâ€ here kind of counteract the whole point of you wanting to reduce voltage anyways.,can b660 boards do v/f curve offsets?,thatâ€™s a more modern undervolting solution that allows you to undervolt high multipliers (ie.,"when the cpu is actually working and drawing high voltage and producing heat) and leave middle and lower multiplier voltages alone, so you donâ€™t get idle or speed step instability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you have a cooling issue not a cpu voltage issue.,my 12900k rarely sees over 45c paying games at 120hz 4k it's also cooled by a 420mm rad with 3 140mm fans.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you have an unlocked chip.,you are supposed to overclock it to get it singing.,if you wanted a cooler less power hungry chip there are lots of options.,i can see your predicament.,you bought it and then realised you couldnâ€™t cool it.,so under volt all you like while you are calculating what cooling you require to make it work properly.,good luck!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i understand what you are saying.,itâ€™s all a balance.,i hope you can find a solution.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the easiest way set high performance mode in windows.,it will remove the idle clocks dropping.,idle temps may go up by a 1c or 2 but it will allow you to have a higher stable undervolt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes disable them.,it will basically make your cpu run at full speed and remove the idle stability issue.,your idle usage may go up by a few watts and heat by a 1c or 2 at idle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"more comparable and probably the hardest on processors other than crushing prim 95, cinebench runs 230w and still only manages to reach around 65c on multicore benching.",even avx512 benching shows 65c averages.,you either have a bent ihs or improper thermal paste application.,did you use the factory thermal paste with your aio?,do the fans ramp up when you processor is running that hot?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
go back to basics.,you need shed loads of airflow through your case.,thatâ€™s the first thing to address.,if you have a 360 cooler with three fans whichever way they blow you got to have double in the other direction.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
flat 0.19 offset.,"of course its not stable at light loads, since when its idle it drops to 0.5 volts and crashes, but it can run aida stress test for days at 1.03 volts.","to be precise, anything above 0.17 causes crashes in idle.",around 0.16 and lower is fine.,"obviously i can tinker the vf curve and make it stable at light loads as well but i'm kinda too bored to do that, so im running a 0.14 offset just to be sure",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yea without it even running say spotify you could run into times the clocks drop low enough at idle and cause a crash.,it's a much better fix then trying to make sure the cpu stays underload enough.,you should be good to go after the change and be able to keep the 125mv undervolt without issues,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is stable at full load.,"but when you are undervolting with an offset, you also undervolt the light loads.",so it basically crashes at idle because it drops idle voltage to 0.5. if i run a flat 1.05 voltage - no adaptive (which is basically a 0.19 offset) it's stable in everything.,i run aida with everything ticked.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ac loadline affects how much extra voltage is applied at load.,higher -> more voltage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
really?,even if you use the search function in bios?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have ran into this issue many a times in the past on undervolting laptops.,it's much less common on the desktop side as less undervolt.,but at a certain voltage cpus become unstable.,if you think about idle voltage say being .700 and load being 1.3v taking 125mv off 1.3 is fine but taking 125 off .700 is alot more percentage wise and ends up putting the voltage into a range where it's not stable.,so your options end up either use a lower undervolt or raise idle voltage which locking idle clocks will solve,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"haven't tried prime95, don't see the point honestly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"> haven't tried prime95, don't see the point honestly.","what a surprise, never heard that from someone overclocking before /s

if you don't experience any instability in your usage, don't worry about stability.","but claiming complete stability on any overclock is ignorant at best, there's always some edge case where you're ***not*** stable.","my own 12900k can run -0.10v offset for cinebench, it will also run your aida64 ""stress test"" just fine at the same voltage.",it will crash in less than a second after starting prime95 small ffts however.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
llc can work as u can reduce load voltage drop or increase it and you may be able to bring your load voltage down without affecting idle.,it is a much more trial and error method but may work well also with enough trial,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"î™ already told you im not running with a -0.19 offset, so why would i test with prime for settings i don't use?","im running -0.14 as a daily driver, and yes, i've tested prime / aida / itb / realbench with these settings.",maybe your sp is low if it's crashing at -0.10. mine is 96 on the p cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"you can overclock memory on this motherboard, and the overclocking tab will also allow you to lower voltage and/or clock speeds of the cpu if you want lower temperatures.","besides, even if you could overclock, the vrm of that motherboard would likely struggle somewhat with overclocking a 12600k.",that stock 150w will quickly reach 220w,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
idk man... when i had the ga-h170-hd3 it promised that i can overclock whatever cpu but yeah... now i have the z170 version of this same model with usb c port (ga-z170-hd3p) and still i can't oc the i3 6100...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you must convert back to console now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it does not matter, as far as i know there are no performance loss between h-series and z-series chipset.","surely maybe some performance loss because of the ram configuration, but in general its fine.",another mention is: on these motherboards with h-series chipset is some cpu voltage control ( that means you can undervolt the cpu to save a bit of energy and thermals),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and enable xmp if you haven't already!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
makes me wonder what is your main rig cpu if this is only used for decoding.,i was considering of upgrading my i7 4770 next month to something like i7 12700.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what?!,idk what you're talking about.,can you check this out: [https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/7j7tpx/z\_seires\_vs\_b\_series\_motherboards/](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/7j7tpx/z_seires_vs_b_series_motherboards/),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel have been using the z/b naming scheme on their chipsets for over a decade now.,"for some reason asus dont always name their boards like they should, they use their silly gamer names like ""asus rog maximus xi hero"" on many of their boards, which is stupid because you have to actually check the motherboard spec sheet to see which chipset it uses.",so its possible if you've only bought these boards with stupid names in the past its possible you may have missed it.,"for some reason only asus does this, all the other board manufacturers name their boards properly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there have always been motherboards that canâ€™t overclock.,this is just your fault.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this isn't an asus or msi thing, this is an intel thing, all z series chipsets can overclock, all b series cannot, plain and simple",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
has nothing to do with msi.,and msi is actually a pretty good manufacturer.,itâ€™s not a brand thing tho.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thank you for the information, that explain why i was able to offset the cores to - but not to +",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the vrm's on the b660m-a are pretty decent, it can actually handle the 250 from a 12900k quite well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's a non oc cpu my dude,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, definitely the first and last time i went for an msi board.",i should have stayed with asus all the way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh cool.,i have been looking at the 12600 but the deals are simply better and more abundant on the 12600k.,like $10 more for 4 extra e cores and likely a higher tier bin seems like a no brainer lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thx!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i use the asus maximus 12
i9 11900k
128gb ram at 4ghz
and an asus strix 3090



i used my old i7 4770k for decoding he was doing it for almost 10 years now.",since the i5 is so extreamly cheap i wanted to release this cpu int to intel heaven.,i cant belive this cpu run for so long overclocked.,i think its the best cpu i ever had.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"do the upgrade, while the 4770 is one of the best chips ever made in my opinion the new ones are just that much faster xd even the i5 12600k stock out of the box will rip my oc'd 4770k apart.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"it's an intel thing, not an msi thing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it has nothing to do with msi, if you bought an asus b660 board it would be the exact same scenario.","its out of the motherboard manufacturers control, its intel that dictates what b660 can and cannot do.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
msi has nothing to do with it.,blame intel.,buying a non z series board from asus would get you exactly the same results.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"isn't to do with msi, you picked the wrong chipset for the use case.",if you'd bought an asus board with the same chipset you'd have had the same issue.,for intel for many years only z series chipsets have supported oc via multi and only k cpus have generally supported it.,some but not all mid tier chipsets support memory oc.,"some 12th gen boards apparently support bclk oc beyond the usual 3mhz or so that you often get historically that ""might"" be an option even if not ideal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yup, haha.",i bought my i7 4770 in 2015 and it served me well.,it still works and performs great but sadly games are evolving constantly and i need to get constant 280+ fps.,when it comes to my graphics design needs and video editing i canâ€™t really notice anything major that would require an upgrade even until today.,i also considered getting an i5 12600k but at that point i might aswell spend 50â‚¬ more to get the i7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

then wtf were you expecting??,?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what happens to you in game fps when your gpu utilization drops?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"when you opened up more tasks in your computer, your cpu's work load becomes higher.",it is so high for your cpu that the cpu has to reduce the handling of the tasks delivered from the gpu.,this is why your gpu usage became even lower when you are streaming.,"in other words, your cpu is not powerful enough, especially in terms of its ipc.","i know it is an i9, but it is the shitty 11th gen, isn't it.","here's the solution: you need a cpu with higher ipc and lower processing latency, such as a i5-12600k or higher.","ps: you can monitor the gpu usage during high workload gaming, it is fine if you could give me a range like 60% - 70%... tell me how much it is.","then i can tell you what to do, if you still don't fully understand what i was talking about.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
does it happen when you are not streaming?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"check your vram, warzone has problems with clearing the vram.",after some played games your vram is almost full and then the harddrive is used instead of vram because of that you get less performance and the gpu doesnt have full bandwith.,the only solution i know right now is restarting the game.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you tried uninstalling nvidia geforce experience?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
welll my cpu temps donâ€™t reach more then 85. i guess that cpu can handle up too 100 temps,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i will say though i was reaching 90-96 temps for a solid 3 months before realizing thatâ€™s not normal and noticed all my apps running were utilizing my cpu.,but i fixed that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"after a couple of hours the game drops fps, the performance isnâ€™t the same basically it doesnâ€™t feel like how i first booted up the game.","i start at around 150-180 fps 
i drop to like 100-125",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i ended up buying the 12900k just to make sure it can handle all the task i need when streaming and gaming but iâ€™m ready to return it if thereâ€™s a better cpu or cheaper i guess that can do just as good as a job.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah itâ€™s a i9 11900k 

and right now iâ€™m gaming vanguard with no stream and i reach high 90s gpu usage with very low cpu usage",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
doesnâ€™t look like it.,just when i put more load on the cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah!,"yesterday i actually put my settings on high and my cpu bottlenecked like crazy, at least i think itâ€™s my cpu.",i went down to 60-80 fps.,had to go to back to all low settings again.,so you think this is just a game issue?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have a 5 year-old 7700k that runs close to 100c when maxed out and it is not failing, nor throttling just yet.","i get why it's not ideal, but far from catastrophic and you shouldn't bother about 85c.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's quite warm for gaming, even for the 11900k.",what kind of cpu cooler?,"what case, and what's the fan configuration?","hopefully it's got a mesh front, and not one of those awful closed off glass or plastic front panels; those are awful for airflow.","it shouldn't be throttling at 85c, but that's still not great.","i forgot to mention before, you should also be monitoring vrm thermals, as well as gpu thermals.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is it safe to assume your obs/slobs app is using the nvenc encoder to stream with as well right?,"i am all too familiar with ""optimizing"" your pc for warzone, did you happen to do that by following a youtube video or anything like that?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good choice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and overclock the cpu to 5.0-5.1ghz all core, but not too high.","too high is useless, too crazy overclocking can result in more computaional errors generated and more efforts (ipc & time) for the cpu to spend on correcting these errors.",ps:  you should be able to see an obvious performance boost with the 12900k.,btw.,"i personally used 9600k -> 9900k -> 10600k -> 11700k, and now i'm using 12600k.","i didn't buy the 12700k or 12900k not because of financial, but because that in the same generation of cpu, ofc higher codenames products have higher performance, but the performance/price ratio also drops exponentially due to the increase in the cost for higher-quality chips manufacturing.",cpu performance boost is much more pronounced in inter-generations than intra-generations.,i can't wait to see how the ryzen 7000 and intel 13th gen turn the 12th gen into trashes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"don't forget about fast ram, it is a huge performance boost in games.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes it is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hahah ummm yeahhh itâ€™s the glass case h510 or whatever.,whatâ€™s vrm thermals and gpu thermals?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i did!,so now my streamlabs obs is using my gpu usage instead of my cpu.,but idk still happens to bottleneck after a couple hours of playing rebirth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mmmm i do need to learn to overclock the cpu.,too scared to do it.,yeah i canâ€™t wait to see the new ryzen chip and 13th gen especially with this unreal engine coming out for games.,another thing actually happened last night while gaming.,i tried to put my settings on high to put more load on my gpu and i actually bottlenecked even more dropping my frames to 60-80!,this is still a cpu bottleneck correct?,my cpu usage was around 50 ish while my gpu was running at 80 ish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have 3200 mhz of ram.,you think i need more?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, that's not an ideal case for an 11900k and a 3080 ti pairing.",vrms are the components on the motherboard that provide power to the cpu (these get hot and can throttle).,"gpu is the video card, and with the h510, that card probably runs on the hot side.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gpu was running at 80 ish means that it still has 20% not being used.,hopefully the new cpu technology could boost gpu usage further.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"eh, hard to tell, but a high-end cpu deserves a high-end ram.",the 3200 is mid-tier.,"nothing wrong and it's quite unknown how much you would gain, as it scales with how much the cpu has to work and with how many cores it uses.",it is best to check youtubers to see if anyone is doing benchmarks for the games you care about.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no it will not help,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just use  throttlestop or intel extreme tuning utility.,i have a motherboard that is the least featured board of all boards.,a alienware r13.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
make sure to test you aren't losing speed when undervolting the cpu.,"clock speeds may appear fine in hardware monitors, but the cpu can stop boosting under load.",a quick way to test is occt cpu bench.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what's your boot drive?,unfortunately by the sounds of it any one of your parts could be causing the blue screen of death.,if you have another motherboard and cpu to troubleshoot with that would be the way to quickly figure out if your 12400 is faulty.,personally i had most of my blue screens because of faulty storage drives and after that the ram and motherboard are what i would try to swap out next.,"psu, maybe the cooler isn't on properly, a short in the case.",the cpu and gpu are typically the last things i consider to be faulty.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
storage is intel 670p.,"i can try different storage, ram, psu but unfortunately i donâ€™t have another $100+ to test on another motherboard right now.","one one blue screen an error appeared â€œigdkmd64.sysâ€ which i read is typically an intel driver issue, so thatâ€™s why i thought it may be my cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good stuff to swap out and test.,whatever you have.,"i feel a bit bad to ask this but your video cables are plugged into your 3050 and not your motherboard, right?",when you are done trouble shooting the other parts there should also be a way to turn off the igpu to see if that helps stop the bsod.,you're right that error is linked to intel drivers and people in general say it is the igpu drivers giving trouble.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"try 1 different ram module, in the correct slot (see motherboard manual) and make sure xmp isn't defaulting to on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i tried different ram in each slot, same issue.","and yes iâ€™ve been using the gpu to my display, but now iâ€™m trying with no graphics card installed and getting no display from motherboard, with a white led on the motherboard.",now to test another ssd and psu but have a feeling its either the motherboard or cpu that needs an rma,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think running w7 in a virtual machine would allow you to use a more modern cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you can use a much newer cpu, but 12th gen parts with e-cores wont schedule as well as it should, so a 12400, 12100, and 11th gen or older will all work fine.","there is no cut off, microsoft just isnt going to keep adding new cpu's to their support list of a discontinued os.","you can find people using modern cpu's on windows xp (just to try it out), windows 7 is no problem for a modern cpu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you know what you're doing you can install windows 7 on modern intel cpus.,but my guess is if you have to ask this question it means you don't likely dont.,i believe the 6th generation (i7 6700k) is officially the most recent cpu that officially supports windows 7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"from a thread with this same question i participated in 42 days ago, the issue isnâ€™t so much cpu support as functional drivers for chipset support.","for example, when windows 7 has no built-in drivers for the usb chipset on the motherboard, you literally cannot get a working mouse and keyboard to install working drivers, should they even exist.","it is apparently suggested to get a motherboard with a ps2 port, as those will work out the box.",folks have even gotten alder lake to work with windows 7. but windows 7 bios support on alder lake is spotty.,many motherboards (specifically as rock and gigabyte) cause bsods.,apparently youâ€™re more likely to get it working on an asus board.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all the latest cpus can run win 7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"officially 6th gen, technically 7th gen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6th gen was the last gen with win7 support.,i myself bought a used 6440hq laptop yesterday because i needed win7 for some work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you may be able to install it on newer cpus, but then there will be no win7 drivers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11 gen and lower will work fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
newest i've ever ran 7 on was a z390 board with modified usb drivers with a 9th gen chip.,"newest i'd run with 7 would be 10th gen, maybe 11th.",i'd avoid 12th gen due to p and e cores unless the e cores are off.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but how do you find the supported drivers if youâ€™re using 12th cpu?,"for example, for thinkpad laptop, iâ€™ve contacted with lenovoâ€™s support, and they replied that if the cpu is above 6th cpu, then they donâ€™t have the supported drivers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's not really worth it to use one of the old hybrid drives.,"if you want the benefits of optane, save up for a larger unit you can install your os and most commonly used programs on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
brian has your answer.,it really wonâ€™t help you so youâ€™re better off just getting a newer bigger ssd when you can for an os drive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if your dead set on trying it out, set up a cache with primocache.","you can find m10 16gb for around $10 on ebay, primo cache has a free 30 day trial but is â‰ˆ$30 if you decide you want it.","i ended up getting some cheap server grade 1tb nand drives and run those in raid 0, otherwise i deal with slow 6/8tb platters for seldom used content.","i have like 4 unused 16gb optane sticks lying around, still use all my 118 gb sticks as standalone fast drives whil attempting to resist the temptation of picking up cheap 905p 1tb drives.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
honestly?,get a larger ssd instead of optane.,"optane has always seemed really gimmicky to me, and i doubt itâ€™s the most value-oriented way to go about things.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as youâ€™ve learned, m series optane drives do not work with alder lake, and h series hybrid drives only accelerate the integrated ssd.","for archive purposes, just live with the hard drives.","if you need bigger storage for active use, a cheap ssd is probably the way to go.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, thatâ€™s sad.","but, come to think of that, the more i read about optane the less i understand why was it even made, considering the way intel treated it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how are the temps of the 800p?,"i'm thinking of getting one to replace my os on my c612 machine, but only if the temps are not like the 905p 380gb m.2 version (low-mid 60s c) as that machine renders out videos for days on end & gets hot.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the problem with getting an ssd is that iâ€™d probably need a couple of those, because the drive is also an archive one, meanwhile only some of the files are being used often, thatâ€™s why i thought of boosting it instead of getting more ssds.","the offers i found for optane are relatively cheap, thatâ€™s why i thought of getting one instead of paying extra for more drives",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i see now, thanks for clearing things out",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"temps are about the same, they are rated up to 85c and put off about 5 w of heat.",as the 800p are only 2x lane pcie they won't draw as much power and heat output as 900/905p as they are bandwidth bottlenecks.,"but ultimately your results will depend on airflow in the case, i have used a heatsink in the past but optane doesn't mind the heat, if you have other components that are sensitive making sure you got airflow over the area should negate that concern.","either way, its much better than first generation slc nand server drives i have, those will cook themselves without active cooling(direct air flow).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the productivity results are impressive.,"gaming not so much, but i was expecting much worse to be honest.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

last i've seen intel's dtt was still causing power / utilization issues in the arc graphics and i believe the tests shown here have dtt enabled.,it's possible that the dtt bug is causing lower than expected gaming results.,[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jicy7aybpf0) is an example of the dtt bug in action on an arc laptop.,not the gpu utilization.,dtt is currently enabled by default in intel + intel systems since the xe iris max dedicated graphics was released.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

has their architecture changed much from their regular igpu configuration at all?,something tells me all they've done is scale up their 12th gen igpu and slapped on some gddr and have called it a day.,i would have expected them to switch up their architecture for their first discrete product.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"

tiger lake-alder lake igp are based on xe-lp, which obviously share some similarities to xe-hpg, since most companies share core architectures like that between product lines but is its own thing and has quite a few architectural changes to cater to gaming and consumer compute oriented tasks, such as the matrix engines and ray tracing units.","dg1, that passive oem only dgpu from last year was xe-lp in discrete form.","there have been some good write ups on this from anandtech and others, but the main source of information comes from the 2021 architecture day where they discussed arc/xe-hpg https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ju_yhz1nqa",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's supposed to be different no?,dg2 cores have matrix accelerators and ray-tracing cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">something tells me all they've done is scale up their 12th gen igpu

as much as that is possible, i don't think they did that.","they actually _already_ scaled up the 12 gen igpu(which is the same as their 11th gen one), in the form of iris xe max graphics(dg1, their latest arc graphics are dg2).","those cards sucked, especially for gaming, no where near the levels of the new arc graphics we're seeing now.",so they had to have altered(improved) the architecture in order to bring the kind of performance we're seeing now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, there are some changes but more of a rebalancing to make it scale better.",also they say it can achieve both 50% higher clocks and 50% higher perf/watt.,"yes, it uses somewhat better process, but 50% will have to be done with circuit optimizations.",also they said they had to beef up things like the load/store unit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"dg1 isn't arc, but using xelp.",dg1 is just a higher clock version of iris xe.,it has the same max 96eus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

definitely call them back because itâ€™ll show that youâ€™re eager for the job.,"tell them about your situation too, you may not need to do an interview for the 2nd job, the hiring manager might recommend you for hiring (thatâ€™s whatâ€™s done on other sites anyway) even if you donâ€™t get the first job.",then you might have an informal chat with the manger from ltd and he will gauge from that if youâ€™re suitable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you on blind?,post this there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for your suggestion.,i hope that's the case and i don't have to interview for the 2nd job.,it does take a long time for the interviews to take place.,i will contact the hiring manager next week and share my situation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you're staying below 80c then better cooling isn't going to do anything, you aren't thermal throttling.","iirc rust is a cpu intensive game anyways so your cpu ""bottlenecking"" the gpu sounds normal.",your temps seem fine to me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"**thank you to everybody for trying to help me in this situation, turns out my cpu didnt have all the cores and threads enabled so that was the cause of high usage.",only thing i need now is a better cooler so the cpu does not get too hot.,**,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
stock cooler?,then that temperature is normal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you have single channel ram?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a better cooler will help as it will allow the 12700 to sustain clocks higher for longer.,"i have a feeling that your motherboard is also the limiting factor as h610 motherboards are really not that good and for something like a 12700, i would have gone at least b660, something like the msi pro a...as the 12700 is a very good cpu especially coupled to the 3070t!",you should be getting exceptional performance.,"most h610 motherboards have a lower end power delivery system with little to no cooling on the vrm's and when sustaining high loads on the cpu, this could be a limiting factor along with the fact that h610 may not allow turbo boost over a set time something that you can remove on b660 and z690..

so b660 coupled to some cheap and cheerful ddr4 3200 ram which has come down in price to as little as $59 for 2x8gb...3600 below if you ever move to b660..

which h610 motheboard do you have?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">stock cooler on the cpu

...is the problem",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so the motherboard is the reason usage stays at 100% and gpu is barely used?,im pretty sure there's no cpu bottlenecking here right?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hey, nice that you figured that out, and very weird that you only had 2p cores available lol.",but how's the temperature and cores looking right now?,i believe that must've skyrocketed.,bit worried about the clock really.,"now that you have all cores enabled, i don't think your mobo you take it well haha.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think its in dual channel 8 + 8 1333mhz each,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks for the suggestion, ive got h610m h ddr4",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
should i invest in a hydro cooling system?,if so what do you suggest,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, i'm saying in this specific case you cpu appears to bottleneck a very cpu intensive game.",mb will never be the issue if you aren't thermal throttling or not getting enough power into the chip.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
temperatures are still running around 70-80. what do you mean its not gonna take it well?,is there any chance it will get fried or something?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"its dual channel, at 2666 frequency is kinda low, but your board does not support oc.","it may be lower fps because of that, but not by that much.",something else might be the issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a solid $50 air cooler will do - the scythe fuma 2, deepcool ak620 and thermalright frost spirit 140 are my current favourites.","itâ€™s also likely that youâ€™ll be vrm throttling anyway since h610 boards have horrible power delivery, so you might be dropping 20-30% of your maximum stock performance on that alone, and more if the default power limits are low.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the feedback.,so what can i do to fix it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"naw, my bet is that it's vrm ain't gonna take the power of the 12700 when in heavy use, so it's gonna throttle, losing clockspeed, and therefore, performance.","i'm curious if it somehow will not tho, that's why i'm asking for a screenshot in game now that everything seems like it's working as it should.","even if it's losing clock speed, i think it's not gonna be a huge problem during gaming, even though i've seen time a time again a motherboard that just can't take the cpu when being heavily used.",they usually just turn off the pc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so i need a better cooler and a better motherboard?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is nothing to fix based on what i see.,your system is operating normally and at fullest capacity for this specific use case (rust).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"depends how many all-core workloads youâ€™re running (the cpu will only push the full 180w in all-core workloads and tends to game at closer to 65w, so you might well be fine on h610 and the stock cooler if youâ€™re just gaming), but if you want your system to perform to its full potential in productivity, youâ€™ll need a solid b660 motherboard and a decent $50ish cooler.","for the motherboard, iâ€™d recommend the msi pro b660m-a ddr4 - itâ€™s about $130, its vrms are rock-solid for anything up to a stock 12900k, and its feature set ainâ€™t bad either.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
h610 is meant for entry and budget cpus and the 12700 isn't either.,"ideally yes you get both, but in more gpu heavy games you can get away with what you currently have, it's just not ideal.",the most recommended board for a 12700 would be the msi pro b660-a which is around $130.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you really shouldn't be pairing a i7 12700 with the stock cooler, let alone using a h610 motherboard.","you're probably suffering thermal throttling for the cpu getting too hot + the vrm from your motherboard, that can't take  how much power the 12700 is using, so it's also throttling.","you said your cpu is staying around 70-80c, but what about the cpu clock and power usage during gaming?","check on youtube how to use msi afterburner to monitor thease and more using it's overlay during gaming, then take some screenshots.","either way, i'd switch the cooler for a decent 120mm, single or dual tower, and a mobo for a decent b660 too, since not all of them can take a 12700. you're literally leaving performance on the table by pairing the i7 with these budget stuff.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but im not getting the desired fps and ive seen other people have way less cpu usage and more fps,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
take for example this video : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cct-oeu7l5k&t=387s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cct-oeu7l5k&t=387s) his gpu works at 90% and above while mine (3070ti) works no more than 40-50%.,"plus, his cpu usage is way lower than 100% :d",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes that one motherboard is the best for it's price!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think the best option for now is to get a better cooler so the cpu outputs more performance at lower temperatures and maybe in the future i could upgrade the mobo as well.,do you think this is a good course of action?,?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"nothing in your post or replies indicated a problem with performance or expectations, now i understand.",that being said without knowing the specific examples and builds you're comparing to we can't really say if your expectations for your system are accurate or not.,"based on thermals and usage, it seems like you're getting the most performance you can right now.","maybe a poorly binned cpu compared to benchmarks, or perhaps your oc and ram config is not what it should be, or is way different from people with better fps.",rust like i said is a highly cpu dependent game and will almost always bottleneck the cpu and not the gpu.,the only other thing is that you may need to check voltages and power draws to see if your cpu is gimped from your mb power delivery systems.,i doubt it though.,"make sure you have the proper oc settings in bios, that your ram is actually in dual channel config, and that it's running at the proper speeds as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you have an i7 12700 or 12700k?,cause there is a decent performance difference there alone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also the fps is highly dependent on in game factors like server pop and density in the areas you play.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you have background apps running, close them.",what os are you running?,try disabling the e cores.,maybe windows isnt scheduling properly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're not going to get more performance with a better cooler.,you'll just get lower temps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

how do i reset it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well that can have a significant performance difference even at stock due to different boost clocks.,they're also likely ocing on top of that to get good bump over your 12700.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"go into bios (when turning on pc hit usually f2, del or esc key), select load optimized defaults, select boot drive (the one that you have os installed) and hit save and exit.",also before doing that download cpuz or just go into task manager and look for how many cores and threads are enabled.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
still doesnt explain the huge gap between usage percentages if im not wrong.,i should be getting more stable and higher fps than what i used to right?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that shouldn't matter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and that's the answer i was looking for.,so it makes a difference and could be worth it depending on your situation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
by ringbus do you mean the bus speed which is 100 mhz by default and what your multipliers are based on?,it's confusing because the cache frequency is called the ring frequency in some motherboards even though they are changing/overclocking the same thing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cache=ringbus.,"ocing cache yields close to no benefit, it's purely for min maxing.",the 15% is bullshit.,"if is not overclocked per se, it raises automatically with memory clock and your job is to restrict bios from going to 1:2 ratio.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the all core boost of the 9700 is 4.4 not 4.3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well *obviously* i just mean like what specific settings do you touch?,are there specific voltages you have to mess with?,etc.,iâ€™ve only ever messed with core clock and such,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it is 43 auto.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you legit have other issues arising after changing cache manually, you need to launch hwinfo and try diagnosing what's going on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
by ringbus he meant he heard some stuff and didn't bother checking what he heard or if he understood any of that.,"cache is ringbus, bclk is whole different story and raising bclk by 1 mhz yields more speed increase that raising cache by over 100 mhz, as you hasten cpu and ram.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they don't.,"ask someone with 4133mhz b-die tuned kit to do cache stock vs overclocked and go see, if they'll get at least 3% difference.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've done it on my h670?,"you just set manual cpu control like normal overclocking and it unlocks core multiplier settings, only that you are limited to max all core boost speed.",let me reset and check.,"like this: https://i.imgur.com/jbq5wgt.jpg

doing this blocks the non all core boosts, so no more 4.8 ghz for 2 cores, but as we all know that crap does nothing to help vs all core clock.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hmm, not sure why they can't set 44x then.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"cache/ring/uncore ratio, if you have skylake and younger then you touch no voltage, as cache voltage is fed from core voltage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes but if you dont force it to stay at max it will throttle during gameplay.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how should i overclock ram if i don't do it manually??,and i obviously do wtf are those assumptions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah man gimmie day juicy 3-5%,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ah i see.,and what about alder lake?,which voltages are specific to cache/ring/uncore?,and what numbers would be considered oc for these settings?,"apologize for the questions but this sounds like an interesting oc to try, especially if i can mostly keep my 12700k undervolted",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i wrote skylake and younger, al is the youngest :v. core voltage feeds cache too.",open hwinfo and see your current cache clock under load and you'll know what will be considered as overclock.,with e-cores and bin down (if setting is present in bios) enabled your cache will run some (300 mhz?),"ratios below e-cores clock, when you disable bin down and set cache ratio it will no longer stay below e-cores frequency.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"as another commenter said, i think the 12700f is a worthwhile investment given how long you will be using it for.","as far as the encoders, i've tried searching for info on their quality.",the general consensus i found was that the nvidia encoders produce a substantially higher image quality while streaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"as a video editor and streamer, why would you specifically want the â€œfâ€ version with no igpu?","the igpu gives you a backup if your main gpu develops problems or needs to be diagnosed, can be used to hook up more monitors, and even in conjunction with your dgpu, you can still use intel quicksync for video encoding and accelerated processing in adobe apps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think the i5 will be fine for a whole console gen, that is if using it mainly for gaming and no other tasks?",if you are how ever gonna make it a double duty and stream or work i suggest the i7 even tough its a bit overkill imo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

does it make a super big difference in real life scenario?,iâ€™m not going to pay 50â‚¬ more for a igpu to save like 5-10 seconds while exporting.,if my rtx gpu dies at some point iâ€™d just need to get a new one anyway.,"plus, i have some extra older gpuâ€™s lying around to troubleshoot with.",iâ€™m definitely going to make some more research on this topic but honestly if there will be any major sale on any of the i7 12700â€™s in my country next month iâ€™d just get the cheapest one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the actual cost difference should be no more than $20.,sometimes the one with the igpu is the same prices as the f or even lower because they go on sale more often.,what are your actual regional prices on these parts?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well in term of decoding videos/photos igpu with 12th gen should be faster than with 3090ti (i have 2060).,and also itâ€™s only a 20-30â‚¬ difference between the non f and f version.,iâ€™ll try to aim for the 12700 and save some money where itâ€™s not needed probably.,but ultimately iâ€™ll decide by sales.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well as i already mentioned i have few older working gpuâ€™s lying around at home so i could troubleshoot using them.,"either way, iâ€™ll try to get 12700 at end (20-30â‚¬ difference will be ok)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, the difference atm between 12700f and 12700 is around $32.",and the difference between 12700 and 12700kf is around $49 here.,iâ€™ll for sure try to get 12700 if i can.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the majority of intel processors can run just fine at up to 100c.,after that thermal throttling will slow performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
userbenchmark's back at it again ffs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you check your cooler/thermal paste when you had the 5900x?,i'm pretty surprised at such a huge difference under load.,though i do understand that ryzen (desktops) have high idle power draw as a side effect of the infinity fabric design.,"that much is true for my zen+ cpu, not sure if that has changed since.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sorry but are you seriously claiming that the 5900x was not strong for 1080p gaming ?,i doubt there is any game where the cpu struggled with.,especially at 1080p.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this dude complaining about 80c under load.,"80c is normal, if my cpu isnâ€™t running 80c under load on my custom loop it means i can push more clocks and voltage xd.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i mean , really?",", replace a 5900x becouse of the gaming performance looks pretty ridiculous to me, even if it is replaced by a 12900k , but maybe is a normal thing , i read a lot of that on this forum...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it makes sense, intel consumes less watts in idle and light loads like gaming, while also its easier to cool cause of 10nm",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
anything can run hot with enough voltage ðÿ˜„,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"80c on amd is not necessarily the same as 80c on intel due to where the temperature meter is located, also it might just be the cooler focusing on the middle of the cpu if you used the same cooler on both its safe to assume it was not designed for chiplets in mind?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 12th gen is simply newer, it has a better architecture.",also 80 c under load is totally fine.,it's just because it wasn't strong enough for your task you were basically running it in constant stress testing conditions.,the only chip from the 5000 series that can compete with the 12th gen and even easily beat it is the 5800x3d.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5800x3d would've been a cheaper upgrade tbh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not really it's just different architecture.,"team red tend to have stupid amounts of cores whereas team blue have fewer cores with faster speeds

generally speaking",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how much did intel pay you?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i really hate this ""strong for 1080p grabbing"" narrative.",that's not how it works.,the resolution is irrelevant to the cpu.,it's the gpu that is restricted by resolution.,a more accurate way of looking at it is in terms of bottlenecks.,you're likely to either be bottlenecked by your cpu or your gpu.,occasionally it can be other things like ram but not as often.,if you're gaming at 4k and your cpu is capable of outputting 130 fps and your gpu is capable of outputting 80 fps your frame rate will be 80 fps.,"if you want more performance you can lower resolution, turn down graphical settings or you can upgrade your graphics card.",whichever of these you do your framerate will not exceed 130fps.,if you are playing at 1080p your cpu will still only be able to output 130 fps.,this doesn't change.,the cpu is no weaker at 1080p than it was at 4k.,"however if your gpu is now capable of outputting 400fps at this new resolution your framerate will be the cpu-limited 300 fps, and there aren't really many settings anymore your can turn down too decrease cpu load.","view distance, population density, that's about it.","the narrative should be about being capable of high refresh gaming, not strong for 1080p, not least because we have gpus capable of 4k high refresh now.","i have been cpu bottlenecked at 4k before, and in more graphically demanding games i've seen gpu bottlenecks at 1080p.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
amd definitely gets hotter as you increase voltage vs intel.,all other things being equal a 400w 12900k and a 275w 5950x will have similar package temps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh ya.,im a pro at putting thermal paste.,when i gamed on the 5900x it would hit 80 c even with max aio fans.,my i9 doesnâ€™t surpass 60 with my custom curve.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think op might be playing a game that simply prefers intel?,i know war thunder really do not play well with amd chips at all barely able to get the desired frames on my ryzen 5 3600 system in ground battles... ðÿ˜…,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1080p gaming is heavily dependent on the cpu.,"i see a massive performance difference between my i9 and 5900xâ€¦

5900x not only ran hot af but got me 50-60 less fps / was laggy compared to my i9â€¦..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80c is too much for gaming around 70c is good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and yet if the 5900x throttles at 90 using whatever place on the chip that temperature is monitoring, and intel throttles at 100 using whatever itâ€™s monitoringâ€¦ how does that improve the situation for the amd?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
".. ""beat"" is workload specific, the 5800x3d is basically a one trick pony that is optimized for specific cpu constrained gaming workloads at 1080p/high framerates.","for a $450 processor it's not a great general use-case solution, when you start looking at productivity or mixed workloads including 1440p & 4k gaming it's almost always outclassed by the much cheaper intel 12600/12700 and amd's 5700x + 5800x non-3d parts.","imho - regardless of which brand of cpu you prefer, for gaming + some general use utility you are will see a higher performance payback per dollar by investing in the gpu once you get beyond the current generation 6-core offerings or ""mainstream value"" 8-core products (5700x & 12600k) from both intel and amd.","the 5800x3d isn't a bad product and if you have the budget and specific use-case that plays to it's strengths it's a great solution that fares well against the more expensive intel 12900 series.. it's just not particularly affordable or versatile option and probably belongs more in the ""prestige vs practical"" category of tech products.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the 12900k has more cores than the 5900x, and also a much higher tdp.","opâ€™s issue was probably that the cooler didnt maintain proper contact on the ryzen chip, and when they had to reinstall it in the cpu upgrade, they inadvertently fixed the contact/cooler issue.",the 12900k is a much faster gaming cpu than the 5900x though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

> ...severely bottlnecking my gpu and giving me horrible performance in gaming compared to my old gpu.,that's not how bottlenecking works.,your performance will not be worse when upgrading gpu due to a cpu bottleneck.,it can only stay the same at worst case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™ll definitely be looking into this combo!,thanks for the suggestion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, i loved my 8600k when i first built my pc but itâ€™s definitely lacking in what iâ€™m looking for these days.",iâ€™ll for sure be looking into the suggestions you mentioned.,i really appreciate your help.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what's the diff.,between z690 and 660m mobo?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just read that 13th gen might release sometime soon in 2022 so i might actually consider that option.,thanks for the advice!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also is there any risk to buying a used cpu?,iâ€™ve seen quite a few people recommending this for people on a budget.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there're always some amount of risk either buying new or used.,i have bought a used cpu 3 times via ebay and didn't encounter any problems.,delivery times may be long though.,"ebay offers costumers protection guarantee in case if a product if not delivered, delivered damaged, or a wrong product is delivered.",but one must follow rules and terms closely to get a refund.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in this case, there looks to be a pretty significant difference between chips.","intel states the 10500 had a max turbo speed of 4.5ghz, and the 10500t just 3.8ghz.","you canâ€™t change this, so iâ€™m not sure i would recommend the t if you actually want the non-t performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
t cpus appear to have a much lower all core turbo.,like a i9 10900t only does 3.7ghz but the normal 10900 is closer to 4.6-4.9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
clock speeds are usually 100 mhz less on the t processors.,aside from that tiny difference it'll be the same as a non-t if you raise the power limits to match the non-t +and have appropriate cooling).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i should clarify i mean turbo clocks.,"for the 10500t the max turbo seems rated 3.8ghz, like u/materidan mentioned.",i've chosen the 11400f instead.,thanks anyway.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
does this happen when the cable is merely plugged in or when it is charging a device?,and have you tried another cable/usb port/device to charge?,"if its not the cable or device, then it's likely your motherboard, though the psu is a small chance too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

power supply cable.,sorry for the confusion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was meaning the power supply cable.,thanks for helping me clarify,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in that case, iâ€™m kind of wondering if the power supply is failing or the power port is not offering a solid connection.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok. i bought this from a person in canada and i live in the us.,maybe i need a us power supply cable?,and maybe another battery too because this one doesn't last long.,i was just hoping this wasn't a cpu or gpu issue,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

raise power limit and current limit in xtu or throttlestop.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hi there.,ill cut to the chase.,i have a rog strix scar iii gaming laptop.,my cpu is an intel i7 - 9750 with 6 physical cores and 12 logical cores.,"the graphics card is nvidia geforce rtx 2060.

recently i decided to reapply the thermal paste to my cpu because i have had the laptop for about 3 years now.",my laptop runs hot so i figured it was pretty dehydrated.,i also decided to use this as an excuse to make some upgrades to my computer.,"\- upgraded my nvme drive from 512gb - to 4 tb  
\- upgraded my stock 16gb 2666mhz ram to 32gb 2666mhz ram.",\- reapplied thermal paste to the cpu/gpu.,\- changed out thermal pads.,"after the fresh install of windows 11 to the new nvme drive, i am having some issues.","everything is working better then it was, with the exception of video games.",it doesn't matter what video game i play or on what client (steam or epic) i am getting a huge drop in fps.,i can barely move the mouse in game menu's without the mouse lagging behind.,it is seriously less then 10 fps regardless of the game.,they are unplayable.,"things i have tried:

\- i have checked out fixing games in windows 11 and altering the game dvr enabled registry like several videos suggested.",\- i have checked and rechecked that all of my drivers are up to date.,\- reinstalled my nvidia drivers.,the one thing i did last night was install the intel xtu and saw today that the **current/edp limit throttling is constantly enacted.,** in fact it has been up for 92% of the time since i booted up the computer a few minutes ago.,other possibly relevant information.,\- when i reapplied the thermal pads to the laptop they are at 1mm all around.,with the exception of one area where i doubled up the pads to 2mm.,\- my cpu temps are fluctuating wildly through my armory crate application.,they generally stay stable around 55-65 degrees celsius.,"but, when i put on the turbo boost and get into a game.",they will fluctuate between 65-95 degrees celsius.,there is not rhyme or reason to it either.,one moment it will be 85 and then drop to 65 less then a second later.,"then jump to 95. so, i have no idea what's going on with that.","but now that i think about it, the laptop was doing the same thing on my old hard drive just before i installed the new nvme.",could i have applied the thermal pads wrong?,or is there a different way to get rid of this throttling?,i saw that other people have had an issue with it as well.,thanks for your help in advance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so...all cards on the table.,i am totally new to xtu and terrified of accidentally frying my computer.,what steps do i need to take to do what you are suggesting?,this is what i see when i go to the advanced tuning tab within the xtu program.,https://imgur.com/a/ndnicgu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you have the power limits set too low.,raise them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"you know, easiest way to know would be to disable e-cores in bios.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
try plugging your secondary monitor into your motherboard port so it uses the integrated graphics while keeping your main monitor plugged into your 2080.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this fixed it!,thanks so much dude,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
does this actually work?,i thought you could only use 1 source at a time.,i have a 240hz (main) and 144hz monitor and i usually watch youtube or movies on 144hz but there's always this little microstutter if i'm playing a game.,"even if i'm capped on frames and cpu and gpu load are both less than 50% 

i wonder if this works.",i just want smooth videos again,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no problem!,i'm glad we got it figured out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i did it in the past.,"if i remember right you need to go into the bios and enable ""multiple-monitor"" or something similar in the integrated gpu section.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
should support it with a bios update,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"most likely support it, but most likely wonâ€™t support any new feature of 13th gen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what cooler are you using?,i have the same chip with similar voltage and i usually see around 45-55c in games on an arctic liquid freezer ii 280mm aio,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
90c is when the cpu starts throttling and degrading in lifespan plus mine never goes above 87c while overclocked at 100% usage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
kraken x73 360mm so should have good temps ðÿ¤£,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you might want to try repasting and make sure you have adequate pressure on your cooler.,87c seems way too high for a 360mm aio at 160w.,i tested just now and 175w in occt large avx2 only gets me to 60c with my 280mm aio.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sounds normal.,of course it'll spike if it's doing something.,"if the fan is too loud, you either need a better cooler, or adjust your fan curve.",or both.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"happens to me also, and i don't have intel cpu, happens to chrome only, doesn't happen for firefox, edge.","the strange thing is, it doesn't happen every single time i open chrome, it happens once in awhile and the cpu spike for like about 5 seconds when that happen, it feels like some google analytics compiling some of my data and send it to their server for some reason.","i keep forgetting to lookout for what's going on every time, press shift + esc will open the task manager for chrome so you can monitor what's running.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is normally a setting in bios that allows you to control how fast your cpu fan ramps upâ€¦.,"slowing it down (the ramp up speed) is solid for spikes like that so the  fan doesnt always ramp upâ€¦ temp spike is normal btw, happens all the time for me on 12700k, staying around 32c and then i open up a program and it spikes to 50c for a few seconds and drops right back",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can check and follow instructions here to know if yours still have it available https://github.com/zingaburga/alderlake_avx512/wiki,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel started disabling avx512 in hardware a couple months after alder lake's launch, so unless your chip is from an earlier batch, chances are pretty good it won't have it.",https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-nukes-alder-lake-avx-512-now-fuses-it-off-in-silicon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

look up ur cpu on ark.intel.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
woah is this with chilled water or liquid nitrogen?,"i messed around with this when i first got my 10980xe, i needed to pull something like 600w to get 25/26k if memory serves.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nice, is this at highest priority or real-time priority?",and what do you normally use this chip for?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wow thats great, i have only managed to get 30.2k with my 5950x but only the first run, after that it dropped to 27.5k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very cool.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how much power does it draw?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is on ambient water cooling with 3 rads.,(one 480mm and 2x 360mm) all for the cpu.,gpu is currently air cooled.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i didn't mess with any application priority settings for this.,it's what ever the windows default is for cinebench r23.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"pbo must have kicked in, overclock it manually (or just stabilise it) and you'll have 30k all day long.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 5950x is a monster.,i've seen people hit 34-35k in r23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the socket cover on lga 1700 motherboards have the text on them indicating they are for lga 17xx/18xx  


i presume then that (at least) 14th and 15th gen would be lga 1800 but i hope they pull an am4 and create a socket to use for all of ddr5",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it will be lga 1701 just to mess with everyone.,similar to how we went lga 1156 to lga 1150 to lga 1151 gen 1 and to lga 1151 gen 2. i bet all of those could have been the same socket if they really wanted it to be.,but that isnâ€™t in intels best interest when they are the ones selling the chipsets to board partners.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i dunno.,but i hope 14th gen will be really good because i'm currently on 4790k and already decided that my next upgrade will be to 14790k :d because upgrade every 10 generations is reasonable lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nothing official yet but i would be willing to bet that the socket will be new but the shape will be the same so same coolers will work.,they will be dropping ddr4 support so they will have to break socket compatibility anyways.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on competition.,"the socket covers list lga 1800 and lga 1700, so we may get a new socket for meteor lake.","if pressured enough, intel may choose to keep the current socket.",lga 775 stuck around for a long time with many chipsets supporting the majority of cpus for it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i would be surprised if intel wants to support ddr4 on 14th gen+.,would be easier for them to do what they've always done and start fresh with chipset and cpu (and new socket or incompatible like 1151) since everything points to 14th gen cpu's being a bigger architectural update than rl over al.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> there were rumors that meteor lake may still use lga1700,

at this point i think that was just a rumormill pulling it out their ass.","if intel really was doing it they'd have been advertising it like crazy for 12th gen, since it would give them an edge against the coming am4/am5 switch",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's too thick.,intel is able to measure in single atoms already.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that makes no sense at all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think lga 1700 would only be a possibility if meteor lake has raptor lake's ddr4+ddr5 memory controller instead of a completely new memory controller that's ddr5-only.,"keeping lga 1700 for 14th gen doesn't necessary mean meteor lake will be compatible with 600 and 700-series motherboards since we've already seen this happen with 8th gen coffee lake and lga 1151, not to mention rocket lake didn't support motherboards with h410 and b460 chipsets even though it had the same lga 1200 as comet lake.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the big deal here being pcie 6 though.,that's likely intel's whole point for not saying anything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i meant i hope intel use the same socket from 14th gen onwards until ddr6 comes out, like what amd did with am4 being around for the ddr4 era",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i would think this is more likely a motherboard issue with it not providing the voltage as desired or an issue with the cooling not being set right since you presumably had to remove it to swap the cpu to the new motherboard?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
more likely to be differences in the motherboard vrm.,try giving it slightly higher voltage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i would consider selling the cpu and mobo and getting a 13th gen upgrade when it launches later in the year, even the i3s and i5s would be a massive upgrade.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my thought is just keep it at 4.5 or try some more tests to get it a bit higher.,i dont know much about cpu degradation but if u can get it back to 4.6 then that should be fine.,maybe some update or the new motherboard has something to do with itâ€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is the temperature like under load?,thermal paste degrades and liquid metal thermal compound will react with pure copper over time.,"could be your temperatures are higher now than they were a couple years ago, higher clocks and higher voltages are more stable at cooler temperatures.","if it were me, i would probably disassemble and delid again, clean it up and reapply, but it's really a case of whether it is worth it to you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

is that 1.3v set or 1.3v under load?,also what llc settings did you use on the old board and on the new board?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the vrms are different.",going from one board to another of **the same model** is enough to cause a situation like what you're experiencing.,your board sidegrade is in fact a downgrade in terms of features and build quality.,a significant step down.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
by 1.3v do you mean that is what you input into the bios or 1.3v reported by hwinfo while under cpu stress test?,different motherboard handle voltage differently depending on what the llc settings is on.,some will over compensate so you may get 1.4v under load even though you enter 1.3v in the bios and some will give less and you may end up with 1.2v under load which will cause you to be instable.,so 1.3v across two different motherboard may give you 2 completely different under load voltage.,i suggest to just redo your overclock and find a llc setting that has a good balance.,so it doesn't overshoot too much to compensate for the vdroop when the system is under load.,"i used to test for stability with overnight prime95 small fft but have since found it redundant and have switched to 1 hour of prime95 small fft instead and then moving on with my daily use like gaming, video encoding and stuff.",a system that pass prime95 for 24 hours isn't necessarily more stable than a system that pass prime95 for 1 hour.,have multiple overclocked system tested this way and both my ram and cpu were tested this way as well and they have been completely stable.,if you want to go extra mile you can test it for 2 hours instead.,prime95 is good at finding instability really quickly and more often than not if you can pass 1 hour then you are stable enough.,in the event where an bsod or instability occur while doing any cpu intensive stuff just go into bios and increase voltage by 1 step (0.016v)  and you are set.,good luck,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

minimum of 1.3 under load monitored.,llc 7 so around 1.335v or so under load which was more than enough with the old board.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1.3 inputted and 1.3+ actual reported vcore.,yea i hear now that too much llc is bad so i'm redoing my oc basically at a lower llc.,"so, you say just an hour of prime95 is sufficient?",i did that long ago with the old board and then just used the pc normally seemed to work ok. atm i'm at 4.6 ghz now with 1.265v stable after 18 hours of prime95 maybe i can hit 4.7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i see.,"you might want to test using llc6 or llc5 and a bit more set voltage, like 1.38 or so and see if you can get it to droop near 1.31-1.32 and see if it helps with stability at all.",i would expect bad transient spikes with llc7.,i've heard of people with aggressive llc crashing when they wiggle their mouse during p95 and i wouldn't expect windows 11 would affect that but hey it might be worth a shot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea better to have higher idle voltage with mid llc than lower idle voltage with high spikes when under load with high llc.,i would say an hour is the minimum.,in the  past i had system that passed 24 hours prime95 only to bsod later on during real life usage and increasing voltage by 1 step usually prevent the same bsod from happening again.,rather than wasting additional 23 hours in synthetic stress test now i just do 1 hour prime95 stress test and proceed to real life usage and if it ever bsod i will just simply increase voltage by 1 step.,this only applies to prime95 tho.,have not used other stress test programs extensively enough to tell whether an hour is enough to tell if the system is stable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"this video explains it https://youtu.be/zqvnkh4tvw8

basically if you have a very aggressive llc, even though your sensor reads 1.3 under load, there will be extremely short undershoots down to like 1.2v when you wiggle your mouse or there's a system interrupt or such causing a brief load fluctuation, and these can wreck your stability.",your sensors can't pick up these undershoots either.,"on the other hand if you have a droopier llc, with set 1.38 or 1.4 dropping to 1.3, the undershoot won't be as severe, maybe only to like 1.27 or 1.26.

you seem to have problem with communication.,it would be easier if you just said what you meant and were a bit less interested in looking very smart.,voltage is not a quantity that the components use.,more components donâ€™t use more voltage.,now having more chips could technically add some capacitance to the circuit which could increase the currents in the memory controller but that effect should be minimal and not affect things much unless you are seeking extreme results.,so what do you propose is the mechanism that requires more voltage for more ram sticks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i'm not trying to be a smartass, you're trying to write as if you knew the topic.",which you don't.,a simple proof of that is any oc result between a single rank and dual rank kits - you always need more sa voltage for dual rank kits and you still end up with lower speed.,"now set gear 2 and you can magically add frequency even further, which prooves you're by no means dragged down by ram overclockability.",voltage is a quantity that a component require to operate properly and they require higher voltage if they're put under a higher stress.,"simple as that, proven throughout over 20 years.","ddr5 kits basically suck hard right now, so they may create an opposite illusion, even though hynix kits can deliver 7000 mbps at 32 gb.","and yes, the mechanism already exists, because it's dictated by basic physics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

voltage lock is true.,"whether or not can it do - it's up to silicon lottery, you're only guaranteed to hit 4800 mhz (ddr5) with such voltage and people already posted here they can't get over 3600 mhz on ddr4 16 gb kits, that easily do way over 4000 mhz on older cpus and i personally know a person with 12100f that could not exceed 3466 mhz on 16 gb kit ([https://youtu.be/nay6xhtqcu8?t=99](https://youtu.be/nay6xhtqcu8?t=99) same kit between all platforms, only alder lake could not make 3600 mhz).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

'thats what you get for going cheap'

so the insinuation is that all non k 12th gen chips are going cheap'.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes because people on this forum are now believing that non k cpus are cheap and shouldn't be able to overclock ram.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

both comet lake and rocket lake had no system agent voltage.,"alder lake received the lock with premeditation, user-wise there was literally no reason to lock it, they solely made it as people kept buying locked cpus and simply overclocked ram and it hurt their unlocked cpus sales.","imagine buying 12100f and cheap 3600 c17 kit and not being able to boot, because intel locked voltage lol.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

raptor lake will support ddr4 i think the rumor was that intel was encouraging  board manufacturers to release less ddr4 boards for 13th gen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
raptor lake will support ddr4 through existing 600 series motherboards.,there won't be any 700 series motherboards coming in ddr4 flavor.,those ones will be ddr5 only.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ddr5 is much better though because the minimum speed for a ddr5 ram stick(at least the ones i've seen so far) is 4800mhz.,that will make a pc a lot better thanks to those speeds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4800 mhz in gear 2 with imc limited to ~~2400 mhz~~ 1200 mhz with insanely high latency.,if you get it up to 6000 mhz and tighten the timings you can achieve ddr4 latency and get better data transfer ratesâ€¦.but yea at 4800 c40 ddr5 is a huge downgrade from ddr4 3600 c18 sticks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in gear2 the imc is at 1200mhz.,the ram clock is half the datarate and in gear2 the imc is clocked at half the ram clock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do i have this all wrong?,ddr5 at 4800 imc is 1200?,wow no wonder i had such poor performance with my 4800 (8 gb no less) sticks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with ddr4 the imc tops out in the 1900-2200mhz range.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, since it ddr5 runs in gear 2 it's 1/4th the transfer rate of the ram or 1/2 the actual frequency.","so 4800 ram means 2400mhz ram, divide that by 2 and you got the imc running at 1200.   


im running 6000c30 1t ram, it's pretty decent but im not sure it's actually faster than a high end ddr4 kit",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you probably had half of your effective bank groups missing on those sticks

don't buy ddr5 sticks with under a 16gb capacity or unless they're verified not to use that crappy micron ic which only works in g2-2t.","that's the only ddr5 which is equal or better than ddr4 which is cheaper, so it's neither the performance option or the budget option.. it kinda exists if you **need** a ddr5 board right now and it's the only thing available for you to boot with, though.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah intel has been locking down on undervolting on their laptop chips for a while now, it's pretty crap if you ask me.","there was a work around for the surface book 2 which involved installing linux and then reinstalling windows, you could try it for your laptop.",you have to do that because they have locked down undervolting through the firmware and i'm pretty sure installing older firmware won't work as they have anticipated that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

iâ€™ve been trying to do that with older versions of xtu which i knew i had to do since iâ€™ve done this before considering that newer versions donâ€™t allow for undervolting unless itâ€™s an unlocked cpu.,"specifically ones that support my cpu only which is up till 2017 before intel dropped undervolting due to plunder volt during 2019.

instead of having it grayed out on older versions itâ€™s simply not there anymore, with newer ones core voltages and gpu voltage is there but grayed off.",i have to assume itâ€™s more strict on alienware laptops.,same goes for throttlestop i only have basic options while voltage controls are again grayed out.,"biggest regret was updating bios which i thought hey could improve something, and well it didnâ€™t.",unfortunately i canâ€™t downgrade bios as dell prevented that.,although i did a repast and replaced thermal pads with gelid ultimates.,"temps while gaming hover around 73 max on cpu, and 78c max on gpu.","i7-7700hq

itâ€™s strange though cause i had a 2016 razor blade with the same cpu but instead has a gtx 1060 and it worked on older versions of xtu, and this was only last year until i sold it a few months ago, so i have to assume it depends on oem bios.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no.,"the 11700k is a downgrade in many cases, including some games.","> better gaming performance (slightly)

this is very game dependent.",the performance is worse more often than it is better.,watch gamersnexus videos.,"> pcie gen 4 (biggest upside as i plan on upgrading to a 4080)

this will be pointless.",gpus are not bandwidth limited.,"even in the worst case scenario, it's a 1-2% difference.",watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dkvvtirnm8).,you will not notice a difference between 150 fps and 147 fps in real life my friend.,"> less heat (i have a liquid freezer ii 360 but 10850k can still get hot)

the 11700k is just as hot as the 10850k.",a liquid freezer 360 is plenty enough.,i'm running my 10850k on a liquid freezer 240. i have no idea why you think it's running hot.,do you want the cpu to run at 40c at load?,"> getting accesses to third nvme slot that's pcie gen 4

this is the only relevant point.",but do you really need a third nvme slot?,"also, games don't even come close to utilizing nvme gen 3.0 ssds.",the difference between a sata ssd and nvme ssds in games is minimal and you won't be able to tell the difference unless you have them side by side.,"in conclusion, this is such a pointless waste of money.","the only relevant upgrade would be pcie 4.0, and that doesn't make any perceptible difference right now in gpus (even with the eventual 4080).","by the time, it actually becomes relevant, we will have pcie 5.0 gpus and cpus that can do much better.","> i feel like 8 faster cores with pcie gen 4 will last me longer that 10 slower cores with pcie gen 3

by the time the pcie gen 4 will become relevant, your 11700k itself will be a bottleneck and you'll be in the same upgrade mindset.",you're overthinking this.,don't waste your money.,"save your money for a better gpu, or wine, or cocaine.",all of them would be a far better investment than a 11700k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

honestly,

11900k, 11600k, and 10900k are all so close in performance that it is hard to justify an upgrade from these 14nm chips to the same 14nm chip.",the 11900k and likely the 11700k will be faster than the 10850k for stock settings.,but the difference is very close.,the 11th gen chips will have better minimum frame rates and thus less variance in framerates.,you can check in the link above for the various tests and at various resolutions.,df at 1080p and 1440p have cpu bound test cases.,"and for the 11th gen intel chips, the bars are smaller which indicate less fps variance.",the 11700k is a lower binned chip than the 11900k and so it does not have intel adaptive boost tech (auto overclocking) and it does not have tvb (thermal velocity boost).,tvb will basically boost clockspeeds below 70c.,the only other reason to jump to 11th gen intel is for avx512 support and ps3 emulation for gaming.,other than that stick with the 10850k (you get the i9 10th gen overclocking tech) or upgrade to the 11900k.,11900k will have all the fun boosting tech that intel offers and still provide good performance abiet at more power draw.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why would you lose 2 cores for basically 0 single core gainthat is literally so ridiculously stupid.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
weird side-- i mean downgrade.,don't waste time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you wonâ€™t notice a practical difference.,individual silicon quality plays a bigger role.,if youâ€™re not in desperate need of the feature set.,donâ€™t worry about it.,get rid of the aio if you want a upgrade.,i tried the asetek and expandable designs.,asetek pumps really arenâ€™t any better then the largest air coolers and iâ€™m my case the water coolers performed worse lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™d prefer the 10th gen over 11th gen. what clocks are you running on it currently?,"as for less heat, im sure the 11th gen generally runs hotter.",the upside is the extra nvme slot like you said.,"iâ€™m using a 10900k at 5.3ghz all cores on a z590 too, so i donâ€™t have access to pcie 4.0 or the additional nvme slots but i see no point in upgrading yet, 11th and 12th gen are a meh upgrade for me at this point, paired with an undervolted 3080ti currently at 3840x1600 175hz no problem.",clocks to 2100mhz nicely but requires some beef 450w.,"if youâ€™d be going for a top 4000 series card, youâ€™d probably be better waiting and staying put.",i mean it could be pcie 5.0 capable and need a monster power input for all we know.,but nothing is real until itâ€™s announced.,and gpus donâ€™t even fully utilise pcie 3 bandwidth at the minute so.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think it's a good trade for you since you're only using it for gaming, and you're profiting from the trade.",also you gain avx-512 which helps a lot with the ps3 emulator rpcs3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"personally i recommend the 12th gen over the 11th because when they were developing the 11th gen, there were testing a couple of new features for the 12th gen, with that they created a new chipset.",12th gen brought the crown back to intel for outperforming the new and series.,you could also wait until the 13th gen /next amd generation because those cpus should be pretty good too.,"if your on a budget, iâ€™d go for a 12600k like a couple of other people have mentioned.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
will the 11700k be an upgrade purely in gaming?,"at 1080p mostly, but it will be very insignificant in the majority of cases.",is it worth upgrading?,absolutely not.,"especially at 4k, there will be pretty much zero difference.","don't waste your time man, it's really minimal.",i've got a 165 hz monitor at 1440p with an rtx 3070 ti and a 10700f.,i feel zero reason to upgrade.,i actually went for 10th gen when 11th gen was out because it's better value and the performance was quite similar.,you have a better processor than me with an extra 2c/4t and you can overclock whereas i'm stuck at 4.6 ghz all core.,i cannot imagine you needing more performance especially at 4k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just watch this video:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3n0_ucbxnpk&t=1350s

any 11th gen with less cores than a 10th gen is less useful than toilet paper.",even the ones with the same amount of cores were pointless for the tiny performance gains at a higher price.,"also if you are considering an upgrade and as you mention you have a relatively low cpu bottleneck, then what do you need a k series cpu for?",the i5 12400 on a non z motherboard completely demolishes all previous gen cpus even the 10900k and 11900k.,"if you wanted you could sell both your motherboard and cpu and upgrade to an alderlake i5, even an i5 12600k and z series board if for some reason you still think a 2% performance increase is worth paying more for.","even better, wait for the upcoming 13th gen, or intel's next die shrink at 14th gen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how much would this upgrade cost you?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do it if also you get some cash left on your hand after buying the 11700k.,gen 4>gen 3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"also op, the single core on 11th gen is barely any better than the 10th gen. 11th gen is basically oced 10th gen. just oc ur 10850k at that point",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"also op, the single core on 11th gen is barely any better than the 10th gen. 11th gen is basically oced 10th gen. just oc ur 10850k at that point",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"agree with all of the above except for the 11900k recommendation, it's a waste of sand.",still only 8 cores like the 11700k and it runs ridiculously hot.,"i don't know why anyone would really go for an 11th gen i9, it's genuinely a downgrade over the 10th gen i9.","op should stay with the 10850k or if they're that desperate to be on the bleeding edge of ipc performance, go 5800x3d.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the multi-core performance difference between 10900k and 11700k is ~5% while the newer part scores +10% single-core in cinebench.,vast majority of games would better utilize 8 slightly better cores.,"despite 11th gen being called *a waste of sand*, some ipc improvements are present.","unfortunately they are overshadowed by the new memory controller and layout, which usually performs worse in gaming *(though 1% lows are usually much better)*.","if you play with your ram and vccsa, you might be able to squeeze out some pretty sweet timings that wouldn't even post on 10900k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same boat just got a 10900k fucking chhhhheap,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah or just 12600k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
agreed.,hardly see any point in upgrading.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think op is considering a side grade.,he has the z490/z590 mobo just for 10th or 11th gen cpus but he doesn't want to buy a new z690 board.,it might be because his existing board is still good and has all the features he needs.,"because swapping out a cpu is relatively easy, he is considering it.","i9 is bad for the regular consumer, but good for the xtreme overclocker who doesn't mind full power.",that is what they prefer.,being able to blast the power for oc performance and having the cpu survive is preferred for extreme oc.,and i think 11900k offers that and more.,avx512 is nice too for ps3 emulation if they are into that.,11900k is not a complete waste.,"if someone is coming from 1st gen intel or even 3rd gen and they wanted avx512, i9 is a viable contender.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you realise x is the roman numeral for 10?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
except it did push the i7 down a segment.,while increasing prices at the same time.,the first i9 was the 9900k.,"up until this point, i5 had only cores, and i7 had hyper threading.","the 9700k has only cores, and the 9900k had hyper threading.",i7 was also the extreme edition.,then one day it suddenly wasnâ€™t.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes but they still didnâ€™t label it directly as 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"an addendum to my previous comment:

if you are comfortable with bus overclocking, there is little reason to need an extreme edition part.",the only benefits of using a qxxxxx part over the standard qxxxx part is the ability to change the core multiplier.,this also means that core 2 extremes will put less strain on the chipset of the board and have looser memory requirements since you do not _need_ to modify the fsb to increase clock speed.,most boards from this era were built to allow extensive fine-tuning of the front side bus to allow some pretty crazy overclocking of even the junkiest cpus.,"when i find ""nicer"" 775-era boards in e-waste, they tended to have been paired with ""budget"" or ""bang for your buck"" cpus of the era.","the most common offenders being the c2d e6300, e8400, q6600, and q9450.","later systems tended to have q9650 and occasionally an extreme edition, but those were not the norm.",a g0 q6600 can easily have the fsb bumped up to achieve >3.6-4.0ghz clocks with little extra cooling (assuming the board and memory can handle it).,i ran an overclocked q6600 with 400mhz fsb using one of the old p4-era intel stock coolers (the big chonky ones with the copper slug core) and never ran into stability issues (although i suspect it would degrade the chip over extended use).,my board at the time was an evga 750i sli ftw with some g.skill 1066mhz ddr2 modules.,"if you enjoy overclocking or want to learn some of the ins and outs of ocing on an older platform, then grab a couple q6600s and maybe an e8400 or two and push 'em as far as they'll go!","if you want it to be a simple performance upgrade without putting too much strain on the board or requiring more exotic memory modules, then go with a core 2 extreme.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i skipped over dual core completely - the qx6700 was my first cpu after the pentium 4 3.73ghz extreme edition.,those zalman coolers were great back then.,flowers and circular towers.,"in factâ€¦ this is that qx6700 system when i was raiding it for parts a couple months ago:

look for an atx 3.0 psu spec with ideally something that is 80 plus titanium rated to meet your needs.",for this during power excusions you can hit 150% to 200% for the 1 micro second to 110 to 120% for 100 milliseconds.,"obviously if you workload or gaming is constantly hitting power excusion limits, you are better off with a psu that can handle these spikes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah.,i should be fine psu wise.,while it is 650w.,i donâ€™t overclock my gpu and donâ€™t plan on overcloxking the 12700k.,for now.,the k is more for being able to stretch it more down the road.,i like being able to add a few more years to its performance.,i figured iâ€™d be just fine since i was running this pc on a 500 and upgraded to 650 on a sale.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

a i3-12100f for around $100 us and a h610 motherboard for around $90 us would be a far better upgrade.,"so for under $200 you could have better overall experience, but at the $300 us mark with a 12400f, is really the sweet spot.","really the 7700k isnâ€™t a bad, but unless it is significantly less then buying new, it isnâ€™t worth it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

idk where you are located and how expensive computer parts are for you but buying older stuff typically isn't worth it.,i had an i7-2600 and i only upgraded when i could afford to buy something relatively new.,when i was checking for 10th gen stuff it was better and surprisingly cheaper than 7th gen. also as other redditors have said ryzen 3000 and 5000 processors are not bad.,good luck with your upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i get 80 fps @1440p using a ryzen 9 3900x and asus 3060 12gb with high/ultra settings; i could probably get well over 120fps if i had a 1080p monitor.,a lot of it depends on the resolution you're trying to game on as well as your in-game settings.,perhaps your friend is trying to game at 4k with a high refresh rate?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah.,i got this monitor last summer so i'm probably not going to upgrade to 4k for a while.,i think the rtx 4060 ti could be more suitable for 1440p but i'm not sure when it will be released.,i would be happy with a gpu which has rtx 3080's rasterizing performance but better ray tracing performance.,i think i will have to wait for more information to be released.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

colder ambient temperature,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you need to provide more details for people to help.,but having a case with more ventilation and fans is beneficial to temps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
components gets cooldown when heat transfer occurs between the heat spreader and the air.,the longer the surface the better the cooling; as long as there is an active cooling happening and the heat spreader is properly joined with the component.,so either yours fans died or the thermal compound seal broke.,both cpu and mobo temps rising may indicate your cpu cooler seal is broken or the fan damaged/unplugged.,if harddrives are hot too then your case/psu fans may have died.,"however this is rare, most common thing is cpu seal broken/loosening.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes playing will increase the temps.,your cpu temps seem fine and no were near overheating.,the motherboard temps seem abnormal.,i would guess they used a very cheap motherboard in your pre built that is not really up to what ever cpu you have.,if you look and there are no heat sinks on the motherboard improving it may be hard.,if it has heatsinks you may be able to get a fan and direct it's airflow over them and it may help,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i do not remember doing that considering my bios skills might of accidentally,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think you just need to uncheck it (well if this '5 core' was from msconfig anyway...),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i doubt they would submit this to tech support without telling us it was a vm unless they really wanted to fuck with people,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but task manager doesn't do that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's how it works actually, on a 6 core precessor you'll have the core 0,1,2,3,4,5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why on earth would you delete msconfig?,"also just because the app is no longer there doesn't mean that the settings it alters haven't changed for some reason (a third party app changing it, data corruption, any number of weird circumstances), only now you've got no easy way to go and see what those settings are.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"hmm, never drink and bios",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no that's not how cores are reported in windows.,in windows they are reported as 6cores and 6 threads.,what you are talking about happens in the bios.,the op maybe disabled a core in the bios or via software in windows,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh well i'm pretty sure it isn't currently on linux and i still have 5 cores tried searching the oc settings on my bios did not see any core disabling stiff should i just restore to factory settings?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no 5 cores out of 6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
true it's just unnecessary  services that might free up to like idk 300mb ram at most (for most people.),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

so confusedâ€¦.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah it's all just unnecessary services until you want to connect to a plex server on your network and you can't see it and you don't know which service you need to start back up.,it's not 2002 anymore where single-core processors need to do as little as possible in order to run smoothly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you know how to retrieve information by looking at pictures?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you still not getting it.,dude lol.,task manager reports an 8500 as six cores not five.,he disabled a core it's as simple as that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that is when you \*name\* the cores, not count them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
try powering it on and running under high load for a while to warm up the paste.,itâ€™s usually much easier to do when itâ€™s warm.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
never had intel cpu's get stuck like this.,are you sure the fan notches are out ?,bench the board and check if the 4 fan feet are out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your ram is in the wrong slots too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're skipping several steps here and making this much harder on yourself by working inside the case.,take the board out of the case.,check if the pins are fully ejected.,"if they are, see if you can rotate the cooler by twisting it left and right to break the seal created by the now-lightly-cemented thermal paste.","if the pins are ejected but the paste is too strong, assemble the pc outside of the case on something like a motherboard box or a wooden table (anything not metal and not conducting or that can generate static charges like plastic) and run something like prime95 to heat up the cpu and cooler for a few minutes.",thermal expansion of the ihs and the cooler will help weaken the hold the paste has on the ihs.,try twisting it while the benchmark is running.,"to make this easier on yourself, take the fan off the cooler.",it is held on by clips.,you can leave it plugged into the header on the motherboard so that you don't get complaints from the motherboard that there isn't a fan connected.,"if the fan comes off, you can then shut down the system.","modern chips can run without the cooler attached, there's very little chance you'll be able to damage it.","clean the motherboard, replace the paste, put the ram in the correct slots, and then consider buying a hyper 212 evo/antec a400 or similar budget cooler.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if your pins are already out you should twist the heatsink and it will detach easily.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just use more force, all there is to it.","there are lots of minor tricks, but you simply have to break the bond formed with the thermal paste ""glue"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
remove the other side panel.,pinch and push the 4 pins from the back of the motherboard to remove the heatsink/fan.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"pull the board, cut the pins off the bottom of the fan, buy new cooler.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is this with the normal thermal paste or did you replace it with aftermarket thermal paste?,as a very small amount of aftermarket pastes will end up bonding the heatsink to the ihs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"what are you trying to accomplish by getting the fan off, is it broken?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
twist counter or clockwise... i do it with amd all the time so their chips do get pulled out... might help... seen some crusty hard paste though...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in the picture... the fan isn't plugged in.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the twist-pull-""click"" only releases the locking mechanism.",look on the back of the board where the posts feed through.,you might need pliers to pinch the inserts to push them through.,"careful though, driving the pliers into the board will likely mess something up.",i really doubt the paste is acting like any sort of adhesive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok so youre  trying  to remove the fan.,got it.,"turn each clip a half turn counter clockwise they should pop up on their own, if not pull up on the clips no tools necessary however if this fails you may have to remove the motherboard and use a needle nose pliers to release the clips from the opposite side of the board.","if all clips are free and fan is still stuck, grasp the entire fan and twist off.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i was told it won't fix anything on the second post (which does not have an image) and i applied ""pressure air gas"" yesterday evening, but i'm guessing it's safe now?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i heard the click, been pulling for a while.","if the feet are stuck, then i'm not sure how that's possible and don't want to break it right now",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hmm... didn't know there was such a thing when it came to ram.,how so?,how could it affect the pc and are we talking wrong rotatation or simply moving both a step to the right from this angle?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
came here for this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i wish i could, but that seems like a no go because i have nowhere safe to apply it.",it's too close to the motherboard and cramped in the case,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i imagine this would be significantly easier for me in particular to do once i have a brand new computer.,i am not willing to take too many steps right now but will use the info for future reference.,"by the time i have the new computer, i will pull everything apart to get the raw components, clean them and go through the process.","if i can break it free without removing the motherboard from the case, i may be able to keep tge computer intact and continue using it a while longer",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have a feeling that i been interpreting ""twisting"" the wrong way all along",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that seems like a final choice if nothing else works, but chances are i will either break it or loosen it before.",i am planing to buy a new computer at some point so this is a temporary solution i'm looking for.,"chances are i can just leave it like this for now and keep using the pc until it breaks or i get to replace it, so it's not an emergency at all",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
final of all final solutions.,so final that i might end up break8ng both the cpu and cooler out of curiosity.,but that is of course the final of final solutions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have no prior memory of what paste was used,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the situation i'm in and the components i use are not nice anymore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
reapply thermal paste because i haven't done so in actual years and i been noticing 60 to 100c depending on what i do and whether or not i have bios xci on for 3100 ish instead of 2100 ish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as intended... it isn't suppose to be while cleaning.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the first have have already been tested as implied by the image caption slide show.,"i am not im a hurry to fix the problems by going all out, i will do that when i get a new computer since everything in there is between couple years to ancient and needs replacement",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1. make sure power is disconnected.,"2. try squirting some ipa (iso-propyl alcohol) onto the base of the fan and cpu
3. give it some time and try twisting this time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you are running single channel and not dual channel like that, so only half of potential bandwidth.",it should be the two grey slots.,the other most slot and the second one from the cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
alcohol doesn't short out electronics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i mean, you have dust and moisture caking things up on the pcie x16 slot, and your memory bandwidth is currently halved.",but you do you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as if you were trying to unscrew it.,just slowly apply constant force and wait for it to loosen up.,but first make sure that the pins are really out.,the white parts should completely be out of the motherboard.,you should be able to see the pointy tips.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in this context ""twisting"" is ""rotating while keeping the plane of the coldplate parallel to the motherboard"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you should probably do this as well as using alcohol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i mean, that's just how i removed that heatsink... it's normal.",those crappy plastic pins get stuck and you need to push them out from the back of the motherboard.,it's not hard dude you got this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i see, you wrote fan in the headline, so i thought you were going to take the fan off the cooler and not the cooler of the motherboard.",":) 
but sounds strange, should be simple twist all four pins 90 degrees and then pull them up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hmm, noted.",i will check that next time i open the box,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"okay, so i have to find a way to get in there.",is there a video or picture of where to apply it?,i have no room left,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, i was told about the ram thing just recently.",do i have 2 16gb or is it displaying 16 but using 8 somehow?,"either way, i noticed there's been buildup, but if it survived for a couple years, it can survive for a month or two",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe half the people who been replying to me were thinking the same.,oh god what have i done!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"make sure you only use 99%

you might be able to sneak a cotton swab soaked in alcohol from the top or the bottom as indicated by the arrows in this image [https://imgur.com/a/suizwrb](https://imgur.com/a/suizwrb).",you only need to get it onto the underside of the cpu cooler and it should work it's way down.,a few repeat applications should work.,"here's an image of the underside for your reference: [https://image2.pushauction.com/3/0/0/c4d11f81-e2de-4d6c-977b-7d17d7d7f909/7ef5bb8a-c28c-4ec1-b8c1-714353306f30.jpg](https://image2.pushauction.com/3/0/0/c4d11f81-e2de-4d6c-977b-7d17d7d7f909/7ef5bb8a-c28c-4ec1-b8c1-714353306f30.jpg)

i would also suggest trying to slightly twist it as well.",you can safely apply way more pressure by twisting rather than pulling because the force is applied to the edge of the board through the very well mounted cpu socket.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"on the motherboard, the memory slots are physically connected to the socket, and thus the memory controller on the cpu.","the length of the copper traces (280 pins & traces for desktop dimms) for the first and second channel, commonly slots numbered 2 and 4, is identical.",this ensures that latency to the ram is kept low.,"when you stick another dimm on to the same channel (slot 1 with slot 2, or slot 3 with slot 4), the traces for that module are the littlest bit longer.","but that has potentially severe penalties for the latency to the memory in that slot, the speed at which both modules can operate, and the effective memory bandwidth as a result.",using dual ranked or single ranked dimms further complicates memory performance when you use more than two modules/sticks on your system.,each separate memory controller on a ddr4 motherboard can achieve around 25gbps memory bandwidth.,"so you could achieve around 50gbps by moving the memory in slot 3 to slot 2. this has implications for improving frame rates, general productivity work, rendering, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
97% or 91% is also safe cause it evaporates fast enough.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

usually the motherboard manufacturer includes a disc with the drivers.,but most builds today do not have disc players.,so my best suggestion is to use a usb drive on a different pc and either download the drivers from their website to said drive or copy the drivers from the disc to the usb drive and then use that usb drive to install what you need.,i have been through multiple builds now so i have a portable bd/dvd drive that i can connect when i absolutely need to read (or write) a disc.,i would hope that in the future that motherboard makers will include drivers on branded usb drives.,i think the value add would be excellent.,you can pick up a dvd drive from best buy for about $30.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it depends on the case.,thereâ€™s sff cases that will let you install 280/360/420mm aios or custom loops so you can let the 12900k go all out or at least run â€œstockâ€ without any power limits.,"personally, i went with a 12700 for my sff build with a b660i and enforced a 65w limit.","my use case is purely gaming though, at 4k too so my cpu performance is absolutely fine like this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

nope you're not gonna get lower fps if you uncap the power limit.,some motherboards cap power limit for non-k to 65w for some reason.,"when power uncapped it will reach 4.79ghz all core(and take around 190w at max load), that's more than stock 12700k does.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

dont run prime.,"other than that, you should be doing better.",how much wattage does it ocnsume under cbr23?,"i can keep it from throttling on a u12a with 33c ambient temperatures, lol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you need better/bigger aio.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1. check if the mounting kit doesn't rest on heatsink ([https://i.imgur.com/bgfqe6p.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/bgfqe6p.jpg) https://i.imgur.com/xfdfdbh.jpg on z690-a strix d4, returned mobo without further investigating why cpu is overheating on stock, only noticed after disassembling this trash)
2. yeet this motherboard away and get something reasonable that isn't pile of trash
3. use washer mod
4. sand ihs down or get conductonaut, liquid freezers coldplate is as flat as manufacturing process lets it (used to be a blessing, now it's a curse, due to trash ihs manufacturing process and mounting brackets obscene mounting pressure) and stock ihs is wavy af, as proven above and you will have a bad day because of that.",thank intel.,"these are not suggestions, these are steps in order of doing.","this is what i have with 360mm gen i version, after sanding down the ihs, using conductonaut and having a washer mod [https://imgur.com/a/ixnoyz6.jpg](https://imgur.com/a/ixnoyz6.jpg) (on z690-a pro, higher ram overclock than what was possible on strix, talk about asus delivering quality product lol).","it's still terrible, but i've had a very same case as you and well... at least it doesn't overheat and die because of temperatures anymore.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that aio should be able to handle that load without hitting the 100 instantly.,did you remove the plastic from the cold plate?,there might be air in the block as well.,have you tried removing and remounting?,before mounting move all the air into the radiator by holding the block as low as possible.,how is your radiator mounted in the case?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
im also having a similar issue with this aio.,running an 12600k at 5ghz and immediately overheats (100c) surpassing 190w running cinebench.,"its fine at stock frequency, staying in the 70cs but if the power consumption reaches around 200w it gets toasty.",and yes im also using the lga1700 kit and the thermal paste is well spread.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks to /u/riesendulli /u/middle_importance_88 /u/noreng /u/meathole /u/texxasmike for your suggestions!,it indeed was a **block contact issue**.,i did not realize the liquid freezer ii unit had an incompatible cover pre-installed even though it came with lga 1700 mounting hardware.,"after i removed that and remounted it, the temperatures went way down.","now cinebench r23 maxes out at 92c on one of the p-cores and does not stay there, it hovers more like around 82c and stays consistently pegged at 4900 mhz on p-cores and 3700 mhz on e-cores with no thermal throttling whatsoever.",thanks again to everyone for your help!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm having the same problem.,wish you take pictures which cover to replaced?,can i ask you did you put plastic o rings on motherboard or not?,i lost those  o ring 8 stickers now the stand off screws rattle after 2 days.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the cooler couples everything into one connector.,i have it run at 100% everything when cpu exceeds 80c.,and i can confirm it kicks in during the cinebench and prime runs.,below 80c i let it run at 50%,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have not tried 1200 mounting.,i went straight for the 1700 baggy as that's what is designed for 1700 after all.,even though asus provides 1200 holes for backwards compatibility,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> i used the included mx-5 paste and applied plenty of paste - i did an x across the cpu and dots all around, similar to how you would apply for threadripper.â",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
220w ish on cpu package according to hwinfo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i don't think that sounds right - no one should ever have to physically modify brand new products designed for each other to get it to work at factory default configurations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have not tried remounting yet.,but i observed same behavior on cinebench both inside case and outside.,i've made sure the pump block is below the top of the radiator tank,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
turns out this was caused by a preinstalled cover on the cpu block on this cooler.,this cover obstructs proper contact on several motherboards including mine.,removing it and remounting completely fixed the issue.,found this out thanks to everyone in the thread!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you're at asus board then check, if pumps sledges don't rest on vrm heatsink first.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
interesting.,were you able to fix it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the thermal load of your processor and the cooler might need you to move the temp down earlier.,i would use 50c as my 100% mark at most.,my own pc is set to run the fans and pump at 100% all the time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which revision do you have?,did you check motherboard compability ?,"your boards is listed
https://support.arctic.de/lf2-lga1700",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"then there is a contact issue, there is no way my u12a can outperform the lf ii 280",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

previous this aio i had a arctic freezer 34 esports duo mounted and the max i could pull from the cpu was 170w before thermal throttling and its a little disapointing that this 100â‚¬ upgrade can only cool up to 190w.",it could be the bending ihs thing being the culprit tho,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'll give this a try and see what happens thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tried running at 100% from 50c on but made no difference in cinebench behavior of instantly going to 100c on the p cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mine came with the lga 1700 bracket in the box,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"crappy ihs waviness is, thought you had asus, sorry.","you can only sand down the ihs, your and ops case was my case too (i'm on z690-a pro too, had z690-a strix d4 as well), only after sanding that ihs and using conductonaut my 12700k doesn't crash the pc due to overheating and stays at unsatisfying 83 c under 220 w heatload.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
found the cause of the issue on my setup thanks to everyone in the thread: the cooler block comes with a pre-installed cover that is incompatible with certain motherboards and causes contact issues.,i removed this cover and remounted the block and the issue went away completely for me.,cpu can stay at 230w load and hover around 82c for the p-cores now with no thermal throttling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, do whatever but read my post then.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then you might need a bigger radiator.,the thermal load from your processor seems to be too high for the radiator to overcome.,i had this problem when i build a dual xeon rig.,i had a 360 radiator and i ended up needing another 360 cm radiator to maintain temps but this wasn't an aio setup.,your processor can pull up to 330 watts of power if overclocked.,if not overclocked it can peak at about 240 watts with all threads going full speed.,i suspect there isn't much that could help except adding another radiator and making sure the original heat sink is connected to the processor with the correct pressure and thermal paste.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you read the link?,there is revisions.,some boards have spacing issues,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm afraid i don't see a post from you in this thread.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"interesting...i was able to keep a 280w threadripper cool no problem with a slightly larger 360mm aio with standard 27mm thickness and this particular 280mm is quite a bit thicker as well and according to reviews this 280mm aio outperforms most 360 aios on the market

32c for idle is good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
judging the idle temp in the bios isn't really the best way.,it will idle at a lower temp once you're in windows because of the power management optimizations that will be engaged at that point.,this is assuming of course you have an optimized windows installation without a bunch of things running in the background.,my 12700k idles in the 30's in the bios but will drop to idling in the 20's while in windows.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
awesome temp!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it depends a lot on ambient temperature and cooling solution but yes, normal idle temperature.",here in spain we are having around 30c and mine sits at 40-43 c and 70 c while gaming.,the other day i pushed it a bit with cinebench and went up to 99 c and i was quite surprised.,"i checked the motherboard settings and creator genie (automatic oc of msi) was on, thus pushing crazy voltages.","disabled that, cpu does 90 c maximum on cinebench.",it does 100 mhz less but i prefer the lesser consumption and temps plus stability.,i donâ€™t think oc is worth it for these line of cpu.,oh i have a deepcool assassin by the way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

my 10700 with the stick cooler idles at 54 so eah you are fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for idle temp in bios probably decent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do a stress test for a couple hours and show us those results.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"come back when itâ€™s 100c and weâ€™ll talk then, ok?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

so is amd really more efficient if it usually runs 40â°c in windows idle with spikes to 60â°c anytime you open some app?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this not under any load :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe you should install the cooler if it's like 80 in the bios.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am interested in idle temp,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i use a noctua nh-d15s with my 12700kf with the lga 1700 mounting kit and my temps usually sit around 45-55c while gaming.,i haven't seen it break 60 once.,at idle i sit between 27-30c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"75f/24c, nzxt 280mm aio.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can't make comparisons like that without details like the processor model and the cooler being used,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the cpu in my laptop runs at 50c idle but spikes up to 99c, but that doesn't make it less efficient than the big honkin cpu in my desktop (at idle at least)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's called race to idle and is the most efficient way to handle tasks, so the cpu can quickly switch back to sleep mode.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
amd is usually less efficient than intel under 80% load i believe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i live in india and.... i have an laptop that doesn't have a unlocked bios,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"exactly, me too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at what frequency?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel stock cooler over here, nearly hits 100c at 30 percent usage since i have a 1650 super",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s what you should always include.,"ambient temp is very important, i have a 360 aio and my idle temp is 30 with ambient temp is at 27",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
using big dual tower cooler on ryzen 5800x results in those temperatures.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm using the stock settings for it, but when gaming it'll stay between 4.6 - 4.8ghz but still be at a comfortable temp.",i haven't ran a stress like cinebench or anything since i don't use any rendering programs.,all the games i tested haven't broken into the 60's.,iirc highest i saw was 58c so far.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but my point wasn't that it idles in the 20's.,my point was that you shouldn't judge idle temp in the bios because it will be higher than in windows.,i just used my example to help prove that point.,ambient temp doesn't matter.,"if my room was ambient 40c, it would still idle lower temp in windows vs the bios.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which one?,brand and model of case and fan?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my point wasnâ€™t about being idle at bios or not iâ€™m just pointing out that if you omit ambiant temp you give a false hope or wrong expectations for the op as his temps wonâ€™t match yours if you have the same set up so heâ€™ll think something is terribly wrong with his cpu/aio/case,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whatever.,all i was saying to the op is: don't judge idle temps in the bios.,nothing more.,give it up already.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"normal wattage for 5.0/4.0 ghz, move along.",why would you introduce such insane avx offset (or an offset in general) is beyond me.,"though i can see either your aio is bottom tier or there's severe ihs to coldplate geometry mismatch, which was my case with 12700k and liquid freezer ii (360 mm).","had to sand the trash ihs down and use conductonaut in the end anyway, it's still 83 c under 220 w, which is garbage temperature, but at least it doesn't exceed 100 c under stock settings and crash the system in result.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you try undervolting?,the best way to overclock alderlake is to use vf offset overclocking *while* increasing ratios.,"otherwise, expect high power consumption since the default curve is very conservative.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you're using adaptive mode, you can set the voltage for the max oc ratio.",the voltage will interpolate for the ratios between oc max and stock max.,"if you're not going above the stock max ratio, leave it on auto.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sounds like a aio mount issue.,did you get the right lga1700 hardware for the cooler?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are u useing an aio that can mount only one fan to it?,"those are just too weak for 12th gen. if that is the case and u are using a single fan aio u should deffinetly get a 2 or 3 fan aio if it fits in ur case, if not than get an air cooler instead.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
undervolted 12600k 5ghz p-cores/ 4.3ghz e-cores reaches \~180-200w in cinebench.,that's normal tdp.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>s my case with 12700k and liquid freezer ii (360 mm).,"had to sand the trash ihs down and use conductonaut in the end anyway, it's still 83 c under 220 w, which is garbage temperature, but at 

thanx for the info i will work again on the cooler.",so intel xtu also reports 220-230w for such speeds right?,"i had no idea....  


as for the avx offset, i didn't introduce anything.","it was the default by intel xtu, and i thought i will just leave it like that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i didn't try that.,"i tried static voltage (1.240 below that seems unstable) and adaptive voltage/dafault, but no negative offset.",btw is there any point in applying offset in static voltage...?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes i have, although it is in my plans to resit the cooler.",basically temps are not my main concern.,"when tdp is enforced to 180w or so (by limit power boost), temps stay in the low 80s range, which i think is accepted.",my concern is the tdp that jumps to 220-230 or even higher!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how about reading the first paragraph.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"delete the offset entirely, it's stupid.","i use cinebench r23 for stress testing (no way will it pass prime95 under such temperatures) and it's 220 w of power draw in my case, 5.0/4.0/4.4 ghz respectively, at 1.28 v on p and e cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ok nwm, im dumb.",didnt know 280 mm aio can mount 2 fans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"last question (i think)

  
you 1.28v on all cores, is it the reported voltage, or the set voltage.","because i set mine to static like 1.240 or so, but it flactuates sometimes up to 1.28 etc (due to loadline calibration i suppose and such)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the i7-12700k is not ""overclocked"".",it's an unlocked processor that is overclockable if one has a z690 motherboard.,it's up to you to overclock it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

just curious how much speed and capacity differences because of the sa voltage?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is very outdated advice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends.,a friend of mine is fresh from testing i3 12100f against 10105 and alder lakes locked sa limited >16 gb of ram< to 3466 mhz.,it'd be even worse for 32 gigs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no it is not.,5950x is faster than 12900k for multicore and consumes only half the power for it.,5900x is a little faster than 12700k for multicore and consumes about 30% less power for it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
does it matter how many sticks?,i.e.,"2 vs 4 , or is it just capacity ?",and are there limitations like this if you're using it for ddr5?,just trying to understand.,fwiw  i built a 12700 (no k) for my father and he's running 32gb @ 3600 without problem.,2 x 16 sticks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then how so b motherboards support even  4400mhz ram?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"except the alder lake equivalents are consistently about $50-80 cheaper, with only the 5950x and 5600 truly being at cost parity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you even ever heard of non k chips and h and b series intel boards?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"higher capacity and higher clock with tighter timings on dual rank kits usually requires more system agent voltage, b-die are imc heavy due to their native tight timings, thus cjr and such does not tax the controller as much.","i'm not quite sure which voltage is dependant by amount of sticks, but i think none and it's about amount of ranks and total capacity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"system agent voltage is absolutely on cpu side, it's derivatived from input/aux voltage.",non-k cpu skews have the control locked within their firmware.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the motherboards are usually 50$ more expensive for the same quality socket 1700 vs am4.,5950x is 50$ cheaper than 12900k + faster mt + it will save you money for electricity and heat a lot less.,how is alder lake a better buy now??,"it was only better buy until march, after that ryzen prices went down.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"so you say that i won't be able to set for example 3600mhz on my ram sticks?i have dual channel, 2x8 gigs  
with 3600mhz base clock",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"except thatâ€™s not quite right, because the msi pro b660m-a (and its z690 counterpart) exists, and is a fully worthwhile and excellent $130 board for any locked alder lake chip whatsoever (and the 12600k can go on there too in a pinch).","iâ€™ll grant that zen 3 is still extremely competitive at its discounted pricing, but the 12600k in particular blows away anything amd has in that price range, and the 12400f and 12700f are impressively affordable and efficient too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also i should add that my ram sticks do support intel xmp,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm saying there will be a high possibility you will encounter issues, as imcs are not born equal.","it's not guaranteed you will not run ram on such speed, but since xmp is overclocking, intel only guarantees your cpu to run flawlessly at the locked system agent voltage at 3200 mhz/mbps and anything else is pure lottery you literally can't do anything about.",3800 mhz and above is almost completely out of the question.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"while it's true it's lower than historical gains with a new node, they don't have a particular reason to focus on density.","at under certain die size, other parts dominate costs, such as packaging.",years ago they said a 100mm2 die would be about $5 to make but the packaging would add additional $5.,so cutting that die in half won't help much.,there's also the clock focus on x86 chips.,"if it runs at high clocks and thus has a high heat density, with already a small die size there's no reason to go all in on packing them tight as possible, since it'll worsen the issue.",that article is saying that crestmont is getting a larger 52% area improvement versus redwood cove getting 34% improvement.,that's with core changes.,it supports the heat density + clock theory.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
while it was never an exact science the node process usually directly related to a physical distance in a processor (gate pitch as an example).,"if i am remembering correctly the last time that was is intel's 22nm node, since then it's been a bit more obscure as to what it's refering to so essentially node naming is just marketing.","add on the nodes are not nearly the jump they were in years prior, which allowed chip design to be pushed harder to make up for the lack of ""free"" performance a new node gets you.","add in the ""need"" for ai and ml accelerators and they are becoming a much different beast than they were previously.",so i guess you could say it's complicated.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not directly stated: seems to confirm meteor lake mobile focus.,"less than theoretical improvement is very unsurprising to me, i imagine the #1 goal is reducing risk, since 5 nodes in 4 years is ridiculous enough anyway.",intel 4 is also very low volume.,"192 eu arrow lake mobile was originally planned for q4 '23, sounds like it was changed to be a 192 eu mtl variant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think they're planning on slicing dies down even further as time progresses and rely more on 3d packaging because its getting a lot harder to keep defect/area rate down.,also easier to slap on different ip blocks without significant redesigns.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wafer costs are expanding like wild,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
actually it was 90nm when things really started disintegrating in node names.,gate scaling slowed to a crawl then.,things like strained silicon introduced in 90nm was further enhanced to counteract that.,"it's even logical to say problems started with 130nm(0.13u), when they had to get copper interconnects.","with 45nm intel introduced hi-k dielectrics, which brought ""equivalent thickness"" metric for the dielectric.","by the finfet generation of 22nm, node names were completely irrelevant.","just think of new nodes as naming the new apple phone, ""iphone 2023"".",it's better than the predecessor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the problem is not just defect and wafer costs.,"some blocks like analog and i/o, the process is getting too small to be useful, and/or isn't scaling as well.","like for power delivery you need wires to be thick, not thinner.",so why would you put that in the most fancy smallest process?,some things just don't scale well.,look at dram.,"1x, 1y, 1a, 1b, 1c, those are all 10nm-class node.","meaning it would be 18nm, 16nm, 14nm, 12nm, 10nm, who knows?","that's because the capacitors can't be super thin and are a limiter to scaling.\*

\*there's also the fact that dram blocks are far, far smaller than cpu blocks.",dram 1xnm is like cpu 3nm or something.,so it's much closer to the fundamental limit.,this is likely the reason sram scaling is slowing down.,it's closer than logic to limit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thank you for the correction, on process node.","i remember reading they were changing what they were measuring (gate size vs gate pitch) to justify the naming nomenclature, but became so laughable most technically people look at the process for its traits of power efficiency, ipc and transistor switching more so than gain from just a shrink.",14nm was not even in the same ball park as 14nm+++ so yeah marketing at its finest.,awesome post!,very thorough walkthrough of the changes to gates over time and the challenges of continual shrinking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you.,"basically what's happening is the minimum feature size is the limiter for scaling, since you run into fundamental limits such as tools.",so you do things to keep the minimum feature size similar while doing things to improve performance.,"14nm variants are not as impressive as they claimed: [https://images.anandtech.com/doci/15971/section%201%20%2815%29.jpg](https://images.anandtech.com/doci/15971/section%201%20%2815%29.jpg)

that's for performance, but 10nm, even if it's slower, it lowers capacitance which results in lower power.","faster 14nm has to rely on voltage scaling, which ran into a limit back in the early 2000s with the pentium 4 chips.",so you can pretty much forget about using 14nm+++ to lower power compared to regular 14nm.,"maybe a few %, but nothing a true new process will do.",they are really running into limits now.,"sram used to scale half the size, but on the apple chips(and also meteorlake) the scaling is now only 20-30%.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

u will never hit that clock speed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
base speed is a meaningless number.,"basically, all it indicates is, â€œat the default intel-specified long term power limits, the cpu can probably maintain this speed long termâ€.","as the 12700 has a lot of cores but a low pl1 of 65 watts, the matching speed will be low as well.","however, even then it will be jumping all over the place because what actually matters to the limit is workload power draw, not ghz, and if you remove power limits it really does become a pointless specification.","what matters to choosing a cpu besides core counts, in my opinion, are these numbers:

* maximum turbo boost speed (this will typically apply to 1 or 2 cores, and intel provides it in specs)
* maximum all-core speed (intel does not provide this number despite it being the most useful, as itâ€™s what your cpu will top out on a heavy all-core workload, like rendering or benchmarks)
* expected power draw (typically pl2, even if you decide to remove the limit, will give you an idea of the amount of power the chip will consume and help you pick cases and cooling).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"it's normal for the cpu clock to fluctuate slightly, and this is not affected by voltage.","also blowing your cpu is literally impossible since you can't put such an high voltage in the bios, at worst the cpu will degrade with time, and end up needing higher voltages to maintain stability.","1.084v is very low, i don't know exactly what is considered a safe daily voltage for your cpu but it should be around 1.35v under load.","it also depends on your cooling, if you can maintain low temperatures you can push higher voltages safely.","also 4ghz is very low, is there any particular reason why you aimed for this frequency?",unless you care a lot about efficiency or have terrible cooling you can go higher.,"i'd try 1.2v and see how high you can increase the frequency before it becomes unstable, checking the temperature under load during the process.","if it's too high try a lower voltage / frequency, if it's still low go higher.","be aware that mine are just general indications , i strongly suggest looking for a detailed overclock guide specific to your cpu since that's the best way to do it properly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
shouldnt the 10900k be able to overclock to 5-5.2ghz?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

since you're on ddr4, the imc voltage is vccsa, which is non-adjustable on non-k processors.","&nbsp;

"imc frequency = base clock /2 * multiplier * (odd ratio)

odd ratio is either 133:100 mode or 100:100 mode

multiplier is whatever multiplier you set.","memory frequency = imc frequency * gear

gear 1 will have 100 mt/s or 133 mt/s increases

gear 2 will have 200 mt/s or 266 mt/s increases (and will round off tcl to be a multiple of 2)

gear 4 will have 400 mt/s or 533 mt/s increases (and will round off tcl to be a multiple of 4)

obviously some bent pins can be fixed.,can't see the backside and we do not have a scope to look into the pcb layers to see if anything is actually fried connection wise.,we could be looking at burn residue on the surface.,without a better inspection it is unclear from this single photo.,if the connections are disrupted/broken/melted then yes it would be a paper weight or circular file candidate no doubt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah some of them look fatter in the middle now like they got super hot and started to melt.,wtf did the 'repair' place do?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not at all more dependent how severe and or as another poster correctly pointed out is whether or not the connections under the pins are fried.,if that is the case its right into the e-waste it goes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"useless, this isnâ€™t a cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
true but one needs to know if the connections under those pins are still operable.,photo shows them blackened.,if those are no longer working the board is a e-waste candidate regardless of straightening the pins.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it certainly can be done.,did you notice the black char on the the pins and bottom?,if those connectors under that are melted or broken its a paper weight or e-waste.,no amount of pin straightening fixes broken connectors in the pcb layers.,hoping for the best for them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

sounds like a bit of a drawn out solution to me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the tools to fix are the same, use a straight edge thin object, a razor blade in this case and or needle nose tweezers.",i only provided as a courtesy.,i am a retired hardware engineer (its in my name) and its what i have personally used among other tools like a cc in a pinch.,"feel free to use amazon, ones local hardware store, a credit card in ones wallet if one so desires if it gets the job done for one self.",this did not imply 100% success rate.,you take it as they come and do the best you can.,many times you can fix yourself.,other times you can not.,unsure why one would think another cpu would help one straighten contact pins.,shrug.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

depends on your current cpu.,"but meteor lake is a year away, raptor lake is a few months away.",if you're itching for an upgrade now the obvious answer is raptor lake.,plus you'll be able to keep using cheap ddr4.,"it's extremely unlikely meteor lake keeps that support, even if it somehow ends up still on lga1700",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes raptor lake will have decent performance uplift over alder lake.,expecting it to be quite competitive against zen 4. beating zen 4 in performance but losing out in efficiency.,efficiency difference will not be as bad as alder lake vs zen 3. the increased cache and ecores will help raptor lake hit high multi threaded performance without driving crazy high power consumption.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

where do you find such info ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes meteor lake focused on power efficiency rather than performance.,arrow lake will be a more powerful cpu for desktop.,meteor lake is more of laptop level performance and efficiency,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"now it sounds like a joke, but i actually did managed to wait 11 years on 2500k till 12600k for 2x single thread increase in cinebench r15(150->300)

"the rumors about intel 4 delay are likely garbage, but timelines you quoted seem to be about right.",it's less to do with delays with the fundamental part of the cpu then it is due to needing to give products certain time period in the market.,raptorlake will be maybe late q3 or so of this year so meteorlake being q2 makes no sense.,"while they can speed up a bit for desktop meteorlake doesn't focus on desktops at all, and considering alderlake mobile launched q1 of this year, that makes q1 of 2023 for raptor and q1 of 2024 for meteor.",i can see the 5w meteorlake chips coming in q2.,but expect most lineups to be a quarter or two after that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
letâ€™s wait for hdmi 3.0 and dp2.2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and then you can overclock the shit out of it without requiring nuclear reactor cooling as with alder lake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
leaking sites like videocardzcom or wcftechcom.,or from twitter leakers.,all speculative though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what?,the 12600k doesn't even come close to the ~250w power draw an 11700 can hit using avx.,even the 12900k uses less power than an 8 core rocket lake.,"there are cheap b560 boards, but you will need a board with a proper vrm to make the 11700 run at it's full 4.4 ghz turbo boost all core frequency.",the msi b560 torpedo is the minimum spec i'd recommend.,"&nbsp;

"1. could be a motherboard problem
2. try updating the bios
3. try shuffling the ram slots

there are many variables at play here.,"you have dual rank memory chips, which are hard to run on 1t gear 1, even at xmp 3200mt/s.",you'd face the exact same issues on 11th gen and on amd systems with stock voltage.,"while you can't adjust the vccsa voltage, you might be able to change odt (depending on your mobo).","this might help, but honestly you should just enable gear 2 or use 2933mt/s gear 1 and be done with it.",you will not feel the difference.,additionally gear 2 may improve performance on locked cpus because it leaves more power budget to the cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the non-k cpus have system agent (vccsa) voltage restricted to 0.925v or similar low value.,as a result the mem controller does not have enough power to run in 1:1 mode (gear 1) with ram at 3600mhz or higher.,but 3200 should be fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

interesting.,i am not finding what you are talking about.,3200mhz is the minimum supported speed.,if you cannot achieve that then you literally have a defect and can return/replace.,i do see some people having trouble reaching 3600mhz but i doubt people are writing articles to complain about reaching the speed so you are experiencing survivor bias.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i don't know about that.,if qvl lists that ram at specific speed then it is supposed to run at that speed.,if it's not running at specific speed then they screwed up bad.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
could be.,i forgot to add that i was able to push 3600mhz somewhat stable with very high vccsa and vccio voltages but i wasn't comfortable with them.,auto voltages were also high.,"i also remember how there was a very cheap i7-11700k, msi z590, 3600mhz ram and rtx 3080 bundle available.",almost everyone complained how they couldn't use the xmp without issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

newer motherboard bioses are supposed to default to gear 2 for anything higher than ddr4-3200 if i've understood correctly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there are a lot of reviews for your motherboard.,some of them call it the best b660 motherboard for certain reasons.,"it has been out for months and no one has bothered to recant or make a dramatic ""do not buy msi motherboards"" click bait.",i mean this in the optimistic and hopeful way possible that there is hope for your build if you don't give up on it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

tbh i cant really say for sure.,"but, i have read some china / taiwanese report, there are a quite a lot of discussion on locked vccsa and its effects on ram controller.","there is a post about it from china ( even msi manager responded the post) , it seems before release intel provides chips to manufacturers which vccsa is unlocked in both k and non-k version.",there is a guy with similar experience with me - cant even run 3200mhz rams,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

>there is less heat generated and who the heck needs hyper threading when you have 16 real cores??,it's significantly more computing power.,heat generation is not an issue in games.,"also ""real cores"" is a bit weird language.",hyperthreading means one core receives instruction stream from two processing threads.,this enables much more efficient use of execution resources since a thread is often stalled.,">as for the e cores, are they ok to leave enabled if i consider going back to win10??",should cause no problems.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

those celerons were nice.,"drill out the br1 via , a few soldered wires, and you could run dual slotted.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel had the pentium ii, xeon, and celerons from that era were slot 1, and amd had the athalon cpus that were slot a. 

there were some really interesting pieces of hardware around then, since isa slots were still in use for things like sound cards and modems/nics.","it was around then that we saw the uptick in pci slot usage of those components, and graphics cards were about 90% agp by then.",i still remember during the piii days seeing the first agp 4x slots start appearing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel made this to make it easy for replacing the cpu, give better cooling option, and giving better memory flexibility as the l2 cache were added in the same cpu pcb, not like today on the cpu die, it was off the die, and because of how small the cpu package was on socket 370, that was very limited options.","it seemed a nice idea, and amd released their first athlon on slot a as well (intel used slot 1), and then the first 1ghz cpu used the slot (the amd athlon 1ghz), and kept going until speeds of 1.0-1.13ghz (1.4ghz unofficially) when things went ugly, the main two reasons were the fsb between the cpu slot and the chipset, the slot added uneven lengths to the bus traces in the motherboard leading to some issues with timing and latency, especially when going for faster memory as the ram were connected to the chipset at that time, not the cpu, the faster it goes, the worst it become.","and the second was cooling was much more limited than a socketed cooler, the cooler became heavy and the slot couldn't handle the weight as there was no mounting holes for the cooler.","intel moved to back to sockets with a new socket 370, and amd created the socket a.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if i recall correctly, that was around the time when having the l2 sram cache being physically next to the cpu was far better than being far off somewhere else on the motherboard, even if that l2 cache was smaller.",(and some of the super cheap motherboards didn't bother to have l2 cache which predictably crippled cpu performance in many different ways.),"once they were able to include the l2 cache within the cpu package itself, the need for the cpu slot connectors went away.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

simple solution - ebay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i second the guy who said ebay.,although why would you even want one?,personally i take those stickers off.,why would i advertise for intel for free?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but ebay is not in india right?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
par for the course.,throw prime95 on there and you'll hit 100c and start throttling.,i'm hitting 100c right now as i'm encoding in handbrake with a d15 and nt-h2 paste.,your ambient temp will make a big difference.,been pulling 205w for the paste 3 months straight while using under 1.25v vcore.,on the plus side i've been wearing shorts in my home office since february :d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you're running cinebench and not hitting tjmax, you're doing good

with my motherboard and case, i can't keep the 12900k under tjmax while running cinebench if power limits are removed using the same nh-d15",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have the same setup as you but i'm using a meshify 2 compact case.,my temps reaches 100c when benching but they are under 80c when gaming.,i think you have great temps for an air cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"cinebench score is where it should be for stock, and 87c is good for an air cooler.",i'd leave it be unless youre unhappy with the fan speed and want to put the 360mm into service.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's ok.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what's the wattage of your 12900k under cinebench?,"in terms of modifying, put some washers (0.5-1.2 mm height) under the socket screws and see if they improve your temps, in general results vary between no difference to a couple of degrees.","also, check the thermal paste pressure distribution and compare it with the coldplate of d15, there's a possibility you may want to rotate the cooling in order to get the best contact between ihs and cooler, but it will introduce airflow issues due to a used chassis.","i've got 12700k with a sanded ihs that has +0.05mm difference between ihs centre and vertical surface edges and i still needed to opt for conductonaut instead of regular thermal paste (mx-5), as the pressure made by arctic lf ii (gen i) lga 1700 kit was just bad.",so instead of almost 100 c on non-sanded cpu on stock 200 w i went to \~90 c during 220 w heat load after sanding down and with conductonaut i have 82 c with 220 w heatload.,and i still consider this result as just straight out trash.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the noctua is noticeably loud and the case is very quiet - i might tweak it a little i have not touched my bios fan settings at all.,"if anything i was considering a 420 aio as i believe they can fit in the torrent at the front or the bottom, although the thing is made for air so if these temps seem fine i may just leave it be.",would have to remove the mega 180-mm fan if  i wanted an aio in the front too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hwinfo says peak package wattage is 235 - is that the right reading?,"i have looked into sanding, thermal grizzly's aftermarket contact plate, etc.",never heard of the washer thing.,i might give these a try later down the line.,"the pressure looks good if i remove the noctua, i used arctic paste rather than theirs just because i already had it.","your results seem pretty bad considering the aio used, damn.",what settings do you run?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"your temps are more than fine, definitely don't do the washer mod.","just do a small undervolt if anything, you won't lose any perf and still will probably be able to oc a bit.","that said, i switched from a d15 with a 9900k to the arctic 280mm on my 12900k and the temps are much better and it's quieter in the new build.",so you have a way out if you're chasing low noise levels.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just to say that i have an arctic cooler freezer 420 and 12900kf, rtx 3080 etc.",i iive in brazil with ambient temperature of 28 celsius degrees.,i reach 79 celsius( as max.,temp) in cinebench 10 minutes multi-core test.,"i attached 2 simple fans to the exterior part of the radiator to do ""push and pull"".",i will complete with the 3rd one of 140mm.,it is an excellent aio!,!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"settings don't matter, only power consumption and it's like above.","i don't mean pressure per se, i mean how pressurized is the paste, in what pattern.","this was mine [https://imgur.com/a/ul6ij4y.jpg](https://imgur.com/a/ul6ij4y.jpg) before sanding and you can see an astronomous area of low pressure due to lf iis coldplate being as close to being flat as a manufacturing process lets it be, resulting in a slow heat transfer from the centre of a die, where cpu cores are located.","i advise you to check, if d15s coldplate unevenness matches that area.",though your temps seem actually alright for that power draw cooled by d15.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why no washer mod?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"washer mod costs close to nothing, can't do any harm and is undetectable on rma.",there's no reason not to try washer mod.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes that sounds about right it seems to be the best aio at the moment - i was researching though and it seems like [even though my case can take a 420mm radiator the arctic doesn't fit the front unless you modify the case.,](https://www.reddit.com/r/fractaldesign/comments/q30r9w/psa_fractal_torrent_arctic_freezer_420mm_aio/) so i may need to do something about that in future.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">  i don't mean pressure per se

yeah sorry, i know what you meant i have seen videos on it, mine doesn't have that variance, at least at the moment, the pattern is pretty consistent all in all.",i might just se if i can get my noise level more under control and then leave it as is for now then.,"right now the case fans are inaudible but d15 is noticeable, probably could ramp up the 180mm intake fans a bit more and that may help.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in your case it's not going to help much if at all and you can damage something in the process.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there are plenty of ways things can go south doing the washermod, all for likely marginal improvements.","it should be a last resort after remounting/repasting and exchanging or rma, especially since ops temps are fine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i guess some lian li or mesh pc cases have a version that can be paired with arctic c. 420. my case is a brazilian product.,it fits without any modification.,"i guess it would be very cheap to you, if you could import hehe : gabinete gamer galax andromeda preto sem fans gx900 https://www.amazon.com.br/dp/b099dfkp8q/ref=cm_sw_r_awdo_pmz6byr2d8p1r1ywhpxd",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if it's consistent then you've got a good match and best you can do is washer mod and applying liquid metal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as in what exactly can go south?,"you unscrew the socket mounting bracket, put a washer or rubber o-ring under it and screw it back in - done.",have you ever seen or read on how the washer mod works?,"there's literally more danger in putting an actual cpu into the socket than the mod itself, you literally can't break anything while doing it.","&#x200b;

temps seem fine - but they can be better.","and given how people reported even 5 c of temps drop, the washer mod is worth a try.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm pretty sure we have galax in europe, but i just got this case and want to use it for a while",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

lmaooooo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, after removing the washermod and putting the cpu without the washers, they were straighter than your reasoning after i lifted the cpu while washers were installed.","learn to read, before you adamantly downvote people you don't understand.","&#x200b;

wait the msrp i don't know how prices are managed in the market now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't know how's the price now but you missed the boat selling it at the peak because of the fast memory i think you'd be able to exchange it for 3060 ti,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i wasn't able to sell it cuz the best offer i got for it was around $300, also i needed my pc for work and gaming so selling my gpu like that was a bad idea",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"modern cpus have complicated boosting algorithms with clock speeds depending on many factors (not sure which ones, maybe load and thermals).","up to 4.2 means that if you don't oc it, it'll go as high as 4.2 under the perfect conditions (meaning decent cooling and bursty single-core loads).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's ghz, and that's the max single core boost clock.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so itâ€™s around that by default?,i donâ€™t have to change settings?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's up to 4.2 if you don't change any settings.,"it'll slow down to save energy (and keep cool) if it doesn't have anything useful to do, though.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok thanks that helped a lot:),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"https://www.agner.org/optimize/instruction_tables.pdf

it is limited to 1 sse load or store per cycle, which is 16 bytes.","so if everything else is perfectly efficient the max bandwidth, from any cache, is 16*clock_frequency.","if you're testing at 2.4 ghz, that is 38 gb/s.","you're getting about 74% of the theoretical max, which is pretty close considering that some loads will miss the l1 and that the benchmark is probably not scheduled ideally for an obscure low power processor.",so really it isn't that the l1 is slow but rather that the processor itself is slow.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bandwidth is not everything.,"silvermont had lower l1 latency (3 cycles even for complex mov's) i guess it was more power efficient this way,

**silvermont l1d latency:**

l1 data cache latency = 3 cycles for simple access via pointer

l1 data cache latency = 3 cycles for access with complex address calculation (size\_t n, \*p; n = p\[n\]).","**sandy bridge l1d latency:**

l1 data cache latency = 4 cycles for simple access via pointer

l1 data cache latency = 5 cycles for access with complex address calculation (size\_t n, \*p; n = p\[n\]).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the explanation.,and yet they used silvermonts to make xeon phi.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they added avx512 to the phi, so it would have been able to do at least 64 bytes per clock, maybe more (can't remember if it could do two avx512 per cycle).","edit:  looking at the above knights landing could do 2 512 bit loads per cycle, so i guess it would be 128 bytes per clock, at least if the cache can keep up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they didn't just stick on silvermont and call it a day.,"they called it ""heavily modified"" silvermont.",the next big iteration was goldmont which brought 30% gains over silvermont(and the practically zero gain shrink airmont).,based on the changes.,"xeon phi's silvermont was probably between silver and gold, although phi's version was specifically optimized to boost hpc workloads that use avx.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they both run 65 watt so it is fine.,wouldn't worry about it because it is probably just pulling more current because it is hotter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you change anything in the bios when you changed coolers?,"perhaps you have an msi motherboard and you changed the ""cooler"" setting from stock to tower cooler?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i stress tested my 12600 for an hour using occt, the maximum power draw was 68w.",so i should only need to raise the thermal limit to 75w to maintain max boost.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wait, is this a new post?",why 10920x??,"and ""new""???",12600kf beats 10920x by 25% in multithread performance...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i used a xeon w-2255 (essentially the xeon variant of the core 10900x) with 64gb registered ecc at 2933 mhz and it was fine.,you could also look for a used xeon w-2100 series system.,"btw, keep in mind that for example on a 12000 series board with 20 / 24 pcie lanes you can bifurcate the 16 slot (check motherboard features).",even a 3090ti will show minimal difference between running on 8 versus 16 lanes.,that gives you 8 extra 4.0 lanes (!),my point is: you may not need the x299 for the 48 3.0 lanes.,quad channel ddr4 had similar bandwidth to dual channel ddr5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
better getting a temp x99 setup to hold you over.,you're gonna regret jumping to x299 with whats coming out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what u end up buying bro i am also looking at an msi x299,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if pcie lanes are a priority, you need to connect multiple hdmi input cards, sound cards,  etc .. it would make sense.",if you are looking at processing power just go for the 12900k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just don't do it.,if you need memory bandwidth go with a 12900k or 13900k with ddr5.,quite a few hedt benchmarks showed very little performance difference between dual and quad core.,these newer ddr5 low latency kits will blow quad ddr4 out of the water.,only reason i could think of running 10920x would be if you need to run windows server which have issues with the hybrid design.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the processor you reference doesnt have enough pci lanes and mem bandwidth is way less than 10920x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you seen any indication of what the cost is going to be for a cpu + mobo on the new hedt architecture?,i havent seen any pricing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,i am looking forward to upgrading to whatever this ends up being.,the leaks have been delicious.,i just hope a 360aio is enough to cool the beast.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how about threadrippers?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what makes you need 128gb ram??,?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

both antenna are typically used for the same function typically.,"some mesh hotspots support using two radios at two different frequencies, one for wifi and one for hotspot.",not sure about your specific device but on cheaper gear taking turns on the same channel is pretty common.,edit:  quick google search says it only does one radio at a time and implements the hot spot by time sharing between the two functions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"rereading this, what i wrote was unclear.",for a dual antenna system both have to transmit or both have to receive at the same time (at least for each frequency).,if one tries to transmit while the other receivers then the receiver will be completely overwhelmed by the transmitter next to it.,the only way to send and receive at the same time is to use two different radios at two different frequencies.,having more or less antenna doesn't matter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just experiment and see if increasing it helps, tbh it probably doesnâ€™t matter because most games arenâ€™t optimized for multithreading.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would putting it at max thread do anything to my pc since all threads would be dedicated to the game?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's not going to damage your pc.,"background tasks will just take longer to complete, and if you have it on windowed mode and try to use another application its possible that other application will be laggy.",i'd put max threads to 6 and if youre not happy with the result just tweak it lower.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is the maximum the game is allowed to create.,"the actual max that it will create is probably very low, so setting it higher won't necessarily make that many.","as for your pc, there is no limit (beyond the amount of ram you have available to hold them) to the number of threads you can have active.","only as many as you have logical cores will run at once, and the others will wait their turn.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

rockitcool are great.,i still have their delid tool that i used for my 4790k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is delid-ing?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
worth noting this is going in a z690 asus extreme glacial.,iâ€™m waiting for a waterblock to come out for the 3090ti still before this build comes together,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think they went out of business last i heard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™d reach out to them for yours, but my 12900ks was around $100 that included delid, benchmarking, copper ihs install and 2 day shipping back to me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s due to turn around time.,basically when i sent them my initial message asking some questions one of them was about turn around time.,the response i got was basically that they only keep enough stock in the delid service to make the turnaround time about 2-3 days after they received the cpu.,that keeps things moving.,iâ€™ve only really interacted with james and i think he might be the only one doing this like it could be a 1 to 2 man operation there which iâ€™m sure sucks for profit but you get great personal service.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so cpus have an integrated heat sink.,thatâ€™s the aluminum bit on the top of the cpu that you apply thermal paste to and stick a cooler or water block on.,"delidding is when you remove that aluminum ihs, remove the thermal compound intel uses, and replace it with much better thermal compound, and then put the ihs back on.",youâ€™ll get better temps this way as the aftermarket thermal compound is much more effective at pulling heat away from the die than the factory stuff from intel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's gonna be one criminally powerful rig my friend.,enjoy it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

they did.,they said that intel's and amd's aggressive binning/boosting made it incredibly difficult to consistently get large overclocks to justify the higher prices.,"and if they got a lemon cpu, they have to sell it at a lower price than the regular retail cpu prices because the buyer would know for certain that they wouldn't be getting good ocing results.",all of that meant they couldn't make a profit anymore.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

probably cuz that line of boards is still relatively new,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

by streaming do you mean something like youtube and netflix or steaming your gameplay?,if it's about watching videos and productivity apps anything modern will do - including that one.,i'm more worried about the 12gb part.,is that a 8gb + 4gb sticks i.e.,no dual channel for 4gb of the memory?,p.s.,"keep in mind that this processor has configurable tdp starting from 13w and clock of 700mhz up to 25w, so the performance of the chip will depend on the laptop.",usually in small and cheap laptops you see the lowest possible implementation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

could potentially make a comeback with mtl generation.,"since skl intel hasnâ€™t released any 5w parts, only 9w with icl, tgl, adl; looks to be finally changing with mtl.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
alder lake was their zen moment.,"if you're talking about a zen ""+62% ipc"" moment, then that's far into the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
alder lake was that.,"look at the huge multithreaded gains over rocket lake, tiger lake and comet lake.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they already had that with conroe.,now their cores aren't that bad that you can do a 62% improvement.,"i think more important that absolute performance, i am expecting great improvements in efficiency with mtl/arl.",especially as they adopt euv and then ribbonfet xtors.,we are definitely entering a great era with both intel/amd having great cpus and hopefully challenging apple in efficiency as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"mtl should be their zen2 moment, i guess",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
zen moments come from huge design changes or overcoming the limitations of a design change.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the little cores on alder lake and latter should help a lot with efficiency, especially as support improves for them.","lots of windows apps still work a lot better with a mouse/keyboard though, so hybrid 2 in 1 devices are probably here to stay.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have had windows tablets of years, it works fine.","i just want a cheap tablet for on the go, and full sized usb ports have saved me before.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"bc they refuse to use risc chips, which isnâ€™t a bad thing imo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they released 4 core y skus with amber lake.,you just made me find out that intel released an sku with lte built in.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
\+62% ipc gen over gen can only happen these days when you've been rehashing the same trash for a decade though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
risc vs cisc has 0 to do with it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
amber lake was the same skl core but i didnâ€™t know they had lte built in in some skus.,interestingâ€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok so apples use of risc arm chips doesnâ€™t have anything to do with why theyâ€™re more power efficientâ€¦right..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
risc vs. cisc hasn't mattered in 20 years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's exactly right.,compare core widths to anything x86 or even other arm parts-apple cores are ridiculously wide and don't break 3.5ghz while also using some of the densest process libraries on the market today.,has absolutely nothing to do with arm vs x86 vs risc-v.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then why are all battery dependent devices (mobile phones + tablets) risc chips and the only place you see x86 x64 cisc chips is in laptops and desktops.,"you can say it doesnâ€™t matter, but it would seem that practically in real world application it does.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">then why are all battery dependent devices (mobile phones + tablets) risc chips

x86 tablets definitely exist.",you're actually talking about them now.,">you can say it doesnâ€™t matter, but it would seem that practically in real world application it does.","there are two surviving architectures that are used in phones/tablets/pcs, x86 and arm.","x86 is not a typical cisc, arm is almost the polar opposite of classic risc, and the pure risc designs like mips are all but dead.","risc vs. cisc hasn't mattered in 20 years, and it was the architectures that ignored the debate that survived.",trying to analyze 2020s cpus using 1980s technology ideas is just dumb.,technology has moved on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
z77 supported 3.0 and z97 does too.,"some motherboards have both 3.0 and 2.0 slots on them, consult motherboard manual before buying.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel first supported pcie 3 on ivy bridge and its 70-series chipsets and haswell has it too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"dell pc5f7/6x1tj/n4yc8 motherboard has pcie 3.0 x16 theyâ€™re used in the optiplex 9020 the dell motherboardâ€™s are proprietary so you have to use a dell 9020 psu and dell 9020 cpu cooler but there are adapters but for them, you can an atx case but youâ€™ll need an adapter for the power button",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i've used a h81, b85, z87 maximus and currently a z97-ws.",all of them worked perfectly fine with pci express 3.0 x16.,the one i'm using rn has 4 pci express x16 3.0 slots.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the cpu has 16 pcie 3.0 lanes (1x16, 2x8 or 1x8+2x4) while the chipset has additional 8 pcie 2.0 lanes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whatever you're seeing on the site cannot be correct.,pci-e 3.0 support was introduced with ivy bridge.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i legit still feel content with my sandy for everyday tasks.,"starting to grow out of gaming and only playing older titles occasionally, it still holds up extremely well.",what an incredible cpu family!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you mean rtx 3070?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i see a man of culture, that fuma 2 will be really silent with that chip.",i used to run mine max at around 200w thermal loads.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i went from i7 870 & 1050 ti to 10850k and 3070 oc.,huge upgrade!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol i just bought a supposedly broken computer with a gtx 760 and an i7 3770k to replace my i7 2600 - wish me luck!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"boy thatâ€™s gonna be a sweet performance jump

sick upgrade!,";-)  


enjoy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i finally replaced my i7-6700k and 980ti with a i9-12900kf and 3070ti about a week ago.,what a difference it is.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
recently got myself a 12700. coming from a sandy bridge 2100. i used it for 10+ years,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"damn, you didnt take this chance to go 12**6**00k for one full cycle?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i remember sandy, she was a bad ass",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12400??,with a 3070?,i would of gone at least 12600k with a 3070â€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
from 4 cores to 6 after one decade is lousy in 2022.,8 cores minimum!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"totally unreasonable pet peeve here but you went through the effort to put gtx for your graphics cards (which btw it's an rtx 3070 not gtx), but you didn't bother to add i7 and i5 respectively for your cpus ðÿ˜¤.",congratz on the upgrade though!,the differnce is going to be night and day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a friend of mine ran his 2700k without a cooler.,sandy bridge cpus are stout!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's a sad moment for the old parts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can you let me know the cpu temps with that cooler with no pl running full load?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
those older chips sure go well for their age!,"enjoy, that's quite a substantial upgrade!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i went from a 6700k with 2 x gtx 970 in sli to a 12700kf with a 3070ti.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i still have a sandy bridge laptop from 2013 still fine but i always get rage when it only gave csgo 10 fps even if it was a esport title lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well deserved upgrade, enjoy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gtx 3070 interestingâ€¦how much is that card because like pretty sure you mean rtx 3070,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my most powerful cpu for multicore loads is still a sandy bridge-ep based xeon e5-2690 (8c/16t with similar clocks as the i7-2600).,it's still doing well and so is my older 6c/12t westmere-ep xeon.,a bit sad that modern cpus probably don't age as well now that there is big generational jumps in performance again,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
huh?,gtx 3070?,you mean rtx?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm still on a i5-2500(non-k).,"i keep getting random freezing until i shut down with no bsod, but i'm holding in there lol, at least, i'm trying to.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i miss my i7-2600k so much.,"it could hold 4.5ghz all day, on a $20 air cooler and never break 65c.","what an amazing cpu it was, but at the time i needed the money when upgrading my rig so it got sold off to someone for a very good price ($120 for the cpu + gigabyte z68 mobo + 16gb ddr3 1600mhz).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had an i7-2600s paired with an hd 6570 for quite awhile and it served me well.,eventually moved on to zen 2 but sandy bridge was great.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i went from 3570k to 12600k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i still have a few sandies; they are adequate as test mules for trying a new linux distro to see if it is bloatware.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i lost my pentium 4 few days ago which i was using it as a utorrent machine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my first pc i built in 2011 was a i7 2600k with a gtx 770. passed it down to my brother in 2017 and he used it with a 1070 right up until this year.,that pc saw 11 years of use.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can still keep her around for the hubs?,mine works pretty smooth still.,i game on my laptop but keep the desktop for work stuff.,she buzzes through everything i throw at her,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ah yes, gtx 3070",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"congrats, i did almost the same as you!",went from i5-2500k to 12700k.,still rocking my gtx 1070 because i'm waiting for the new gen to drop.,that sandy bridge cpu held on for so long even overclocked.,"after that, intel was just doing minor iterations for a long time.",i feel like i saved a lot of money over the years without giving up that much.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just recently upgraded from my ancient gulftown i7 980x and rx 580 to an i5 12400f/rtx 3060. im re-experiencing pretty much every game ive owned on pc.,im no longer in denial about how much cpus have evolved in terms of power and efficiency.,this little i5 uses 1/3 of the power my oced/watercooled 980 x used while also running 20c cooler and its in a whole other realm in terms of speed.,i dont think ill ever get rid of my x58 though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i just upgraded a month ago too, from the i5 2400 to the 12600k",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"still using my i7-3770, gtx970 with 32gb ram.","i use it for autocad, some structural designing program, dota and csgo.","thought upgrade it for 12700 but after some thinking, said nah maybe next 1 or 2 year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"dang i thought i was holding out, i havenâ€™t rebuilt my pc (besides 1 gpu upgrade) since i was 16. now iâ€™m 24 considering getting a 3000 series card and a 12th gen like you haha",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
benchmarks?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just went from i5 6600k and 1070 to i7 12700k and 3080ti boy it feels good to run apex now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dang thats a great upgrade!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my laptop's i7 4700mq gets the same numbers in games and benchmarks as an i7 2600. it has a gt 840m in it so no where near a 760 but overall it's awesome for a portable with a touchscreen.,congrats on the 12400 x 3070 tho!,it's an awesome pair.,got a friend just build 6 of em on order and they are as fast and sometimes faster than my 8700k @5.2 ghz x 3070 combo.,raptor lake non k sku still coming with e cores ?,cause that'll be awesome.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i feel you!!,i just upgraded from an i7 4790k on to a i912900k.,only did it because my motherboard finally tapped out.,gotta say it a it' a game changer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just bought parts to go from 3570k to 12400.  doubt i will make it another decade on a single chip.,waiting to upgrade gpu though.,still rocking gtx 1060 6gb.,rig was finally starting to struggle to hit 60fps 1080p.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

have to agree.,that processor was a beast.,happy with my new one and love the performance increase but it's a testament to that chip that i was able to hold on long enough to jump 10 generations of intel processors.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had a 3570k for years and it was a beast.,ocâ€™d it to 4.7 ghz and it took it like a champ.,like two years ago i think the vrms in my shitty mobo burned out from it tho.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm still so happy with my 2700k, which was sold as a ""guaranteed 4.5 ghz overclock"" bundle.","to be fair, it was only truly stable at 4.3 ghz with overvoltage, but it's been rock solid for ten (?)",years heavy use.,"it started getting unreliable, but after diagnosing i replaced the psu and it still runs 72 hours continuous prime95 at 4.2 ghz on stock voltages with temps below 75c.","with the original ssd it's still as fast as a good modern machine in any business app, and great for app development.",minor annoyance is that the graphics card (passively cooled) only runs my 4k monitor at 30hz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
indeed i did.,good catch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, so far at least i barely hear it or the case fans when things are running.",it's overkill for my current processor but i bought it with the thought that i would be able to upgrade to a nice 13th gen in the future when necessary since they are supposed to be compatible with this motherboard.,hopefully anyway.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good luck!,an upgrade is an upgrade!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whoah...  3770k was a great chip but even the 7700k is considered old at this point.,the main diff i noticed when i made the jump between the two is how fast the frequency changes happened in real time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4 cores are feeling the hurt these days,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

sb was a stunning architecture.,"i bought sb-e 3930k in 2012, overclocked it to 4,7ghz and used it on my desktop till late 2020 without any issues until i replaced it with 3900x+x570 combo.","today, that 3930k, memory and mobo are running in my linux htpc with gtx1660 and it still runs most games just fine at 1080p.","when i finally decide to upgrade my trusty gtx1080ti, i put that card into that htpc and it will be even better.",definitely my best hw purchase ever.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

everything adds cost.,everything.,"i'd assume development of an even lower tier chipset would add cost, defeating its purpose.",also have to consider the future of the system.,there's a reason why optiplex's are the go to for office machine turned gaming capable.,"even though their boards lack any special features, they still can be upgraded with a gpu.","while you may not use it, in the future it adds resale value.",what's the point of a motherboard that can't do anything other than display a signal.,"without any ""expansion"" slots it becomes outdated e-waste.","if you just want a machine for office usage, just get a pre-built mini pc.",saves space and still has the features you'd want.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there're are affordable terminals systems for this purpose.,for example many universities have such systems.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can get an h610 board for $70 +$40 celeron with an igp.,that's still very budget friendly.,"but those people on ultra budgets, people that want an entire new pc for $250, they aren't looking at diy, they are looking at prebuilts where a company like acer can get volume pricing on a trash tier 250w psu's, the cheapest custom motherboard devoid of features, tiny ssd or even still a hdd, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you're absolutely correct, but the huge vrm focus in the review sector is leading to motherboards that have done aggressive cost-cutting measures, like the asrock b600m-hdv, to [get slammed by reviews for being unable to run the 150w 12600k at full performance](https://youtu.be/llxnkr8ed9y).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so why doesn't one go for the sff sbc pc with something like m3 8100y?,those can be super tiny and hook up behind a monitor!,and can be very cheap.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"at that point i think the profit margins would be so small, that manufacturers wouldn't even bother.","one could get for example an x16 slot with x4 or x8 lanes or something like that (plenty for display out) , but beyond that i don't really see how you cna really cut costs.","you will want usb 3.0 even for an office pc, you really want 2-3 even 4 video outs for a home office/htcp pc, because 2-3 monitors for work and then 1 tv on the same computer is a good thing to have.","lower speed for ram, idk.","the motherboards on the lower end are pretty bare bones as it is, making them even more so would make profits smaller than for h610 boards.","intel has a problem with motherboard pricing generally, thats the real issue here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then customers of 12900ks would complain that their system does not work reliably at 5.5ghz in the supposedly compatible $50 motherboard.,it's a hedt only platform now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why not repurpose old hardware for them?,simple tasks don't really need the new ipc gains.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"honestly, at that price point you are either buying some new mini pc or a **second hand laptop**, since the monitor, the case, the psu, the ram, the ssd and even the keyboard and the mouse also add to the cost.",the mobo is the least of your problems.,"i usually stay away from second hand market, but buying celeron/pentium makes no sense

there are firms that resell office laptops used for 1-2 years on really cheap prices and usually far better than these low end cpus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"12600k has base power of 125w (it's the same with 12700k/12900k) and if you actually watched the video, the board fails to do that.",bear in mind that top end skus are much more efficient than the normal parts (which are mostly binned down due to not satisfying the requirements).,so should you care if you have non-k sku with 65w base?,"well, these parts can draw 150-200w in turbo provided that the board is not stopping them and perform much better, but yes 65w is the baseline for the **base clock**, so these are **fine** provided the information is **properly disclosed**.",it doesn't help that there are  boards for the same price with much better performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not avilable in all region.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the voltage is wrong on both programs.,this was using 1.45v set (1.40v under load),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1.24v according to pic on right;

theyâ€™re using an evga dark board which is really good at clocking with low volts.",max temp says 90c so not exotic cooling either.,this is a pretty amazing result..  iâ€™m curious what voltages would be required with this cpu on another board..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[removed],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i know it's pretty crazy!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the voltage is very much incorrect on these lol.,it's actually running 1.45v on the mobo with about 50 mv droop under load.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it would take alot more than 250w of power draw to alter the temperature of my room by any meaningful amount.,room stays at 65 degrees (18c) year round.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

just custom loop water cooling.,you should be several thousand points ahead of this.,11000 is very easy on a 5950x.,even 12000 isn't too difficult.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thank you.,"holy hell that's amazing, congrats op!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the cpu was about 250w under load.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i meant 1.45v.,my 12600k is utter trash,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you have people say this is not possible on those voltages.,and you have people that say this is very impressive well done.,haha.,ps:hwinfo64 for all your needs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

with pbo maybe.,without i can't even reach 10.000 points.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[removed],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sad day.,yeah these are typically reject bins so they usually max our around 5.0-5.1 or maybe 5.2 on depending on cooling.,this is a freak chip no doubt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"silicon lottery my guy, sucks to hear that",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because under stock conditions those are the power limits.,but this isn't stock lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and to think of you didn't do [contact frame](https://youtu.be/zhxzmtwovj4?t=426) mod.,didn't use the best water cooling block in existence.,didn't use [gochiller graphene coolant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m10lv-0sdns).,"and still reach 5.5ghz, i wonder if people on oc forums could get it that high with all the magic they pull.",very insane cpu indeed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
modern chips are ok in that temp range.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm not quite sure what that program/app is that you are running.,"however, running cyberpunk 2077 on ultra will put majority of the load onto the gpu.",having the gpu run up to 70-75 degrees is would be pretty normal.,"if the cpu temperature does go up, i'd personally try to keep it below 90 degrees.",the components will throttle itself if they get too hot.,"i think you're fine to give ultra settings a go, the computer will adjust accordingly if it doesn't like something (drop in fps, fans going crazy, etc.",lol),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"something seems to limit your performance, gpu load should be at 99% and no way it would stay that cool then.","cpu temp is fine, especially for a notebook.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
temps are pretty good especially for a laptop and still good for desktops.,don't worry.,"tho, your ram timings seem awfully bad.",what kit do you have?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
even with cyberpunk in background?,i think the op just alt-tabbed out of the game to look at the temps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that looks like sodimm jdec cl22 3200mhz ram for laptops.,this is pretty normal for low power cpus.,"it could be a samsung, crucial, kingston fury etc kit.",only a handful of 1.2v ram kits have cl20 timings and i only know of one with cl18.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was thinking that those were ddr5 timings.,"i noticed it as well, and then remembered that ddr5 had slower timings.",edit: or maybe not \*shrug\*,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
laptops come with shitty ram 95% of the time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i got an alienware x17 r1, intel i7 gen 11 18000h, rtx 3070, 16 ram",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well dunno how cp behaves in the background.,but in that case you couldn't use the number anyway because temps drop real fast when load drops.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ah okay, but then the tras at 52?",most dimms runn in 30s or high 20s,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not a bad guess.,ddr5 normally has timings in the ~40s and offer a base speed of 4800mhz.,this is ddr4 3200mhz cl22 sodimm ram running at jdec 1.2v instead of xmp 1.35v.,i think ddr5 is at 1.1v anyway until it is overclocked in which case the ram would be running closer to 6000mhz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well the frequency looks like ddr4 and the timings arent as loose as ddr5 (they're usually in high 20s or in the 30s iirc),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"fast, but not as fast as the load.","the numbers are sort of usable within maybe a second or two, i think.",but iâ€™m not really sure...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
jdec tras of 50 or higher is really normal.,you're thinking 1.35v xmp ram which is much more normal for desktops.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

pigs will fly before the thunderbolt 2 add-in card would work.,the only way it could ever work is under linux with a patched kernel and afaik i am the only one who knows how to do that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s one thing iâ€™m noticing about certain tb devices.,seems like itâ€™ll only work with the model of motherboard and and future use on other mobos will be limited as itâ€™s just a special feature.,so iâ€™m interested in getting the asus thunderboltex4 but nervous because if i ever switch to another motherboard even through asus it might not be supported.,just the little things to keep an eye out for.,i am only interested in it for more io and better connection with vr hopefully.,also any future use with actual tb would be nice sense i donâ€™t really know anything about tb other than i think you can do a egpu which is more recommended for laptops i believe.,other than that i think iâ€™d benefit from faster storage and variety of options tb4 provides like output long a display.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thats part of what i was wondering.,if the firmware or software between the board and the card could communicate correctly.,appreciate you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they have different entry and exit flows for power states, afaik.",and the old card will not support native enumeration mode.,"in linux you can hack the kernel to send the wakeup command to the nhi mailbox of the controller in pci/probe.c and use kargs to assign resources, but it will not be pretty, and it will probably crash if the computer goes to sleep while pci tunnels are active.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"depending on the kind of pressure the mount was designed to produce, a proper lga1700 mount could potentially improve things.",lga1700 socket height (distance from surface of motherboard to top of cpu ihs) is lower than lga1200.,"so if the lga1200 mount was designed to provide â€œmoderateâ€ pressure, then it would likely be a bit loose for lga1700.",lga1700 standoffs are usually slightly lower.,"on the other hand if thereâ€™s a lot of spring steel and it really cranks down, then probably no difference.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"before you ""throw money at the problem"", check your mounting contact, aio pump and fan speeds.",check that your thermal compound isn't being slid off when you mount the cooler.,"also, check that you are not overvolting and that your **cpu downclocks on idle and lowers voltage upon downclocking**.",this is what allows for sub-30 c temperatures.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

bro can you please help me out with the undervolt!!,what settings should i tweak in the bios?,i've tried following a couple vids but my options are different.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also try an undervolt of 40-80millivolts.,these new z690s really overvolt the cpus beyond what's necessary.,i usually sit at 85c with a cpu voltage of 1.25 and llc3 with a nh-d15 in cinebench,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no oc.,sometimes these board manufacturers tend to overvolt some parts.,realize that they need to find a default value that works for the majority of the binned parts.,you can fix a lot of overheating problems by tweaking your default baseline voltage in bios.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if using xtu it's the voltage offset you want to change.,"the new cpus have adaptive voltage based on load, the offset will +/- the adaptive voltage.","i run a -0.050v offset on mine which netted a 5deg difference, i've heard people running up to and over -0.100v without losing performance on these chips.",to undervolt you want a negative offset.,if you go too low you will lose stability.,you don't need to use a positive offset unless you're overclocking.,"xtu is great for adjusting in os, a lot easier running back to back benchmarks etc.","the downside is if xtu isn't running, the changes aren't applied.","so you can either use xtu to fine tune then hard set the changes in the bios, or have xtu set to start with windows automatically.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i never actually tried using the global core svid without adjusting the additional turbo mode voltage.,i haven't touched the cache svid voltage.,"i was previously using the ""v/f point offset"" to add in a undervolt.",i think i did a negative offset from point 6 to 10. this is another option you can try.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not surprising when the entire us economy is facing a labor shortage.,krzanich made a lot of bad decisions and this was one of them.,"since pat gelsinger became ceo, he's taken a lot of steps to try and reverse the damage done by krzanich, poaching well known talent from apple and amd, as well as going on a hiring craze adding thousands of new employees, and removing this poorly though out rehire ban.","but intel has already been draining oregon of talent, they have 22,000+ employees there, and are the largest private employer in the state.","and they've been trying to keep them happy with wfh options, increased pay and lax drug policies.",but what happened under krzanich will still leave a sour taste in ex-employees mouths should they try to be recruited again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why not show goodwill by terminating the employees that came up with those decisions in the first place?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i work at another semiconductor company and one of our c level execs recently showed a chart of where we hire from and where people leave to go to.,we hire a lot of intel people because we pay more.,we lose people to apple because we pay less.,i've known a lot of good engineers who got laid off over the years.,it would be crazy to not hire them back if you had a need.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why would they come back now?,most people i know who got laid off were those with decades of experience and solid track record.,"they have found their home in apple, amd, nvidia.","if people want to know why are they suddenly doing better in design, this is why.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was among those laid off in 2015. there is zero chance i will ever return.,so much happier and better paid now.,"while i didn't think it at the time, intel made one of my best career decisions for me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ah the sweet sound of entitled rich people crying as they realize that we're not yet at star trek levels of technology and they actually still need people working for them.,/s,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's a rule instituted out of spite rather than liability in almost all scenarios.,can't imagine not hiring someone that has more experience and training just because they worked there previously.,even non-compete agreements have more ground to stand on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they also laid off people based on how much stock compensation they got, which i am confused of how that could be correlated with any sort of work performance:

> intel changed its criteria for determining who it laid off in 2015 and 2016, considering not just their rating in the companyâ€™s annual performance reviews but also amount of company stock they received in their compensation package.","> stock grants were also linked to performance reviews, but less directly and less consistently.",those with smaller stock grants were more likely to lose their jobs â€“ even if theyâ€™d given up the stock as part of a broader arrangement over their annual review or bonus.,"> as a result, some laid-off employees said they lost their jobs despite receiving solid performance ratings, then found themselves locked out of the company forever.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hr recruiter tried to make me feel guilty about asking for higher pay by saying you are getting a chance at creating world changing tech that improves life yada yada.",i currently work at their competitor who is beating them on raw performance and iâ€™m having people from intel jump ship every month and their hr couldnâ€™t be any more arrogant.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the whole firing spree made no sense to begin with.,"they didn't just trim the fat, top design and management talent were fired or pushed to resign and immediately got positions at competitors.",still don't understand what happened.,did they really let one ceo convince them their top talent could be replaced by cheaper new graduates?,its unbelievable how many of them ended up taking part in developing products that are now industry leading.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its not only out of spite.,former employees tend to know their own and collogue pay scales.,as such they are in a stronger position for salary negotiations vs managers.,"and managers hate this, as they can not play people against each other.","knowing the inner working of a company also gives them more power in regards to rights (ot, vacations, compensations, training days etc).",and another part is some people being scared that a old subordinate gets rehired in a position of power.,a lot of people who get fired is not because they work bad but because managers always pick those they dislike first.,"having people like that come back, is troublesome for those behind the firing in the first place.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the point was, bk wanted to transition things.",there was and still is a lot of people who have been there for 20+ years.,people who have climbed the ladder but then stagnated.,they've created ecosystems around them.,the layoffs fired people based on performance reviews but also offered packages to encourage early retirement so they could reduce all the boomers still working (usually at higher pay ranges.),but layoffs can't target age that's illegal.,the no hire back was to prevent mandates from rebuilding old teams with people they knew.,basically an anti-nepotism and hire fresh blood/get new ideas in.,they've been breaking the hire back rule since the layoffs but they used to be very selective from my understanding.,and i've heard stories of people trying to hire people back for reasons that don't seem to make sense on paper.,"whether or not what i said was achieved or attempted properly,  i can't speak to.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what's bizzarre is that this is the *inverse* of what you would expect.,normally you would consider to lay off the *most* expensive people but here they are laying off the *cheaper* employees.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

seems like a good way to get intel on your resume and leave after a few months for better salaries.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mostly agree with your sentiment that they don't pay well.,but i would also add that there's a lot to be said for making intel a leaner machine.,as in get rid of the less useful or redundant positions and pay the critical positions more money.,"it seems like intel has gotten so big that there's a lot of unnecessary jobs/job functions that might be out of date entirely, and nothing is being done to fix this because the machine (intel) is too large and complicated to fix without some sort of extremely focused effort.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sounds like these companies created the shortage themselves if they are so poorly ran.,why go into software for those salaries when you can make more elsewhere?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> you are getting a chance at creating world changing tech that improves life yada yada

my comeback line (if i wasn't interested in that job offer anymore due to hr being stubborn on the pay) would probably be something along the lines of:

""but would it pay for my bills?""","or

""if i wanted to be paid pennies to have a chance at creating world changing tech that improves life, i would have been applying at startups that might not have enough money to survive the next 6 months without another round of venture capital fund raising.""","there was one company i applied at that tried lowballing me with a pay that was 10% less than my current salary, even though the job had more responsibilities.",i laughed when they were adamant that their pay was still fair.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> did they really let one ceo convince them their top talent could be replaced by cheaper new graduates?,hey that sounds a lot like a previous employer i worked at.,"laid off a large portion of their workforce as soon as covid got started, and then several months later tried to rehire those employees with the original salary when it became clear that economy wasn't going to immediately go into a recession.","when that failed, they tried hiring new people using salary offers that were many years out of date.","some of the people who accepted those low paying offers, probably would not have been able to find work elsewhere.","shortly before i left, there were two new hires that joined my department.","an engineer that proved to be incredibly toxic within the first week, and another one who had their professional engineering license revoked recently.","something something ""you get what you paid for"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

prescott's intended successor tejas was so bad that intel canceled its release  and abandoned netburst in favor of core 2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i would say the p4 willamette was worse than prescott, for these reasons:

- it was slower than the high end p3s in some situations, and even worse when compared to late 1990s and before when launching new cpu generations usually had +20% performance gain, and cpus would also gain significant performance within the same generation as well (e.g.",bumping up launch clock rates from 33 mhz to +100 mhz by the time a new cpu generation is launched).,this was well before the the era of where using a decade old cpu (e.g.,i7 2600k) for light gaming is still doable and ~5 year old cpus still being quite usable for gaming.,in comparison to the 1990's-2000's where you would have a very bad day of trying to use a decade old cpu (e.g.,i486 in 1999) for even basic office work.,"- because it was tied with rambus' rdram, the costs skyrocketed to the point where someone could buy two high end p3 systems for the cost of one p4 willamette system.","i never understood the reasoning to use a faster but much more expensive ram when generally computers were bottlenecked by limited ram capacity, and thus constantly used pagefile on the massively slower hdd.",going from 128mb to 512mb ram on my family's pentium 3 home computer with windows xp was such a massive improvement.,"- newer p4 cpus moved from socket 423 to socket 478, which meant those willamette systems couldn't upgrade to northwood.",the money that was already sunk into the expensive rdram?,into the trash bin if you wanted to upgrade to northwood.,"pentium 4 ""mobile"" would also be a contender.","the ""run it at a higher clock rate to make up for the poor ipc"" does not well work on laptops.","my parents bought a p4 laptop sometime after core 2 already launched because they thought higher mhz was always better, and were enticed by the fire sale pricing.","it was about 1 inch thick, functionally useless for anything else when antivirus is running, and was hot+loud.",the core 2 laptop i used afterward was easily half the weight+thickness and far more responsive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you know, i wonder if weâ€™re reaching a level of engineering in the industry where there are no more fundamentally broken products, just shitty pricing (the i9-11900k) and anti-consumer market segmentation decisions (intelâ€™s horrible b460-b660 chipsets).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel 11900kf is the worst and shouldn't even exist.,it's an 11700kf with higher clocks and insane power draw.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they used a picture of a tualatin chip for that p3 1.13 - ironically, tualatin was really quite good and was crippled by intel so it could sell more p4's.","i never owned anything on that list, but my dad ran an office/email pc on a prescott 509 or something like that.","i'll never know how he dealt with that buzzy, underwhelming stock cooler.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no transmeta crusoe?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 6x86 had an x87 fpu that was much slower than intel's pentium and it had the misfortune of being released when the fpu was starting to matter for games like quake.,the 6x86 also ran hotter then other socket 7 chips too.,"imo, cyrix's most embarrassing cpu release was the mediagx with it's 5x86-based core and a 33mhz bus that severely crippled performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i still have a cyrix 6x86 (not in use tho).,just hanging out in the drawer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the memes of introducing 7 ghz single-core cpus that pull more power than the pentium ds!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my first pc ever had a p4 1.5ghz socket 478 system.,the rest was windows 98 and 128mb sd ram (i didn't even have ddr1).,it ran on a sis chipset motherboard that i don't remember the name (was a 7 years old kid at that time).,by 2002-2005 standard it already couldn't do anything properly.,"i was stuck with it until summer 2009, finally upgrade to lga775 c2d e8400.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well said,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the problem with the prescott release is it was a few months after the athlon 64s came out and it was just a really poor showing especially since it didnâ€™t beat similarly clocked northwoods and it ran hotter.,then smithfield had to compete with the x2s and it was just a terrible architecture and release schedule for intel all around for the 90nm releases.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™d agree at launch williamette was basically a disaster but by the end it was a decent upgrade over p3.,the fastest p3 on 180nm was 1.13 ghz (eventually fixed after the recall) and williamette on 180nm was 2.0 ghz.,williamette also came in s478 versions and gained sdram and ddr support.,power leap also made an adapter to run 478 chips on 423 boards.,is there any scenarios a 2.0 ghz p4 would lose to the 1.13 ghz p3 other than power usage?,in integer code the ipc is about 20% lower but more than offset by an 80% clock gain.,fpu/sse the p4 performed about the same clock per clock as p3.,compare to prescott where it was slower at the same clock and only barely clocked higher than northwood after 12 months of refinements.. (though it added 64-bit support).,p4 mobile is definitely a strong contender for terrible cpu :).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ok  great, what about longevity.",is it true that the msi b660 will extend the lifespan of my components?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> no h610 only 660m.,this is the way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i actually donâ€™t recommend cheaping out on storage or ram at all lol, while i personally stated the motherboard is important for power management and being able to upgrade components in the future, if it is a budget build on 12th gen intel i think using a cheaper mother board(if with ddr4 bc well ddr5 board are neverâ€cheapâ€) for a â€œbudget buildâ€ isnâ€™t a bad idea, just make sure you have a gold psu, and i recommend actually buying peak ddr4 ram of a cheaper brand so try for say(if the mobo can max 3600mhz) a small company with cl16-18 at 3600mhz and try to get 16gb of ram, and for instance with storage i would get m.2nvme with at least 3500mb/s the brand doesnâ€™t matter just go for statistics, also make sure if storage doesnâ€™t come with heatsink get one for it, and make sure to get good case fans and make sure if you go air cool to check the rpm on the fan, if itâ€™s not high enough replace it and add another one for maximum cooling from the heatsink on the cpu.","with your case just ensure it has plenty of space for air to flow through and ensure all your parts will fit, for a budget build you want this to be the last think you buy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i3 12100 is not available in lebanon, i bought the i5 10400 3 weeks ago but it's bottlenecking the 6600xt at 1080p low settings, especially in warzone and battlefield.","the difference between 10400f and 12400f is 40$, but the mobo of 10400 is 90$ if i'm gonna go with msi b660m-a then i'll have to pay 60$ more, while the h610 is 6$ more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i live in lebanon, don't have access to amazon.","these are my only options, i found gigabyte h610 d2h for 110$",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
me using intel cpu + amd gpu: wut?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah buying a 2060 instead of 6600xt is about the stupidest thing i've heard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>  is it true that the msi b660 will extend the lifespan of my components?,"that is not what a motherboard does, keeping your components cool/dust free extends life.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lifespan of components?,no.,h610 only has 2 memory slots.,"you'll need to sell your 16gb if you ever need to upgrade to 32gb, instead of adding another 2 sticks like you could on most b660.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"while thatâ€™s not true entirely, motherboards do monitor power flow, and having a 660 over a 610 means you can upgrade to most 12th gen cpu in the future",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"may be a part of the ""pcie slot q-release"" mechanism that makes it easier to release a gpu.",that board has a push button near the end of the slot - you should be able to easily tell if that elevated piece of actuated by the button by gently pressing it and seeing if the button raises back up.,"[https://www.tweaktown.com/news/82404/asus-z690-rog-boards-feature-pcie-slot-quick-release/index.html](https://www.tweaktown.com/news/82404/asus-z690-rog-boards-feature-pcie-slot-quick-release/index.html)

eta: if it *doesn't* move with the quick release button, it may indeed have separated itself from the slot on accident (stuck to the gpu's pcb when it was removed).","you could try simply pushing it back down, but if it's loose that may point towards a more generally damaged slot.","that portion of the slot itself is just to help ""key"" the card, but if asus put a cosmetic metal cover on it this may have separated.",one of those things you kind of have to see in person to wiggle a little bit and see if it's come loose.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looks like however you removed the gpu it caught on that metal piece and bent the left side up.,"if you look at photos there should, in fact, be a metal piece there just as a strengthener to the notch, and i assume the part thatâ€™s sticking up is supposed to be folded down into the slot like you can see in the right side.","edit: if you canâ€™t do that, then youâ€™re probably safe to break off/remove the tab.",probably better than having it get caught again or mashed in front of pins and prevent the gpu from working.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[fixed it] hey y'all i just wanted to say thanks for your comments.,i was able to reseat it back in to the slot with my riser cable and my 3080 is running fine so thank for the help.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't believe it's part of the q-release but i tried to push it back and it bent a little.,"it's very tight in the slot, i also tried to us needle nose pliers to slide it back but no luck",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ya that want i was thinking.,i used a riser cable i had to push it down evenly and it went down it'll the cable seated in so i'm just gonna finish my build and see what happens.,at worst it doesn't work and at best it's fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™m sure the op is asking if his laptop can make use of a pcie 4.0 ssd, not whether a pcie 4.0 ssd can work at slower speeds.","iâ€™m fairly certain the answer is â€œnoâ€, and i helped someone figure this out for their hp laptop a short while ago.","basically, pcie 4.0 support is only available on a cpu-connected m.2 slot.","chipset-connected slots only support 3.0.

as far as the hpâ€™s specifications show, there is only one m.2 slot.",all of the stock configurations only show pcie 3.0 ssds being used.,"additionally, the laptop supports optane, and optane can notably only be supported on a chipset-attached m.2 slot.","ergo, the one m.2 slot is chipset connected, and thus can only make use of pcie 3.0.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the cpu supports it, yes.",but hp might have cheaped out/crippled everything but the most expensive tier laptops like lenovo did for their entire lineup (only the x1 extreme and x1 carbon 2021 models fully support pcie 4.0),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i installed a samsung 980 pro (with no heatsink) in my 1165g7 handheld gaming pc and it operates at pcie 4.0 speed with no issue.,the 980 pro is one of the best pcie 4.0 drives for portable devices.,it handles heat very well unlike crazy hot drives like the sn850 that require a heatsink to maintain peek performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
afaik all pcie generations are intercompatible.,"pcie 4.0 device will work in a 2.0, and a 2.0 device will work in a 4.0 slot.",the speed will however be the lowest gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the info and yes i was asking if it would be able to use full 4.0 speed.,definitely not going to spend the extra for 3.0 speed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can you clarify what this means from the intel website.,"microprocessor pcie revision - gen 4 
chipset pch/pcie revision - gen 3

when i was inside my laptop i noticed there is 2 m.2 slots.",one is used by the ssd and the other is there but has some antennas or something glued in the space where i could add a second m.2.,i debated moving the antennas things to make the space useable for another m.2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thats very interesting about the sn850.,"i was debating between the samsung 980 pro, crucial p5 plus, and maybe the sabrent rocket 4 plus.",did you notice any performance improvement with the pcie 4 vs the 3. i have people telling me it will be negligible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if there are antennas and youâ€™re not talking about the wifi card, that would most likely be a wan slot (cell data modem).","you can, in fact, install a ssd into there, but it is almost certainly pcie 3.0 x1, meaning you would get at most 800mb/sec (slightly above standard sata speed).","i have done this in a lenovo laptop for some extra space, but itâ€™s not fast.",what the intel specs are saying is the cpu supports pcie 4.0 and the chipset 3.0. however there is no requirement for manufacturers to use it.,like 12th gen cpus all support pcie 5.0 but even some of the best b660 boards only spec out to 4.0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

sorry havenâ€™t had time to pull back off laptop.,i know that sounds ðÿ¤¨.,anyways i did install cpuz and it showed my mainboard bus specs is pcie 3. does this mean itâ€™s currently operating at 3.0 or that itâ€™s can only use pcie 3 ssd?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"definitely the former, not sure if it actually indicates the latter.","however, i am quite certain the laptop was not designed to support pcie 4.0.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>a problem with just making a larger and larger core to get faster single-threaded performance is that doubling the size of the core does not double the performance.,"take a look at an intel cpu die and a surprisingly large fraction, sometimes even majority is other stuff besides cpus stuck on die to take up unused silicon.","we have more silicon than we know what to do with, so not much of a problem if you can find a way to use it to be even a little bit faster.",">if you have many background tasks, the little cores can take care of that without slowing down the big cores.","this would be a good point if cpus had one big core, but there's 6-10 of them, so not really a problem if one is using a couple percent of it's time on low priority tasks.",you'll inevitably have down time with so many cores.,>game physics and enemy ai may not need the fastest single core.,but there may be many things that have to be done at once such that it can use many cores.,"and as compilers get better, tasks that needed a few fast threads are more and more getting divided into more threads to use more cores effectively.",compilers do not rewrite algorithms in game engines to be parallel.,software engineers do.,no one is going to waste time separating out latency insensitive tasks to run on little cores when there are plenty of big cores that can do the same thing but faster.,it's be stupid to do that when you could optimize things that would improve performance instead.,">gaming aside, for containerized applications and vms, many cloud servers may need a lot of cores more than they need the fastest single-core performance.","and when it comes to storage servers, i expect many small cores will drive more iops and throughput than fewer big cores.",i am excited about where this might lead.,intels server products don't use big little because it makes no sense for a server.,if you need lots of little cores you use atom-based xeons.,if you need high performance you use conventional xeons.,big.little is about extending battery life in mobile devices.,it's great for cell phones and laptops.,if you don't have a battery then it's a lot less useful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think you're kind of underestimating how complex multiprocessing usually is.,"intel has a major advantage they're risking with this architecture change, namely i tel has simple, linear, little-fuss multiprocessing compared to amd, which uses clusters that need to be kept in mind when doing mp.",the reason multiprocessing seems so automatic is because of intel old design.,"the new alder lake design does make this more complicated, but probably less than one might expect at first.","for the most part of you're multiprocessing in alder lake, you either use e cores as normal, or don't use them at all.",e cores have issues indeoendt of their lower clock.,1 e core in a bank will actually talk to each p core and other e core banks faster than its adjacent e core neighbor.,"it's a very strange design, it's kind of hyperbolically shaped in a certain way,rather than clustered.","anyways, that's just to say there's a lot more to know about these big and little cores besides clock speed.","personally, i have my doubts but if i'm reading meteor lake rumors and leaks correctly, we may get something like e cores more directly slaves to a specific pair of p cores, or something,get the e cores off the direct cache clock or something, idk.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
\>and this is why i think the big little architecture is a great idea.,"if you have many background tasks, the little cores can take care of that without slowing down the big cores.","and as games get more complicated, there should be more and more tasks that need to be done.",many of which donâ€™t need the fastest single-threaded performance.,game physics and enemy ai may not need the fastest single core.,but there may be many things that have to be done at once such that it can use many cores.,"and as compilers get better, tasks that needed a few fast threads are more and more getting divided into more threads to use more cores effectively.",i mainly game and so far every person i've talked to said their games run better with the e-cores off (frametime/fps wise) architecture wise for gaming this seems to be a step backwards so far.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yess u can,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why do you think itâ€™s overpriced.,itâ€™s pretty much the same price as a normal build..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i personally don't see the point in systems like these.,i lan with a mid tower just fine and i doubt op lan parties very often if at all.,if size is an issue that is an issue with how you lay everything out and not an issue with your machine.,all this does is put your components closer together in a hotter box reducing system lifespan.,this is ignoring the fact that you are limited in expansion card and storage upgrades (unless you use external drives eww...).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i also heard you wanted it to go to a good home at a very cheap price...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can see his old board in the nzxt case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not an itx, but atx i know because i recognize it as i have the exact same one",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in the third pic you can see op still has the full atx board in the full tower.,there are some atx sff cases but this ain't it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no point in commenting any further clearly the rest of the thread is convinced of the same dillusion.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s very apparent youâ€™re clueless about sff builds.,itâ€™s fine if you donâ€™t like them but donâ€™t spout falsehood about something you know nothing about.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's not always about lan parties.,it's entirely possible op likes the aesthetic.,personally i prefer a normal sized case but thats just my preference,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
donâ€™t agree with this.,temps are great especially for an itx.,case is fully mesh.,some of those bigger cases with tempered glass panels can be considered hot boxes.,storage is perfect for me.,can add another 2.5 ssd drive and another m.2 drive if needed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

full atx cases are great.,however itâ€™s true.,a very popular case such as the nzxt h510 has terrible airflow compared to many choices out there.,same can go with sff cases.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s all relative lol h510 temperatures are fine despite other cases having better airflow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
buy some decent b660 not that crap.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in my experience, if it gets too hot because the board is not robust enough (ie.",inadequate vrm cooling) you will become power limited and lose performance.,"nothing will melt, the board will just limit power as a way to reduce heat.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sorry, i would not recommend a h610 for the 12700.",12400 is about the max you can do.,"note that many cheaper b660s are also incapable of properly powering the 12700.

parts have to be paired properly.","if you canâ€™t afford the proper motherboard for the 12700, buy a cheaper cpu more in line with what the h610 is intended for, which is basically lower i5 and below.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, i'd say you made a mistake and should upgrade it.",sticking a fan pointing at the vrm will help a little.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i myself went with a h670 for my 12700, a h610 is typically used for celeron/pentium/i3/low non k i5.",the issue with h610 is it will likely limit your cpu rendering i7 performance into an i3/i5 or it will get fried.,this shows how a h610 limits an i9 https://youtu.be/s1y9lanne3i,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s a *huge* mistake.,this thing will lose about a third of its performance from throttling.,"the only board you should get with an i7-12700, in my opinion, is the msi pro b660m-a ddr4.","itâ€™s around $130-150, but has easily enough vrm to handle this chip, and a pretty decent feature set too.","anything cheaper throttles, and anything more expensive wastes money you could be using on your cpu and gpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if none of the pins are broke off you can use a staple and gently bend them back.,"if there are broken pins and the board was sold as working, try and get a refund.","edit: reason why i say staple is due to its small size, and the fact that itâ€™s bent.","staples are much more thin than tweezers, you can move it under a pin and pull it up, or right next to a pin and nudge it laterally.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how did they got bent?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™ve got experience with fixing these pins using a set of ultra fine tipped tweezers and an amscope 45x trinocular microscope with hdmi camera if youâ€™re interested in having a cheap repair attempted.,i have pictures of my past repairs and can provide heatware feedback.,dm me and we can go from there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

depends on where u live iâ€™ve had this multiple times and iâ€™ve fixed it every time me or usually my friends had it.,but u probably donâ€™t live near me so i canâ€™t really help u in personðÿ˜‚ but iâ€™ll give u some tips to try to make it work.,get a pincet or some tweezers doesnâ€™t really matter.,get ur self some glasses or something that allows u to have a better look.,can be ur dadâ€™s or moms glasses doesnâ€™t really matter.,of course a magnifying glass would be ideal but you probably donâ€™t have that.,now take your tweezer or pincet and and push the pin back.,if u push it back and the bent pin is standing upright a bit itâ€™s fine.,the pads on the cpu it self should just make contact with the pins.,so even if itâ€™s not in perfect place itâ€™s fine.,aslong as itâ€™s somewhat in place and the pins and the pads make contact.,a few tips for bending it back is like i said but ur tool under it and move it up and in the direction you want it to go to.,be gentle with it because u can still break the pins.,ive repaired 4 motherboards with this method and iâ€™ve never had any broken of pins but non the less be careful as it might still happen.,if u have any further questions feel free to contact me :) gl (edit: iâ€™m assuming u have a cpu and ram etc to test if it works after you potentially fixed the problem right?),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it is pretty bad but you can try to repair it.,unfortunately i don't think it's gonna work so you will probably end up having to buy a new motherboard but it's always worth a try especially for a z390,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

how did this happen?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i striped down my 7700k/z170 system for cleaning the other week.,i was also changing the cooler so i decided to remove the cpu entirely to give the thermal paste a proper clean off.,i thought i'd be 'good' and put the socket cover back  while i did so.,i put the cover in the socket and tried to re-fit the retention plate.,"the cover doesn't fit under the plate on socket 1151, i was thinking of socket 1366. i'd just mashed a piece of plastic into the pins and bent some.","https://imgur.com/a/odqwdd1  

i continued cleaning the rest of the components wondering if i was wasting my time and i'd already killed it.","i put it back together and...  

no post.",five beeps.,cpu error.,it was f**ked.,"i'd heard lga described as ""unfixable"" so i looked at the price of new and second hand z170 and z270 boards and it wasn't really worth it.","for the prices i was seeing for a 6-7 year old platform i might as well buy a new board like socket 1700 with ddr 4, even an i3-12300 would probably do as well as my current i7 (which for all i knew just got killed with a power line shorted to data or something)

with nothing to loose i ended up sat at the kitchen table with the bare board, psu, cpu, and cooler (without even the cooler retention mechanism), a sewing needle and a magnifying lens.","i picked a pin and, very gingerly, pushed it back into place with the needle, or at least away from any other it could be touching.",i soon found the magnifier annoying to use and actually had a lot more luck looking through the viewfinder of my phone on max zoom.,"when it looked passible i put the cpu back, sat the cooler on top and fired it up.","i'd hear 5 beeps again, then have another go with the needle.","after four or five rounds of this, i finally got a different beep sequence!",no keyboard!,i reintroduced the board to the case and replaced the graphics card & other stuff.,id cleared the cmos so had to reload a saved profile but it booted to windows without issue.,running prime 95 all seemed stable but then i saw it - 16gb memory.,"i have 32.  

the dimms were in banks 1 & 3 so i tried 2 & 4. still only one stick detected.","damn, dead channel?",tried 3 & 4 - 32gb visible.,"ok, looks like 1 & 2 have gone one channel is better than none.",try them to be sure - 32gb visible?,"back to banks 1 & 3, 32gb *again*.","i don't know what all that was about, bit gift horses and all that, i don't touch them again.",let's just re-enable xmp (3200).,4 beeps and then post with stock ram.,this isn't exactly new with this board it did it from new.,i only got xmp to work by moving the dimms from 2 & 4 to 1 & 3 when i replaced the original 6600k with the 7700k.,"i'm not touching the dimms again, so i'll just set it manually.","no matter what i set, it won't run over 2666, *but it does at least run*

i don't know if the memory issues are due to a misaligned pin(s), or the board is iust bad.",i have a new case coming so i'll tempt fate and take a closer look at the memory slots when the board is out of the case.,"i look forward to the day i can justify an all new system, but for now i'm just glad it works.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

how do i know which ones?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would i be able to?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah lmao,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oky,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they arenâ€™t pins thatâ€™s a lga socket and a mechanical pencil wonâ€™t work here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can now switch* to a phone's rear camera set to video w/light on and x10 digital zoom.,this can be a makeshift optical zoom.,only needs a camera stand to hold the camera over the area.,a selfie stick can work as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and spend money i don't have no thank you i'm building on a budget lmao,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this one hit me hard lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
step 7: bend pin on lga processor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hate on intel but would you rather have bent pins on a mb, or bent pins on a processor?",in my book i spend way more on the processor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel pins aren't round they are tiny leaf springs.,a mechanical pencil will mangle them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not good to work on lga, the pins are actually springs and have a weird shape to them, magnification and ultra fine tweezers are the tools for this job.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's genius,nice idea.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
exactly.. a staple?,really?,terrible idea.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why are you asking if you would be able to sell it on ebay if you bought it on ebay?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you didn't buy it as a ""for parts not working"" listing, or if it did not say on the listing that there are bent pins, then contact ebay and they will sort out a refund for you",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you buy it as defective?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if it came like that, i would be seeking a refund.",that board is done.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sell it on ebay.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
who knows... just install cpu if it works then fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as long as you are up front about the damage, then you absolutely can.",people sell damaged/non-functional hardware on ebay all the time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"make sure you use plenty of light and if you have a cell phone holder stand, you can use that as a make shift light+optical zoom.",just position the phone's camera towards the bent pin area.,open your phone's rear camera in the camera app.,zoom into the affected area and turn on the light.,now you can use your phone to help guide you when bending the pins back.,edit* my phone has a 10x digital zoom.,"and when set to video mode, i can turn on the backlight as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it came from ebay bad.,talk to the seller and get a return going.,"if he wonâ€™t, file a dispute and get your money back.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, but also less performance even if you're running an overclocked 9900k vs a 12100. i'd just take it as a sign that it is time to move on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've repaired more than a few intel sockets with mechanical pencil/ special tweezers from amazon and a magnifying glass.,you can 100 percent do it but it takes a lot of time.,they are pins.,just not the amd type pins,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
time is money.,you're spending time on this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's like everyone here is a dentist or a surgeon.,with my shaky hands - i wouldn't even think of trying that...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so, take a pair of tweezers and a magnifying glasss and bend the pins back into position, one at a time, 1200 times?!?!?!","i don't think is imposible, but it will definitly be nervewrecking.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
works for cpu pins but not socket pins,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nope, mechanical pencil tubular grip only works on straight pins.",lga boards are not straight pins.,this won't work.,something like a small pick with a handle like a pencil will be helpful though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or maybe he bought it just fine and bent it after that.,someone lied here fosho,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
idk didnt think i could,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ive had people tell me its still useable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
okay thank you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"how much could i sell it for, its a z390 aorus pro",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ah iâ€™ve tried it before and the spring pins get wide and change directions they didnâ€™t really fit.,"tweezers for sure, and a pin for finer work.",but no luck with a pencil personally.,works great on amd!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the trick is steadying everything.,"sit down, work at a desk that's the right height to rest your arms on, and keep your elbows on the table and wrists on the board.",mount the motherboard to the table if you need to.,"make small movements and pushes, don't try to fix the pin in one motion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i repaired a socket with 8 bent pins.,just using a pair of tweezers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or a sewing needle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
still would have liked to know how they managed to bend those like that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"but you bought it from there...

did you intentionally buy a damaged motherboard?",view the listing again.,if not then raise a dispute to get a refund.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just raise a dispute my guy.,let the seller deal with it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"get a refund, your chances with that are better than trying to fix it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would not even bother with it.,"that many bent pins, the chances of you even straightening them out let alone not breaking them is small.","and even if you manage that, the system could be highly unstable.",i would get your money back asap.,how much is this board new anyway?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"look them up and go off of that, its a good chance youll see other broke ones going for \_\_\_ amount of dollars and take it from there",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i sold a broken z390 not long ago for $20-30.,decent for something that's not working.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"without checking, likely under $50.","the boards are cheap now and the damage requires specialized socket replacement, not that many people will want it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you bought it from ebay so you know how much you paid for it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
150,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"honestly man, this would be a challenging task even for those of us that have some experience with fixing bent pins.",i would not mess with it if i were you and try to get your money back.,unless they told you up front that it was like that.,or you didnt do it yourself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well it just got here but i don't think they will notice if i try fixing it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is a high liklihood of making it worse by bending more pins or breaking off existing pins.,not understanding why even bother with it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
spent money on it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's not ready to be released.,most likely driver issues.,"so they released them in s. korea and china to beta test, and they can tell their investor they did release those product on time like they promised.","it's a lot like the first 10nm processor release, cannon lake.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no one really knows.,and if they knew they can't state the reasons why for very obvious reasons.,"if they do leak information, they will leak to a youtuber and the youtuber/leak site can generate revenue/rumors.",either way arc will launch.,it is inevitable.,they will launch 3 generations of video cards manufactured on tsmc n6 and beyond.,so contracts are signed.,i think production issues and shipping issues are the reason why for the delays.,could be due to the massive shutdown in china.,and that has huge distributions all over the place.,so when things kick back up again (shipping) they will have a huge backlog of shipping to get through.,and we will start to see ships waiting at us ports again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
driver and hardware issues.,"alchemist will probably be phased out before launch by battlemage, which is releasing in 2023.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it could be decent or a complete shit show and thus costing raj his excellent position at intel.,honestly with a 3rd player in the gpu game or more if the chinese and russian gpu manufacturers get into it means more gpus for everyone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you canâ€™t compare 40 series and arc.,leaks suggest it to be mid 30 series power only,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i really want this not to be true.,we all will benefit if arc is as potent as the marketing says it is.,the gpu space needs the third competitor!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

>either way arc will launch.",it is inevitable.,they will launch 3 generations of video cards manufactured on tsmc n6 and beyond.,so contracts are signed.,">  
>i think production issues and shipping issues are the reason why for the delays.",could be due to the massive shutdown in china.,"and that has huge distributions all 

yeah i just wanted an update on what we do know and the speculation because i haven't followed arc in like 5 months",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't think they were comparing 40 series to arc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and even then, why can't you compare it to the 40 series, considering they're launching within months of each other.","as long as the 4070-esque tier is within striking distance of arc's top end price, there's a comparison to be made.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"defo not in the end user segment, they are not dying, they are dead already... more socket boards are the field of servers...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">are there any plans for a dual socket capable z690 processor 

not possible since the needed upi channels to connect two sockets together are not present.","you have to step up to the xeon for that, which has the extra pins for the upi channels.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no - there's no indication the socket nor cpus for it support multi processing.,unfortunately.,"however for vms/docker containers, raptor lake will have up to 24 cores total (8 big, 16 small) so that'll work nicely for those scenarios.",there may also be a return of 'hedt' (high end desktop) based on these chips - giving a lot more cores and ram slots if you need..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah i am not surprised, will be interested to see what comes out for servers though.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
still do you think a dual xeon workstation is possible?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
does that include the w680 line as well?,also why are they putting so many small cores and fewer big cores.,i have heard complaints about thread ripper being sluggish i assume it's a mix of clock speed and pipelines.,(and possibly infinity fabric.),seems like those performance cores could be kept busier then the efficiency cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a dual xeon workstation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> also why are they putting so many small cores and fewer big cores.,because e-cores take up a lot less physical die space than the p-cores.,"intel could definitely make a chip with 18 p-cores if they wanted to, but it would be almost twice as large as the current 8p + 8e alder lake, slower per core due to needing a mesh interconnect instead of the faster ringbus, and significantly more power-hungry due to the mesh interconnect and large number of p-cores.",you think the 12900ks at 260w is hot?,"try a 10980xe, that chip makes the 12900ks seem tame.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ah i didn't think about internal bussing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, previous generation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the intel 12 gen has efficiency cores... so if you weren't doing anything that required much progressing power... it will just use those efficiency cores and therefore the lower 1300 mhz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"low clocks use much less power which also reduces heat output, so it is good for light use/ when not plugged in.","while windows power plans seems to affect the clock boost logic, it will always go up when you give some work to the cpu.","how high it will go depends on the temperatures, or power caps (which is controlled by the laptop manufacturer).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 1300 is the base frequency as mentioned.,it will boost as needed assuming the thermal performance of the system allows it to run cool enough.,"that laptop is pretty slick, i tried one myself.",great form factor etc.,what was your old laptop?,that would give us a better reference for comparison.,there are definitely more powerful laptops that are bigger or different form factor as well so knowing what youâ€™d like in those areas would also help.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ah so you're saying because there weren't that many tasks running it just set itself to 1.3 but it would automatically go up if you were to run something that uses up a lot of power?,i wouldn't say i was an expert in this area at all haha,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's awesome to hear!,my old laptop is an asus x556u with an intel core i7-6500u.,the cpu is 6th gen released in 2015 so definitely doesn't hold up too well.,"i'm still going back and forth getting the book2 360 because i'm wanting the most powerful laptop for my â£850/$1,050 budget",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's a bit more complicated than that... but yes.,https://www.pcmag.com/news/intels-alder-lake-combines-performance-and-efficiency-cpu-cores-on-one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"cpus, just like car engines, don't always need to run at full frequency, i.e full rpm or redline for an engine.",on normal stuff you just use the engine at max 2000rpm which is fine.,"similar in a cpu, it runs a much lower frequencies cause it is more efficient that way.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah if thatâ€™s the case i think youâ€™d be happy with it.,"i guess the other thing to consider is if you are a power user, a bigger laptop with better cooling maybe good?",it wouldnâ€™t be a slim or sexy but might be more what you need for your use case.,"i like the gb pro, but just something to think about.",good luck!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">mtl might improve in "" branch prediction, micro-operation fusion, instruction dispatch, register remake, and eu execution efficiency "" rather than widening the core.","this is the safest prediction ever since every new x86 arch improves branch prediction, dispatch, fusion, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"golden cove is already extremely wide for it's frequency (50% wider than both willow cove and zen 3), making it wider at this point would increase power consumption significantly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this makes sense -- 

the new process won't be nearly as mature - making it harder to clock up.",finfets are starting to run out of steam.,"i'm curious how much clocks will drop - with amd increasing (rumor) up to \~ 5.4 ghz with zen 4, and raptorlake exceeding 5.5 ghz.",alderlake brought a substantially wider architecture vs. previous;  and improving all of the things that let the architecture 'stay full' makes sense.,meteor lake will probably be an epic laptop chip..    desktop sounds less exciting..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i dunno if i'd call the frequency problems a leak.,intel says they're moving away from cobalt so people assume they may run into resistance problems.,isn't as much of a leak as it is a complete guess.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
get ready for an entire die full of cache memory,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hope for intel it comes very early in 2023 because another minor st gain like raptor lake that will already be slower in st than zen4 will stand no chance against a close to 30% ipc bump from zen5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but can it be backported to 10nm+++ if intel pulls an intel and delays 7nm?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah lol, basically ""hey new gen will be better that current one""

what a shocker!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"comparison with zen 3 is a bit challenging, zen 3 can be considered 4-wide (decode), 6-wide (dispatch), or as much as 14-wide (peak concurrent execution).","it falls behind in total in flight instructions against golden cove as well as, obviously, frequency.","zen 4 undoubtedly has focused on those areas, and presumably added another decode or possibly a different front end design... intel is still well ahead in feeding their execution units.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s not right to say finfets are running out of steam.,the showstopper is usually interconnect where rc do not scale linearly.,interconnect does not scale well because we are limited by materials and at the same time by physics.,"too thin metals have em, large process skews and simply harder to pattern.",finfets on their own have transit frequency as high as 60ghz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i still don't really want to believe that zen 4 on tsmc 5nm will clock to 5.4ghz.. 

the chip will be tiny, just imagine how high the heat density must be with 5.4ghz on that.",seems coolable only by some big chiller or something.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"meteor lake 1h 2023 ~15 percent ipc gain slower clock speeds 
arrow lake probably 1h 2024?",intel usually follows a 1 year - 3 quarters cadence.,rumored to bring 30 percent ipc gain.,zen 5 is rumored to come out end of 2023. sandwiched between meteor lake and arrow lake.,zen 4 and raptor lake are rumored to be extremely close in st. zen 4 winning in st is by no means definite.,***rumors***,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel 7nm pretty much done because intel already able to produce the chiplets and assembled on package.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel 4 is already done.,they have been producing some low volume products since last year and meteor lake compute tile has been taped-in on intel 4. only way a delay happens is if the gpu tile is late.,which is a possibility as the arc team can't be trusted with such problems alchemist is facing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"redgamingtech : ""raptor lake redefines performance and crushes amd hopes and dreams""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"interesting - i thought smaller finfets were starting to have increasing leakage problems, which are generally worse at higher clocks?",also gate all around has been touted as necessary for further scaling soon .. ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
some benchmark showed an 8 core zen 4 chip reaching 5.2ghz.,"so people assumed that if 8 core 7800x is 5.2ghz, 7900x and 7950x wil reach 5.3 and 5.4ghz respectively.","zen 3 can do 5ghz, so 5.3-5.4ghz on single thread seems doable with node improvements and architecture changes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i believe they are sourcing the gpu tile from tsmc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
done doesn't mean yealds are good enough for mass production.,if it is on time it would be the first time in years intel has executed what they've planned.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
leakage is the current transistors see when they are off.,leakage does not prevent higher frequencies.,it affects your power.,"higher leakage means higher power, faster battery drain.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
some benchmark also shows 12th gen core i9's running at over 7ghz.,so please don't believe leaked benchmarks!,zen 4 will probably peak at 5 or low 5s... for about a second.,just like zen 3 peak in the mid 4's for about a second before going 'well we now have the up to results lets dial it back before the silicon melts'.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, they are.",either tsmc n5 or n3.,but the arc team execution has been lacking so far.,i hope everything goes well though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes but if your leakage current is really high at higher clock speeds it can prevent clocking up from increased temperatures and thermal challenges,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not really.,leakage adds to noise more than temperature.,most of the temperature will come from active devices.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

- it launched only a few months before skylake

- it had a massive igp that still wasn't useful for 1080p 60hz gaming

i really think given how much they were pushing it with the 10th and 11th gen that its lack of support on 12th gen is pure practicality.,the situation of only allowing it by disabling e cores was a bad user experience and makes anything more than the 12400 kind of a water of silicon.,i think if they were able to support it without hacks like that on 12th gen they'd be shouting it from the rooftops: is another thing they'd have (and did have) that amd don't (yet).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i've not heard a clear explanation tbh.,"most of the time windows 10 and windows 11 don't perform any differently, but sometimes they do.","clearly it made a difference in linux, but intel's marketing talks about how the hybrid architecture is obfuscated from the os, which doesn't seem like it could possibly be entirely true.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"eh, no, my design likely predates that, though it has gone through various periods of redesign and such since my first foray into high level cpu architecture design while in school in the late 90s / early 2000s.","my initial design, of course, didn't have a concept of cores, but of cpus, and i was looking at a way to have both amd and intel cpus working together on the same board :p

you could probably find me referencing my ideas at various times in the past on old forums if you really cared.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
by merging much of the cores together into what is effectively a single wildly massive core and using a dedicated generic register file in addition to integer and fp register files.,"the brown lines showing partitions are clock domains as well as preferential allocations in the schedulers for a given instruction stream, however the instructions are simply tagged for reorder and any pipeline can execute any instruction from any thread, the reorder and retirement are global and are shown under ""memory operations"" in the third group (the white space in the mo section are the clock domains, using more brown lines was messy).","a good deal of work happens during prefetch and decode - the results of this preparation and fetch are kept in the gprf (general purpose register file) so that when/if the instruction stream is loaded for execution (a branch is taken, a function called, a memory address used, etc.)","the data is in a rapidly accessible location - faster than an l1 by a great deal, naturally.","when i first made this my focus was on feeding one thread through multiple cores at once to extract maximum ilp, however this design could have just one avx-512 unit and every thread enumerated by the core could execute avx-512, the pipeline(s) would be competitively shared.",https://files.looncraz.net/uwidecore.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the isa doesn't impact the design at all.,"btw, amd uses a similar design internally already with their coprocessor fpu layout, instructions and data getting routed based on type.","for something such as avx-512 you would route the instr and data to an adjacent core with support that has specifically designed access to a minor core's caches -  dependent instructions would stay on the big core while non-dependent instructions would concurrently execute on the small core, reordering would happen on an external retirement unit.","and that's just one thread of execution, on two cores at once...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's a hell of a deal.,"i'd like to see similar deals in the range of 13400, though.","maybe a 13400 6pc, 13470 6pc+4ec (but they're both locked and don't clock as high as the 13600 / 13670 / 13600k / 13670k)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
guess il turn them off whenever  i get a high end cpu in the future since intel is probably not going to ditch e-cores or release high end cpus without them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"from here: https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-thread-director-coming-to-linux-5-18

â€œby contrast, intel's thread director communicates actual numeric performance and numeric power efficiency values of each cpu core in a 0 â€“ 255 range to the os.","if either the performance or energy efficiency capability of a cpu core is 0, the hardware dynamically adapts to the current instruction mix and recommends not assigning any tasks on this core for performance, energy efficiency, or thermal reasons.â€

so sounds like itâ€™s true they donâ€™t know about p or e cores.",the challenge is how to communicate to the hardware scheduler while still allowing the os to be abstracted.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> the isa doesn't impact the design at all.,the isa determines what instructions can do and thus how you can execute them.,this absolutely matters.,"the original x86 for example was designed to run on a parallel chip, so all of its state was separate for x86's state.",">for something such as avx-512 you would route the instr and data to an adjacent core with support that has specifically designed access to a minor core's caches

in x86 and its extensions, instructions can access almost the entire state of the original processor, so all of that has to go over too, meaning you're doing a context switch.",game over.,fwiw this was all worked out in the 1960s back when cpus where huge circuit boards with hundreds of discrete parts that were all needed to execute instructions.,"see for example tomasulo's algorithm, where people worked out how to split up programs across hardware devices.","if you think you have an ""easy"" solution to hard design problem, and you don't know much about how computers work, its a good idea to ask yourself if what you're thinking is really dumb.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
raptor lineup was already leaked!,all cpus that has e-cores will have double the amount of them.,"additionally, non-k i5 will get 4 e-cores.",i3 and lower will stay the same.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the design isn't as simple as i explain it here, i am on my phone sitting on the toilet making quick responses between workorders.","i actually call the design a luwc, which is an ultra-wide core, think dozens of execution pipes with numerous duplications.",there's two register files to handle state and most caches are shared.,"context switches are practically free, moving data between threads is a register reference or rename.",it treats various instruction types as special and they are handled in a coprocessor style.,it would be capable of extracting incredible ilp from a single thread with fetch windows several times larger than today's cpus.,i could turn an e-core cluster plus a p-core into such a beast and it would present as six threads with identical instruction support and you could have avx-512 on all 16/24 threads with only 8 avx-512 capable fpus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so this ignores any latency between caches and cores etc.,iâ€™m not a physical layout person but my guess would be this would increase cycle latency.,but again not my area.,i agree philosophically it makes sense but the difference between a drawing an a physical layout that can run at 3.5ghz with minimal stalls is different?,like i can draw a zero stall pipeline if i assume 0 latency in the entire system but thatâ€™s the not reality of the physical world.,sorry using the pipeline example as itâ€™s the easiest for many people to understand.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the ram issue could also be indicative of a cpu problem..

intel xeon phi co-processor cards.,these are the older knights landing cards.,basically a system on a card.,these things featured 60+ x86 pentium class cores with 4 way hyper threading for 240+ hyper threaded cores.,8gb of ram and ran a custom version of linux.,think of it as a bigger raspberry pi compute node.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the problem is that there was never any sort of official support for these things so if you want to use one you will more than likely have to deal with some rudimentary implementation that hasn't been undated in a long while and even then probably end up with performance worse than a modern mid tier gpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

linear algebra was by far my favorite class for higher level math.,"it's such a powerful tool and really eased my understanding of differential equations, i'd recommend it over diffeq in every way possible for anyone struggling with diffeq.",i even went back to problems i struggled with in a diffeq class and easily did them using linear algebra.,granted i had a great teacher.,i got a math minor just by taking it too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

did we take a different class?,"it wasnâ€™t a required course for my major but we used it all the time, so we got taught the relevant bits in other classes as we go.",like parts pertaining to diffeq and matrices.,i took it later as a tech elective and we spent 99% of the time doing lame ass proofs.,they only spent like two weeks glancing over the actually relevant bits.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it wasn't required for my major, but it was all i had to take to add a math minor.","all classes that it could have helped with didn't cover much, or any, of it.",i think only one course did and they recommended taking it.,diff eq didn't cover it at all for me.,"if it had, i definitely would have had a much better time with it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

unless youre getting the 10900k for dirt cheap i'd get the 12700k.,i didn't upgrade to a 12700k only because i game on 1440p and the relative difference between them in gaming is 5%,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
\^ this is the correct answer.,there are just two situations where you should be getting 10900k instead: if you already have the motherboard for it or if you get a really cheap deal for it and motherboard.,performance wise 12700k is definitely better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes.,but it doesnâ€™t have that because itâ€™s called the i9.,it has that because itâ€™s the top end cpu.,compare the i5-12600k with the i7-12700k and you only lose 2 performance cores.,still have the same 4 efficiency.,but then the i5-12600 you suddenly lose the 4 efficiency.,does that make sense?,not to me.,"anyhow, all iâ€™m saying is compare each cpu to its own merits and your needs, and donâ€™t try to match up models or even series from different generations, because they donâ€™t hold true with the 12th gen shakeup.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"same build here, i'd recommend undervolting the cpu to get rid of throttling if that ever happens.",mine takes -90mv before it gets unstable.,"that limits power draw from around 150w to 100w, i never hit thermal throttling under full load anymore.","i don't overclock that is, it's plenty powerful enough.","you have a better cooler though (air cooler here), so maybe you don't need to, but just in case ;)

undervolting the 3080ti didn't really bring anything honestly, maybe lowered a bit fan speed but nothing too noticeable, not worth your time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why does everyone trash the 11th gen intel processors?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"*yikes*, this build is horrible value.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yikes an 11900k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if itâ€™s new why a 11900k, rather poor choice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you already own the 11900k or get a deal on it.,is there any reason you had to choose the older gen processor?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fire!,!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is the 11th gen cpu for laptop good though?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
white fans are always so clean.,jaylen waddle on the cooler is a nice touch too haha,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looks very similar to mine.,i'm running the same i9 but paired with a 3090. although i've made mine slightly slower but managed to make it consume less power and pump out less heat.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
best buy finally had them in stock.,evga 3080ti,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3 individuals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2 cables is fine.,"the cables are rated for 300w each, it's the pcie connectors that are rated to 150w.",no 3080ti (short of ln2 escapades) requires 900w (+75w pcie slot delivery if you want to include that).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can get 12600k for $249 though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how is it good with 250w power usage?,lmao,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ya but you're still silver even with 400 fps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh no, op's cpu of choice is slower than the 12600, 12700, and 12900, what is he going to do?","the 11900k is actually slightly faster than the 5800x, it just guzzles power",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
he must have gotten a killer deal honestly.,"itâ€™s still a very good cpu, and if youâ€™re on a budget after spending most of it on a 3080 ti, better a 11900k than a 12400f or 12500.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11900k is a great cpu.,it will do just fine with the 3080 ti.,"additionally there is nothing ""even"" about 12600k as it is also a great cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so what, it has a 3080 tiâ€¦",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah never understood why someone has to be shitty about another person's build.,"itx on alder lake is a mess, for example, so if i was building a new itx today i'd either go with rocket lake or ryzen",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"guys running an i3/gtx960 are on an extreme budget or lack the funds to upgrade, unlike yourself.",you willfully spent $650 on a dead end socket capped at 8 cores with arguably the worst cpu release of the decade.,"but no, you're totally right, people are shitting on the 11900k just because they're haters.","to hell with the 12600k and its superior performance, upgrade path to raptor lake, power consumption, and ddr5.",you got the performance you wanted!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you.,itâ€™s a great gaming cpu 100% and powerful.,yeah maybe intel went a bit backwards but it still does an amazing job especially overclocked.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i appreciate it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"horrible value and temps, while being worse performing than 10th gen. simple as that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there were sensational youtube videos trashing them.,11900k is a great chip.,it is not good value though often (depending on the price you get it at) so there is that.,most of the people complaining about it have no idea about computers though.,they just tout what they think is fashionable at the moment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"some like it, some donâ€™t.",iâ€™ve heard both stories.,5.1ghz itâ€™s running and works great on this set up for 1440p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they watched some videos on youtube that said it's bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nope,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11900k is a great cpu.,you have been watching too much youtube for your own good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yikes a troll,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"again, 3080 tiâ€¦.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"we get it, your not a fan of the 11900k.",totally fine.,you donâ€™t have to comment 4 different times in a post lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
was on sale $350,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes its good.,the 11th gen laptop chips were done on different process technology than the desktop chips so there is little common between the desktop and laptop variants during the 11th gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on which one and for what purpose.,imo kinda meh because the core/thread count compared to amd is weak unless you spend a lot on the laptop.,"12th gen laptops might be more interesting though, but it's been a slow rollout",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nope.,they 2 cores and 2 threads.,"got a high end la top from my job, itâ€™s 4 cores 8 threads.","when you start a build, the computers just bogs down, very disappointing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

fins up ðÿ¬,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
please show where it states a graphics card's psu cable is rated for 300w.,"a single 8 pin usually plugs in to an 8 pin on the psu, that's the same connector as on the gpu.","for 8 to 8 pin, its fine.","the purpose of 8 + 6 pin on the same cable is because the 8 pin actually splits to 6+2, which was common back in maxwell and kepler era of graphics cards, when a lot of them had 2x 6 pins or a single 8 pin.",6 + 6 or just 8. that was intended for wide range of compatibility.,"it is not a good idea to cheap out on your psu to save potentially 30 bucks by going with for example a psu with only 2x gpu cables vs 3x, as it can and has been proven to be the cause of literal fires in people's 30 series builds.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
letâ€™s do calculations then.,i like asus strix mobo.,"12600k $250 + z690e $450= $700
11900k $350 + z590e $300 = $650

both pretty close to pricing to eachother",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i dont get why people bag on 11th gen so much.,i was going to get an 11400f simply because it was $100 less at the time and everyone screamed at me to get a 12400f.,im happy with it but for someone who used one cpu for almost 10 years these people are insane.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"right, lol.",wait to see what happens when raptor lake comes out and makes the 12900 look slow lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there is nothing ""even"" about?",dude it's a fkin core i5 and you compare it with last gen core i9 yet the i5 still outperforms in both single and multi cores!,can't you see how ridiculous it is?,11900k is a great cpu?,since it can still handle the 3080ti and fulfill every needs of gaming at the moment?,"by that logic i would say i7 8700 is also a great cpu too, since it can do just like that.","but we still buy the latest shits anyway, right?",then why not 12600k?,"even if they wre the same price, the 11900k couldn't compete at all.",oh but it's up to the op's choice anyway.,i just want to point out since it seems like not many people notice that 11st gen of intel is so ridiculous.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 11900k was the worst cpu release of the decade.,it's the intel equivalent of bulldozer.,it was not a good cpu by any stretch of the imagination.,comet lake was better.,zen3 was better.,not existing would be better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what does the 3080ti have to do with the 11900k being a bad choice for a new build?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's called bottleneck,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol i like your response.,i only spent $350 on the 11900k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"value, sure, but the other things are so overblown on this subreddit.",temps are manageable and performance with the exception of some multithreaded workloads is superior on the 11th gen over the 10th.,would i recommend it over other things available now?,no.,"is the 11900k a very fast top of the line cpu, very much so.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lmao the way people talk about it though as if my pc will explode if i install an 11th gen processor for my pc or that my pc will be doa lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i donâ€™t think they were that sensational.,"especially at launch, the 11900k especially was trashed for reduced multicore performance, power draw, and terrible price.",the 11700k and 11600k were a lot better in these respects.,even today if i were going 11th gen i would see no reason to go with the i9 unless it was very cheap.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mine will do 5.1 all cores with 5.5 tvb (3733gear1),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yup,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm aware that it is a powerful chip in and of itself i just don't get why it would be chosen over so many other great choices.,i had an 11700f cpu myself that i upgraded from and i know that they sorta pack but i just didn't know what i was doing when i got my pc and if i did i still would've avoided the 11th gen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you not understand what bottlenecking is?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12700k is on sale for $350 right now :o,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"11300h vs 5600h which one wins, i know this an intel sub but they are at discount both equipped with rtx 3050 i really dont know which to choose.",it will be an upgrade from 7200u anyways.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oic didnt realize the mobo was in the pricing.,yup i agree.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i donâ€™t think you would have really minded the $50 after buying a 3080ti, you just made the wrong choice it happens.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hmmm yeah with that motherboard your pricing with ddr5 would be a lot higher.,why not the 11700k instead or a ddr4 z690?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 11900k & z590e were on sale last week - $280 and $190 respectively.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel's turbo boosting technology did get very confusing for a lot of users.,see anandtech's reporting on 11900k turbo boosting levels.,"[https://images.anandtech.com/doci/16857/1-11900kturbo.png](https://images.anandtech.com/doci/16857/1-11900kturbo.png)

it can be understood what you should see from this chart.",it gets more confusing for users when they decide to overclock because now how can they get the most performance out of their chip while still manually adjusting the voltages to their ideal setting?,do users aim for 5.3ghz all core?,"but that means very high voltages and since they are all core loads, the cpu will be hotter faster.","or 

do they stick to 4.7ghz all core and leave 5.3ghz to 1 or 2 cores in the stock setting.",this way if 1 or 2 cores boost to 5.3ghz the overall cpu temperature will be lower.,and how do you manually adjust for all these voltages if you are into overclocking?,a lot of og overclockers typically disable all intel c-state or power saving states and they set the windows power mode to performance.,this disables all/most cpu power saving features and thus leads to higher power draw than normal.,so that is just one way that users can get a bad impression of a particular product.,just user error and intel's confusing boost technology.,i have written about methods to control the voltage and maintain intel's boosting tech.,but it is easier to demonstrate it than explain by written wall of text.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
blaablaablaa.,where did you hear that crap?,on youtube on some infomercial channel?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11900k is not that bad.,it is aimed at the enthusiast level and comes equipped with avx512.,"so for the right user who needs this level of binned performance and feature set, 11900k is quite nice.","when the price drops, it will be a nice cpu to snatch up!",currently the chip is priced at 390 at bestbuy in the usa.,not bad.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because itâ€™s based on preferenceâ€¦youâ€™re totally missing the point lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol.,"i know an 11900k is intel's nadir, but it doesn't actually limit a 3080ti any more than any other current high performance cpus.","the 11900k was rightly beat on for a number of reasons, but it's not actually a bad performer in isolation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"again, there are two different kinds of bottleneckingâ€¦",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no shit you paid $350 but in total you paid $650 which you even stated yourself that's the whole point he's trying to make... dafty.,"but, none the less, enjoy your build.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
unless you plays at low resolution you wont see any difference between gen 9 to 12... just get the one that fits your budget.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no need to explain, they still wonâ€™t listen lol.","great cpu overall, especially for gaming.",240-360mm aio and itâ€™s ready to rock n roll,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, the hive mind is strong in this issue.",the reality is though that you will have just fine computer using the 11th gen. i guess the amd brainwashing was strong at that point.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i9 has often been a halo product and had pretty marginal uplift from the i7.,on 11th gen this difference was much narrower than it normally was and the i7-i9 difference was closer to k-ks difference than a true tier.,"anyhow, that does not make the 11900k a bad cpu as it is still a great chip.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well apparently you don't if you think this cpu limits a 3080ti....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm running a 9900k with a 3090 and there's no bottlenecking...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you understand that there are two different forms of bottlenecking?,?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and got to buy a new motherboard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what are the prices?,5600h is 6c 12t where as 11300h is 4c8t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they are both about the same in terms of level of performance for gaming.,the 5600h does feature more 2 more cores.,so that may or may not help you for what you do.,"if you do rendering or encode videos, then you would want more cores.","if you game, sometimes more cores can help but games still largely depend on a faster processor rather than more cores.",more cores also mean a hotter chip.,imagine a 128 core chip vs a 4 core chip.,the 4 core chip will be easier to cool.,and so you will have higher thermal headroom on the 4 core chip.,that means that the chip can boost for longer.,"but either way, both chips are very very similar.",just pick the laptop with the best specs for what you want.,sometimes each chip come with different feature configurations or what not.,you have to look closely.,the screen will usually dictate battery life over the processor.,some screens come with a peak brightness of 500 nits and that is just super bright.,while others top out at 375 nits.,"so when battery life tests are conducted, the tester usually just lowers the screen brightness by 50%.",so this will affect the battery life number.,but the 500 nit screen will look better in outdoor conditions than the less bright screen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no i wouldnâ€™t mind.,but iâ€™m happy with either.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
voltages?,as in plural?,there's literally only vcore to adjust on lga1200 for core overclocking.,"all the different options available to adjust vcore might be confusing, but they all adjust vcore...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just curious what are some channels you consider to be informercial?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"computerbase, perhaps you've heard of them?",go shovel your dribble elsewhere lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no that is the point.,why would the 11900k be the preference?,it is objectively worse than current offerings that perform better and are cheaper from both amd and intel.,"of course, op will still have a great time with their computer.","but for a new build, i would definitely not recommend the 11900k and would advise getting the board and processor refunded if possible for a newer platform.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there many meanings to bottlenecking... what is your point,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wtf you talking about spending $650 in totalâ€¦.,specify what parts you mean?,lol and thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">value, sure, but the other things are so overblown on this subreddit.",temps are manageable and performance with the exception of some multithreaded workloads is superior on the 11th gen over the 10th.,would i recommend it over other things available now?,no.,"is the 11900k a very fast top of the line cpu, very much so.","with this type of permance, an l12s should be enough.",it draws more power than a 5950x at half the cores and multi threaded performance.,don't really see the point in defending intel's decision in releasing this cpu - you gotta admit it wasn't a good deal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah itâ€™s not a bad cpu, but it definitely has a bad price.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at 1080p it definitely would... 1440p only a little.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is always bottlenecking... especially on cpu intensive games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"$890, it is cheaper than other brands with the same processor and gpu, its lenovo gaming 3 and the intel one is at $920",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"how about things like matlab and coding, do they rely on higher cores?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
amazing.,so you read the review article from computerbase and you came to that conclusion when the article never stated that :-d go home kiddo.,"looking at the article that you **claimed** to have read:

[https://www.computerbase.de/2021-03/intel-core-i9-11900k-i5-11600k-test/3/](https://www.computerbase.de/2021-03/intel-core-i9-11900k-i5-11600k-test/3/)

11900k is a very competent cpu.",i have heard rational people here saying that it is expensive for what you get and that is a valid argument.,what you are touting on the other hand is just what rabid dog would bark tied to a pole.,"anyhow, i have had enough of this ""discussion"".","blocking you now, feel free to do the same.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just some additional points i would consider:

1.	i would stay on ddr4 even with a 12.gen cpu because of cost
2.	an average or good enough ddr4 board still might be 200 bucks
3.	there are z590 sell offs of 500 msrp boards for under 150 bucks going, where you can get all the features like 10gig lan, thunderbolt, massive vrm and overall well build chonker boards for overclocking
4.	if he got the chip for a good price, say the same or even lower than the 12600k
5.	as for 11. gen, yes itâ€™s nice for pcie4.0 nvme but i would even consider 10. gen as itâ€™s easier to delid and have more fun overclocking.",11. gen is soldered die.,"10. gen also has two additional cores
6.	i canâ€™t hackintosh on 12. gen

the chip is still fast enough to produce high frames and wonâ€™t bottleneck",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or you can chill and appreciate his cool build.,"also, here is some education on bottlenecking: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/go74vi/is_it_better_to_have_a_cpu_or_gpu_bottleneck_and/fre4jkv/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3

youâ€™re welcome.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is my pointâ€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on the price you got it for i guess.,"the tdp of the amd chips would be higher if the chips could handle it, neither company is leaving performance on the table in this competitive environment.","in a laptop or mobile solution i get it, energy efficiency is king, but with enthusiast desktops peak performance is what people are chasing.","i've never seen an argument that intel xeons are terrible and shouldn't be released because they're so power hungry, to the contrary, people understand there's a price to pay for the performance.","the gen over gen performance increase was disappointing but it's not a failure of a chip, it's still a step up, albeit minor, to the previous gen, and also supports the next gen of pcie which intel was lacking with the 10th.","this isn't some fan boy perspective, i don't have the chip, but i wouldn't be disappointed if i did.",similarly i'd be happy if i had the 5950x but the fact of the matter is the 11900k would out perform it for the things that i do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most definitely i understand the question â€œwhy would intel release this cpuâ€.,"iâ€™m just stating for me personally, all i do is gaming, the cpu is great.",it achieved what i envisioned,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that we agree on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i9's are the best binned chips of the gen, they are not meant to be affordable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, but so would anything else at 1080p...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
right... but the idea that an 11900k is going to bottleneck anything enough to be concerned about right now is absurd.,it's not the best bang for your buck - sure.,but it's still in the upper echelon of chips.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
another potential point would be if you really needed avx 512 and didnâ€™t get a 12th gen with it still unlocked.,"even still though, why not just go with the 11700k then?",itâ€™s basically the same chip as the 11900k without the i9 tax.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
youâ€™re still missing the point of the comments.,"we all know that the 11900k is not going to be a bottleneck for the 3080ti and yes, the build looks nice.","the point of the comments was to point out that there are *newer, better performing, and cheaper options* than the 11900k and that nobody should get a 11900k new for a build.","of course the 11900k is still fast and op should enjoy it, but a better course of action exists.",just because something isnâ€™t a bottleneck doesnâ€™t mean it doesnâ€™t matter.,"still, something like a 12600k will perform better in games and production.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then you have no point,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
""" but with enthusiast desktops peak performance is what people are chasing""... 11th gen was not peak performance, nor was it good value.",that's the issue here.,"i love 12th gen though, since its not that efficient but it's excellent value with excellent performance.","i dont understand why saying ""11th gen, in general, was bad"" is so controversial.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, we know.","the whole point of the comments was to point out that the 11900k is terrible value, even compared to every other i9 that has launched.","people are wondering about the build since going with an 11900k new these days doesnâ€™t really make sense since there are newer, better performing parts for a similar or better price.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so youâ€™re assuming that everyone has all the money in the world,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and no, lol youâ€™re the one missing the point, stillâ€¦.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
agree to disagree,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i mean, i have no problem with you thinking that.",i do agree some aspects are bad but the data doesn't point me towards thinking the whole generation is bad and the 11900k isn't a good cpu.,"i agree it's bad value, but so is a lambo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's the case for every generation... can you tell me the difference in value of the last 3 i9 that perform exactly the same in 95% of situations... new generations wont give you any major performance benefits... cpu's dont bottleneck games unless you play low res and quality... in all other case both cpu will be exactly the same.,"i play 1440p 144hz ultra setting, i bought the 11900k because i was looking for 20 pcie gen4 lanes for the future gpus and storage... thats what i value, not a marginal performance boost.",what value does the ecores give to the 12th gen?,ppl are disabling them in gaming for a higher cache ratio lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
youâ€™re still not understanding.,"i literally said newer, better performing, and *cheaper*.",iâ€™m saying that there are better value options.,how is that assuming everyone has all the money in the world?,"even for the 11th gen, why not the 11700k instead?",itâ€™s more or less the same chip.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what point am i missing?,i have already refuted all of your points.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 11900k was a uniquely terrible i9 in that it basically did nothing to differentiate itself from the i7.,"every other generation had some difference between them, whether it was artificial segmentation or a different configuration.","the 9900k had hyper threading, the 10900k had 2 extra cores, the 12900k has 4 extra e cores.",the 11900k is the exact same as the 11700k except for the frequencies.,"same core configuration, same cache amount, etc.","whether or not something like the 12900k is worth it over the 12700k is a different matter, but at least the 12900k is different.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ahhh i see, now i understand, thank you!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol nope,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11700k dont have tvb and can only turbo up to 5. i reach 5.5ghz with tvb and i dont have much cooling.,"11900k are meant for hardcore overclockers, they have no power limit and the imc and clock speed are heavily binned for maximum stability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"10700f will, but in most cases the performance will be equivlent in gaming because they will be bottlenecked by the gpu.","unless you are heavily focused on playing competative games at 1080p (and maybe 1440p) with the goal of absolute max fps, just get the cheaper one.","also want to add unless you are upgrading a system you already own, it's probably better to just get something like a 12400(f) as that will outperform both in gaming and is very likely cheaper, although it may depend on your region.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a 10600k with a 6600xt and a mild 4.7 overclock.,i get 250 fps in valorant on lower 1080p settings .,depends on the kind of games you are playing .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you can't find 12400 get a 12100 and upgrade to a 13400/13600 next year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can you fit a 12400 (no f since you can't find it) + b660 board in your budget?,it's a substantial improvement over those other cpus for gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 10700f is better overall.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for gaming i would go for intel alder lake.,they are pretty good cpu's.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would the 11600k bottleneck too?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i might have not been clear, but the 3060 will be the bottleneck, not the cpu.","in most games it will not matter if you have a 10600k or something several times stronger like a 12900k, the fps will be the same because the system will be held back by the 3060. the only situations where thoses cpus will hold the system back is in games not super gpu heavy like fortnight at low settings and at 1080p, even then you will still get a lot of fps.","but to awnser your question, i think the 11600k is a tiny bit weaker than a 10700f, and it is powehog while gaming so you are best getting the 10700f if they are close in price.","its probably the best lga 1200 cpu for gaming, excluding the i9 but those are not worth getting for gaming.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10th and 11th gen have similar performance.,"10600k and up won't bottleneck a 3060 except in low graphics or highly cpu intensive games, like cs or cities skylines.","ideally you get a 12400 or better though, as it has the same multithreaded performance as a 10700k but much faster single thread (better for gaming).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"right i see, my budget is around â£400 for a motherboard and cpu.","and i can't find a 12400f anywhere on amazonm

i have also watched alot of benchmark videos between the cpus and the 10700f gives better performance the 10600k.",but then again i probably shouldnt trust benchmark videos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

would you say it gives the better performance than the 3 listed cpus?,(i don't know much about intel),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it seems you don't know when to stop.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's perfectly expected and those temps are fine.,"my cpu runs at : 5.1p, 4.2e, 4.4ring, at 1.36 v-core under load.",under cinebench it runs at 93-95c(p-core 5. other p-cores are at 86's) at long loads and throttles under linpack and prime95 (prime95 small ffts bluescreens after 2 minutes and pulling 280-300w).,i literally have the same cooling setup as you btw.,"i would set throttle temperature in bios to 95c (alderlake bluescreens consistently near real tjunction, so you should start throttling before then)..  


\--unless you expect to be at those temps constantly i wouldn't worry about it.",modern cpu's shutoff far before you can do any real damage to them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have an sp72 12700k.,i would recommend you aim for 5.1/3.9.,"in my case, in order to sustain that 4.0, i need like +70mv above what's required for 5.1 on the p cores.","i can sit at a pretty reasonable 230w ish on this config at around 1.39v adaptive setting, 1.35v actual.","also, lapping isn't that great on alder lake.","i've done some amateur experiments removing extra material around the edges of the ihs, to create a convex flat-top shape, like a plateau, and easily got much better results.","when measuring improvements to aio, the best thing to measure is how quickly the coolant temperature increases.","the faster the better, assuming no issues or changes to the radiator.","personally, i won't be delidding until the next gen has already been out for a month or two.",just in case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"huh, what is this about?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
too bad these are my constant temp due to my workload.,"also, i'm not in need of basic teaching, if i lapped an ihs then with 99% probability i'm ""a bit"" more advanced user.",all i see is people running 12900k not on custom loops with much higher wattage than me and with same or even lower temperatures and it puzzles me mad.,what's your power draw under cinebench?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
about those.,"i have 1.6mm rubber o-rings under socket screws, that squash to about 1 mm under pressure.","after lapping i've tried removing these for comparison sake and i ended up with bent and shorted pins, which i discovered after seeing the pc does not boot kekw.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i can't aim for 5.1/3.9, as it overheats due to how terrible heat transfer seems to be.","i do sit now on 5.0/4.0/4.4 and it did pass over 2 hours in r23, it's just 5.1 ghz on p-core requires a big jump in voltage and 5.0 already needs 1.28 v due to the temperature issues.","also, override masterrace.","cpu switches between only between 800-5000 mhz anyway, don't really see a point in setting it to vary.","not that voltage even wants to drop in the first place, but may be z690-a pro's thing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"there was no sweet spot, there was simply ""above that it gives no additional benefit or stops pc from posting"", i've already seen people receiving best results with 0.5 mm and given the tolerances on socket dimensions it's to no surprise.","do i have best ""washer"" height?","i don't know, but i've also got conductonaut spread, so mounting pressure should not be an issue at all anyway and removing o-rings actually broke things.","chip is in an excellent state, pins are also straightened up without any trace of the ""tragedy"".","i only wish to know where's the insane temperatures discrepancy between chips coming from, surface is close to being best-as-can-be and i have a hard time believing the chip is in need of a delid.","hence my post, as i was interested in input of people having alder lake in conjunction with liquid freezer ii as to get a big enough sample data to state if the aio is on its thermal transfer limit or there's something wrong with heat transfer below ihs.","if it's aio, then there's nothing i can do as i'm not gonna build a custom loop that'd end up in a cost of another i7 for a drop of 7 c and if it'd point out towards heat transfer issue - easy case.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
