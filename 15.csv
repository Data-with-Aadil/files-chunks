i think they are targeting the gamers left behind by the cryptomining commercialization.,"and also if their gpus work well in the cryptomining space, i imagine they are targeting that audience as well.","2017 was when bitcoin really took off and ""boomed.""","once the cat was let out of the bag, i think intel knew there was no turning back.",and so in 2017 they hired raja to lead the intel team for discrete graphics.,"i'm sure if they could have developed this sooner and released the tech sooner, they would have done so.",i don't know the timing needed for dgpu development.,maybe they waited until their xess software was competitive enough.,maybe they had a competitive product in 2019 (the year dlss launched) but delayed their own release due to xess being not competitive enough?,all i know is 2022 will be really exciting.,2025 will be even more nuts!,tons of excellent products are being released!,"edit:

in the past couple of months we've been seeing nvidia release a slurry of new features and updates!",tons of new features!,which is awesome.,and i think the timing of those feature releases and the upcoming intel dgpus are not a coincidence.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"besides the worse than worthless 6500xt (and amd's fake msrps), i don't really take issue with what the gpu makers are doing.","like, they can't conjure suppy out of this air - regardless of what they do, cards are going to end up overpriced at retail.",there just aren't enough.,i'd rather the profits go to them than to scalpers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> support from game development companies does not look very good.,source?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> make it one model of videocard sale per credit card...with the warranty tied to the card's registered serial number on a per person basis.,that's going to be hard to enforce.,no retailer is going to agree to something like that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">most probably get as many cards as possible into gamers' hands

i doubt it.",the retailers are going to jack up the price and the miners are going to snag most of it up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel is definitely trying to leverage phi experience + igpu experience and push in to the rather lucrative dgpu market.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is something that the dg2 development guys shared.,not from internet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why?,"if intel wants these cards distributed to the most potential new clients, they'll need to think outside the box on sales.",that is the only way to do this...given the current circumstances.,"it is just as easy for newegg, amazon, b&h or any of the retailers to copy the serial number before dropping the thing into a box for shipping.","if that invoice has that unique serial number attached, it drastically reduces the chance of the same guy ordering ten to scalp or put in his mining rig.",he may be able to buy two if he gets a friend to order it on his behalf but that friend then becomes liable for any warranty returns.,"unless the person is in close contact daily, the perpetrator will be on the hook for warranty or replacement.",it keeps one or two guys from buying up all the stock and somebody else getting none.,these are not normal times.,companies and their partners need to get creative to ensure they're building a long-term strategy.,a long-term strategy is not hedging all their bets on crypto-currency but building a client base...in the case of intel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you're implying that ""the dg2 development guys"" are in contact with you",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
neither intel not the retailers really care about who buys the cards because they get the money at the end of the day.,and intel isn't going to risk harming their relationships with distribution partners by trying to force them to implement changes in their websites.,and do you seriously think intel has the capability to force a massive company like amazon to change their processes just for intel?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i have some friends in that team.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel has stated their goal is to build a footprint in the gpu space.,"the only way to do that for any competitor to nvidia, is by ensuring their cards are (1) good...(2) not overly expensive out of the gate and (3) get spread around to as many users as possible.",good experiences will cause guys to talk amongst themselves.,that leads to more sales through exposure and with little additional advertising required.,doing exactly the opposite is precisely why amd failed to gain a foot-hold.,the sold lots of cards but mostly to a few....so no real exposure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it should be fine .,but if you have the budget you should go for tuf b560m it has it all great power delivery great vrm heat sink and it should make that 11400 go full tilt.,[sorry i couldn't find the atx version] (https://www.amazon.com/asus-tuf-b560m-plus-motherboard-thunderbolt/dp/b08w6psc52/ref=mp_s_a_1_2?crid=3ds2rwuhjn5u4&keywords=b560+tuf&qid=1642607567&sprefix=b560+tu%2caps%2c388&sr=8-2#),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i built a z690 12900kf computer for myself and ran into a lot of stability issues especially with the the xmp profiles.,the z690 platform has gotten better for me through bios updates.,i donâ€™t want my dad to have to go through random bsods like i did.,thatâ€™s why i am sticking with the older platform.,thank you for your input.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"hi i totally agree 100%
i purchased a mugen 5 march 2022 no lga1700 bracket emailed customer service 3 times no reply all mugen cpu coolers have no lga1700 brackets its march 2022
no suppliers in uk have any stock of brackets lga1700
i found several retailers in germany have stock but will not post to uk
i'm going to return cooler for refund
and go with reputable company
i contacted noctua bequiet they offer free postage and brackets
arctic freezer offer free bracket just 5 euro for postage
cooler master  service were terible as well no stock in europe 18euro for postage i only paid 20 euro for complete cooler
the bigger brands are more expensive but you get excellent service
you get what you pay for",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yep, it's a complete joke.","not having stock is one thing, but flat-out ignoring customers who've bought your product just isn't on.",ended up getting a noctua nh-u12s redux and they sent a mounting kit from germany free of charge and with no hassle at all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there was no link and there are no scythe lga 1700 mounting kits on amazon uk, which they know i am from.","so no they ""probly"" didn't.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

very exciting parts in my opinion.,those i7s with the 282 config are awesome chips.,"nice mobile portfolio from intel, proud to have worked on these designs for so many years and see them finally shipping.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i am very interested to see intel u-series benchmarks, especially the i7-1265u u15.everyone is talking about how intel needs to use twice the power to match the performance of apple m1.",what about those of us who care about battery life over performance?,does 1265u come close at all to m1 for lightly/single threaded workflows like javascript dev?,what about in single-threaded esports type gaming?,i actually donâ€™t care about multithreaded performance that much.,"&#x200b;

u series is supposed to have the same battery life as apple m1.","if single thread performance is close enough, it could be a very compelling option for battery-life focused people like me :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
really hope the aliexpress mini pc makes like eglobal or hystou get these chips.,i'd love a i3 1215u fanless mini pc.,my 5005u and 5500u fanless mini pcs don't support 4k h265 for when i finally get a 4k tv.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
where are the benchmarks ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so in the sub 10w fanless segment (macbook air is 4+4) the best alder lake can do yet again after lakefield is 1+4?,"doesnâ€™t bode well with intelâ€™s high frequency low ipc design

edit: 2+8 not 1+4 thank god",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lakefield was 1+4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1+4 would be pretty cool to see in a fanless ultrabook.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
agreed.i donâ€™t really need the best performance but i really need great battery life and efficiency,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m skeptical that theyâ€™ll get to m1 levels of battery life and single threaded performance.,though iâ€™m excited itâ€™s even a possibility.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
product not out yet.,this is the announcement,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you even read the article?,the highest 9w config is 2+8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"bear in mind too that lakefield had less performant, less efficient core and atom cores to boot.",the better microarchitecture in both the efficiency and performance cores should net significantly higher performance and better efficiency than lakefield ever saw.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"very slight difference now - lakefield had no smt on the big core, alder lake does.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what's the point in a product if there are no fans to support it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh right, missed the 1260u chart.","so thatâ€™s much better than lakefield, now i just wonder about how high the 2 golden cove cores are expected to clock at steady pl1",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh for sure i just mean 1+4 isn't really ""exotic"" when it was intel's original hybrid design",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
small form factor good for travelling.,also audiophiles love fanless products for music streaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was agreeing.,it's the beauty of iterative development that i was pointing out.,"last gen's high-end is this gen's low-end, only better!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"switched from 6700k and ddr4-2133 to 12600k and ddr4-3600 and in some games like kingdom come deliverance, rdr2 or thehunter:cotw fps literally doubled.",it also greatly improved 1% lows which is very noticeable in vr.,would recommend!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in the same boat right now.,"i'm leaning toward the 12700 non k a bit but only if i could get a good price, and there isn't much availability or cheap mobos out so it's a bit hard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"12400f/12500 on b660 ddr4, or 12700k on z690 ddr5.",if you are reusing older ram go with the first option.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've gone 6700k and 1070 to 12700k and 3080ti.,"exactly same 3200mhz ram -crucially that and a slight overclock to 1070 gained 12fps and much better 1% lows, so start with ram first.","the 6700k was fine for everything but the occasional vr game, mainly the ones not specifically made for vr.","i added the 3080ti first and no matter what i done with vr resolution, with my racing sims the gpu was practically sleeping as cpu just couldn't feed it

people say you don't get bottlenecks at 4k clearly aren't playing cpu intense games, my headset render is over 5k and nothing but adding a 12th gen sorted it.","that said, every single game i thrown at the 6700k had absolutely no issue really for 1440p and 1080p and with nvidia nis that pc probably had another 3 good years left still for modern stuff, nvidia gsync also makes 1440p fine and all my games were above 60fps even the heavier stuff.","if your after 300+ fps esport or trying to actually make cyberpunk playable, then fair enough, but i honestly can't say i had same limiting factor to my cpu, i've not even sold that pc yet as i'm still ultimately undecided as my normal every day gaming is just seriously overkill on new system, even putting a 80fps limit on god of war so it uses less wattage on gpu.","of course vr racing is spot on now, but it's not like i wasn't playing the same games before on old system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if he plans to keep his cpu for another 6 years he'd be better with the 12600kf or 12700f.,more expensive but will age far better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a lot of that was probably your ram though.,especially the 1% lows.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what gpu did you have?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have the same cpu and was thinking of an upgrade, just wondering what differences have you noticed in day to day use?","start up time, general tasks?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you are right, switched my 16gb 2800 cl12 ram with 32 gb 3200 cl16 on the 6600k.","saw far less dips in fps, but no increase... probably because of more stability during boost overclock.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i suppose booting is more on the speed of the drives.,like an m.2 or an ssd.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
boot up is pretty much the same with win10 on ssd.,"i'd say for browsing, video-streaming the 6700k is more than capable.",but i've decided to finally upgrade for gaming and that's where 12600k really shines.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have two motherboard and one of them is on b-chipset.,can i overclock my cpu and ram on it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you will be able to overclock ram but not cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not 12900k but 12700k.,the game barely stresses the cpu.,"i see 50-60 ish  degrees, and most of the heat comes from the 300w my gpu is expelling around the case.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m running a 12900k and see spikes into the 80s but only for this game.,"iâ€™m also running all p core 5.2 with 2 core boost up to 5.5, e cores are just set to 3.9 and can drop to 3.7 under heavy load.",most other games run 50s-60s for me.,running on an asus maximus hero board with a strix 3080 12gb.,playing god of war at max settings with dlss off.,i thought about removing my overclock to see but the 12900k doesnâ€™t thermal throttle until 100 so i havenâ€™t really worried about it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hi guys!i play with i9 12900k and rtx 3080!my resolution is 3440x1440p,144hz!i play around 120 fps,and have spikes of 100 degrees!is it normal?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"weird iâ€™m seeing 40 percent usage of my p-cores, 20 e. temps fluctuating from 50s all the way up to 80.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i lowered my overclock since this post and undervolted to 5.1p / 4.0e all core 4.2 ring.,significantly better temps overall as to be expected.,worth it in my opinion.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"curious, what do you have your voltages set as for this setup.",may try and fable around getting my 2 preferred cores up a bit more maybe 5.3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is your fps and resolution?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i never saw 100, would spike to mid 70s tops at 1600p on a 3090",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how about on other games?,"for example, on gow, my cpu consumes around 60-70w, on horizon zero dawn 100-110w.",that's why i reckon gow is a bit lighter on the cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i feel like the asus ai overclock is really aggressive with voltage which is probably why it spikes hot.,i might remove it and see if there is even any performance loss.,i canâ€™t imagine there will be a loss and itâ€™ll run cooler.,i should be gpu bound anyway at max settings and 3440x1440,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the ai overclock has the voltage at like 1.4something so i could probably manually turn it down and remain stable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what were your cores when it was hitting 80 and what voltage were you using?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hmm, horizon i donâ€™t break over 60c.",gow is consuming around 100w on average.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ahh yea i have msi edge ddr4.,no ai overclock.,but i heard that asus ai learns over time and becomes less aggressive the longer you have it set.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2 cores at 5.5 prolly gonna require some juice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tbh i wasnâ€™t looking most of the time at the specific cores just package temp.,voltage was spiking high for me but only in this game.,1.388 is what i captured.,since iâ€™ve revisited the overclock/undervolt iâ€™ve had far more stable voltage and temps.,"granted, iâ€™m 100 mhz less on all p cores.",maybe i did something wrong on the last overclock/undervolt.,may try and dabble at 5.2 again this weekend with a push for 2 slightly higher cores.,edit: in game iâ€™m seeing 1.298 consistently on all core with slight spikes to 1.318 currently.,"temps went from mid 60s -70 w/ spikes into 80s too mid 50s consistent, i do still see random spikes to high 60 sometime 70 sometimes this just has to be something with the game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's really odd, and quite the opposite i see in my chip.",maybe the scheduler?,win11 here.,you?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is that with all p core 5.1 now?,i might lower my clocks as i really only went so high for timespy scores lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so i reset my bios back to stock settings and everything is running like butter again.,will try the overclock again soon.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yea all 5.1 p, 4.0 e 4.2 ring",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes.,cpu will throttle up and down depending on the workload.,you never use the full ghz unless there is a heavy workload.,so at idle your ghz can drop to 1.00 or below.,if thats what your asking,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah it is normal for it to spike,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's automatic unless you turn off power saving features and c states.,it doesn't affect performance at all.,once under load it will ramp back up to full power/turbo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is the default behavior.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have once gotten down to 0.18 ghz lol imagine how much jobless the cpu was,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"or, you could also just put windows in ""high performance mode"" in the power settings.",i don't think it throttles in that mode.,iirc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mine is a desktop ....and with this clock speed ...this is so laggy ....any solutions to this?,i didn't even tempt with the power saving features,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is laggy?,you've haven't said anything about any performance issues.,the cpu will automatically adjust its clock speed to save power when idle.,doing nothing at full clock speed uses more power than doing nothing at 0.8ghz.,"once it is put under load, it will clock back up, boosting above baseclock when possible.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
turn off core parking and c-states.,also i doubt the lag is due to this.,it can adjust the clock speed in fractions of a millisecond.,"however, if it's parking cores (turning them off) it can result in tens of milliseconds of lag to restart and load useful work.",usually the virtual cores are the ones parked ( basically it shuts off hyperthreading) .,core parking is controlled by windows and is why it can take so long for them to come back online.,the response time is tied to how often the kernel thread scheduler runs.,the frequency of this can be checked via `ntquerytimerresolution` and set via  `ntsettimerresolution`.,"the default windows timer resolution when in ""high performance mode"" is your monitors refresh rate (so 60hz = 60 times per second = 16.6milliseconds).","in ""power saving mode"" its increased.","bringing a core back online takes 2 timer ticks (~33ms), one to bring it online then another to schedule a thread for the core to process.",and this is only after windows figures it might need to bring another core online.,it decides this based on load statistics which is gathered every time the scheduler runs - so the core will remain off until enough data is gathered to make an informed decision.,with a 16ms timer it may take ~100ms to unpark the core.,"you can manually set timer frequency with the utility app called [""timer tool""](https://i.imgur.com/iiklcyj.jpg).",unfortunately i can't find anywhere to download it anymore.,16ms (60hz) interval is pretty substantial when you have programs running multiple processes that need to communicate with each other.,for instance chrome has dozens of processes.,"if one process sends a message to another and then waits for a result (assume it yields the remainder of its time slice and an unrelated process takes its place), that thread will have to wait for the thread scheduler to schedule that other process so it can respond, then the original thread needs to wait for itself to be scheduled to run again.","this can take several timer ticks and with a 16ms timer resolution, the delay becomes substantial.","for this reason, chrome and other apps (like those based on electron) that run multiple processes call `ntsettimerresolution` to set 1ms (1000 times per second).","when you're actually using your computer, youre likely running an app that utilizes multiple processes (spotify, firefox, chrome, edge, discord, teams, slack, vscode).",in which case windows is probably running 1ms timer resolution and it shouldn't take any longer than 1 frame (~16ms) to unpark a core and have it processing useful work.,"**in summary, the processor is not a very likely culprit for any perceiveable lag.",the lag is something else.,"**

i highly recommend disabling core parking if using a desktop pc.",its known to cause microstutter and hiccups.,also be aware that disabling it may prevent some c-states because active (unparked) cores are not eligible to enter them.,https://www.thewindowsclub.com/enable-disable-core-parking-windows,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"run a game or other application that has heavy cpu usage, it should just jump back up automatically.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whats laggy?,you haven't mentioned any issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
s states (s1 s3 s4 s5) are what the computer calls various sleep or idle cpu states.,you can manually turn them off if you want using group policy changes in windows or using your bios if it has that functionality.,you can also turn off speed step can c states i believe it is and that will lock the cpu at it's base clock rate provided there is no overclocking going on.,if you are then unhappy with how responsive the cpu is at that point you can try adjusting it's multiplier to oc the cpu at all times.,read a 10700 oc guide for more info on that before you do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"by right even if it's idle state this shld stay around the base clock
it can't be in order to achieve around the base clock i need to run heavy application stuff

this shld nt even happen at all",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no it should not stay at base clock when there is no load present.,even high end motherboards and cpus all have power saving c states and other options enabled at default to save power when you're not doing much of anything on your computer.,"what these programs do, is automatically adjust the speed of the processor based on its load.","so, when you aren't needing the full power if the processor it goes into power saving mode.","but, when you open up an application or do anything in windows that requires more power from your cpu it automatically goes back up to base, or even turbo speeds to get the processes done faster.",it should be absolutely fine and is most likely working 100% how it should.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if the hr or the hiring manager said they will give you an offer then they will give you the offer.,if they gave you a salary number then they will offer a salary not less than that amount.,usually the number of days it takes for the offer to be generated depends on the hr and how many offers they have pending.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it can take a week or more for hr to generate an offer letter, and right now is a very busy time for hr as it's right in the middle of the annual performance review process, so i would expect them to be slower than usual.",i wouldn't be concerned about the delay.,if you have questions then you should probably just reach out to the person you interviewed with.,you can pm me if you need help getting an email address.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"> the tech that has been advertised for 7yrs that has yet to ship in volume

fwiw, emib has actually shipped in various different products.",the first i'm aware of was kaby lake g back in 2018.  since then its been used in a lot of the stratix products and will be core to sapphire rapids.,the technology itself has been mature for a while and it basically replaced conventional interposers for intel due to lower cost.,>and also uses expensive silicon bridges resulting in wildly expensive substrates?,"emib is a lower cost interposer technology, that is, one silicon chip stacked on top of another.","chip stacking is not a disadvantage, rather it is the whole point.","and yes, while emib is cheaper, stacking is still expensive and hard to test, which is why you mostly see it used in high end products.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>kaby was a low volume single bridge product and iâ€™d be shocked if intel made any money off of it as they never made anything like it again.,it really seemed to be more of a poc.,regardless of kaby lake g being profitable they're been using it for most (all?),interposer products the last 5 years.,>you cut off half my reasoning for wildly expensive substrates and focused only on the si bridge part.,the expensive substrate is the si bridge.,this is nonsense.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that makes sense why you want the extra cpu.,"some of the newer atom cores are essentially skylake level performance, so if you could actually get one that might work.",but i'm not sure if they're available yet with ecc.,the problem i see with the xeon-w is that it's a workstation platform and has correspondingly high platform power draw.,"i also think the xeons don't have the little cores enabled, but i could be wrong.","the other option would be a ryzen 7 5700g, which is pretty cheap, has ecc and is essentially a mobile part so platform power should be reasonable.",no idea if the radeon hardware video acceleration works for you or not.,"by the way, with ebay flooded with cheap 40gbe gear i just upgraded from 10g.",definitely worth looking into if you're serious about io.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ddr5's using in-chip ecc.,that means the ram module validates its own data stored on its chips.,what's missing here is the data doesnt have ecc while it's in transit between the cpu and the ram.,but yes i recommend waiting for w-1400 to get the higher core counts if you need this end-to-end ecc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

stop spreading fud.,i have a lottery loser and mine doesnâ€™t even do this.,i can unlock power limits and clock it to 5ghz all core with additional voltage and still not break 90.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"&#x200b;

i have had zero issues on windows 11. i ended up going with a 12900k but if you can fine-tune an oc and play with the voltages it's not an issue...boosting up to 5.5ghz on 2 cores and the rest of the pcores are locked 5.2.  cinebench isn't instantly spiking to 100 and my cinebench score is 2072-2100 sc and 27000+ mc, max temp i hit during cinebench is 85c on a few p cores only... not throttling over here, in fact, my e cores don't go above 67c during various stress tests may be one core goes up to 70 max, p cores can get up to 85c (core 0 and 7 for me) the rest fluctuate but my temps are well below 100c.","if i rolled with asus ai oc or not tweaking out everything the bios, temps would be higher but gaming it doesn't break 55c.",my ryzen 5800x with a 280mm aio hits 84-85c in stress testing or anything that's a heavy workload too.,"my proxmox lab is setup on my old 5800x, still a solid chip but alder lake is better based on my experience using both ryzen 5000 and alder lake.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i feel you.maybe and has a competitor in the works at the x800x level on am5.,this is also technically intels ddr5 platform and and has yet to do a mobo chipset refresh.,not disputing performance or placing brackets for making current builds though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it will run completely fine, one 8pin eps connector can supply 336w maximum, which is well below the rated power of 190w of the 12700k.",also any realistic air/liquid oc will keep it below that.,so dont worry about that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i thought the same as you and thought ""oh no, my power supply wont work with this motherboard 100%"".","8 + 4 i think it is but that doesnt matter unless doing extreme overclocking and needing the extra power for silly clock speeds on liquid nitrogen etc...

i've got a 12700k similar setup to you, overclocked and used the chip as expected with just an 8pin cpu power plugged in and its worked flawlessly now for about a month.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah.,it's such a hit or miss with aio's even with top brands like corsair as well.,"always see reviews either they're extremely happy, or it dies within 5 months to 2 years.","i on the other hand is still using a cooler master hyper 212 plus from 2009, on my 10850k (unfortunately until i get my thermalright cooler shipped) and i'm super surprised it's holding it very well with the 10850k.","obviously if i were to stress test the shit out of it, the hyper 212 plus won't hold but it's actually pretty decent.",(76c gaming 36c idle no oc) so idk i might just stick with aircooling for a long time to come.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

from one of the main retailers for pc parts here in romania.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is not correct.,premature aio failure can occur if the pump is the highest point in the loop .,if the pump is at the top of the radiator then your aio has a higher chance of failure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"why get some thing that says "" just as good"" when you can get ""the good one"" from the start.. 12900k is about 1100$ where i am, the 10700k is about 900$, so why not spend the extra few bucks and just get the bigger cpu..  heck i spent 2300 bucks on just the mobo cpu and ram.","if i followed your train of thoughts, i could have saved 100 bucks with just as good gear.. sorry but i dont like t he term "" just as good""  just means ya too lazy to spend the extra few bucks and go the whole hog.. if ya a tight wad, you can always go amd :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most pumps are rated at 70k hours.,that is roughly 8 years.,100% sure you are wrong on how long a aio can last.,mostly because i have had them last 4-5 years replacing them while they still were working for newer models and or builds.,"toss it over to steve at gn, jay or linus they wonâ€™t say any different.",nothing wrong with aio since most folks rebuild every 2-5 years anyway if we are to believe tech industry.,cheers!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

could you run a couple benchmarks like cinebench or prime95 and see what happens?,"also, what is your power plan set to (in control panel), and what is your power mode set to (in settings > system > power)?","iâ€™m running windows 11 with a 12900k on air cooling and it idles 27-31 in a closed case, so the operating system change shouldnâ€™t have made any big difference.","i kind of wonder if the overclock changed some voltage settings and even undoing them did not change them back, and now youâ€™re pumping more voltage into the cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you need to be a little more scientific when applying an overclock.,download hwmonitor and monitor the frequencies and vcore and cpu power usage.,heat is a result of higher power usage which happens when a larger frequency and voltage are applied.,for a .1 ghz increase there should be no more than around 0.01v of an increase in voltage.,dont take my word for the voltage.,but check if something funny is happening like the voltage applied at idle is increased when overclocked (it shouldnt be increasing on idle).,basically take a screenshot of hwmonitor idle no oc.,then on full load no oc.,"then apply the oc, take a screenshot on idle, then another on full load.",compare to no oc screenshots.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, i actually have not thought to check to make sure the screws were still properly tightened.","i did grab the pump housing and see if it would give me any wiggle and did not feel any, but yea if a single one loosened i could see it create a hot spot and i may not notice it.",i will check that when i get home this evening.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so running cinebench i was averaging upper 90s with 2 cores hitting 100 several times, i removed the cooler, cleaned and applied some left over kryonought, reseated and tightened everything cinebench run after that was sitting in the low 90s with a peak of 97 on the same 2 cores.","itâ€™s possible a voltage setting got messed up, but i do not think thatâ€™s the case 1.315 is max i see at idling and 1.410-1.428 was the max i saw running cinebench.",my idle temps are 22-23 right now.,but anytime i open a program/game right as it starts to begin loading up i get spikes near 70 still.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i usually go through a rather long process if/when i decide to put a real oc on a cpu/gpu.,i was just curious to see what difference it would make using the in os software to do it.,alder lake chips are slightly different than what i'm used to with the performance/eff cores and the fact its shifting closer to a soc i feel my past experience with intel cpu is a little dated now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
here's the thing.,"i see those voltages, and i say ""that's way too high"".","but, i don't actually know what alder lake cpus are supposed to be running at, or specifically the 12700kf.","but what i do know, is that my 12900k wants to idle at 0.700v (0.515v reported minimum vcore), and during a 10 minute run of cinebench maxed out at no more than 1.314v (vcore) and 208w at 89c, on air cooling in a closed, poor airflow case (fractal define r5).","so at minimum, it seems like something's up with your idle voltages?",which perhaps explains the heat when doing minor tasks?,[https://imgur.com/a/elstdgo](https://imgur.com/a/elstdgo),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

12600k is good.,if you have the funds then get the 12700k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
get the newly announced i7-12700f.,"$314 msrp, so you save about $100 off the 12700k, but you still get the same performance.",and its only $20-$30 more than the 12600k.,"the 12600k is great, but when you have a top of the line gpu, spend the extra money on the 12700f for the 8 performance cores, more cache, more frequency.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i would go with the 12700k or 12700kf, which ever is cheaper, 80is dollars for two more cores and additional l3 cache, i think is worth it if you are running a 3080. alderlake really does like the additional cache for performance.",and who knows you may upgrade you monitor to  a a 4k high refresh and the extra horsepower will be a really nice to have.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's common for there to be a large delta between core temperatures in laptops.,this is normally due to the nature of laptop heatsinks having low and uneven pressure.,you can try repasting with a thick paste and it may remedy what you're running into.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yup, you need to realize that in reality there's half as many physical cores and hyper threading divides each physical core into two logical cores the os sees.",heavy duty single threaded tasks will be assigned one of the logical cores (even numbered) and the other core (odd numbered) will be left with few tasks or none so that heavy tasks gets as much of the physical core's processing power as possible.,"example 2 core cpu with hyper threading:

physical core 0  - physical core 1  
|xxxxxxxxx|--------|xxxxxxxx|  
core 0----core 1      core 2----core 3

if the os puts heavy tasks on the even cores you see every physical core will have one 1 heavy task and the work load is balanced better.","i shouldve made a picture instead, it kept deleting spaces so i needed to fill them with x's or -'s.",it may not always put the heavy task on even numbered cores but it will choose one of the logical cores and leave the other free.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think you might be right that it is all thermal.,"i logged the core clock speed every 0.01s, and core 1 does reach around 4.7ghz for the first entry after a program starts running on it, but then drops off right away.","core 0 tapers off much more slowly, staying at around 4.6mhz.","i'll think about redoing the thermal paste, but i'm not sure how hard that is on this laptop.",should i also consider undervolting?,"it's not something i'm experienced with, and stability is crucial for me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as i said in the post, i have hyperthreading turned off in the bios.",there are 8 physical cores on this cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i repasted my x1 extreme gen 4 using noctua nt-h2, and it made a huge difference.","now all cores run at roughly the same speed, reaching the expected 4.8ghz turboboost speed for smaller loads.","during some benchmarks, the package temperature dropped from 94c to 66c, with the cores running at higher speeds and the fans running at the same speed.","in other tests, the temperatures were similar, but the cores ran at faster speeds and the fans ran at slower speeds.",all around improvements.,"i also noticed that the underside of the heat sink had a number of purple thermal pads that were not aligned perfectly with the metal on the heat sink, so i very gently lifted them and centered them.",the service manual was helpful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ah bugger.,i hope it's not some bug in ubuntu where it see a cpu that supports hyper threading and makes some assumptions its always on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

â€¢sufficient amount of ports for usb drive,external disk and for connecting external display
â€¢good speaker system

"let me correct my statement regarding adl-p.

comparing to tiger lake h45, yes.","everything is 50% better or even more, including battery life.","comparing to tiger lake u28/h35, no.",battery life didn't improve by much in this segment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
let me clarify what i said.,adl h 45w has 50% lower power consumption in battery life tests compared to tgl h 45w.,adl p 28w has 50% better battery life compared to tgl u 28w.,the performance also goes up by about 50% in both cases.,"heavily multi threaded workloads consume close to tgl, but such workloads are not part of battery life tests.",for such workloads even an apple m1 max gives less than 2 hours of battery life.,adl p and h gives about 50% better performance compared to tgl u and h respectively (also amd 5000u 28w and h 45w).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that kit has everything needed for that mobo and a 2 x 8pin gpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you don't have to use the secondary eps as that is optional for extreme overclocking, but if you want to fill it for aesthetics then of course you can do it for that reason too.",:),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so run the 8pin eps and the 4+4 eps?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 12900k running at full utilization at stock all core boosts will push the limit of what a single 8 pin can provide.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why wouldn't you?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ah, good to know!","on a 5900x myself and haven't looked into the 12900k myself to have learned that one, thank you for the heads up!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
was just curious if that's the right connector to use as i've been told that i need 2x8pin eps and not 8pin eps and 4+4pin eps.,i plan on running full 16pins.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pulls about 230 watts.,easily goes over 300 when overclocked.,"performance monster, but it certainly gulps power to do it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the only reason they include a 4+4 is because some boards don't use a full 8. they all plug in fine no matter you have 8+8 or 8+4 with that kit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
haha yeah that will definitely do it i suppose!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"gotcha, thank you!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why even bother gimping the 12900k when you can just get the 12900?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"h670 chipset is very, very close to z690 without cpu overclocking.",basically same feature set in other respects.,"if you don't plan to overclock your 12900k, you can buy h670 with a clear conscience.","however, i wouldn't buy that particular board.",it has only 8x50a vrm phases with no heatsink.,your 12900k will starve and your mobo will cook.,"rule of thumb: if it doesn't have 2x8 pin power connectors for the cpu, you don't want it for your 12900k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why not get a good board?,you already spend 650$ on a cpu.,being chap for the board doesnt make sense.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no donâ€™t put a 12900k in a board that doesnâ€™t have good vrms and cooling, you would be power throttling that chip down way to far and could damage the board or cpu at the same time.",spend the money on a quality board.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hey man take reddit with a grain of salt.,see if you can find youtube videos or someone posting about their temps for real evidence.,iâ€™m in fact running the 12900kf ( got the kf for future oc but mainly resell value) with a 3090 on a asus h670 pro and my temps are low - like max out 40c.,i went h670 because overclocking the 12900k is pretty much useless (%10 percent gain).,i will get a z board when ddr5 comes down in price and use my extra $100 buck on games for now.,moral of the story if you plan to oc and have ddr5 go z690 (ddr5 supported).,if you want something that works proficiently the h670 is clone to the z960 made for businesses with high end cpuâ€™s who need not to overclock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i completely disagree on your vrm statement.,"a single 8 pin eps can supply 336w max by design, and 8 vrms rated at 50a at maybe 1.2v can supply 480w.","thats easy within the limits of the 12900k, especially on a non oc board.",but i agree that a cheap board with a 600$+ cpu looks kinda weird.,"still, from a technical pov it works absolutely fine with no issues at all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 not true about the power connectors.,an 8 pin on a decent board supplies 400w to the cpu alone which is more than enough for a 12900k.,watch buildzoids video on the aorus pro z690.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for this input i didn't even think about the single 1x8 connector.,"i'm also looking at two z690 boards, so i might go with one of these:

asus rog strix z690-a gaming wifi d4 and asus tuf gaming z690-plus wifi d4",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so i bought the z690 board to this and it has no heatsinks either.,"https://www.asrock.com/mb/intel/z690m-itxax/index.asp i have a 12900k, is that bad?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you don't actually need a board with more than a single 8 pin unless you plan to overclock.,you also don't need all the power stages that are coming on mostly quite overengineered z690 boards for this generation.,"however, approximately all the boards you might actually want to use with a 12900k have multiple power connectors for the cpu.","it's a razor for ""is the manufacturer cutting corners on this board?""",more than anything else.,"i would be absolutely floored if that h670m board could sustain anything remotely close to 480w, incidentally.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
both of these will serve well.,you can consider the h670 tuf model also.,"the tufs have the 1x8,1x4 arrangement for cpu power, which is a bit annoying for some psus since 4-pins aren't always plentiful, but is serviceable for non-oc 12900k.","with the strix board, you get everything you want, but you pay the strix tax.",if you don't mind the price it's a very good board.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
look to the aorus pro z690.,the vrms are awesome and one 8 pin supplies 400w on that board.,itâ€™s being regarded as the best z690 for the price and is even recommended over the more expensive options.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"personally, i wouldn't buy it.",that's a pretty budget board for your high end cpu.,"however, the board will probably work fine for you.","if you are a gamer or your use case is about having a really fast st performance, you have absolutely nothing to worry about.",bursty mt workloads also won't be a problem.,the use case where it may struggle is sustained mt workloads.,"if you are regularly doing a lot of number crunching for scientific workloads, big compilations, rendering, that sort of thing, you may find that the power delivery/cooling is limiting.","z690 itx board selection is kinda awful, unfortunately.","i recently specced out an atx build and thought the atx boards were bad value, but after looking at itx it's a whole new level of bad.",this [aorus ultra](https://www.newegg.com/gigabyte-z690i-aorus-ultra/p/n82e16813145367?description=z690%20itx&cm_re=z690_itx-_-13-145-367-_-product&quicklink=true) looks like the least bad option on newegg today.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"with a single 8pin eps not, only 336w maximum.",in the end everyone can choose on their own.,i just wanted to clarify that there is nothing on that board that would be dangerous or cripple a stock 12900k.,"also ""cutting corners"" generally means a less expensive board.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what about an i5 12400f on a h670?,"no oc possible, but i would unlock the power limit.","the h670 should be fine, as the 12400f is not that powerful compared to the ones mentioned in this thread, right?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah i need ddr4 itx and there's nothing for me really.,i take what i can get.,also i'm only doing 5-10 minute code compilation mt workloads and the single threaded will be used for vr gaming mainly.,the vibe i'm getting is to probably keep the board and then upgrade next year when ddr5 isn't hella expensive so i have more options... if this board gives me trouble.,"funny idea, but, could i not just slap an nvme heatsink on the vrms?","that is, if that's what those blocks next to the cpu are.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">with a single 8pin eps not, only 336w maximum._x000d_

i meant that the vrm + cooling solution on the board looks inadequate to sustain that power level, even if enough power was going in.",you can't just multiply #stages \* max amps \* supply voltage and be confident that's sustainable.,>i just wanted to clarify that there is nothing on that board that would be dangerous or cripple a stock 12900k.,"cripple is a strong word, and certainly there is nothing dangerous about buying that board.",probably it's ok the vast majority of the time.,"that said, i would not be surprised to see that board thermal throttle on stress test workloads on stock power limits.",">also ""cutting corners"" generally means a less expensive board._x000d_

i mean for a constant 100% load is it definitely not adequate, yes.","and yea, rather ""cheap"" out on the cpu instead of the mobo.",it needs to be a healthy combo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the 12th gens are  more power efficient than most people think.,the asus h670 pro has m.2/vrm heat sinks and is a copy of a their z690 (ddr4 variant) board without oc /less features.,12900kf+ 3090 on a h670 is maxing out at 40c on my build.,"reasoning:

kf version for future overclocking + resell value.",ddr5 is leprechaun gold atm.,12900k oc gains are sucky.,so is a z690 board better investment?,not really if you canâ€™t take advantage of ddr5.,money could be used on better cooling ect.,now when ddr5 does come down i will recommend the z board 10/10 times.,the h670 is really made for businesses who do use high grade cpuâ€™s.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™d save the $100 and get the 12900. the k is not worth.,"itâ€™s the halo part you sell to people who want the best thing, price no object.",h670 boards are pretty great value.,"basically same feature set as z690 minus oc, which as you mention is not so hot anyway.",12900k is quite power efficient when tuned or in a less than stress test workload.,it gets a bad rap because the default settings run to thermal limits and people care too much about cinebench.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"note that the avx offset is referenced per each core's maximum multiplier, meaning that if you use a per-core usage overclock (as you should), you will only see avx being throttled during single-threaded workloads.",it's better to enforce a power or current limit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
having a -2 offset for avx512 is quite ok and i would leave it at that.,though i wouldn't worry too much about that voltage if your temps are sub 90's.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

quality of the bracket ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the cooler bracket, its the thing that attaches the cooler to the cpu.",my theory is most brackets cause poor contact between the cpu and the cooler and that causes high temperatures.,there is no way my u12a performs better than some 360 and 420 aios if not for that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there is a lot of room for tuning with the 12600k so would definitely go with that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 12600k is simply just the better chip.,"itâ€™s far cheaper and more power-efficient, a few percent faster in multithreading, and vastly better in single-threaded and gaming workloads.",alder lake makes all previous intel cpus obsolete.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12600k = 5900x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think u should keep that 3700x and wait for 14th gen or ryzen 8000 which will most probably come next year.,and if you still wanna upgrade i would go with 12600k both for productivity and gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the 12600k is the better chip.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why upgrade so quickly?,ryzen 7 3700x zen 2 is still a good product.,is overclocking not an option for this processor?,my 10700k can still stretch its legs when i overclock the cpu.,i am able to get good frames that can sometimes match the ryzen 5000 or intel 11th gen cpus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if upgrading right now no matter what, the 12600k all the way.","if your mobo supports the 5000 series, and you don't mind waiting for the 5800x3d, then wait and see how it compares to the 12th gen both performance and price wise.","if your mobo doesn't support the 5000 series, then either the 12600k right now or, if you can wait that long, wait for the am5 and see how it compares to whatever intel has to offer by then.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i would go with i9 even tho ipc is better in 12th gen but while gaming and multitasking 10 full cores is betterâ€¦i tryed both..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"depends on if your just going to game, if your going to just game and maybe listen to music or have apps like discord open, your fine with i5, but anything more than that i would recommend a i9",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12600k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i9 has 20 thread and better boost clock and i5 has 16 threads including efficiency cores and performance core the winner is i9 but if you looking for longevity choose the i5 12gen for better motherboard and might support upcoming cpus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"12 gen is much better, a 12400 is better that all old gen intel on gaming",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12600k hands down.,10th gen and zen2 have similar ipc and 2 extra cores will do nothing for gaming.,10900k is a sidegrade for gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
obsolete is a bit of hyperbole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no the i9 has more threads and boost clock,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not really.,it already bottleneck current gpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for gaming the single threaded performance is what matters and zen2s single threaded is equivalent to skylake which came out in 2016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">just throwing it out there, the 5800x3d releases in a few months, and supposedly is an incredible gaming chip.","lol, it won't look incredible versus the 12900ks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's going to be extremely low quantity and priced out the ass for sure.,it will probably take the gaming crown from the 12900k for a bit but it's really just a stopgap amd came up with because they felt threatened by intel.,as it should be.,the more scared they are of the competition the better the products we get,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as a 5775c owner i have been saying a big cache is a good idea, however, amds vcache design here is adding a lot of complexity vs an l4 like my 5775c has, to do basically the same thing.",a golden binned 8 core ccx on one side and big ass l4+igpu where the other ccx would be would have been a better value imho.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

can you turn your homer googles off for a day or are they permanently active?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well lisa compared it to the 12900k.,the 12900ks will be 5-10% better max.,so it may be the best gaming cpu?,but unlikely they'll get them into the hands of mainstream gamers due to low supply.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

explain to me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if amd was years ahead there would be no competition.,"do you really think that companies like intel, amd, and nvidia donâ€™t work together?",they have deals to make sure that no one company comes out on top.,a monopoly is less beneficial than â€œcompetitionâ€,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my 5775c could beat the 6700k in some titles too, but at the end of the day, the 6700k was the better cpu in most scenarios.",and i believe we will see the same scenario play out here with zen3d vs alder lake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3700x isn't 5600x.,cyberpunk 2077 3700x and 5950x difference is 80-100%,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, a cpu with 2 less cores beats it, and if we are just talking gaming, the 4c/8t 12100 beats it too.","games can use cores, if they need more capacity, but single threaded is what determines how fast they run.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>hopefully!,it would be nice to see intel back on top for an extended period.,competition means we both win.,":)


arguably for gaming amds only been ahead for one generation.",competition is them trading blows and having no one on top for extended periods.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"5775c owner here (only cpu till now with a big cache beyond a normal l3) the big cache helps in some games that are bottlenecked by memory latency, my 5775c beat the 6/7700k in some games.","but in most things, overall, the 6700k was a better cpu and because of that it outsold the 5775c by a lot.",i don't see any reason to think amd will fare any differently.,"they will take niche gaming wins, put them all on a chart so the average idiot thinks its the ""industry standard"", but overall alder lake will still be the better cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lisa compared it to a stock 12900k paired with ddr5-5200 (probably cl38 timings).,we all know this is not the fastest configuration for the 12900k.,"at stock the 12900k runs at 4.9ghz on all p-cores and as third party reviewers test ""unlocked"" cpus only at stock, i want the 12900ks to get a review as well as its stock configuration will be 5.2ghz on all p-cores.",this will highlight the oc benefit on all adl k cpus.,and i highly doubt there's any oc headroom left in that zen 3d chip given the already lowered clock speeds compared to regular zen 3. amd paired their 5800x3d with ddr4-3600 (very likely cl16 timings).,3 out of the 6 games were tied.,amd will always show themselves in the best light possible for obvious reasons.,"but putting things into perspective, if the 5800x3d fails at beating the 12900ks, this will reveal to everyone that the v-cache implementation failed at matching/beating any overclocked 12700k/12900k chips in most games.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the ryzen 9s were the only truly good purchases from that generation at msrp.,"i sincerely hope amd rethinks that â€œpremium pricingâ€ stunt, because they canâ€™t afford to milk consumers anymore.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s not all about threads and clock you doughnut,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's not true.,"if that were true, they wouldn't have had to create anti trust laws.",why create those laws to curtail monopolies if having a monopoly was less beneficial to a company in an industry?,doesn't make sense.,only in an ideologically minded libertarian fantasy world do companies want competition over monopoly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there only seems to be competition bc of release schedules.,if you look back to when they released the current ryzen architecture vs the intel 10th gen there was zero competition hence why 70% of the market share went to amd during this last bout they had so again not sure what you are talking about.,"take it you've never heard of the sec either which makes sure companies like this, don't create a monopoly.",every 1st world country has an equivalent and all of them are itching to go after anyone of these companies.,nvidia is under the microscope right now bc of it's attempt to aquire arm.,don't believe me go read the tomshardware article on both technologies!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"let me clarify: a 3700x is just 15% off of the 5600x, so itâ€™s realistically almost no different.","also, yes, if youâ€™re running more cpu intensive games, then the difference becomes more apparent.","however, a lot of 3a games out there still rely mostly on the gpu.","fh5, for example, uses 100% of my 3070 ti but only 50% of my 5600x, so itâ€™s not worth it to upgrade my cpu unless i get a better gpu, one that has to bring my r5 to 100% (i donâ€™t think the 3090 can even do that).","in short, most games donâ€™t really need all the extra cpu horsepower from a 5950x or even 5900x.","iâ€™d say 5800x is the limit right now as you donâ€™t really need anything better for games to run as smooth as possible, and a 3700x isnâ€™t too far off the mark either.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for sure.,"thatâ€™s, yep.",like i said it would be nice to see intel back on top for an extended period.,"amd has some issues that they need to figure out still, main one being the usb disconnect issue still present after their â€œbios update fixâ€ back in 03/2021.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">5775c 

yeah that was a really interesting chip.",though amd has implemented their cache with almost no latency penalty so their technology will definitely be more advanced than what the 5775c had.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"true, i forgot that chart that showed 3 games tied.",thats going to be hilarious.,"""remember those games you tied in?",yeah not a tie anymore.,"intel is faster in more games than you.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
even the ryzen 9 5900x was more at launch than the 3900x.,the price creep is very real.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 9 class is a terrible purchase from both companies.,"you are paying for e-peen swinging and then losing it all in depreciation as next years 200 dollar 5 class spanks it in gaming, desktop responsiveness, the latest io, etc etc.",if you aren't making a profit on those extra cores they are a waste of silicon.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

itâ€™s simple.,"as a business, you want your consumers to buy your products.",as a consumer you want new and improved products to buy.,"within a monopoly a business has no need to improve; customers stop buying, progress halts, business fails.",there is no debate to be had here.,competition has and always will drive progress and progress drives society and itâ€™s economy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they make sure monopolies donâ€™t exist to prevent economic disaster.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

bro you are really that stupid?,"12th gen intel is based on a completely new architecture as well as a new process node, the performance you get out of these things is literally insane.",if you donâ€™t believe me watch some youtube,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why would customers stop buying in a monopoly situation if there are no other sources for the product?,doesn't make sense.,i'm not able to choose any other isp in my area.,i am way less likely to cancel my internet than someone who has options.,this is generally true for most services that are in widespread use.. they don't improve because there is no threat of losing the customer to a competitor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"he doesnt know what ipc are, thats why.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we arenâ€™t talking about needs here.,we are talking about tech companies.,and as for the last sentence we are saying the same thing.,"if there is no competition, there is no improvement which = less money for the business.",plus i guarantee you wish you had a better isp and better internet.,you know what would solve that?,if there were competing isps.,everyone wins.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no shit, the debate is whether or not companies want competition.",of course the consumer does.,"if only intel made cpus, would you stop using computers altogether because they haven't improved at the rate you'd want?","no, i highly doubt it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"try newegg, and maybe microcenter if that exists there, amazon typically isn't the best for big ticket items.","how amazon gets shit so cheap is by flooding their market so prices on stuff drop, then they come in, rip off the best selling design, and shove it on the market at 10-50 bucks cheaper.","cant really do that with pc parts, so at best your paying a few bucks off full price, at worst, your going to over pay.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"u/skull_reaper101 u/sergeitachenov thanks for helping out, however i only want to upgrade the cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would *highly* suggest looking into the cost of a 12400f-12600kf+cheap b660 board.,"because both of those will be a much bigger improvement than a 9900k, which doesn't even sell for cheap used.",and you get a new platform with new features and an upgrade path.,also remember you'll be able to sell your current cpu and motherboard which would offset like $150+ of upgrading to 12th gen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if possible, get a good b550 board with a 5800x.. it's gonna be much better",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a 12400f beats the 9900k.,iâ€™m with you.,go 12th gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in that case the 9900k would be a good option.,but.,do you have a z series mobo to take advantage of it?,you might be able to get a 9900f for cheaper if you don't have a z series.,get the f sku (i.e.,9900kf or 9900f) if u have a dgpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i mean yeah... that too...... i missed that lol.,"if i were to upgrade, i would rather just save up more and get the 13th gen",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then getting a k sku wouldn't be beneficial unless u want the higher clock speeds.,"if u have a dedicatid gpu, get the 9900kf or 9900f whichever u desire",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"also, the vrms arent cooled on that board from what i see in pics online.",so just keep a check on that.,it shouldn't be exceeding 95c.. if it does it's a good idea to just get a whole new motherboard and platform,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

a worker failing at stock is a problem.,sure you didn't have xmp on?,do a memtest on that?,also the temp should not exceed 100-101c.,thermal throttling is at 100c.,"if it spikes so quickly that you see 105+, that is also a problem.","the motherboard might not be running the cpu at stock, could be feeding it excessive voltage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
some board do that out of the box.. very annoying if you want it quiet and cool.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh yeah, i forgot i have my corsair dominator 5600 on a healthy 6200mhz oc.",the p95 failure very well could have been due to that.,but the high cpu package temps are what worried me more.,"i'll double check that voltage really was stock, it's an asus z690 strix so i may have taken for granted that ""auto"" was stock.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

870 is pretty much first generation i7.,8700 is something wayyy newer.,"forget 870 exists, it won't work either in your board.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what tells you quickly if a motherboard and cpu are compatible is 'socket type'.,"in a nutshell different generations use a different number of pins which is reflected in the socket type, for example 11th gen is 'intel 1200' while 12th gen is 'intel 1700'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"your cpu doesn't have integrated graphics and as a result, the graphics ports on your motherboard won't work.",you need a cpu with integrated graphics in order for your motherboard's graphics ports to function.,"since you have a dedicated gpu, you should connect your monitor to it and not the motherboard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
f means there is no integrated graphics.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"damn u don't know how a pc works, for sure",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ur cpu isnâ€™t working because it finishes with f, in intel it means you need a dedicated gpu, cause the signal youâ€™re getting is just for image, but youâ€™ll need a graphics card if you want to do more things like gaming or another type of works.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh.,"i didn't know, thanks!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you've won the silicon lottery.,congratulations.,"if you don't mind, can you go into bios and share what's your sp rating?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
300w at 80c is big cap unless your ambient is actually significantly below 22c.,post a screenshot of r23 running with hwinfo showing the package power/vcore and temps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm having a similar experience in an nr200 of all cases!,"using an arctic lf ii 280 + z690-i, though i did need the 1700 standoffs that came in the bundle on amazon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mine idles at 25-35c depending on my room temp of course.,doesnt crack 60c but may spike past it here and there momentarily.,"lian li galahad 360, gaming/streaming.",itâ€™s a cool chip.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i actually have similar results with my cpu.,"the base vid for my 12900k at 5.2ghz is 1.160v with undervolt, but at load temps in r23 (mid 70s ) it is ~1.275v.",sp88 overall with sp98 on the p-cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">overclock to 5.2ghz at 1.28v 80c

i thought going over 5ghz would require at least 5ghz voltage, how are you using lower voltages?",1.35v is the 5ghz voltage for me on z690 tuf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
im having thr same experience with a u12a.,below 70 at stock on every stress test including aida cpu and fpu.,"overclocked to 5.2 and 5.3 ghz it inevitably hits 90, but thats still decent considering its a stress test",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what's your cpu power consumption in prime 95?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wow, impressive temps",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think flight sim doesn't use more than 4 cores unless they patched it.,temps in that won't be high.,"new cpus are soldered, while the 8700k used a kind of paste.","at stock, your new cpu probably pulls around double the power that your old one did, though.",at least in some workloads.,probably not in gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
here's a serious answer.,your bedroom benchmark means absolutely nothing.,"until it is verified by industry experts, tested, reproduced continuously and recorded, it means nothing.","if the 12900k is unleashed, it will draw 280w+ and it will usually hover in the mid 80s or higher temperature wise, even with a 360mm radiator.",just like every single reputable test as demonstrated.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the exception of the exception if this is true.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sp88 overall.,i will try to get a bunch of screenshots of everything.,i really did not expect this to be as unique as it seems to be.,prior to getting the setup i had done zero research and just assumed this is what new intel was all about since i hadnâ€™t touched a new build or even stuck my nose in general industry news until after i did the build and was scratching my head as to what might be wrong given the unusually low temps but high performance.,i thought surely iâ€™d be battling temps way more.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have the same cooler, top mounted.","i idle some 26 to 28, and haven't seen it crack 60 degrees yet in a game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well... it depends on your llc.,not to mention silicon lottery.,"in my experience, (forgive me.",i know it is not right to compare these) my 7700k gets to 4.9ghz @ 1.248v,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your board reports socket sense voltage for the core i assume.,"higher end board reports die sense core voltage, which is usually about 100mv less than socket sense.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i hit around 300ish watts in prime 95,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't need an industry expert to tell your opinion is moot and op here is rocking an exquisite slice of silicon.,or shall i say op slice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well would it change anything if i told you the computer wasnâ€™t in a bedroom?,perhaps an office benchmark does mean something.,"joking aside from what you say, this is a very cool (temp) chip.",pounded on by industry experts over and over again and only hitting 80c?,thatâ€™s incredible for intel as far as iâ€™m aware?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
unless you wanna directly contradict op that's one effective mount and good for a case study.,300w at 80c tdie with 21c ambient on 240mm.,"might want more precise/further validation, but if we don't bother to study why one user gets a great result and the majority users don't, we wouldn't be advancing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can u also use hwinfo64 for checking power draw and temps instead?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same.,seems like this aio (mine is top mounted as well) is just a good one for this chip?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that makes sense.,i have core vids that can go up to 1.37v and then the vcore sensor that is a bit lower 1.33v( cpu core voltage measures by external sensor),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm super impressed.,count yourself lucky.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seems like it.,the fan configuration and case makes a difference too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
core vids are different.,that's the requested voltage.,vcore is the voltage delivered.,"vcore can be measured at the socket or the die, when measured at the socket it's higher than what it is when measured at the die, and some motherboards only measure it at the socket.","so when people are posting their vcore and oc stats, you never know if they are telling you their die sense or socket sense voltage unless they specify.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
o11 dynamic xl.,"3 120s on the bottom, 3 120s on top, and 3 on the side.","the top fans are on the radiator, all exhaust.",air comes in through the back of the case without the need  for a fan.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes build on the carpet it'll be fine unless you get a carpet fiber under the cpu pins.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you need to slow down and keep it simple when you test.,"1) test memory/cpu /video and temps are fine and its stable, then you don't need to rma those things.",2) you have 2 video cards listed.,are you running them both ?,and are you forcing the second card to run the opened instance of your discord/youtube/ to that video card.,because i can promise you as someone who had two cards.,"similar to this, the default behavior of windows is to use the primary gpu to still render/handle acceleration then it passes to your second video card.","this does in fact add studder, and for me i had to run in reverse, i had windows render on the second card, and then force games to run locked to my better video card.","(in end i just pulled the second card as its not worth the hassle to me)

another issue for stutter/input lag can indicate hardware failure.,so rma was the correct steps.,but you should check your 4 - 4tb hardware raid array first.,"as those are **mechanical spinning** disks, they can sometimes fail prematurely or fail due to age.","even if those things are just for storage and the os is not located on them nor the windows system page file, they can still cause problems.",a problem that a spinning mechanical hard disk can cause is actually stuttering.,i've been pc gaming for over 20 years and i had a few disks start to fail on me.,"a couple of old western digital raptor 10,000 rpm drives failed and one 7,200 rpm hdd was in the process of failing once.","that 7,200 rpm hdd was making a noticeable tick sound.","and i noticed that every time the hdd ticked, i would get an in game stutter and/or speaker audio stutter.",but the drive still worked.,i was still able to access data from that hdd.,so that can be something to look into.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"because theyâ€™re both 65 watt parts, and the 12700f has 8 performance cores and 4 efficiency cores, while the 12400f has just 6 performance cores and zero efficiency cores.","so with fewer cores, they can be run higher while maintaining that same 65 watt rating.",base speed is a generally meaningless number.,itâ€™s not useful except to say that a 65w cpu should be able to run itâ€™s cores at that base frequency while consuming about 65 watts.,"but if the turbo limits allow, it will go higher.","the 12700f has a 4.9ghz max boost and 180 watt turbo power rating, while the 12400f has a 4.4ghz max boost and 117 watts turbo rating.",those are the more useful numbers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you are going to use any decent air/water cooler you can basically ignore this rating and go straight to unlocking the 65w tdp 'wall'.,then you can boost the cpu to the turbo speeds all day,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i plan to run a 280mm aio.,i'm confused about the difference between turbo and overclocking.,gotta do some more research i guess.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i suppose the tdp is where intel gives oems a reference for the power needed to be 'good enough' for typical computing like office tasks, so they can lower the cost of production (i.e.",why put a huge cooler just for microsoft office).,but when you build your own i guess you would want to be able to push this cpu at 100% without throttling.,which is when you need to search for how much power it actually uses for the workloads you do/ the maximum power draw,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

do you have any rgb ram installed and using any asus aura addons ?,"cuz if you got asus aura or armoury installed with any kind of rgb ram and they are synched with other rgb stuff, then the cpu will keep running at max + turbo boost.","&#x200b;

try unsynch ur ram and see for ur self.",just enable the multicore again cuz thats not the case here :d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can you prove it by leaving hwmonitor open for 5 minutes then taking a screenshot?,the clocks never register 800 mhz?,check to see that your power settings in windows is set to balanced and not max performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
turbo boost is intel's own thing to have cores go beyond the clock set by bios.,"its normal, id leave it on.","but to disable, turn off ""turbo mode"" (under cpu power management) or something similar depending on your bios.","i don't feel like checking, but multi-core enhancement is definitely not the setting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i still bet he has rgb ram and they are synched in aura tool :d cuz thats why,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just looked at the power plan and the cpu min was at 100%.,i've set it down to 50% and i've got an 800mhz min on one of the cores and the real time updates are now fluctuating.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh shit that's a thing?,xd yeah i have corsair rgb pro.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah you should set the min to 0%, cpus do a good job cycling their own frequency in reponse to load to attain the best performance while saving power when possible.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if youâ€™re on the high performance power plan thereâ€™s no real reason to use it; balanced will allow down clocking to 400/500mhz (on a 12900k) which sips as little as 8-10 watts when idle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's 5% by default in the balanced plan for cpu min,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and what rgb tool do you use ?armoury or aura ?,"find the option in either app and disable the ""sync with ram"" or choose a static color.",or else ur stuck with auto rainbow mode.,then try watch cpu z again and see with the ram in synch then ur cpu will likely run fullspeed with boost and if you disable the synch or choose a static colour then it will idle on 800 ish mhz and sometimes jump a bit higher but ur temps will go down.,the reason why this happens is cuz the synch with ram takes 5-10 % cpu use and peaks on ur cpu so it thinks it must activate boost mode or high load mode.,this has been a problem for ages and havent been fixed and i dont think it can be fixed.,some people dont care or dont know since they dont monitor ther cpu and use a good cooler that can handle these temps and speeds still.,also some people prefer to have ther cpu run full speed allways for default so its not a problem for them either.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ahh ok, i'm using icue and it didn't have the ram sync when i checked.",i'll try putting it to a solid colour and monitoring.,"i'm not too worried about it, it was more that i just wanted to check it was fine and what the reason was.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then try install armoury or aura if you got asus mofo and test what i said :) maybe ur ram is setup as synched allready by default.,but it can be disabled in asus tools apps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's completely true.,right now intel beats amd at both single core performance and price per performance for desktop cpus.,even if amd manage to come out with a better product soon they are very limited by the high price of tsmc and they are also clearly not capable of getting tsmc to produce enough chips for them.,their chip production bottleneck is clear when you look at the state of the gpu shortage and the fact that they have not lowered their cpu prices.,they don't have to lower their cpu prices because they are selling all the ones they produce and they simply can't produce more.,"amd is ""in the rear-view mirror"" not because their technology is worst (it isn't) but because they can't compete with intel in availability and pricing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's amazing that every single intel ceo starts spouting such nonsense couple of months they take over.,"as far as i'm aware epyc exists and is perpetually dropkicking xeons to the ground for about 3 years now, and it will get worse with zen 4 epyc products.",amd accelerators also became quite interesting in the last half year.,"alder lake beat a one year old amd design by a couple percentage points on average, which is great, but far from ""a slam dunk, let's pack it up and go home.",""", in mobile intel will likely have great products in the 45w+ class, but in u class i think amd 6000 series will be pretty equally matched.","it would be nice if one intel ceo could break the hubris nonsense one liners and pr stunts, and just be quiet with regards to those things for the remainder of their tenure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so intel releases their next gen and finally gets a leg up on amd previous gen and thinks they have it made in the shade... they are in for a rude awakening.,zen 4 is going to demolish them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

some interesting comments in this thread.,"worth remembering that amd are much more at the mercy of supply constraints being fabless than intel, who at least have more control.",they *are* slowing down and zen 4 *is* behind but i'd put this down to the supply environment rather than troubles executing.,i think the thing that is going to crystalise over the next few years is this: amd doesn't have a problem with intel's efficiency cores - zen 3 cores are efficient enough and zen 4 will be more so when they stop cheaping out on the iod.,"the issue amd will have is that zen cores are ""medium"" cores and unless they execute a radical change in philosophy i can see intel holding onto single-thread lead for a good while.","the more intel can lean on efficiency cores for... y'know, efficiency, the more they can afford to make the performance cores absolute monsters, especially as e-cores (i would guess) start to permeate down the product stack in future generations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ok buddy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i find it strange that so few people mention zen io die power consumption like they deliberately try to put amd zen in better light compared to intel competition.,amd io die makes zen chips real power hogs at light loads like 25w cpu package power at idle that easily shoots up to 60w while opening new tab in chrome itâ€™s just ridiculous when alder lake at exactly the same task uses 5w-15w.,"sure when all cores run at 100% load zen 3 consumes less power than alder lake but very few people utilize their cpuâ€™s at 100%, most people use case is light and moderate loads like web browsing or gaming where alder lake is more power efficient.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

how good intel cpus are is entirely a separate question to whether they have cpus under $300.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have no idea where you got that.,amd 5000 series has multiple cpus at different performance and price points.,people here acted like 5600x was the lowest performance and lowest price product in the series.,when i pointed out it's not people complained that 5600g performs worse than the one i just explained is not the cheapest and lowest performing part.,unlike people claim 5600g is better than 3600 across the board.,if you want cheaper and lower performing chip then 3600 is an option.,now are they competitive against intel offerings?,"no, obviously.",but that wasn't the question.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

for example, the first argument is the node advancement argument which is the strongest one.",amd could have sat on their ass as far as arch development goes and still be able to put something that beats al just because of node alone.,and so to add amds impressive capabilities when it comes to advancing their zen architecture (remember the biggest performance jump was from zen 2 to zen 3 **on the same node!,"** ), you know zen 4 is going to be the biggest jump ryzen has ever seen.",the way you've posed your argument screams insecurities to me.,i don't believe you even believe your own arguments.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well go take a look at alder lake mobile (12900hk) versus tiger lake (11980hk) and see for yourself what intel is able to achieve **on the same node**.,sure the next zen iteration always look great when compared to its predecessor.,nothing we haven't seen before.,however will it look great versus the competition in late 2022?,absolutely not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ever since i got my i7-12700k i've been struggling with its temperatures.,at stock settings (power limits removed by default on my mb) i used to see temperatures in the high 90s in cinebench r23 and thermal throttling in prime95 small ffts.,this is despite running a custom loop with a d5 pump and two 360mm radiators.,because my gpu stayed nice a cool in the same loop i naturally blamed my cpu waterblock - the corsairâ xc7 rgb pro.,this was disappointing as corsair usually make good stuff and this block was specifically designed for alder lake.,yesterday i read the article from igor's lab about the problem with concave ihs's on alder lake and the washer mod and i knew i had to try it.,after draining my loop and removing the waterblock the problem wasâ quite obvious.,there was a large build-up of tim right in the middle of the ihs and waterblock (see images).,i further verified the concave shape of my ihs with a razor blade.,"although my waterblock was slightly convex, the curvature on my ihs proved too great for it to overcome.","as i've been running this cpu since it was released a couple of months ago i was afraid that the ihs had taken on this shape permanently.â sinceâ my loop was drained, i took the opportunity to lap my cpu and waterblock to ensure they were flat.",i then applied the washer mod to the loading mechanism.,i understand this makes it difficult to separate the effect of lapping my cpu and the washer mod but draining and filling my loop twice would have been a pita.,"after refilling my loop, crossing my fingers, and starting my system the effects were immediately apparent.",my cpu was now idling at around ambient rather than 10 degrees above as it had been previously.,after running cinebench r23 for 20-minutes my cpu was now topping out at 83â° on the hottest core in coretemp rather than at 97â°.,but it gets better.,i noticed on cpu-z that the 12700k was now actually running at 4.8ghz all-core due to thermal velocity boost detecting the extra thermal headroom.,for a more apples-to-apples comparison i disabled tvb so that the cpu would run at 4.7ghz and the maximum temperature dropped another 3â° to 80â° for a total of 17â° reduction in temperature as a result of the mod.,while i'm thrilled to finally be able to overclock my cpu a little i'm at the same time disappointed that i had to go through this much effort and probably void my warranty to fix a design flaw that intel had overlooked.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have seen some people having various issues with memory channels and the like after performing the washer mod with 1mm washers so i decided to make a purchase of some .8 mm nylon washers in the hopes that a little bit more pressure on the cpu will eliminate those possible issues.,while also reducing the strain on the chip itself from the original mounting system.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this baffles me as i'm currently sitting on my 12700k which idles at 30-33c and goes as low as 25c if i leave my door wide open for more cold air to pass through the system.,i'm using a h150i as exhaust in a lian li o11 dynamic.,hm?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"guess i've got lucky, idle temps are pretty much ambient for me with a nh-d15, cinebench will hold 4.4 or 4.8 depending on me setting bios power to air or watercool presets, obviously throttling but it's air and i expected as much.","temp wise under cinebench is in 80s and high 80s depending on power preset but i realistically never hold cpu usage like that so for gaming use its flying and cooler than my old 6700k was at idle (locked 4.4) 

the force of the clamping mech for this 12700k was alarming though, i've not pulled the cooler back off to have a look and right now i don't plan to overclock, i know it's not ideal with the nh-d15 as for front/rear flow the pipes are oriented 90degs off optimal and it doesn't cover the full ihs, still, way cooler than the old 6700k i had.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so will that surface oxidate now?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"honestly i'm not surprised, it's very rare to get good flat surfaces on water blocks or cpu ihs

"nice work on the big temperature drop, although sanding your new chip is bold!",i have i7 12700kf + asus z690-f + kraken z73 and i did the 1mm nylon washer mod and got a 5-10 degree drop which is great - my chip is less than 2 week old and iâ€™ve only been using it moderately so probably not as concave as yours.,i have a question on getting a stiff backplate - is that what comes with the mobo or with the aio?,because what comes with the asus mobo seems pretty stiff and i donâ€™t see the ilm thatâ€™s torx screwed into it exerting enough pressure to bend that backplate or mobo.,what came with the kraken aio is a flimsy plastic backplate - but i donâ€™t see tighening the aio thumbscrews enough to bend the mobo and ilm in the center - it will only increase contact pressure between the aio contact plate and ilm?,am i correct in this assumption?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i couldn't find any reviews of that exact corsair model but reviews of a similar named xc corsair kit showed lousy temps compared to alphacool or ek offerings.,the problems of the bending of the z690 board due to the cheap mounting plate combined with the ddr5 and avx512 confusion has ruined the alderlake release.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i'm gonna be honest (i don't know much about cpus) but i'm pretty sure yours didn't need to be lapped and the surface is within normal specs of a cpu, they have a little bit of variance, that's almost the whole reason thermal paste is used.","but that being said, lapping the cpu probably didn't hurt the temps either and it's not like you can undo it now.",just in my opinion i'm not sure it needed lapping.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have the same hsf and took it off to really thermal paste yesterday and it definitely doesn't have great contact in the center as shown in the pictures.,i also get 80s in cb.,"i imagine it would be much better with good contact, which is what the washer mod tries to do

what i've noticed is that temps idle mid 30s but jump sporadically when there's any cpu usage instead of a gradual raise

not when it's covered in thermal paste.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes it probably will over time.,but not the part between the ihs and waterblock as that will never be exposed to air (and thereby oxygen).,there are lots of water cooling parts that are pure copper without the nicket plating.,as long as they're kept dry they won't corrode in a hurry.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this isn't necessary at all.,plenty of people have good temps (for high end cpus..) right out of the box.,"most coolers come convex, so having a concave ihs actually is a good thing to a degree.","but if you have an absolutely flat cold plate, because it came that way or was lapped, like in buildzoids case, the washer mod helps.","the actual issues are motherboard manufacturers going past intel specifications and pushing cpus with more voltage by default, and cooler compatibility/conversion brackets and installation issues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes i had checked my mount a couple of times.",first time because i thought my 5-year-old tube of artic silver 5 had gone bad so i replaced it with brand new nt-h1.,when the temperatures didn't improve i thought it might have been because i had incorrectly mounted it.,my mb has mounting holes for both lga 1200 and lga 1700 and my waterblock also supports both and i accidentally mounted 3 of pins in the lga 1700 holes and 1 in a lga 1200 hole.,re-mounting properly had no effect on my temperatures either.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
basically if your cooler came with a very sturdy backplate it can stiffen that part of the mb and prevent the pressure exerted by the ilm from deforming your ihs.,since you've already applied the washer mod then hopefully you should be fine as this reduces the amount of clamping force exerted by the ilm.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would think the level of force necessary to do this would break the socket and the cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to be honest it's really not the best idea as it'll void the warranty on a new cpu.,if you are really concerned about it you can use a razor blade to test how flat it is and if it is indeed a concave ihs that's causing your poor temperatures then consider an rma.,how's the backplate on your aio?,i've head that large sturdy backplates can mitigate the flexing to a good degree.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">buildzoid's mod

i own a 12700k, lian li galahad 360, and pretty worried, cause im reaching 91-100 degrees using cinebench r23, not washer mod applied yet, but im thinking to switch to a noctua air cooler or maybe to an artic freeze ii, not sure

[https://ibb.co/bl2gt2z](https://ibb.co/bl2gt2z)

"iâ€™ve got the same mainboard, 12900k, and ryujin 2. i bought the washers just in case but based on your experience iâ€™m going to start without them.",perhaps our cooler doesnâ€™t have these temp issues?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm at 1.225v for 4.8ghz all-core in cinebench r23.,pl1 and pl2 unlimited and drawing around 190w in cinebench to maintain 4.8ghz.,also bare in mind that i'm comparing the maximum temperature seen on any core in coretemp.,each utility uses different algorithms to report aggregate temperatures from raw sensor data.,for example aida64 reports much lower temperatures for me.,that's why you'll see such extreme results when comparing what other people report in comments.,the only way to get a fair comparison with someone is by using the same stress test and temperature software.,"for example when i run the stability test on version 6.60.5900 on aida64 configured to stress cpu, fpu, cache and memory i see the cpu temperature peak at 66â° and specific cores peak at 73â° after a 30-minute run with an ambient temperature of 19â°.",but no one ever goes into that kind of detail when commenting on their thermal performance so it's basically impossible to compare.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes and no.,i think the issue is actually the concave ihs.,the reason people using other blocks have had better luck is that the xc7 comes with a really flimsey backplate.,other blocks like the heatkiller or new ek come with very solid backplates that just happen to prevent any flex from occurring in the first place.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i agree.,usually lapping makes little difference.,the first time i did it was with an xspc waterblock on a 2600k and it barely made a difference so i haven't done it since.,it this case though i think it was necessary as the ihs was actually deformed making it impossible to get good contact.,"but again, not sure if it was the washer mod or lapping that made the bigger difference.",also i didn't go mirror this time.,most people say to take it no higher than 800 grit as it won't make a difference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
normally i would agree.,but in this case the ihs was significantly concave due to overtensioning from the poorly thought out ilm.,if i'd done the washer mod when i got the cpu then i'd probably have nothing to worry about.,but after two months of use i was araid it would be permanently deformed hence why i decided to lap it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
loosen the 4 torx screws by 1 turn each and see if that helps.,that should loosen the ilm by 0.5mm.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'm confused.,what is it you're asking?,are you trying to find what temperatures people are getting at full load with various coolers?,"yes, full load is very unscientific because the cpu cores are comprised of many different processing units for various calculations eg integer, floating point, vector which can use up varying amounts of wattage fully loaded.","eg cinebench can cap it out at 240 watts but you're seeing p95 cap it at 300w yet both scenarios are ""full load"" for those calculations.",theres this youtube video testing a couple coolers on the 12900k while running cinebench.,a couple air coolers and a 240mm aio.,the conclusion was the aio runs super loud vs the air cooler and you need at least a 360mm.,but you should also be able to air cool using an nh d15.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjdrq2iecci,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
real world temps doesn't tell you if you have a cooling issue or not.,you need to stress it with p95 or cinebench,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'll make a trip to the hardware store when they open today and report back.,"i will still say, initially he did not report wattage.",he later mentions he is at 190w at 80c.,i'm ~20c cooler at 190w.,"the question still stands, what are folks seeing that are also running up against the 300w power limit?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i would consider hitting the power limit to be full load, but the issue i see it that nobody actually says what they are running.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm buying some .8mm washers instead of 1mm since i have heard of people having issues with memory lanes not working and pcs not booting after the washer mod.,"so i feel like some slightly thinner washers (thus slightly higher pressure on the cpu, just hopefully without the bending) hopefully eliminating the possibility of these issues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"mine is cooled by a noctua nh-d15 air cooler, cinebench r32 (still hit a score of like 26800ish) makes it hit 100 on almost all cores within seconds, there are three possible factors contributing here.",two of them i can maybe fix.,1. i did a crap job with my thermal paste since it was my first try.,2. the cpu is bending from pressure causing a spot where thermal paste is too thick and cannot conduct.,3. it is an air cooler after all and will never be as efficient as water cooling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"> and on the opposite end of things: a 12900k comes with 8 e cores, judging by what we know about e cores so far why not go for a 10 + 2/4 config instead of a 8+8 config?","they add e-cores in place of 2 p-cores, so 10+4 isn't an option (except for segmentation if they did a 10+8, but the point of having e-cores is to lower the power consumption while keeping somewhat high multithreaded performance), 10+2 definitely wouldn't be an option, 10+8, while possible, would require a larger die and it would likely increase the power consumption to more than what they're willing to.","https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/reviews/070bdpri2ik2ecd2wzo0asi-5.fit_lim.size_768x.png

if they wanted to go with e-cores on the lower-end they would need to reduce the amount of p-cores, like 4+8 or 2+16 instead of 6+0, however mainstream doesn't have much use for e-cores as they're mostly there to keep power in check while increasing multithreaded performance.",this supposed leak (?),"is more or less everything that's currently possible, at least without having a ton of e-cores: https://www.ultrabookreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/mobil-intel-alder-lake.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i say, if you want to save that much more money, and are not too concerned over pcie-4.0.",10900k would be also a good option since they are both the same when it comes to gaming performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"isnt quick sync with igpu still a thing anymore, or is it very bad performance and quality?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have that but idk x264 has alway ran better for me, even on my older cpu.",i am not so caught up on the nvidia encoder and what benefits does it have over cpu steaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have a 1080ti , will this provide the benefit you speak of or do only the newer gpus outshine x264 encoding ?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i agree, i think the 12700f is the happy medium for best performance at a fair price.","it's $314 msrp, has the full 8 performance cores and 4 e-cores, more cache, more frequency, and it's notuch more expensive than the 12600k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i think asus motherboards are ranging from 250-450,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"b660 was affordable, running that with 12600k now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yep, agreed.","itâ€™s a little difficult to find close to that price here, but it seems like the best chip in the lineup, especially if derbauerâ€™s bclk ocs are viable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah.. this is where amd shines.,you can buy a decent b550 board for \~150 usd (eastern eu).,"for example:

https://www.msi.com/motherboard/mag-b550-tomahawk/overview",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in my region (eastern eu), b660 boards are close in price to z690 that makes the z a better purchase.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for streaming probably not, unless you use your gpu to encode.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gpu will be indeed used for the streaming part but i am gonna upgrade in the future to balance out the game quality and streaming quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you sure the pump is running properly?,95c for 160 watts and 80c for 120 watts definitely doesnâ€™t sound right.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the only info i was able to scrounge up was [this twitter post](https://twitter.com/techepiphany/status/1480294909181579268?ref_src=twsrc%5etfw) claiming intel had 33% of the revenue and 38% of the units sold in week #1 of the year, which is a modest increase from november.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there's your answer.,oc'ing this cpu and keeping it at stock voltage is what makes it run really hot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

someone correct me if iâ€™m wrong hereâ€¦ but bifurcation is not the same as simple lane reduction.,"so, you know you can take an x1 or an x4 device and plug it into an x16 gpu slot, and itâ€™ll work fine, because itâ€™s still only one device, and that device doesnâ€™t have to use all 16 lanes that are available.",just like you can plug an x16 device into an x4 slot (assuming physically compatible).,"but you couldnâ€™t, for example, take some weird breakout cable and plug 4 different x4 devices into that same x16 slot, even though youâ€™re still only using 16 lanes, because you now have 4 different devices.","only one of them would initializeâ€¦

which is where bifurcation comes in.",itâ€™s taking existing lanes and then splitting them up into potential devices that the system looks for.,"to support optaneâ€™s dual x2 device architecture, the bios needs to know to look for it.","otherwise, you basically just end up with a standard x4 slot running the first x2 device, and ignoring the second.",i also imagine that chipsets / cpus need to support the bifurcation being used as well.,"for example, alder lakeâ€™s pcie 5.0 lanes support x16 or x8/x8 modes.",but it does not support x8/x4/x4 (ie if you wanted to hook up dual 5.0 nvme drives).,"similarly, alder lake cpus cannot support optane on the cpu lanes, and only on the chipset lanes.",also likely due to the bifurcation needed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"according to the ""platform compatibility"" table here that is normal with an unsupported bios:  https://www.anandtech.com/show/14249/the-intel-optane-memory-h10-review-two-ssds-in-one

you have the right idea with the hacked bios to enable bifurcation, but probably that only enables 16x->4x bifurcation (since that is 99% of devices), whereas you need a rom that is coded to look for 4x->2x, which is basically not a thing expect for a few obscure products like the h10.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that was a joke.,"pentiums are old machines, good luck running windows 11 on it.",older generation 486 have turbo buttons to speed up the clock in the front of the case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

clock speed = multiplier*base clock.,"base clock fluctuates around 100mhz by design (""spread spectrum"").",you can disable it in the bios.,"also sometimes the base clock can be off by a few kilohertz, if it really bothers you, you can force it to 100 in the bios as well.",you may need to put a little bit more or less than 100 sometimes to get exactly 100 in cpu-z.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the pro board supports 6200mhz and up according to the product page for ddr5.,the majority of the power delivery for ddr5 is on the ram itself though the board does have some as well.,itâ€™ll support higher speeds no issues.,iâ€™ve had a z390 pro board for a few years with a 9900k and itâ€™s never given me any problems so idc what others say.,iâ€™m sure i could find a ton of bad reviews on other boards if i cared to look.,the bios out of the box sucks but it has q flash so you donâ€™t even need a cpu installed to flash the newest bios.,youâ€™re hell bent on shitting on my build for some reason because i didnâ€™t wanna go with a ddr4 board that i would have had to turn around and upgrade later on to take advantage of ddr5 later when my board does everything now and will do it in the future.,just chill.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if youâ€™re instantly hitting 100c in cinebench â€” like within 3 seconds, then itâ€™s likely:

- cpu voltage is going way high, causing a massive amount of heat (you can try manually setting a fixed voltage for the cpu)
- bad contact between the water block and the cpu (it looks like youâ€™ve tried to address this at least once)

if it takes longer, like 30 seconds or more (5+ mins even) to hit 100c in cinebench, then likely itâ€™s a heat soak scenario of some kind:

- the 240mm aio may not have enough overall capacity for the 12700k at full clock/voltage.","(240mm generally are good for 200w max, this is a bit above that).",- not enough airflow over the radiator (i.e.,"fans spun down, and/or case intake fans not supporting the liquid freezer - if your water cooler is exhaust for example, youâ€™ll want 240mm worth of intake fans too, or vice versa).","- the pump on the lf ii is not running at full speed reducing water flow

for the last two you can play with setting the case fan settings in bios to â€œmaxâ€ and seeing if that helps enough.",for the â€œ240mm is not enoughâ€ - you can try manually specifying a voltage that the cpu is happy with thatâ€™s lower than your screenshot voltages.,"i donâ€™t know enough about alderlake clocking to provide a recommendation, but you can do things like setting a voltage offset of a negative number or setting a fixed voltage of like 1.25v or something like that - and as long as the cpu is stable you should see less heat under full load.","also, and maybe best:  your bios might also have a â€˜power limitâ€™ option in watts.",try setting it to 130-150w and seeing what happens.. then raise to 180w or 200w.,good luck..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

guess you have to trust.,did you use the correct lga 1700 mountig kit and tightened really down?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it does seem cooler at idle.,can you check if your aio pump is plugged into your motherboard pump/aio header instead of cpu fan?,saw a few cases that the pump is underperforming when plugged into cpu fan header.,perhaps also check if pump speed is set at 100% and see if that helps your temps.,unfortunately there has been a growing number of ppl reporting liquid freezer ii having issues with lga1700 socket.,high temps etc... some are considering an alternative e.g.,corsair h170.,you might want to consider another cooler if temps are too hot under load.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are seeing 100c with cinebench r20/r23?,even with the 1mm washer offset mod?,how old is the thermal paste?,is the paste drying out?,do you also have full ihs coverage and coverage of paste on your aio cold plate?,how does the ihs and aio cold plate look after your remove them?,do they look fully covered with thermal paste?,any dry spots?,last resort is to adjust the ac and dc load lines so that you use less power overall.,"both less current, less voltage, and less power.",it is a sort of underclocking.,but i think it is a mounting issue or thermal paste issue.,with stock settings you should just hit 78c to 85c with an aio in cinebench.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your voltage is high.,245 watts is hella high.,my 12700k pulls 170-ish watts in r23 and stays below 80â° on a 240mm aio.,iâ€™ll double check voltage but itâ€™s 1.2xx something or another running stock,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"awesome, thanks.",i'll try to read all the tips here and see what works.,may i ask what your cinebench temps are after the fix and what your power draw is at max?,did some things last night and managed to drop it to 82-85 c. max power load is 200watts.,but i wonder if thats just because my psu has only 1x8 pin cpu connector and the cpu could techincally go above?,"although according to msi, 1x8pin can handle 360watts",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes and yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i had oc tuner i on when i first got it a couple weeks ago, and was able to benchmark with 85 being max, but having it off for a week now hasnt made any difference, i changed the multi core enhancement setting, and tried to disable my xmp profile and nothing has helped thusfar",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sorry for the late reply, i havenâ€™t benchmarked with cinebench since fixing it because i ended up also resetting my pc, but if i remember iâ€™ll try to get one done today",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is your cpu header set to 100% in bios?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"unplug your fans from the lf2 and plug them into the cpu\_fan header, while plugging the pump into the aio\_pump header.","you'll need a pwm extension cable to do so, as the fan cable on the lf2 is very short.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
arctic liquid freezer is a good brand.,do you have 1 fan or 2 fan versions?,i think their aio 240mm and 280mm are more than enough for these chips.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
voltage is too high anyway.,cb23 should consume some 170w on a stock 12700k.,"""no oc"" doesn't mean anything if the chip is consuming 250w.","xmp has little to do, so either svid profile is set to worst case scenario, llc is set too agressive, not allowing the chip to have vdroop, voltage optimisation is compensating for the high temperature sending more voltage gradually as the temperatures rise.",or all of the above.,"set the vcore manually, 1.2v and even less after vdroop should suffice for most chips to be stable at stock.",power consumption will drop dramatically.,"after you find a stable voltage, set an adaptive offset that allows you to hit those voltages.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m not sure then.,iâ€™d suggest resetting the bios to absolute stock settings and trying again.,"maybe something got inadvertently left in, or turned on, hard to say for sure.","xmp profiles wonâ€™t have any impact on cpu temps, at least to the degree you are seeing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no worries.,eventually managed a fix for mine :d im now getting 77-78 in cinebench.,and 45-50 while gaming.,my problem was that the aio fans were way too close to the top of the case so the air couldn't get out easily.,"my case is modular so when i removed the top, temps went down quite a lot.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

certainly nothing mentioned in the manual.,check the bios to make sure itâ€™s not forced into sata mode or something.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

go into bios and see if there is a switch for m2\_3 to be set at 3.0. the board specs are just strange to me as z690 comes with 12 4.0 lanes and the board should have enough to make all m.2 slots 4.0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in my old x299 asus tuf mark 2 it did disable one of the two m.2 drives when one specific sata was used at the same time for a storage hdd.,"but asus to msi, different generations, only sharing cause perhaps its worth a shot testing one by one real quick.",just wires and reboots.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"at least on my asus board, m.2 options are scattered all over the place.","the pcie option youâ€™re seeing, for the cpu-connected slot, is likely under system agent, while the chipset-connected slots would be under pch.",then thereâ€™s likely another section entirely where you select storage-related options.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i don't think your temps are that bad enough to warrant a paste change,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"pasteis supposed to dry out, the particles in it are what conducts the heat, not the liquid.",that's why the good paste is always much thicker.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"could this possibly mean undervolting possibilities on laptops, as plundervolt (relying on sgx) was the cause for blocking them?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the article implies it's only 4k blu-rays discs that are effected by the removal of sgx.,standard 1080p blu-rays should still be able to play on new intel cpus with windows?,my guess is intel didn't put further effort into it considering 4k bd never became as popular as dvd and 1080p bd and they probably assume most people stream on their computers anyway and the article also gives me the opinion 4k bd requires even more stringent drm than dvd and standard 1080p bd.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hey guys!,just wanted to add my thoughts here.,i went through a major upgrade.,went from an i7 4790k to an i9 12900k and have had no issues playing blu rays.,"i dont collect 4k, just dvds and blurays.",so far my experience has been excellent with the latest version of cyberlink power dvd.,as an avid film collector i was very hesitant to upgrade to the 12th gen series and was looking for an older cpu.,ultimately for my personal machine i decided to upgrade to something with a bit more power for gaming and occasionally editing.,i can honestly say as long as you watch blu rays and dvds you are fine with the new 12th series processors.,i truly hope film companies lose the security formats on these disk.,at this point no one buys bootlegs movies in the us.,all their doing is pushing honest film collectors into a corner.,and making it harder to preserve 1000s of films.,hopefully this is helpful to anyone looking for firsthand feedback.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the 12th gen is widely recognized as one of the most successful lately, while the 11th gen is the opposite (there are some good cpus in it, but the overall generation is more or less considered a failure).","moreover, the 12th gen uses a new socket, which means there will be an option to upgrade the cpu later.","yes, there are rumored to be problems with e-cores in windows 10. but unless you really need that many cores, why not consider the 12600?","unlike the k version, it only has 6 full cores.","i don't see any benchmarks for it, though, perhaps because it was just launched.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

don't decide to buy a processor based on its max clock speed.,always compare performance on a [benchmark chart](https://browser.geekbench.com/processor-benchmarks).,why?,"because you can have a processor with a lower frequency for example 12600k with 4.9 ghz max turbo speed, and it [destroys](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare/intel-i9-9900k-vs-intel-i5-12600k/3334vs4603) a processor with a faster max turbo speed like the 9900k with 5.0 ghz; in this case because it is newer.",you can find the max clock speed on the intel ark specifications page.,it's called max turbo frequency.,example: [12900k](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/134599/intel-core-i912900k-processor-30m-cache-up-to-5-20-ghz/specifications.html) 5.2 ghz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"typically yes, it will be the turbo boost which is usually only for the first core.",if it's an overclockable cpu then there's no way of knowing the max frequency without trying different bios settings and pairing it with the best cooler you can get.,it's a matter of silicon lottery at that point as well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

depending on who you bought it from they may just take it back and give you a new one.,microcenter is good for that especially if you just purchased it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes i guess .,i can see 2 bent pins here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes a single pin is bent and one looks like it's not even there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
best buy will let you return it no problem i'm sure.,i've had many monitors with dead pixels and returned them no issues.,their return policy is very good and is why i don't buy monitors anywhere else.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
was it hard to put the socket down on the cpu?,or didnt you even installed the cpu before?,asking because i ordered the same board.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"damn, i'll give it a shot.",literally opened it up and noticed the bent pins.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well won't putting the cpu in possibly damaged the cpu or no?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i thought that warranty doesn't cover bent pins.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's literally a brand new board out of the box though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i bought it from best buy guess i could try getting it returned.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"newegg is really bad about ""bend pins on new ""unopened""; they blame you.",microcenter and maybe bestbuy are likely better if you stand your ground,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you sure it wasnâ€™t opened by someone else before you?,but that gets me thinking.,"i had to pick up a msi z690-a pro i didnâ€™t want just to get my ddr5 memory, and i found it weird when the store insisted on opening the obviously new and sealed motherboard, taking it out the static bag, opening the socket, and having both myself and store staff sign off on there being no broken/bent pins in the socket.",wonder if this has been an issue with msi?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thats probably what damaged it last time but this time be careful just place the scpu in the socket eithout pushing down.,if its not in correctly then u can push it to fit it slowly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you buy something new and are opening things you might consider starting to record your opening of it and what not.,atleast then if the damage is done when you open it you have proof you werent the cause.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's unfortunate, it does happen.",hopefully you can get your money back,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you get the extra geek squad care?,if so they should exchange it no questions asked.,if not there maybe questions but as long as you have a receipt they should exchange it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean i was the only one to open it and noticed the pins immediately.,now i am worried about trying to bend the pin back.,i am worried about possibly damaging the cpu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no it wasn't.,he opened the box and it was already bent.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea that's a good idea.,this is the first thing i can say i've ever bought online that was damaged though.,just hoping best buy doesn't screw around with me with the return process.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not really proof unless you record literally the whole delivery process.,"otherwise you could just box it back up then recording yourself opening for the ""first time"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sadly i did not get the geek squad care.,think i am just going to try to exchange it tommowrow.,really just disappointed with the fact that i never touched it and it was already broken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thing is, it looks like youâ€™ve got one entirely missing pin.",canâ€™t bend that back.,"as for the one you can bend, you need to use something stiff and small, like tiny needle nose tweezers or, as iâ€™ve seen mentioned, the tip of a mechanical pencil.",and you need to be very slow and patient.,this wonâ€™t damage the cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you just opened it and it's broken, return it.",don't even bother going further.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thatâ€™s what these box lid stickers and plastic wraps are for - record cutting open the sticker and wraps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have never had an issue with a return at best buy.,"in fact their ""no issue"" return policy is the main reason i purchase half the stuff i do through them.","i actually dont like best buy, but i know if i purchase something, bring it home, and regret it within that 10 day period, i can tell them just that and have no hassel getting my cash back....  


""sorry, its not what i wanted"", done deal.","mind you, it has not been a ""defective"" product thing, but i would be confident you wont have an issue getting a replacement for a missing pin.",good luck.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea i just saw that one spot that looks like it was missing.,didn't even notice that before.....going to try and return it to best buy tommowrow and hope that all goes well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
motherboards donâ€™t tend to have any stickers and wraps when sold as new.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you that is reassuring to hear.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you just opened it and it was missing a pin this falls under defective with everything else being pristine.,you should be good on returning it for a replacement.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nice tip i used is zoom on phone camera, espetially one with macro setting to look on pins.",it might be also useful if someone is holding the phone for you to look as you unbend the pin.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"correct, as someone that has sold motherboards it's actually a pain.",so many first time buyers claim the board isn't new because it's not sealed.,also so many returns because customers absolutely mash the pins.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got 3 asus z690 mobos and they all have sticker seals.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i've been running my dh15 with 12700 since release date on asus z690 without a single issue.,no washer mod here.,\-99,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
was wondering the same.,jayz did the mod and he did not notice any different temps.,"i would not mess with that stuff tbh, even if it is a simple mod.","if sth breaks, you are responsible.","if you do not do the mod and sth breaks, you can rma without issues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm wondering the same with a 12700k + d15.,"the temperatures are of course a concern, but for me the bending is the real issue.",that cannot be good for the chip.,"if i keep my 12700k, i'm going to do the mod.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the washer mod isn't some magic solution that lowers temps for everyone.,"you can try it at the start or try it later, but nobody can tell you the results of which is better beforehand, as every system is unique.","the washer mod is only useful if your coolers cold plate is flat, like buildzoids custom lapped one.",the ihs can become further concave when socketed in lga1700.,"but many cooler cold plates are convex, so they actually mate well without any mods, and using a washer mod would actually hinder the performance if you have a convex cold plate.","which is why buildzoids stock cooler performed well, while his lapped one didn't, and then performance reversed with the pasher mod, his stock cooler did worse but his lapped one better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no issues with my 12900k, asus z690 hero, and noctua d15 + lga1700 kit (without the washer mod).","cooling performance and temperatures are exactly in line with expectations, even with ai cooling enabled.","build it without messing around with anything, and see what you get.","unless youâ€™re idling at 50c or throttling bad running cinebench, youâ€™re probably fine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
anyone on msi boards?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my rule of thumb is if it isn't broken don't fix it, in my case with a i5 12600kf paired with a id-cooling se224xt, the temperature without any mods whatsoever seems fine.","so, i personally won't even bother with this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
running a 12700k on a strix-a motherboard with a 360 aio that came with the socket 1700 bracket and no temp issues at all...this maybe down to some motherboards or even coolers with slight differences..i would try it stock first and if issues then try the shim..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i did it after buying my i7 12700k before using it.,"max temp of 70âºc, but i couldn't compare it to anything

"the tdlr, jay saw no difference between washer, no washer and cpu lapping using lga1200 mounting hardware.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you try it?,i have the same board,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"with these kinds of questions, i would strongly advise you to just put it together normally and see if you have an issue.","there is no reason to do this, unless your particular setup has an issue.","and even then, the issue is probably a non issue in 99.9% of your pc use, and that other .1%.....its a small issue that causes a benchmark to be a little lower than it could be.",dont sweat this stuff.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"use a ruler and rest it on your cpu cooler cold plate, if there's gap on the side it's convex.","if there is gap in the middle area,  it's concave.",most importantly is to mount your lga1700 mounting kit/backplate first before your insert and lock your cpu into the cpu socket.,this seem to pervent the cpu ihs from bending the most afaik.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i bought them at local store.,"the only have m4 0,8mm, but was fine for me",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
was this using as asus motherboard that used a lga1200 mount versus lga1700 mount?,the msi board iâ€™m using specifically needs a lga1700 specific mount.,iâ€™m wondering if that can cause a difference in the uneven cpu ilm pressure issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i understand that setting performance mode or having multi-monitors is supposed to stop the aggressive shifting to e-cores (any program not the immediate active forefront program is pushed off p-cores)â€¦.,but your rdp scenario does actually bring up a huge point of whether using rdp would negate the multi-monitor solution.,"possibly only leaving the performance mode solution, which isnâ€™t great for daily use.",they really need to change this behaviour.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that was it, power mode: best performance!",balanced or best power efficiency has the problem.,this is the first time i noticed this option.,it is completely different from the power plans you can find in the old control panel (or powercfg /l).,"in fact, if i change the old one to anything else but ""balanced"", the new settings app won't even let me change it to best performance, it just removes this row and says ""power mode can't be set while the ... power plan is used"".",that's a wierd schizophrenic behaviour.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the problem is the windows scheduler is trying to have a one size fits all solution for everyone.,this behavior is absolutely correct for most users.,but not in op's case.,"similar problem with a handful of applications like handbrake being set as low priority affinity by the developers, the scheduler assigning e-cores to an application that was set to low priority is absolutely the right move, but handbrake developers weren't aware this change would happen before w11 launched and thus theybwere slow to fix it.","microsoft really should've added an attribute flag that users could check on executables 'prefer all-core', which would exempt them from being pushed to the efficiency cores, as use as many cores as it can.","also a setting in the power settings, that would prioritize performance.","obviously there are third party solutions to fix these problems, but it would be nice to have them built in.","what microsoft has done isn't wrong, it just doesn't fit every users needs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> that's a wierd schizophrenic behaviour.,"lol, i think thatâ€™s the answer to most â€œwhy doesâ€¦â€ questions about windows!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"honestly, i donâ€™t see how this is really even a â€œone size fits allâ€ solution, because in the case of the 12900k with 16 cores and 24 threads, if youâ€™ve got 24 threads running full tilt, how is shoving 24 threads onto 8 cores and leaving 8 cores/16 threads doing nothing possibly the ideal solution?",regardless of priority?,i can see moving a few threads.,i can moving more threads if the â€œactiveâ€ program starts creating load or is a game or something actively flagged high priority.,"but if something simple like disconnecting from rdp or accidentally clicking on your email program last turns a 1 hour render into a 4 hour render all because your system is â€œwaitingâ€ pointlessly just in case something else might happen, thatâ€™s not smart behaviour at all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i understand what you are saying but it's still one size fits all.,you are looking at the problem with the assumption that performance is the most important thing at all costs.,perhaps it is for you.,"some people care about power efficiency - whether for battery life, thermals/fans, or just to be better for the environment.",not everyone wants 200w+ full performance at 5ghz+ for every little app and service running in the background.,not that your perspective is wrong.,it simply isn't the only goal for every users needs.,"and even for users who prioritize performance like you do, i bet there is still a significant variation in desires.","when the display locks/turns off and you go to bed, should handbrake consume 240w with potentially loud fans?","or should it get all the cores, but run with slightly lower performance for an 'acceptable' level of fan noise?","different pcs will have different cooling solutions, with different noise levels, and each user will have their own definition of 'acceptable' noise.",if i'm going to bed while waiting on handbrake encoding i honestly don't care if it takes 3 or 4 hours if i am going to sleep for 8h.,"impossible to come up with something that makes every users, on every pc, in every circumstance, for every workload happy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"granted, but until alder lake, the option of even shoving things off of â€œperformance coresâ€ and putting them on â€œefficiency coresâ€ didnâ€™t really exist.","weâ€™ve got 40 years of expectation that â€œwhen you make your computer work, it keeps working the best it can until it stopsâ€.","and if you donâ€™t like it because itâ€™s in your bedroom, you put it to sleep.","the problem is, for every reason why the current behaviour might be beneficial to some users, there are equal reasons why itâ€™s not beneficial to others.",and the latter user group has that 40 year â€œthis is how it has always workedâ€ thing.,"which is to say, there needs to be adjustability.",this behaviour needs to have a toggle between â€œprefer efficiencyâ€ (current option which frees up performance codes) and â€œprefer performanceâ€ (keep performance cores busy).,"and iâ€™m not talking about the current performance power plan, as its other behaviours (forcing max clock speeds at all times) are draconian and unnecessary.","perhaps even a middle ground option that kind of works the opposite of how it does today, by keeping high demand threads on performance cores but freeing up efficiency cores for other minor tasks.",i kind of think thatâ€™s how many users think it should work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is false in the sense that stutter is far more disruptive to the gameplay experience than a slightly lower average frame rate.,stutter is very often cpu related and can't be fixed or mitigated as easily as a lower average framerate.,the latter can be tackled by reducing resolution of graphical detail.,"but to fix cpu stutter you have to reduce game complexity, which is inherently hard in complex games.",this is also why the 1 or 0.1% lows matter so much - they are empathically not random.,"these stutters always occur in the massive team fight in moba games, or in boss fights in mmo's, or in the big clashes in arma.","solving cpu stutter therefore is very beneficial to gameplay, much more impactful than would appear at a glance.","in fact, i would argue that beyond 1080ti performance, investing in the cpu is a more cost effective  experience improvement.",especially with current gpu prices.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gracemont is 2mb l2 + 3mb l3 per 4 cores.,"if that remains in raptorlake then 10mb of the extra cache would be just from expanding to 16 gracemont cores, but that still leaves 14mb extra cache for the whole chip compared to alderlake.","not massive but considering it'll bleed down the product stack, the low/mid range chips will probably get a big performance boost.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i don't think any laptops actually use tb for charging.,even if it's a tb port it drops into usb-pd mode when you plug in a charger.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"of course it does, derpnuts, but you need an intel certified cable for tb4.","trust me, it's gonna save a lot of headache",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nah a usb cable will charge.,but some cables have different amounts of power delivery.,"the cables you can get on the cheap usually charge fine, but have e shit data xfer.","i'm just saying if you plan on using tb4 to move data with drives n stuff, they're going to act all funky and fail.","i don't know why, but i had to switch to tb4 cables before my ssds would work properly",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"with how much the manual mentions bringing the ac adapter, i'm going to go with no on the tb/usb-c connector being used for input charging.",perhaps you can try it out and return the device if it doesn't charge.,sometimes it'll charge with one brick but not another.,it's like a coin flip with third-party usb-pd.,"you may also want a usb meter to tell if it's charging, as some devices won't report as charging if there's too little net battery input.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just to be clear.,"are you wanting to charge your phone using the tb4 ports, or are you trying to charge the laptop itself?",it seems some of the comments here are assuming you want to charge the laptop battery through the port.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's not guaranteed.,"check the manufacturer's website to see if the port supports charging, as this is a feature worth advertising.","is the model you're looking for using an h35 cpu (11300h, 11370h)?",consider looking for h45 processors as h35 doesn't make sense with a powerful dgpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you need a certified cable even if it's just for charging?,for example right now i'm using a 100w usb 2 cable to charge my pc.,"transfer rate is horrible, but the charging is good.",would that not work?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the laptop itself.,"might have been unclear, i thought all ports would be able to charge a phone",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"should not need a certified cable, the certified cables have active components like redrivers on them so signal integrity isnâ€™t lost (in the gbps range) well beyond what you need for charging.",those cables are made so signaling doesnâ€™t drop to tb3 levels.,but for simply charging you can use a standard type c to type c cable with an appropriate brick for power delivery which operates in the khz frequency,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"okay, so does this mean that the laptop most likely supports charging, and that the reviewers stating that it doesn't have simply been using the wrong cable?",the acer website states that it does support it as well as intel's support but reviewers are vaguely stating that it does not.,acer is also unconcistent if it supports 65w or 100w,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it depends solely on the laptop maker/model to whether pd charging is supported.,they can opt to use their type c ports for data/charging devices like your cell phone and not tie the subsystem to the battery.,"unfortunately the only way to figure that is research, reviews and the manufactures specs",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think the jump from the 12400 to the 12500 makes sense to me if you need integrated graphics.,"apparently, the integrated graphics are better in some way as well.","it's $10 more, and you get 5% higher clocks.","the 12600 is $20 more than the 12500 for another 5%, and seems like worse value.","i mean people are buying gpu with better coolers and 1%-2% higher boosts or oc potential and paying $30-50 more (which i never do), so $10 more for a cpu doesn't seem bad to me.",or even $20-30 more.,the 12400f and the 12500 make the most sense to me.,but i wish there was a 12600f.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wrong a 12500 has an all-core turbo of 4.1 ghz so 0.1 ghz higher than the 12400, the 12600 has 4.4 ghz so 0.4 ghz higher than the 12400.

"the 12500 is for uhd 770 for more igpu cores, the 12600 for oems or the niche of players who have a fixed budget at the 12600 price point and care about 100 mhz or whatever it is higher allcore turbo.",but ye.,"12100, 12400, 12600k and 12700(k) are all the most baller cpus.",i probably would go for the 12500 instead of 12400 for the higher core count on the igpu though.,rmaing my 3080 now and am happy to have the uhd 770 on my 12600k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"so the latency you are referring to is called ""first page latency"" and it affects the beginning of a memory operation.","but if a large memory operation happens, the 6000mhz is going to do it twice as fast (minus the longer delay).","where things get fuzzy is mixed workloads, but it's rare for a workload to be so dependent on small memory operations that the latency overcomes the advantage of higher speed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"no worries, this is kind of a superficial explanation, but it covers the general idea well enough.","something to keep in mind (though this i am less sure of) is that ryzens are more sensitive to memory latency - so when the zen4s come out we will have to see what the impact of higher latency is (though ddr5 latency should continue to improve, or at least the speed should keep increasing without too much extra latency)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if you don't want cpu overclocking any of those three will be good for you.,"it really depends on which specific boards, features and price you need.","z690 is the most premium, but a $180 z690 board will probably have less features than a $200 h670 board, while a $130 b660 will have even less.","as long as you don't buy the absolute cheapest b660 board that is available, you'll be fine with any of them, it just depends on if you favor cheaper prices or more/better features.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

things are about to get worse for intelâ€™s data center business before it gets better.,i mean they are still worse icelake vs milan/milan x. spr would have to compete against genoa.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

doesn't look accurate tho.,spr is already out of the door and people have moved to newer programs.,not sure if the substrate shortage will delay manufacturing substantially.,spr should launch in early q2 and be quite competitive against milan and milanx until genoa comes in q4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i read the article.,the first thing that stands out to me is that the data center company they are getting the info from is located in china.,dell is the worlds largest data center supplier.,intel is simply not giving inspur any product as dell is intels biggest friend.,china is at a cold war with the usa and more specifically at war with intel.,nancy pelosi husband also has a massive put options on intel.,itâ€™s a coordinated effort to take down intel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hard boot the system from cmd line.,shutdown -p iirc.,"if you can, unplug the device and plug it back in.",msi uninstall is a best effort and the plug and plug architecture has a cache.,you can use pnputil.exe from cmd line and manually uninstall the drivers.,if you are comfortable messing with the drivers in windows/system32.,look for any file: ibt*.,this should all be related to intel bluetooth.,certain models do a firmware download from the driver and can get stuck in a bad state where the power rail needs to be cut.,hence the hard boot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the bigger *be aware* part about gigabyte z690 boards is that they train poor rtls compared to asus, msi, and asrock, both with ddr4 and ddr5.","leading to worse memory latency, and in turn worse performance.","given that gigabyte boards haven't trained comparable rtls to the other manufacturers for at least 5 years now, i wouldn't expect it to be fixed anytime soon either.","gigabyte haven't even changed the rtl part of memory tuning in their bios, despite the fact that alder lake has twice as many rtl values you need to adjust on ddr5.",so you can't even tweak your way out of the performance deficit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
honestly you always should.,i've seen many hardware releases in my time as pc repair tech.,never run early edition bios if you can help it.,many z390 from the 9th gen days couldn't run the 9900k on first/early bios.,they'd pass post but lock up trying to load windows.,"picked up a 12900k on launch day, and the first thing i did on my board after assembly was update my gigabyte z690i from f1 to f3.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

some motherboards don't unlock all the power without fiddling with the bios.,do a google search with your motherboard and you might find a tutorial of how to unlock the full potential of your 12700,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
set affinity to one core and see what happens during benchmark.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the all core boost is supposed to be 4.6ghz i believe.,it would be a pretty simple overclock in the bios to just set them to 4.9 if thats what you want.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wikipedia, which isnâ€™t always right, says 4.8 all core and 4.9 single core for the 12700.

i would load up hwinfo and just leave it running for a while as you use/benchmark your system.",if any core reaches 4.9 itâ€™ll show up and you can see which.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep probably a bios setting.,"on my z690 asus strix, you can disable all limits...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's not a bad idea to test honestly :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all core seems to be 4.5 but single should be 4.9. it's the b660 and non-k so can't set multipliers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what does it boost to when you do the single core cinebench benchmark?,on intels own site they have multiple boost speeds.,max single core is 4.9ghz.,maximum p-core turbo frequency is 4.8ghz.,and their turbo max 3.0 settings will boost to 4.9 ghz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"4.789, no matter what benchmark/prime i run that's the max on any core.",not sure if i need to enable turbo max 3 in some way perhaps.,gonna search around in bios later :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you'll only see the cpu hitting max single core turbo in very light workloads, if you're running benchmarks it likely won't be hitting max single core turbo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what board is it out of curiosity?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i noticed it actually has gone to (almost) 4.9 once now so there's probably nothing wrong.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i got the asus prime b660 plus d4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's exactly what i am planning to get.,is there any option in the bios to boost all the cores?,something like asus performance enhancement or multi-core enhancement?,"if not, does removing power limits boost all the cores to max clock?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it has asus performance enhancement that lifts power limitations, but max boost for all cores remains 4090mhz no matter what setting you change.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if the board has a ps2 connector you can use windows 7 right away, assuming you have a ps2 mouse.","from there installing any 3.0/3.1/3.2 usb driver that can be found by trial and error, signed or not, should get usb working eventually.","if there's no ps2, its a challenging prospect to get w7 operational.",disabling uac using another pc first and then trying to get usb drivers installed using automation or by remote control over lan are all i can think of.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

xtu is the same as in the bios.,"what i mean by that is that the multipliers on the clocks don't work, the highest it let's me put the multiplier is 38. also the per core multiplier option is missing as well.",the general overclocking features in the bios don't do anything even when i enable everything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

which is the last light that stays on?,cpu or dram?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there was a post a few days ago with a gigabyte board with the same issue that needed a new bios.,use qflash to update to the latest bios.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no not at all, just says no signal and has the error light on the board",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"dram is on the majority of the time, flicks over to cpu for a brief second",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iv already tried that, but have had no luck",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you checked for bent pins?,it sounds like board is finishing memory training then jumping to boot programming.,does the board have diagnostic leds that have hex codes?,i assume it's the motherboard since you've gotten two separate cpus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iv checked for bent pins and nothing, issue is this is the second motherboard too (unless itâ€™s just a crap motherboard)

and not the board only has the 4 standard error lightsâ€¦ doesnâ€™t show codes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so you've swapped motherboards, cpu, and the last thing left would be ram.",also sounds like a crummy motherboard if it does not have diagnostics.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah itâ€™s one of the more budget z690 tbh.,"i was leaning towards ram, but iv tried running on single sticks and i just have the same issueâ€¦ my other thought is i need slower ram (4800 not 5600) to get into bios and change the xmp profileâ€¦ but youâ€™d think that wouldnâ€™t be the case",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"first boot or after a bios flash the ram will use the slowest default non-oc while booting, before you can set an xmp profile to increase the speed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's probably not the case.,is the ram on the motherboard qvl list?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah i checked, the ram is supported.","the old thing to note on that is that there are 2 bios flashes available for better support of 5600mhz +

but even when itâ€™s flashed nothing changes.",so iâ€™m starting to feel itâ€™s some weird issue thatâ€™s not commonâ€¦ or iâ€™m just unlucky,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

is there a reason you're going for hedt?,"a 12900k will stomp both in single thread and still win mt by a modest margin, while using less power, on a better [consumer] platform and might be cheaper after factoring in motherboard costs and power.","if you had to choose between the two, the 10920x is slightly better in st, while the 7960x in mt.",i'd get the 10920x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably the 7960x unless you don't need more cpu cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"keep in mind the 10920x will have hardware mitigations for spectre & meltdown baked in the silicon, which makes quite a difference in day-to-day performance, even though it has less cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ended up going for the 7960x the dude selling gave it to me at an extremely cheap price of $150,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
okay thanks iâ€™m on a budget and got a free x299 dark and the cpus are under 300,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
btw is it better for gaming?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is it better for gaming?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 10920x will be faster when not using all the cores, which would include gaming workloads.",the 7960x will be faster for workloads that utilize all the cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if all you're doing is gaming, i would just sell the x299 and put the money towards a 12th gen build!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i haven't gamed on a hedt xeon since broadwell.,10k series of hedt is cascade lake which is a skylake derivative.,it is a xeon in client cpu packaging.,they are highly tuneable cpus if your motherboard allows it and can be great for gaming.,"however, if gaming is your only goal then a client part is your best bet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hedt cpus are not gaming cpus.,10920 has better st perf which makes it slightly better for gaming than 7960.,7960 has 4 more cores which makes it better for heavy work such as rendering because it has more mt performance.,"both cpus can play games, just not as good as the consumer parts.","a 10900k will do better in gaming than a 10920x, probably a difference of around 20 frames in some cases.",a 12900k will stomp everything.,watch a benchmark comparing them on youtube.,"but, since you said you are on a budget and already have a free board, get the 10920x or 7960x, you can't go from with any of them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yep i agree, the nice thing with hedt is that you have pcie lanes for days, so you will never have to worry running your gpu at pcie 8x ever, you have endless of possibilities for ssd upgrades with pcie adapters, so yeah if you are extreme enthusiast and have like massive 360-420mm aio or custom loop i dont see why dont go with intel hedt.",but current x299 is a little bit dated now and new architectures like zen 3 or alderlake starts to overcome even highly overclocked 10980xe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i personally get slightly triggered when people say x cpu is not a gaming cpu... all cpus can be gaming cpus its just that some cpus are better at it, but it doesnt mean you cant game on it, in fact intel hedt cpus has been good cpus for gaming for years.","for example, highly oc'd 10980xe can easily compete with highly oc'ed 10900k.",usually hedt cpus gain significant fps boost with quad channel ram and bigger cache.,"i mean sure alderlake currently is the fastest in games, but thats not my point.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i never implied anything else so not sure why you got all fired up.,"i clearly said that both hedt chips are fine for gaming, just that they are not ideal(""botch cpus can play games, just not as good as the consumer parts"").",it seems you just read the first sentence of my post and ignored everything else.,"in general, there is no reason to spend 2k(what these cpus used to cost) to get a cpu that prioritizes mt performance which will perform slightly worse than getting a mainstream consumer chip which will be cheaper and provide better performance in that particular use case(gaming).","to put it in other words, you can kill a mosquito with a rocket launcher, but not sure why you would want to do that.","after all, these chips are general purpose cpus and can perform any kind of task, but is exactly because some are better at a given workload than others that you have to pick carefully and the facts are that hedt chips usually come with lower clock speeds so lower st perf which is crucial for gaming.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well there is no reason to spend $500 for a cpu if all you do is game, $300 part will do just as good, so keep in mind that ""its not worth spending x to do x"" can be very subjective, for one guy its a whole budget for the other its pennies, doesnt mean that spending 2k is not a viable way to use that cpu, its all different point of view.","now intel hedt vs amd hedt are kinda different beasts, intel hedt are highly tunable and overclockable and with amd they are significantly less tunable so with amd its more like you said, that it is oriented and possible for multithreaded workloads while intel counterparts can be tuned to a level that you compete with best of the best gaming mainstream parts.",> facts are that hedt chips usually come with lower clock speeds so lower st perf which is crucial for gaming.,"you probably know this, but i single core speed is far from everything for gaming, more cpu cache and higher memory bandwidth makes just as big of a difference if not bigger.",you can oc intel hedt all core clockspeeds just few hundred mhz lower than what is possible on mainstream cpus but in exchange you get quad channel memory and more l3/l2/l1 cache per core.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
those hedt cpus are/were much better than the consumer chips for gaming workloads though.,"overclocked to like ~4,6ghz with fast quad channel ram and these monsters stomped everything in gaming for a couple years.",especially because they had huge cache for their time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, more l2 / l3 cache yes.",but you miss out on the ringbus that consumer level cpus get.,"you can overclock the uncore / mesh so that there's not much difference, but it's something to note.",l1 is unchanged from normal client cpus though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i didnt mention it but thats the reason why consumer cpus can even compete with hedt counterparts in a first place:) and yeah you are right about l1 cache.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

to be fair they milked it while they could,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gn does both gaming and production benchmarks so it makes sense they do worst case power load.,i have both gaming and work pcs so knowing how each performs is important to me.,each game will have a different cpu workload up to 100% so anything less than 100 is kinda dumb anyway?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
highlighting avx efficiency and not talking about the achilis heel of zen2/3 cpus - the i/o die is the reason why users are sometimes surprised by idle and gaming heat and wattage they did not expect with the allegedly more efficient cpu variants.,aida gets higher temps and wattage peaks with zen2/zen3 as just running avx2 benchmarks and hints why some games are running so hot.,a bit more transparency could help some gamers to choose the hardware without surprises at the end.,just a thought.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've been saying for a long time that amd isn't really as efficient during most light gaming and basic things like web browsing/video watching.,"i care a lot for light load/idle power, and amd has always been crossed off of my list because of it.","sometimes it won't be too bad(8 watt extra), but some have had up to about 20 watts extra just doing nothing.",i believe it depends on the infinity fabric clock as well.,"however, the monolithic nature of the apu series(starting with 4000 i think?)",generally leads to much better idle wattages.,"it's just unfortunate they didn't give the apus as much cache, they'd likely would have had very good efficiency/performance throughout any kind of load.","a lot of oems couldn't certify their amd desktops for energy star for a long time because of the high idle wattage, unless they tried pretty hard or just certified it by allowing the newer apus to meet the idle wattage requirements.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

get a better coolerâ€¦.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"from my experience, high idle temps are the result of bad case airflow or bad mounting pressure of the cpu cooler, even the stock cooler can do better",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20% cpu load on a 6 core cpu is not idle.,you probably have some flavor of bloatware taking up resources.,"any rgb controller software like icue, cam, or some of the others?",look at your task manager process list and see why your cpu is at such high usage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"turbo works the following way:

the cpu can run as fast as possible (at pl2 power consumption) for tau time.","when that turbo window expires, the cpu drops down to pl1 and stays there.","when the power consumption is below pl1 the turbo window regenerates, so that the cpu can boost higher next time its under load.","so, in your case, if you hit the cpu with a full load, it will clock as high as possible staying within 64 watts for 28 seconds.",when the 28 seconds are over it will clock as high as possible staying within 28 watts indefinitely.,you are seeing lower temperatures when lowering those values because the cpu is simply clocking lower and using less power.,"you can lower them as much as you want, its not harmful.","in particular for snappy experience i would allow a high pl2 with a low tau (this allows the cpu to boost really fast on instantaneous workloads), and for low temperature the lowest pl1 possible.","tau=0 might be either no pl2, or infinite pl2, you will need to experiment.",on a notebook i wouldn't disable pl2 though.,">also,  cpu's lowest multiplier is 4 but i never see it goes so low in windows 10

cpus change their clockspeed faster than any ui program can read it, so you might be just missing it, or the load of measuring the clockspeed itself is enough to move the cpu to a higher performance level.",in my experience the windows governor is incredibly aggressive as well.,"also 400 mhz is too low, it sounds to me more like a clockspeed used for some sleep power state like s0ix.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can damage your cpu if you increase your voltage and run the chip too hot (90+ c).,you can just cause boot failure and crashes if you increase your multiplier or frequency too high that the voltage is not strong enough to support it.,you can equally cause boot failure by lowering your voltage too much.,you aren't modifying your voltage or increasing frequencies so you are all good there.,the processor manages voltage on its own.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that motherboard is good enough yes.,it can even handle a 10900k no power limits in an all core prolonged stress test so you should have no issues.,"the only ""problem"" is that your ram will be limited to 2933mhz (10700k support limit) because of b460 chipset, but since your ram is 3000mhz there would likely be almost 0 difference anyway.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your ram will be limited below 3000mhz so i wouldnt say its worth it.,it deos support your cpu.,to be more flexable you can get a z490 to be able to get even 11th gen. there are some options for z490 that are about 100 dollars or a little more.,you can get an msi z490 pro which is cheap.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the higher pl only allows the chip to turbo boost at 4.0 for longer.,without it after the turbo expires it clocks down under 4.0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks man, where did you get the all-core turbo numbers from?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> i know it's marketed all core is 4ghz

answer this, marketed where?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

good to know.,what a silly limitation intel makes in the name of product segmentation.,"this is the sort of thing that makes me think that amd wants my business more than intel even if actual performance is competitive- the principle of accepting being artificially locked down pisses me off, kinda like apple.","ymmv, but that's me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"cant recall, all i can say is that it was an unreliable web so take it with a grain of salt.","however, it does seem plausible, the 12600 being the highest binned chip on that die.","i want it benchmarked too, wondering if the 12600 can be cooled with the stock cooler well with clocks like that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a few generations ago i would have agreed with you but in practical terms thereâ€™s not much difference anymore - for example, a 5600x is 4.6 but in practice even if you turn pbo on and overclock it still doesnâ€™t necessarily hit that in all core.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've a 12600 - the answer on the stock cooler is in games it's ok - in c23 it was getting into the early 90s with the power unlocked so i dialled it back.,i've got a nh12a which is overkill tbh - a nh12s or dark rock 4 or even something like a hyper 212 would likely be fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there are benchmarks of the 12400 which is why i knew it.,but cpus like the 12500 and 12600 are rarely benchmarked with video recording shown.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i feel the need to clarify my position so i come across correctly, rather than tor refute your position-- if you'd bear with me here: 

-

it's true that amd's 'x' line is fairly tapped out already, but i fall back on precedent for, say the 3600 and the rest of the line, being tunable if so desired.",there's nothing preventing a 3600 from running at whatever voltage/pl the user decides.,amd is making absurd money on their silicon now so they didn't feel the need to release 5000-non-x cpus but i'd hazard to suggest that they wouldn't break with tradition if they had.,this sits better with me than knowing that i've paid for something that's artificially power limited as a means of product segmentation.,"i'm 100% good with doing so as a default (as amd does) because it's good for power savings and most people won't care, i'm unhappy with strong-arming the market to protect margins.","-

all of the x86-based systems in my house are intel, and have been for some time, but i'm losing patience for this policy i consider to be bullshit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can confirm the 12600 numbers.,source: i have one :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no worries - i do get what you mean  (and sympathise to a degree)

i used to have a 3600 that could do itâ€™s labelled max on all core with pbo and over clocking - though i guess even there thatâ€™s only 5% (4.2ghz).","tbh, i wouldnâ€™t say the 12600 is artificially limited anymore - removing power limits and memory over clocking is available on b660 boards.",the fact it has a higher single core boost than all core is just how chips work (same for amd).,"you could argue that 12600s could have been sold as 12400 with overclocking head room, but iâ€™ve got no problem with intel offering higher binned parts to people who donâ€™t want to overclock, as long as itâ€™s not a stupid premium.","in the case of the 12600 which i bought, it literally cost 10% more than a 12400 for 10% more all core (+ better gpu).",i think thatâ€™s ok.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks, 4.4 ghz all-core so 10% higher than the 12400, good to know.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"maybe i misunderstood, alder lake turbo rules kinda elude my understanding.",is it a matter of varying board-to-board model for which ones allow indefinite pl2 clocks on locked cpus?,"i suppose that's better, but it still a limiting factor that keeps the silicon from stretching its legs.",">iâ€™ve got no problem with intel offering higher binned parts to people who donâ€™t want to overclock

nor do i, the competition and formerly intel used to do this.","again, the 3600/x accomplishes this with better default clocks/boost settings for the x sku while you can take your chances with the 3600.

the extra limitations in tuning don't seem very useful for much but segmentation.","anyway, the price differences aren't terrible and intel seems to have done pretty well this generation, i'm just not keen on the remaining, hard limitations whose purpose mostly just serve to throttle silicon that could otherwise perform better with tuning.",it wouldn't bother me if a 12400f could only hit 4.4ghz all-core without adding a bunch of voltage or was very unlikely to support much in the way of an oc- provided it wasn't entirely locked out for the hell of it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
who cares what node it's on and who makes it as long as it performs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"try giving them a call, they may yet change plans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is no way they would be competitive if they used their 14nm node.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you really think the intel gpu prices will be normal if they would be made on their own node?,these gpu's won't stay at their msrp price for more than a few minutes until the initial stock sells out.,then its right back to scalping prices no matter if the gpu is made on tsmc's or intel's node.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just called the ceo of france, he sent me intel",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they dont need to competitive because everything sell nowaday .,sad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i donâ€™t know if i can fully agree with that
the 1080 ti is on a 16nn node and a lot of people still compare it to the 60 serious.",if intel released a gpu with similar performance to the 1080 ti for 400 bucks it would sell out in minutes.,"also it could be slightly more power efficient because itâ€™s on a smaller die 

i also disagree that it will consume that much power because rtx 3060 ti consumes 200watts while gtx 1080ti consumes 250watts ( those to graphics cards are almost identical in performance when it comes to tasks without ray tracing )",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was more concerned about manufacturing capability.,if intel use their own node it would at least give us a lot more extra gpus.,the only thing thatâ€™s going to happen now is that intel and amd are going to be competing for manufacturing space at tsmc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"we need as many gpus as possible right now, and 14nm means bigger dies, which means less performance and less gpus.",n6p is much smaller which allows intel to pump many more gpus in a wafer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel also makes chips for qualcomm, though.",they also have no plans on using their 14nm node anymore.,"not sure intel has the capacity for gpu due to their cpu market, or if they would even prioritize it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it means more dies.,because intel has shitloads of 14nm capacity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[they don't.,](https://www.techpowerup.com/284915/intel-now-producing-more-10-nanometer-wafers-than-14-nanometer-wafers) any 14nm fab is probably in the process of being adapted for 10nm nodes.,"regardless, it isn't only about capacity, but also about transistor density; who can squeeze more dies in a wafer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you telling me that intel could literally have almost unlimited production of 14 nm gpu if they just kept their labs opened.,and iâ€™m saying almost unlimited as iâ€™ve never seen a shortage of intel cpu is in the past.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would depend on quite a few factors.,"one of them is whether intel would give their gpus priority over their cpu segment(amd gives ryzen priority over radeon, for example).","the second is how big a die with the 14nm wafers you could build(smaller nodes, and higher density means less defect rate, as well as the obvious, less tdp to deal with.","tiger lake gt2(96eu model found in the i7 1165g7 and over) has a die size of 146mmâ², according to [tpu.","](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/intel-tiger-lake-gt2.g906)

intel has a tight roadmap they're following, so keeping 14nm right now is a stupid decision.",it would need to be made in 10nm.,there are already talks of intel outsourcing their meteor lake igpus(which will go up to 192eu) for tsmc n3.,"intel also recognizes the shortage, and, frankly, they might just go the amd route.","if the gpu is bigger by a significant margin than the cpus, then it's probably not worth it, as they won't be competing with rdna2/ampere in the mid-range segment, and the low-end segment relies on low cost, high amounts, which means that n6p might be an better deal than their n10 process.",intel's decision to use n6p not to interfere with their cpu production is good.,"tsmc may be strained right now, but i doubt intel would want their cpu segmentation to be threatened by amd.","in fact, intel claims it will not provide good supply, according to [this videocardz article](https://videocardz.com/newz/intel-confirms-arc-graphics-cards-wont-ship-with-cryptocurrency-mining-lock).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a good power supply b660m will have same performance with z board without overclocking.,the seller is bullshiting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hopefully buildzoid will shed some light on b660 soon but the cheapest b660ms i can find don't even have a vrm heatsink, which is bad news for a 12700k.",what i'd consider acceptable for this cpu starts at the msi b660m-a (not the e and g versions).,"on the other hand, it's hard to know whether it's a problem without knowing the exact model and manufacturer of the motherboard, and how much more the z690 upgrade is.","however, losing 30% is certainly an exaggeration, especially in gaming where the vrm might not even throttle as opposed to running cpu heavy workloads like cinebench.","as for the cpu cooler i would opt for the larger ma612 if possible due to acoustics/fan quality, especially if you or the motherboard manufacturer remove the turbo limits.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

asus, gigabyte and msi have all for some reason decided to stop making barebones itx boards, the ones they do have have overspecified 90a vrms, gamer heatsinks, and not so bad to have in comparison intel 2.5 gb ethernet.",these specs are what drive the costs up to the similar to z board pricing.,"the only thing i would have preferred on top of the asrock boards is the intel 2.5 gb ports, but asrock using realtek ones instead is one of the things making their boards cheaper as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

well it's not like i don't believe you.,i'm just saying i don't think it should be that way.,:),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
anyways since this thread went completely off topic.,the g6900 is a $42 cpu that comes with a stock cooler.,"it only is 2c/2t, so its definitely an office pc sku despite the golden cove cores being so good.","you can double the threads and cache for $20 more with a g7400, but your still not going to be gaming on it.","the i3-12100 is probably the cpu you want to go for if youre on a tight budget, 4c/8t, double the cache again, much higher frequencies, its $120 so twice the price, but actually usable for gaming and multi-threaded workloads.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a problem i've come across on a bunch of forums currently is mentioning to people looking to upgrade that an i5 12400 is better than any older generation chip to buy right now.,i'm met with however many armchair experts that are so full of themselves that they think it can't even be better than an 8700k simply due to being a non k and having lower clocks.,"these golden cove cores vastly outperform all older cpus, even the 5950x, the only thing to decide is how many cores you want.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

intel needs to step it up at the low end as far as cores and threads are concerned.,we shouldnâ€™t be making e-waste 2 core/2 thread cpus anymore.,at least throw people a bone and make it 2 core/4 thread for celeron and make the pentium 4 core/4 thread.,that still keeps them differentiated but makes them each bit better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah wtf is he on about, rebuilding a pc is fun.","plus it's not even a full rebuild, it's just unplugging all the cables on the mobo, taking it out and putting the new one in, and plugging everything back in.",i think he thinks he needs to unscrew all the fans and drives or something just to change the motherboard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> and that completely ignores the fact that you can sell your old motherboard and recoup $75+.,meanwhile your argument ignores the time investment required in finding a buyer for your old hardware and the fact that you could get scammed if you don't sell it to someone you know (ebay will tend to side with the customer over the seller so you are sol in most cases like that).,"> it also ignores that these new lga1700 boards have new features, and an upgrade path.","ok but what if you don't benefit from those ""new features""?",also if someone is on something like an 8th gen i3 or i5 they do have an upgrade path and they may have gotten a 300-series intel motherboard with exactly this idea.,"it's like suggesting that someone with a zen+ system shouldn't upgrade to a 5000-series cpu but instead upgrade to alder lake to have an ""upgrade path"".",they already **are** on an upgrade path.,"> and if your on 8th gen or older, you dont get official w11 support.",?,???,"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/minimum/supported/windows-11-supported-intel-processors

i'm not saying you have to build a completely new system.",i'm just saying the amount of work required is almost as large as having to build a completely new system.,in fact it could argued that rebuilding a system is a bigger issue for many people as at least when you're building a new system your old system is still ready to be used at any time if something urgent comes up or you run into an issue in the middle of rebuilding.,as for the cooler the time spent choosing a new cooler also needs to be taken into account if you aren't satisfied with the performance of the stock cooler.,the best case scenario is that you can get new mounting hardware though that will also cost you at least the shipping cost in most cases.,all i'm doing is pointing out reasons why people may choose a less time consuming upgrade even if it gives them a bit less performance.,it doesn't mean you have to do it that way if that's not something you care about.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you seem like don't understand.,it is not wasted.,it is the same chip as 12900k but can't pass all the test.,then it degraded to g6900.,anyway 12400 already achieved 5.2ghz.,i don't doubt 12th gen celeron could run 5ghz as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes :-d i play on 4k cca 250-500fps depends on situation but i have only 4k 144 monitor.,later i want upgrade 11600 for 13900 or 14900 and see if it increase :-d. back in day when i bought fx9590 and r9 390 in 2015 it pulled cca 300fps in lol then.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well i assumed we are talking about people who know that you can't mix ddr generations due to the slot differences.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's still easy to upgrade ddr3.,it's always a question of how many slots you have.,mostly you are limited by slots not it's ddr3 or 4 or 5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have a special windows 10  power plan .cfg reg edit that allows you to do this.,"- tell windows to use all p and e cores 
- demanding apps use p and back ground apps use e cores 

-demanding apps use e cores / p cores 

i made 4 custom tweaked power plans for my 12900k so it does this while gaming.","automatically

- play a game or heavy app only uses p cores and it's hyper threaded cores.","back ground apps like discord , windows, smaller things only use the e cores it's pretty awesome.",so i have it like this to make it easy .,windows power plans i use .,"1) windows (  ultimate power)  plan is set to use 
all p and e 

2) windows ( high performance ) plan uses heavy apps like games and browsers on my  p cores and back ground stuff on the e cores .",3) windows balanced  is same as #2 high performance but allows down clocking and down volting.,"4 ) windows power saver uses e cores small for everything games and back ground apps and i limited the processor max to 99% wich limits the p cores and e cores to non boost ( 3.2 ghz max ) 

i have the artical and the reg edit for windows 10 for these configs safe and easy and u don't need windows 11.  

cheers",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thats some weird bugs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
any chance you could share me those powerplans along with the config?,i dont have the aknowledge for creating those lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

for me it showed 1 for the  attributes on each one.","so i just changed it to 2. this was done by clicking the string, then on the right side i saw, ""default, attribute, description, friendlyname"" so i clicked into attribute and changed it from 1 to 2.. is this correct?",also where and how do you set up heterogeneous option,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yup thats fine .,"under windows power plan u will see 4 new options

1) heterogeneous policy in affect = 0

2) heterogeneous thread scedualing policy = performant processors  
( all games and apps use p cores automaticly and not e cores )   
i like this one e cores just lower fps   


3) heterogeneous  short running thread thread scedualing policy = effcient processors  
( back ground apps )  use  e cores not  p cores   


now  any game or app or benchmark will use p cores only and ignore e cores backj ground aappds use e cores .","if u cvhange option 2 and option 3 to  = all processors  all apps games windows uses all p cores and e cores   


i made aq custom power plan named ultimate power plan that power plan i have set to  use all processor for option 2 and 3 .","my blanced and high performance power plan  i edited to use  option 1 - performant processors and option 3 set to effeint processors   


thjat way for benchmarks i use ultimate power plan ( all cores )

"to be exact, i fashioned some myself out of a sheet of plastic 1 mm thick that i had lying around.",i took the inside diameter to be around 4.3 mm and the outside to be around 10 mm and that has worked.,"the one thing you have to be careful for is the clearance between the screw holes and the corner of the cpu socket, so i don't think you can really go above 10 mm outside diameter.",9 mm should be great also in your case.,"i got a pretty consistent 5-7c decrease in temperatures or a 30w increase in sustained power draw in a thermally throttled scenario (cinebench r23), although i didn't quite do fully rigorous scientific testing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
any issues since you did the washer mod?,"i've been searching around, trying to find which size washers i would need.",did you use the m4's?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

okay first of all your computer will do fine with windows 11 if you disable the requirement checks while installing.,but your computer is pretty dated and i do recommend an upgrade.,"you'd be looking at something like this:

the core i5-12500 is currently out of stock but would be even faster for about [$20 more](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1675543-reg/intel_bx8071512500_core_i5_12500_desktop_processor.html).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if your asking to upgrade to another cpu within your same motherboard you won't get w11 support and frankly it's a bad deal buying old cpus, because they are overpriced for their poor performance.","you didn't give a price point, but a 12400f for $180 will be a large leap in performance, efficiency, and is pretty cheap.","pair it with h610 or b660 depending on your needs, and bring over your ddr4 ram.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

keep in mind cpu models that end with f don't have graphics.,"i assume you have a dedicated graphics card but if you don't then this is important, you should get a cpu that doesn't end in f. in this case it would be 12400 instead.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"disable intel vmd in bios if you are not or do not plan to use raid on m.2 or sata, and this will allow the drive to work in normal ahci mode.","if you are using raid on one of those two interfaces, i know on asus you can enable vmd and then map or not map nvme/sata interfaces to it.","this would allow you to have sata in raid mode and nvme in non-raid mode, for example.","if you wish to use intel vmd on an existing, already working windows installation, then you will need to install the intel optane/rst drivers to see drives on that controller.","if you are trying to install windows clean on a drive in vmd mode, then you need to download the intel optane/rst drivers and copy them to your windows installation media, and then when it brings up the screen to pick where to install to, and the drive is not shown, chose to load the new driver.","note that when vmd is enabled, the bios will not see the drive except when you enter the intel rst option.",this is normal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">this would allow you to have sata in raid mode and nvme in non-raid mode, for example.","wait, is this something special?",like on an amd board would u not be able to only put your sata drives in raid but not your nvme drives?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"its chipset specific, like the h610 doesn't support pcie raid.","if setting it up from new, just make sure to have intel raid set as default if you plan on using it or not, because starting with ahci then swapping to raid tends to brick the boot partition.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no idea.,iâ€™m not sure even how other intel boards implement it.,but there hasnâ€™t been many scenarios in the past where there have been two chipset-based storage interfaces where raid/ahci has been a possibility on both.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ohh, icic.","btw let's say i already have a 2tb sata ssd as a secondary drive, and then i get another one of the exact same 2tb sata ssd and wanna put them in raid 0, i'll have to wipe everything on the drive and start fresh otherwise it'll brick?",or does it only affect boot drives?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"amd's raid settings are similar; boards can configure arrays on nvme drives, sata drives or both, but volumes aren't allowed to cross controllers.","no nvme + sata jbod volume wackiness, at least through the bios.","i run a 3x1tb nvme raid 0 boot volume and 2x2tb sata ssd raid 0 scratch disk on my main x570 system for quick photo/video scrubbing and project export, works well.",it's a silly setup.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well if you want to raid 0 on any old drive, it needs a clean formatting regardless.",swapping from ahci to raid also requires a windows reinstall.,"best to just make sure to have the intel raid with optane setting enabled from the start, before learning the hard way that you wont be able to boot anymore after swapping from ahci to raid.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wait, if my windows is installed on a completely seperate nvme drive, i still won't be able to setup sata raid on my sata ssds?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ahh icic.,">ahci is a bad setting to use nowadays, and unfortunately most motherboards use it as the default setting, so you won't notice problems until trying to set up raid later on.","wait i don't get this part, so what you're saying is, even if someone doesn't plan on setting up raid, they should always change their sata controller to operate in raid mode rather than achi?",does this even work with just one sata drive?,does it affect performance?,sorry for the rapid fire of questions lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no that's the thing, even without raid, the raid controller is the same as ahci, if not better supported due to the latest intel drivers.","i saw zero difference on my basic sata 3 boot drive between the two, i currently have 2x2 tb nvme because at the time 4tb drives cost too much, and 2x16 tb hdd raid 1 for backup.","i'm waiting for either 4 or 8 tb gen 4 drives to drop in price before replacing the raided nvmes, as id also like to move my os onto one of the nvme slots too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m doing raid 0 just for convenience factor - iâ€™m tired of having a ton of volumes to deal with and just want one big drive thatâ€™ll spread the wear more evenly.,"iâ€™m not too concerned about reliability in this case, and itâ€™ll all be backed up anyways.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the main issue with putting things in vmd/raid mode is that a lot of tools cannot access the drives directly.,"for example, it is impossible to use samsung magician to update the firmware of a ssd connected in intel raid mode, even if it is not part of an array.","thereâ€™s no real speed difference between the two, but in ahci mode you do get the option of playing with different ahci drivers which can change performance.","with that said, iâ€™ve got a samsung 980 pro 2tb gen4 for my os, and iâ€™ve got two wd red sn700 4tb m.2 gen3 drives on order that iâ€™ll be putting in raid 0 mode for a nice 8tb ssd array.","theyâ€™re priced well ($480 us) and rated for 5,100 tbw each, which is exceptional.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

its a picture that demonstrates how chips get smaller/more refined over time.,"the light and dark brown on the left side chip represents layers (about 16 by my count), the same light and dark on the right are incredibly small by comparison because the chip is using that much newer a process to manufacture.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel has superior pcb manufacturering, also intels ihs doesn't look like it was made with an angle grinder in a third world country",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the processes used to make these multilayer pcbs have been around for decades, so it isn't about being newer or older, but rather how much you want to pay.","pcbs are made a pair of layers at a time, the traces are etched, holes are drilled and then they glue them together.",as you add more layers costs go up because you're paying for more layers which each have to be individually manufactured.,you try to use the smallest number of layers since that maximizes profit.,"in this case the individual layers in the 12600 are thinner because it has pcie 5 and ddr5, which due to the higher frequencies are probably going to need both more layers and thinner spacing between adjacent layers.",the 2600 with pcie 3 and ddr4 can use a cheaper to make pcb.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah but amd's ihs won't form a dip in the middle and cause the cpu to thermal throttle while being cooled by a 360 aio.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

okay so some 120/140mm all in one water cooler.,okay so after looking at the motherboard manual it looks like it's proprietary to hp and doesn't support overclocking through the bios.,so this is actually one of those rare instances where you're going to have to overclock with software!,i'm only slightly familiar with intel xtu but i can tell you their stress test is not much of a stress test.,it's a good idea to use it to see if your oc is remotely viable but you need to download some free software in addition to intel xtu.,download hwinfo64 this will give you accurate voltages under load and tell you why some things might be happening.,it will also show you if you encounter any whea errors while stress testing that indicate an unstable overclock.,i like to use asus realbench to stress your overall system (little bit of gpu but mostly your cpu).,"don't install this in your program files, you can keep and run it from your downloads folder, it won't run in your program files folder.","i'd download prime95, there's an option to run it with avx/avx2 instructions on or off.",i'd turn them off.,lots of stuff uses avx instructions but most of it isn't going to be as intense as prime95 and i don't think it's necessary to run it with them on to achieve a pretty solid oc.,"rule of thumb when running any stress test is to open hwinfo64 and scroll down to an entry called ""vcore"".",this shouldn't ever exceed 1.4v.,this is important that you monitor this because it can cause chip degradation or death because voltage is too high.,under intel xtu maybe try setting your core clock speed to 5ghz and a cpu voltage of 1.325v.,"run intel's stress test, if it passes and doesn't thermal throttle (it will show this in hwinfo64 core temperatures shouldn't exceed 99â°c or else throttling will happen) or if voltage remains under 1.4v you can move on to realbench and choose to stress test for say 15 minutes with half your ram capacity (or whatever is closest to half).",if your pc doesn't lock up or restart after this i'd probably run another stress test with realbench (same settings) for an hour.,"you're probably good to go at this point for reasonable reliability if you don't thermal throttle, go over voltage, or have any whea errors.",let us know what happens after you try this.,make sure you know where your cmos reset/battery is located on your motherboard by referring to your manual in case something catastrophic happens.,"if your pc won't boot and you can't get into bios, pull the battery and or short the jumpers to reset your cmos (this shouldn't happen because you're not overclocking in bios but it's a good thing to know just in case).",also learn how to boot into safe mode to hopefully disable intel xtu on startup in case it's causing you to crash shortly after login.,if the voltage goes over 1.4v stop any stress tests and lower your voltage.,odds are you're going to be thermal limited in your overclocking.,i'm not sure how good the voltage controllers are on your motherboard either so those two things are possibly going to cause you issues with stability and limit how high your all core clock can go.,i don't play iracing but i run my 10700k on stock settings with an undervolt and haven't had any reason to overclock at this point (i have a setting in bios that has a stable 5ghz overclock it just isn't worth the extra heat for the performance increase),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i would recommend not overclocking as unless you're running a super high quality 240mm or 360mm rad, you will run into thermal throttling on a pre built system.",it's really not worth it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

okay thanks for the very detailed answer.,iâ€™ll try to tackle this beast later.,iracing is a pretty old game and not usually that graphic intense but does rely more on cpu processing the most games.,the problem is that iâ€™m running it with vr and this is the real heavy lifting that needs to be done.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i downloaded hwinfo64 and ran little stress test.,i actually donâ€™t see the vcore measurement anywhere.,"i hope thatâ€™s not the same as â€˜average active clock vidâ€™, because that is going over 1.4v quite a lot ðÿ˜±.",the max was 1.449v.,where exactly do i see this vcore value?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"have been running my 8700k at 1.4v for 4 years now, seems to be doing just fine.","high temperature all the time as well, 96 highest temp when i check hw monitor.",been using it like that since day one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
vid is how much voltage the core is requesting or thinks it needs.,vcore is how much voltage it actually gets.,don't give it as much voltage as it asks for haha.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
should be in there.,it varies how things display depending on your hardware.,"i can't really tell you to ""scroll down to line 32"" or something like that.",vcore will be in there.,make sure everything is expanded so you don't miss it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you do you i guess.,"i, personally, would never allow that to happen on my pc.",you gotta understand that as technology develops the chips get better at operating at lower voltages for higher clock speeds.,the chips are more efficient but usually more fragile to voltages and heat.,your cpu could last another 10 years or it could die tomorrow but it's well known that heat degrades the life expectancy of these things.,i'm just not interested in having to replace an expensive component and would like to keep it around as long as i need to.,op shouldn't exclusively take our anecdotal experiences and should do some research to see what the bigger general concensus is.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you sure your cpu vcore is 1.4v?,"my vid is at 1.4v, but the vcore is 1.2v.",the vid is how much voltage the core wants but that's not how much it really gets which is the vcore.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok. thanks now i get it.,i still have not found anywhere where i can see the vcore voltage on my computer though.,ðÿ˜,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i checked hwinfo, says max vcore 1.45 and average 1.41. had to turn up the voltage in bios to get the overclock stable.",had crashes with lower bios voltage settings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in hwinfo64 it's there under sensors -> motherboard -> vcore but this isnt very accurate for the lows.,you can get a per-core vcore in cpuz.,if you right click the screen in cpuz you can select which core you're viewing.,[https://i.imgur.com/vx15lwl.png](https://i.imgur.com/vx15lwl.png),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

valid point and sorry to hear you really got the shit end of the silicon lottery stick.,i thought at least being able to go full 5.0/4.0 full time was pretty standard on these 12700k chips from what i've been seeing on here and in reviews.,"even stock, the 12700k still runs within a few fps of the stock 12900k in most games though.",it may be completely unfounded but this variability is why i never go for kf chips.,"i feel like, well if the igpu is disabled, was that due to manufacturing defects and they are just trying to maximize sales from imperfect wafers?",why else would you waste that lithography effort to just fuse it off?,"and if so, could those defects impact the rest of the chip in a meaningful way performance wise?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, but i can share my process overall.","first regarding power, i didn't mess around with voltages much and left it on adaptive mostly.",i also *did* turn on c-states up to c8 with rush to halt to help keep package power down since i keep frequencies maxed out constant.,"some claim that you must disable c-states to maintain stability when overclocking, those people are idiots and have no idea what they are talking about, as this is completely untrue on 12th gen chips.","as a result, my 12700k chip can sip as little as 4.5w in idle total in a 5/5/5/5.2/5.2/5/5/5 + 4/4/4/4 constant config without issue (typically fluctuates between 4-15w depending on background processes).",pretty amazing considering my 3080 sits at 30w in idle with two 1440p monitors on even though it's undervolted to 870mv.,"as far as oc'ing, first i turned e-cores off, enabled avx512, bumped all p-cores to 5.1ghz and ring clock to 4.7ghz.",this worked set some solid benchmark scores but ran warm and i wasn't convinced turning off the e-cores off was really worth it.,single core scores were higher than stock and i barely gave up anything in multi-core.,"then i went with all p-cores at 5.0ghz, all e-cores at 4.0ghz and ring clock at 4.2ghz constant.",this worked perfectly fine.,then i tried upping the preferred cores bit by bit.,"i got as high as one of them at 5.3ghz, the other at 5.2ghz and the rest of the p-cores at 5.0ghz and it was stable when benchmarking for the most part, but once in a while the system would just randomly hang after being on for hours, which gets old fast.",from there i bumped both preferred cores to 5.2ghz and the rest 5.0ghz and i never have stability problems now.,since then i added a slight negative voltage offset to vcore to run a bit cooler but otherwise i haven't messed with it and it's still stable.,"as is, it rarely tops out over 1.38 or 1.39 vcore, max package power is typically around 220watts for cb23 multi-core run but it usually hovers around 205w under that load.",i think the highest i ever saw the package go when i was really screwing around with high clock speeds earlier was 307watts in a kombuster cpu burner test but i ran into thermal throttling within a few seconds of doing that.,"i believe in my current setup i draw around 275w using the kombuster cpu burner and it strains my cooling solution, but no workload i'd ever run in real life comes close to that load.","your results may vary, but that's been my experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a low sp rating (64) and stress testing/lower than â€œnormalâ€ benchmarks.,if i remove the power limit the scores come up to â€œnormalâ€ and power use moves toward 190w.,it wants well over 1.3v to run all core.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes.,you can set the tdp in the bios to what ever you want.,"check out:

keep in mind these cpus only use the power they need.,"a 12900k uses the same power as a 12700f, and less than a 5800x in gaming.",you can pretty much ignore the max tdp unless you're actually pushing these cpus with heavy workloads.,"anyways with b660 and z690 you can limit pl2 (max power) anyways, so it doesn't matter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

old post now but should someone not worry about a board like the asrock h670m-itx/ac that limits the cpu to 150w?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is not true.,"i used intel xtu to measure my tdps, and even idling in the game menu screen, it is maxing out at 65w tdp even though cpu utilization is only 10%.","when i run the xtu stress test, the tdp is also 65w but the cpu utilization jumps to 100%.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"main reason is that i don't want cpu to become hot at all, not for its longevity, but just to keep my room cool.",i'd rather wait slightly longer for a program to load than my pc to output double the heat.,"for the mobo, i'm trying to decide between the asus prime z690-p wifi d4 and msi pro z690-a ddr4.",the asus is more barebones but it's got no memory problems and better reviews compared to the msi.,"i just want to know which has better audio codec, msi alc897 or the asus ""realtek 7.1 surround sound high definition audio codec "", whatever that is, as i don't really want to fork out anymore for a dac.",both of them are probably alc897...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, it's a core intel cpu feature and not dependant on the motherboard.",worst case you can download intel xtu and change power limits from inside windows.,"keep in mind power is limited by lowering clock speed, so if you aren't already maxing out the clock on all of your cores you may be well below power limits anyway.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

good to know!,iâ€™m going sff so i am going to be cooler constrained for higher loads but when the price difference is basically nothing the 12700 feels like bad value.,might as well have the full power available even if i have to take the cover off and point the desk fan straight at the cpu to use it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

strange its probably the best ddr4 board especially for the money and people on this subreddit also recommend it.,gamers nexus also recommends the msi board,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah the z690-p looks to be juts a cheap as possible board.,it doesnt even have 2 8 pin eps connectors.,the z690-a is the way to go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> 2 8 pin eps connectors

you only ever need the 2nd connector for severe ln2 oc's

yes.,you can find small form factor power supplies like the corsair sf-750 that can comfortably run a 3070 or even a 3080. the motherboards also support fairly intense overclocking with 10 plus power phases on high end boards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks!,will i have to find one of the thin mini-itxs with a pcie slot or is there another way to wire up a gpu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there are itx cases designed to hold video cards.,"you can also go external over thunderbolt, but there is some lost performance for doing so.","the external video card cases would handle the power for you, so that you could connect it to any pc that has the appropriate port.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is it a gigabyte motherboard??.,if yes then try updating to the latest bios available.,it should work fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there are no benchmarks of the 12600 out yet, as far as i know.","but i imagine that, in gaming, it will perform [somewhere between the 12400 and ""12600k no ecore"" in this graph](

"op - fwiw, if it's in your price range - consider also the i7-12700  vs. these two processors.","the i7-12700 will be faster than the 12600k unless you significantly overclock the 12600k due to extra cache, 2 more ""big cores"", and similar or slightly better sustained load clock speeds.","the stock cooler is also sufficient on 12700 for gaming, though if you're doing production work you might want a better cooler and a board that supports raised power limits.",\+remember the 12600 and 12700 come with coolers which saves even more money vs 12600k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"cannot find the a reason to have e-cores on desktop, but would prefer more e-cores on laptop.","12600 non-k looks fine, unless you really need the any-extra-cores or you want oc.",because non-k price looks noticeably lower + you can save on box version if no long and heavy tasks or games.,"+ z690 adds extra-price

also, i suppose that most desktops' tasks are about single-core speed, that is why i3-12100 or i3-12300 is much better price/value + 4 cores is more than enough for non-special daily usage and games, but i do not like it has lower freq.","conclusion: you need more cores oc oc => 12600k, no need => 12600 looks fine",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it depend what is the propose of the build.,if it is mainly for gaming then 12600 is alright (for now).,i will go for b660 if it is non-k .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™d imagine thereâ€™s not much point getting a z690 if you arenâ€™t over clocking,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

kitguru included some overclocked benchmarks for 12600k.,https://youtu.be/jms2mvj8n-u,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, 12600k is 4,5 ghz allcore, 12700k 5 single and 4,7 ghz allcore and 12900k 4,9 ghz allcore.","the 12900ks will even be 5,2 ghz allcore and 5,5 ghz single core.","there is nothing wrong with going 5 ghz single and 4,8 ghz allcore at 12600k or more, but undervolting 4,5 ghz is also an idea for amazing efficiency",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i miss the huge gains of overclocking, had a core i7 920 @ 2.66ghz, maybe like 5-6 years later got into vr with an htc vive, but my 920 was not vr ""ready"".","overclocked to 4ghz, 50% improvement, and i was gaming great and held onto it a few more years.","now on my 5900x, i can get maybe like 5-10% more performance depending on silicon lottery and how many hours i want to waste tweaking (which is not many since im married with a 2 year old)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
undervolting is still a good idea.,sort of goes hand in hand with the hobby of overclocking.,i was able to drop about 80 watts off of a 12900k without losing any performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm in the same predicament, but i also don't understand how pcie lanes and io work.","i have 3 sata drives (2 are in raid) , 2 m.2's and going to add an add in m.2 card.",does this mean i should opt for the z690 over b660?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not necessarily - my 12600k will hit 5 ghz on all cores with one click of a button (using gigabyte easy tune).,of course i could try doing it manually as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i found a random youtube benchmark.,"dunno if you trust that sort of thing, but until we get reviews from the reputable sites, it's all you've got to go by.","according to this, the 12600k gets on average 2% more fps than the 12600. so, i guess it depends on whether you think going from 153 fps to 157 fps is worth the 40 squid.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej2vlqom7sm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't think there will be any notable difference between 12600k and 12600 until the e-cores get properly utilized.,"you sacrifice 100 mhz boost clock and 2 mb cache, that's about it.","in comparison, 12400 is down 400 mhz max boost compared to the 12600.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'll be doing productivity apps regularly tho like adobe programs and blender and i thought the e cores would come in handy for it, would 8 cores practically be just as good and also another question, is it worth overclocking nowadays and with these cpus",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"isn't the stock cooler garbage though, even though its a new design?",i've been watching a few vids on its performance and i'm not sure it's fit for purpose.,"so i've been factoring in a third party cooler to the prices of these cpus too, that's why i felt 12600k+3rd party cooler would be better value than the 12700+3rd party cooler",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm actually considering getting the 12 gen i3's, what's exactly the daily usage activities specifically you can do with it and is it real good for modeling and rendering, not much of those though, beginner here.",and pairing those with a 3000 series card wouldn't cause too much of a bottleneck right?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on what connectivity you want and if you want a post code display.,i'm building a rig for my dad and looking primarily at the 12600k and 12700f but am going z690 no matter which processor for the extra connectivity and he wants a post code for easier troubleshooting.,i have a post code for my rig (5900x/rtx3090) and wouldn't do without it for my own rig.,"for the dad build i'm frustrated because there's no ddr4 boards with a post code released in the us (only board i'm aware of anywhere that has it is the aorus pro ddr4 but looks like it's only released in east asia, australia, and nz).",looks like i'm going ddr5 because of this and that's another set of availability issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

actually it's very easy to oc and uv your ryzen with clock tuner.,it usually nets you more oc than 10% and with a reduced power consumption/heat thanks to uv.,"on intel though, oc has practically lost all appeal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"undervolting (and also in case of 12900k, reducing pl2) is good stuff.","it seems to be more useful with gpu than with cpu, but i undervolt all my parts these days.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your sata drives will be fine on any b660.,"fortunately, most board makers are prioritizing m2 connectivity over more fast pcie slots.",just make sure the board has 4xpcie4 for each m2 slot you want to use.,most b660 boards will be fine for you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
100% go with the 12600k or 12700 then,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 12700 has the benefits of both - 8 p-cores and 4 e-cores;  vs.  6/4 for 12600k and 6/0 for 12600.  

as for oc, imo only the 12600k is worth overclocking.","the 12900k is pretty much already up against the limit, and the 12700k is quite close but a really nice balance of - a few hundred less mhz and a good deal less power draw -- when doing heavy applications for example.","https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/intel-core-i9-12900k-and-core-i5-12600k-review-retaking-the-gaming-crown/4

if you look at the 99th percentile 1080p fps (i.e.","cpu limited scenarios) -chart 3 of 4, 12600k oc'd defeats 12900k and overclocked ryzens -- rising about 17% above stock.","here's a direct link to that chart:

it's garbage if you are going to run heavy applications for long periods of time - something that can hit all of the cores.,but it's enough for games or lighter apps.,it'll also allow the cinebench type apps to run just with some reduced performance due to throttling.,i.e.,if you're getting the cpu for professional work get a better cooler.,if you're playing games and run some apps but have a budget.. start with the box cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yes youâ€™ll definitely see significant gains, but the 12400/12400f just came out and it matches the performance of [even the 11700k](https://youtu.be/2j0ip520woy&t=732) at a significantly lower price and power consumption.",depending on your local pricing it might actually be worth going for that instead.,it is an overkill for a 1050 ti as youâ€™ll definitely be gpu limited in most games but it leaves a lot of headroom for a gpu upgrade down the line when prices are normal again,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1080p casual gaming right ?,better i3 12100f/12300 + h610m (for tight budget) or b660m.,4c/8t 12th gen really decent for casual gaming that love single core performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
both of your parts are heavily constrained.,"upgrading one of them will help some of the time, but its going to be game specific.","some games need way more cpu than you have, other games need way more gpu than you have.",upgrading one or the other will not solve your problems completely.,they will only help.,need to replace both problems to get where you want to be.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no he's saying you should get a 12400f.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don't buy any of this yet lol if you can afford a 10600k and a motherboard that will fit it you can afford one of the new budget cards if you can get your hands on one of them.,the new 6500xt releases january 19 for $199 ($300ish for higher end aib cards) and the 3050 releases january 27 for $249.,"the 5500xt was the last gen card and it was 40-100% faster than the 1050ti  so the two new cards should significantly outperform those for less than the cost to upgrade cpu/motherboard

i've had similar issues on linux which were resolved by disabling rc6 and c-states in my bios.,"the former is probably somewhere in your system agent or graphics settings, the latter in your cpu settings, under whatever the ""advanced features"" panel is.","disabling both of those may slightly reduce the power efficiency of your machine at idle, but i doubt that's a problem since you're running a 3080 :).","if those don't fix it, make sure you os is completely up to date.","if issues still persist and you're comfortable flashing your bios and understand the risks of botching it, perhaps there's a newer version available for your board.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
latest bios?,ram in the correct slots?,"any overclocking, undervolting, auto performance boost, mce, etc?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm having the exact same issues.,"i bought an i7 12700kf, asus prime z690-p d4 motherboard and samsung 970 evo plus ssd 1tb, and i'm experiencing this problem since then.","i have ddr4 ram so i think the problem is not there, so it have to be the processors.","&#x200b;

how did you solve it?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all i have done is run my ram at default speeds & kept my bios and drivers up to date with all the latest versions as they became available.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the problem solved?,did you use any program to update your drivers or did you download them manually?,i haven't changed any ram configuration in the bios.,"that means they are running at default speed, aren't they?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, if you haven't manually gone in & tweaked the timings or enabled xmp they should be default, i would go to your motherboards page [here](https://www.asus.com/motherboards-components/motherboards/prime/prime-z690-p-d4/helpdesk_knowledge/) & update all of your drivers, see if the problem continues.","if so then i would recommend updating to the latest bios if you aren't already on it, if you've never updated a bios before i recommend watching a video on how to before you go in blind because it's possible to brick your motherboard if you don't know what you are doing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"fun to see someone say ""regular reader of the intel intrinsics guide"" as a qualification.","i created the intrinsics guide, and i'm not sure i'd even consider myself an expert on avx / avx512.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
creator of linux hopes that avx512 will die a painful death.,https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=linus-torvalds-on-avx-512,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is avx 512 and why does it matter?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just fyi but i love the intrinsics guide, it is incredibly useful.",i wish more software would come with a reference like that.,one minor request: could the avx512 subsets list the cpu family on the left side?,"or at least indicate somehow (different color, etc) if they're the old phi stuff?","for some of them its obvious, but if i see something with a cpuid of avx512_4fmaps i inevitably end up having to google around to figure out what i'm losing compatibility with if i use it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"haha, i tried to find a word that implied a good amount of experience without sounding like i invented the thing, but it seems like i'll have to wait for english-512 for that.","anybody who does this professionally would definitely be able to teach me some new tricks, and i owe much of what expertise i do have to the intrinsics guide and all the other excellent documentation you and others have created.","on behalf of everybody who uses that stuff, thanks for making it all so accsssible :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you read through that quote (and the rest of his linked comments), most of what annoyed him about skylake-sp (high power draw on 14nm) was already fixed in icelake and alder lake by the shrink to 10nm and the smaller avx-512 units (512 instead of 1024 bit).",unfortunately everyone just reads the title and ignores what his actual argument was.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"instruction set for computation similar to gpu computation but done on the cpu, overall intel server cpus as a premium feature.","it had adoption in some scientific calculations and alike and now intel released avx on consumer alder lake, amd is also likely adding some avx support so it curious what's next.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's application-specific.,"if a program uses avx-512 to good effect to speed things up, 11th gen will be faster in said program.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i no longer own the intrinsics guide, as we transitioned it to a larger group a year or so ago.",but i will pass along your request.,it does seem reasonable to distinguish phi exclusive extensions vs non-phi extensions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the downclocking penalty was dramatically reduced with 10nm parts as well.,itâ€™s really a non issue now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
avx and avx2 has been a thing on consumer cpus since haswell.,"avx-512 is the new thing that was added and it is much more than just ""for computation similar to gpu computation but done on the cpu"".",if you listen to the podcast they explain why.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so it's in early stages of implementation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not a huge amount uses avx512 yet, since rocket lake was the first consumer cpu to support it, so not too many people need it.",most that do would be buying hedt anyway.,what is going on is that intel screwed up.,"over the summer they were saying it would be supported, but at the last minute they dropped it.","no one knows why, but likely some kind of errata or compatibility issue they couldn't iron out in time for launch.","i'm still hoping they can sort it out for raptor lake, but its looking like raptor lake is going to be a pretty minimal refresh of alder lake, so it might inherit the same problems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's also less likely to be added to existing software if the instructions are not easily usable by software developers.,"i've used sse over avx/avx2 and avx/2 over avx-512 because of the physical limitations of my hardware, despite the instructions being ""out"" in haswell or skl-x",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

some of these can be labeled as bad or old.",but i think they are great.,igpu gaming is great because you don't feel pressured to get the highest graphics or pursue the fastest most competitive game.,sometimes it is just nice to be able to go someplace quiet and just play a chill and enjoyable game.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it all depends on the game you want to play.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you should be able to do some casual gaming.,"i would advice you not to spend money getting any games though but instead try some of the many good free to play titles; league of legends, rocket league, fortnite, paladins etc first.",then set resolution to 1600x900 in the games and low or performance mode settings.,make sure also if you game at home on the laptop it is connected to power and not on battery for better result.,epic store is much maligned but they give away free games every week you can grab to start a collection.,enjoy the gaming!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it would be difficult to run a game properly on that setup but there are solutions.,"if you upgrade your ram you can google ""can i run it"", it'll compare your pc setup to minimum and recommended specifications making it much easier to decide if you should play a game on it.","however, you could currently play games if you have a somewhat decent internet connection using nvidia's geforce now, it's free and you can link your steam account to it and play games over their cloud service.",that's what i currently use on my phone and laptop.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

bruv there's not a lot you can play on that pc but you should be able to emulate some systems.,"give 3ds, ds, ps2, ps1 and some other retro systems a try.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it looks like you have 4 gb of ram.,"you don't have a dedicated gpu (aka graphics card basically  the thing that renders graphically intensive things like games) so the igpu (integrated graphics that's build into your processor)  doesn't have its own ram, (called vram for graphics cards) so it has to barrow some ram from your main computer.",ps sorry this is probably a bad explanation :/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"long story short, you need to get yourself a new computer if youâ€™d like to play newer games

"5500 will scale up to use more ram, but because you only have 4 gb of it to start with, it probably won't scale well.","it terms of what's feasible, integrated just doesn't work good for gaming in general, but if the stuff your playing is low demand...it wouldn't hurt to go to can you run it on systemlabs website and see how the evaluate your pc for each prospective game you select...if you meet basic requirements...you can probably do ok with low settings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

try running each game at 1280x720 with low detail settings, and adjust it from there.",you'll likely end up with performance between 20-30fps.,"not amazing, but if you're just looking to join up with friends it'll do the trick.","[this video on youtube](https://youtu.be/uwjkuibp1x4?t=192) shows a clip captured off of a thinkpad with a similar model of integrated graphics, to give you an idea of what to expect in fall guys, for example.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would also suggest trying out the factorio demo.,it's free to try out from factorio.com before you buy it.,it's a pretty easy to run game and is tons of fun.,the only bad (or good) thing is it never goes on sale so it will always be $30 to buy the game.,at least you won't feel buyer's remorse from buying it then going on sale for $5 the next day.,it also has a built in mod function once you've done a play through and mostly understand the game so you can tweak the experience to be anything from absolute warfare to the most difficult and challenging game you've ever played.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"we also don't even have ram fast enough to saturate transfers across a full pci-e 6.0 bus..

"well if you're on a pcie 3.0 system, i'm assuming you're running something older than 12th generation intel or zen 2/3 which supported pcie 4.0 (unless you have an older board on the zen platform).","if that's the case, a newer cpu would certainly help frametime more than just improving pcie 3.0 to 4.0 ..

the review is a little weird because it compares 3.0 x16 of 10900k to 4.0 of 3950x, but the data to look at is pcie 4.0 x8 vs pcie 4.0 x16 for 3950x;  x8 4.0 is equal to x16 3.0.   it's a few percent overall but not a ton..   as you can see though a faster cpu makes more difference than the pcie speeds.","however, a 12900k+3080 on 4.0 would outperform a 12900k+3080 on 3.0 for sure..

p.s.","newer boards also support ""resizable bar"" which adds a few more % to 3080 performance.",some info:  https://www.pcworld.com/article/394720/faster-gaming-frame-rates-for-free-resizable-bar-explained.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
im  running a 3080/9900k/z390asus rog hero/750w psu with a 1440p 165hz monitor.,"in some games i'm feeling like the 9900k is holding me back because it can't get a hold of stable fps (more erractive frametime) like staying around 150-165hz (in certain games)

for example limiting the fps to 144 i notice better frametimes and thats probably because the cpu doesn't have to work as hard to try and hold an extra 20fps over 144fps.",thinking of going for a 12900k (or version 2 of alder lake) and def getting a 4.0 board.,spoke with multiple ppl playing cyberpunk on 4k that made the jump from 9900k>12900k and  i shit you not even they noticed the game was significantly smoother which is kinda insane since its 4k where you would think the gpu would be the real work horse.possibly the e-cores helping the game by offloading uneccesary load on them (i could this being especially helpful if you watch videos while you play) or maybe the fact the cpu has double the cache?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so cyberpunk might be a special case where ""hardware mitigations"" for vulnerabilities could be making a big difference for some reason.","go to about 6:20 on this gamers nexus video, pause and expand the screen size:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pri7vxh0ju

notice the low fpses of 9900k - 49.8 and 81.5 (0.1% and 1.0% lows) are lower even than 10600k - 74.5 and 102.7.  the 10600k uses the same architecture as 9900k (skylake cores), has less cache (12mb vs 16mb), and only boosts 100 mhz higher than a stock 9900k.",the difference is that the 10th gen had a lot more of the spectre/meltdown mitigations in hardware vs. microcode - which can slow down certain functions considerably.,"i point this out because while the 12th gen is definitely the fastest cpu for gaming, the 8th and 9th gen are being held back by mitigations for spectre and meltdown.","if you wanted to take the risk, you could disable these and improve fps..  

p.s.","although it's on linux, here's a comparison of how much the mitigations impact each cpu:
https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=3-years-specmelt&num=9

the thermaltake frio ock is by far the best cooler i've ever used on anything... used to cool a i7 7820x a few years back.,basically the same as the noctua nh-d14 at a slightly smaller footprint.,"when seeing 90c+ i'm talking when running cinebench, which is how i test system stability under load.",prime 95... just forget about it within seconds it's thermal throttled.,"so by ""better cooler"" what exactly would you recommend?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
...i have it set to auto.,hence my concern.,yes i use balanced as well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have... twice, used deepcool z3 and noctua nt-h1... didn't change cinebench load temps at all with either cooler or thermal paste.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"what sort of load, cinebench load?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've had goodluck with the lian li galahad 360 and kryonaut thermal paste.,also i have a high airflow case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the case matters too.,no air flow and the cooler doesn't work,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, what motherboard are you running?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nzxt phantom 820 should be fine lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gigabyte z590 aorus pro ax...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that case has like half its front intake surface blocked and only 25% of the side panel (rough estimate) available as perforated intake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's one of the boards which had vrms overheating due to excessively high power plane resistance if i remember correctly...

lower operating voltage will probably help, but you might just see a higher cpu temp than people will have on cooler boards.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
high airflow still... it's also still forcing air into the case regardless as to how much room is there to do it lol.,"look at gamersnexus, you'll understand that case designs make no sense and even with a full mesh front panel the cooling may not actually be any better.",i've had this case for years and it's by far the best i've used.,"most cases today barely have 2 let alone 4 drive bays and have massive cut outs for radiators or a res... i'm not filling up this case with water cooling stuff, as long as there's an exhaust the cool air is still getting circulated ;)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you know which boards aren't crap then... also the vrm's aren't too bad but it does pour a ton of voltage through this chip at random intervals... running cinebench it hit 1.5v on default bios which is running well outside intel spec for sure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nah pal, you'll definitely have to use a better cooler.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"go b660 since an i7 12700 has no overcloking, and that would hopefully save you enough to get a better cooler (which you will absolutely need).","i have an i7 12700k, and the socket temp never exceeds 40c when gaming using a corsair h115i.",i recommend something lower like a corsaie h100i or a be quiet heatsink for 80-110$.,"if you don't know, we're to look just try to find a cpu cooler that can keep up with a ryzen 7 5800x or ryzen 9 5900x, and you will be fine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for gaming, the stock cooler will be adequate but noisy.",i'd still advise getting an aftermarket cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
both are excellent options.,i think that you would not go wrong with either one.,we do not yet know how well those b660 boards will keep the turbos up for extended periods and what the performance difference between 12700k and 12700 will be in real usage.,why am i comparing between 12700k and 12700 instead of 12700 vs 12600k?,because we know this: **the difference between 12600k and 12700 will not be more in 12700's advantage than what the difference between 12600k and 12700k is**.,"we do not yet know if 12600k will actually beat 12700.

anyhow so looking at this review from igorslab

[https://www.igorslab.de/en/intel-core-i9-12900kf-core-i7-12700k-and-core-i5-12600k-review-gaming-in-really-fast-and-really-frugal-part-1/6/](https://www.igorslab.de/en/intel-core-i9-12900kf-core-i7-12700k-and-core-i5-12600k-review-gaming-in-really-fast-and-really-frugal-part-1/6/)

we see that on 1440p (vr gaming you will have probably higher resolution than this, but check the other resolutions also if you want to) the 12700k is leading at most at around 4% in fps when pushed hard, while pulling more power (240w vs 150w).",12700k has a big better 1% lows also (quite important for vr) but nothing dramatic there.,there is also no difference at all on many games.,in fact on the summary charts here [https://www.igorslab.de/en/intel-core-i9-12900kf-core-i7-12700k-and-core-i5-12600k-review-gaming-in-really-fast-and-really-frugal-part-1/8/](https://www.igorslab.de/en/intel-core-i9-12900kf-core-i7-12700k-and-core-i5-12600k-review-gaming-in-really-fast-and-really-frugal-part-1/8/) you see that on average the fps difference between these cpus is less than 1% in 1440p and around 2% in 1080p.,so a brief conclusion.,"depending on how it goes you will see at most 1% difference in favor of 12700, but most likely it will lose somewhat to 12600k.","either way, both options will very likely be extremely nice selections for you.",i personally would take the 12600k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
go for a 12700k and a cheaper (but still good) motherboard.,check out the msi pro z690-p (or a version).,"i was abel to keep a 12900k at 5 ghz on air with that board, no problem.",and it was cheap and reliable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think either will be a great choice.,i would personally prefer the 12700f because i think overclocking is wasteful power and heat wise.,12400f is also looking like a pretty amazing cpu if all you need it for is snappy vr.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all of these cpus are great choices for vr and simulators â€” you want strong per core performance which 12th gen delivers.,"unless youâ€™re doing a solid oc on the 12600k*, the 12700 with the stock cooler or aftermarket cooler and power limits removed (i.e.",good 660 board or probably any 690) will outperform the 12600k.,"the 12700 has more l3 cache (= slightly higher per core performance), and clocks a little higher (all core turbo).","hereâ€™s a review of the cpu - unfortunately no 12600k, but you can see with the power limits removed and the stock cooler, itâ€™s within 2% of a stock 12700k and aftermarket cooler: https://www.techspot.com/review/2391-intel-core-i7-12700/

(scroll down for game summary).",*toms hardware has a specific oc review of the 12600k where it can exceed the stock 12700k if you push it pretty hard (5.1 ghz all core turbo on the p-cores).,if you want fire and forget â€” get the 12700.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why are you planning to couple 12600k with z690 and not with b660 mobo?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is stock cooler sufficient for light to medium usage?,"(like chrome, photoshop)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
any fan cooler recommendation please.... like will cooler master hyper 212 evo be sufficient?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks!,though in this review it seems like the 12700 is faster than the 12600k aside from one exception.,"[https://adoredtv.com/reviewed-intel-i7-12700-cpu-with-noctuas-nh-u12a-and-intels-rm1-stock-cooler/](https://adoredtv.com/reviewed-intel-i7-12700-cpu-with-noctuas-nh-u12a-and-intels-rm1-stock-cooler/)

i am probably going to with the 12600k, but i'll wait on the benchmarks and see how the b660 are.",much appreciate the detailed comparison!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> check out the msi pro z690-p

not the -p, that board has a really weak vrm.",the -a is so much better equipped it's not even worth considering the -p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
issue with the 12700k is that i will need a new power supply; i'm currently using a 650w.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>can you do undervolting with a 12700f?,i am happy with the performance of it but i undervolting is a must for me.,i do that with every processor i own.,"normally that means same performce but cooler, more quit and less power hungry processor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the very detailed explanation!,i'll wait and see how the b660 boards are going to be and make judgement from there.,thanks!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"because only z-series boards allow for oc would be my guess, and many people like to at least have the option.",they also got more pcb lanes for people who need them.,"a 12700 non-k cannot be overclocked, so unless you think you need the extra lanes, it's wasted on a non-k chip.","this topic is inactive for two months now, though, so likely resolved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's definitely usable at that workload.,it is still possible that it will heat a lot but not enough to damage it's useful life or to shut down.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"fera 5 is very good, if you want something looking good one arctic freezer 34 esports duo.","those are budget, but as i said ""very good"".",ofc you can go with something overpriced like noctua or be quiet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, that review shows a very positive picture for 12700. it also shows a lot more difference between all of the cpus than the igorslab-review.",too much difference between these two reviews so i guess it is time to wait for some more reviews with the official release products and see how it plays out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
solid advice then!,"get the a over the p. i only got the p as it was the cheapest ddr4 board available, as a placeholder until my ddr5 came in.",didn't have any issues powering the 12900k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how to know week vrm from a good one?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"buy the 12700f for $320 and buy b660 unless you have a specific need for z690, the amount you save there will be plenty for a new psu, though you will need to spend like $50+ more for a better cooler

plus you're going to need to buy a new psu anyways with the rumored power demands of next gen gpus, both amd and nvidia are rumored to increase wattages going forward.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"go something like this:

i7 12700 

b660 mobo

keep psu (for now if you have an rx 580 or below gpu)

go ddr4

get a cooler for atleast 70$ and as high as 110$

a 650w should be good enough if you don't have a demanding gpu right now.. but you will need to upgrade it later.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm not sure but i doubt it.,undervolting is great and you'd think the k series are a higher quality of silicon which would work better for undervolting anyway.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what cpu/mobo/cooler did you end up with?,"if it's b660, have you been able to undervolt cpu?",thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

better optimization is super important right now for intel's graphics division.,"on paper, they have a very fast and capable product even in their igpus, and while we see that shine through in select workloads and games, there are still plenty where this is not the case.","many games have xe being outperformed by even previous generation graphics architectures (integrated vega, entry level polaris, entry level pascal and maxwell) that should be easily overcome according to games that they have already optimized for, and workloads that xe should be superior in from a raw computational standpoint.","even once they get many of the aaa and esports type titles fully optimized, there's going to be quite a backlog of older, previous generation games that just aren't going to work as well as they should due to the fact that intel doesn't have that long history of optimization to their stack that nvidia and amd do.","still, they do seem to be working at a very rapid pace so far.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the lead will always exist when the cpu is the limiting factor.,that will be true regardless of the gpu being used.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it will have better lows and better averages in most games but might potentially perform worse in games that need more than 4 cores.,if you already have a 3600 don't bother with the 12100. i'd personally wouldn't buy a 4c/8t cpu outside of a low budget build.,12400f is a much better choice to go with the gpus you mention.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"true, one should never go below 6 cores unless severely budget constrained",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"please stop using the term ""needs more cores"" there is no such thing.","most games that needed 6 zen2 or skylake cores, only need 4 alder lake cores.","there are no ""hard core minimums"" it's simply a thing of needing ""x amount of total thoroughput"".","12100 has proven this with excellent 1% and .1% lows in many cpu heavy titles once claimed to be ""quad core killers"".",almost everyone remained gpu bottlenecked the entire time we stuck with skylake level of performance per core.,"now that cpu power is rising at a much faster rate, it be be even more true than ever that gamers should buy the best gpu they can fit in the budget, and then buy extra cores beyond 4 if there is still budget to work with.",but me?,i'd still rather put that extra into ssd capacity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

pretty sure performance trumps core count,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that was my point in my response.,"overall performance matters more then core count, and modern 4 core processors are amazing at gaming.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> most games that needed 6 zen2 or skylake cores, only need 4 alder lake cores.",better ipc can make up for fewer cores but 12100 is nowhere near as fast as you're making it out to be.,it falls behind 3700x in many games despite having significantly better ipc.,youtube benchmarks aren't very representitive of real life.,"a lot of games go untested because they're difficult to test, or relatively niche.","in the few games reviewers test they don't test every scene, or every scenario.","they test with lower gpu settings, comeletely ignoring some graphical settings introduce a lot of cpu overhead, like rt.",some particle effects in some games can choke cpus with fewer cores.,even increasing fov or playing at ultra wide screen ratio can increase cpu utilization.,and good luck playing racing sims with ai opponents with a 4 core cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 rt adds a little work but nothing like the load that low settings introduces.,but at realistic settings the cpu is almost always a non factor and gpu is all that matters.,"at 1080p ultra with a 3080 the i3 and i5 are within 5fps in most titles, or just plain tied.",in real life my 3300x never sees over 70% load.,and i play asseto and i played it on my 5775c too runs perfectly fine not sure what you are referring to.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you could buy a chromax nh-u12a and [modify](https://youtu.be/pwyalll1jj8) the fans with rgb yourself if you really want to go wild.,noctua could probably sell these for $40-50 a pop easily if they'd just do it themselves at the factory lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

short answer - completely normal.,your cpu is not faulty.,every intel cpu does it.,it can be 3c difference on cores or 15!c.,just don't stress it out.,i remember my old 4790k had 12c difference on cores before delidd and ~2-3c after.,"your cpu ihs can be curvy as well, so cooler have bad contact on 1 corner for example.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i had a similar problem, and after checking a programm, i noticed that my cpu used 310 watts.",for me a simple bios update helped.,now my temps on cinebench are at 70â°c with an aio.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

my cpu package temps are 100 in cine 23 with 12900k and noktua.. got better with new msi z690 bios.. these guys are hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looks normal to me.,check your voltage settings.,"at 4.8p/3.9e, my sample can run at around 1.23v avx2, and this is right at the margin of stability.",on a 240 aio and 185w this runs around 86-90c.,if you're running >1.35v then you almost certainly are throttling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s very common for 1 or 2 cores to be a little hotter than the others.,"you also have 3 others hitting 96.

"havenâ€™t seen what cooler you are using listed, unless iâ€™m blind?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
somehow your cooling is inadequate.,you need to apply a lot of thermal paste on the 12900k ihs and on the noctua cooler itself.,can i suggest place thermal paste on the ihs.,place the cooler over it without apply pressure.,now remove the cooler and spread the paste with a plastic tool of somesort.,get full coverage add or remove paste as needed.,check that both ihs and cooler has full coverage.,you can add an additional dot of paste if you want in the middle after this.,and finally tighten all 4 screws down as evenly as you can.,"do not apply external pressure on the cooler as when you remove your pressure, it may cause uneven spread or lack of coverage.",you are using the world's fastest most capable chip out on the market currently.,"if this doesn't work, consider an aio to help tame this beast.",and alderlake is a beast despite what others may say.,it is impressive.,2nd place.,"[https://hwbot.org/benchmark/geekbench4\_-\_multi\_core/rankings?hardwaretypeid=processor\_6627&cores=16#start=0#interval=20](https://hwbot.org/benchmark/geekbench4_-_multi_core/rankings?hardwaretypeid=processor_6627&cores=16#start=0#interval=20)

its just that no matter what this one core always hits 100c no matter what... its causing throttling in cinebench.,"as you can see on the picture on the far left colum core 7 is at 90c and the next one down core 6 is 77c....

"there are always cores that run hotter than others, happens with every cpu.","and with the 12900k being as hot and power hungry as it is at stock, its going to push a lot of people near or to the limit depending on their cpu cooler/mounting/paste/airflow and bios settings.","id recommend underclocking it, youll lose no performance but will probably be able to eek under the 100c thermal throttle.","if that doesnt solve it, lower the pl2 slightly, that will cause very very minor performance loss but significantly reduce power consumption and heat.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
modern intel chips basically end up balancing thermals against margin against performance.,"you can only pick two:
thermals and margin -> reduce performance (set lower power limit)
thermals and performance -> reduce reliability (eg.","overclock/undervolt)
performance and margin -> good cooling required - you are here.","if you're going to try tuning voltages for better efficiency, i recommend reviewing https://skatterbencher.com/2021/11/04/alder-lake-overclocking-whats-new/#alder_lake_overclocking_ambient_expectations for what to expect.",load voltage (after vdroop) is what matters for heat/temps.,"this is the ""vcore"" value in hwinfo.","if your vcore is over about 1.3v, you're almost guaranteed to throttle without exquisite cooling.","the other thing is, alder lake's v-f curve doesn't have individual points past 48x.","above 48x are a few interpolated points, and at these points my chip requests insane voltages.",you may want to try capping to 4.8ghz to determine if it's just those points that are resulting in ridiculous temperatures.,core 6/7 are your fastest cores so windows will try to schedule work on those cpus preferentially.,the intel default voltage settings placed my cpu at some 1.33v at 4.8ghz on my board.,i was able to go >100mv below that.,the other thing i'd check is whether the vccsa is set at a reasonable voltage.,"my board ran this at 1.4v upon enabling xmp (from 0.9v), and a voltage that high is likely to cause early mc degradation... or heat up cores close to it.","with really fast memory, you might not be able to reduce it by much, but it's worth trying if only to slow degradation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can try lowering the core voltage.,"i'm running a stable -70mv and it lowered the all-core cinebench temps on my 12700k/nh-d15s from 81c avg / 88c peak to 72c avg / 77c peak, almost a clean 10c improvement without any loss of performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

im using the nh-d15s which is the same cooler but its offset a little for gpu and more space and only has one fan but preformance is almost the same even with the one fan.,i added a 120mm fan to the end.,which is the noctua nf-a12x25 (the best 120mm they do) that probably helps like 2 degree's.its a nice looking setup i even got the white covers for the cooler.,like i said my other cpu throttled on just one core which was core 7. my new cpu doesnt throttle anymore but it does hit 96c.,i used cinebench r23 for all my stress tests and even tried undervolting.,i ended up leaving it stock.,my score is always between 26900-27100 on multi-thread.,"i dont trust water cooling, had bad experience in the best... so i go with the best air setup on the market.",gaming with warzone which is probably the most cpu intensive game i can find... i hit like 69c max but average much less.,you will never throttle while gaming with this cooler or even get into the 90c bracket.,so thats why i just left it stock.,been gaming on it for like 4 weeks straight now.,no issues with temps.,im using mx4 2019 edition thermal paste which is the best on this chip.,its better than the noctua paste as this is a hotter chip and mx4 does like 2 degree's better on the higher ends.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

both linpack and y-cruncher don't run any slower with this than with a 3900 cl14 gear1 setup.,so at least in througput limited workloads it's viable.,probably not ideal for gaming since that's typically latency bound.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

now if only any ddr5 could be run at 4000 mhz c16 in gear 1â€¦.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

gear1 straight up doesn't seem to work with ddr5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

as mentioned any decent air cooler will do the job even something like the cooler master 212 evo if running at stock.,"as it is the k version, i would go for something a bit stronger as you can remove the limits and or run mce so that it boosts to it's max or even if you are happy to overclock (something like a 5ghz all core, though not required) then a decent cooler will be better.",something like a 240mm aio would be perfect or on the air side a noctua or be quiet...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"depends on your motherboard, unless you go with asus, you will be limited on what coolers support lga1700 out of the box.",i used the thermaltake toughair 510 for a bit while i was waiting on my artic mounting kit and it did a decent job.,nactua has the mounting kit as a separate item to buy but the cost is higher then the thermaltake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the stock cooler still throttles these cpus a lot, and also limited overclocking of the all core frequency up to the single core boost (4.8 ghz) should be supported on some motherboards (confirmation that asrock h / b series boards will).","a decent air cooler should suffice, or a 120-140mm aio, though if you have toom for one a 240mm would be plenty and overkill.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what are you using it for?,"if you're only gaming, the stock cooler will be sufficient - though a little loud.",i'd pair it with something like deepcool's as500 or noctua's nh-u12 redux.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thanks.,"though iâ€™m getting the non-k. so, i think i should go for a decent cooler like a 212. thanks regardless",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
alternatively a vetroo v5 is comporable in performance and may be cheaper depending on where you live.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no problems and yes just go for something like the 212 as it will be more than good enough for the non k versions..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 212 is overpriced and outclasses by many coolers around the price range.,it was a solid cooler for the price around 8 years ago.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the noctua u12s chromax is matte black and performs well, should be a good fit for your chip.","scythe fuma 2 is also good and cheaper, should outperform the noctua as well but it's larger",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the edge has an rgb dragon on it.,this is the most important difference.,the edge also has mildly better i/o.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

12400f is 100â‚¬ cheaper than the 5600x in germany.,weird how amd still haven't lowered the prices.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
unless amd prices some items down they literally will lose a lot of the budget gamers/productivity users.,which is 60% of most gamers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"at the moment, amd has expensive cpus and cheap mobos.",and intel has expensive mobos and cheap(er) cpus.,it all comes down to your budget and if it is an upgrade from a 3xx or 4xx am4 motherboard or a new system.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it was the same last gen tbh i bought 11400f and have no regrets especially at â£150 i paid.,ðÿ‘,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12th gen non k skus have lost their huge single core advantage and now linger just below ryzen 5xxx cpus.,"if you really want to have 12th gen advantage, buy 12600k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they can barely meet demand anyway, also there's tons of people in the am4 platform that would rather get the 5600x to not change the motherboard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no cheap motherboards yet though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why?,because amd forgot about budget buildiers with 5xxx series.,"like any other company, it's all about profits.","at the specific time, ryzen 5600x was the leader, it isn't anymore vs 12600k which is lower priced and has way better performance.","as a ryzen user myself, alder lake is looking good.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in uk 12400f can be had for 185 and ryzen 5 5600x for 235. according to hub 12400 is still slower than 5600x, and tags along with 11th gen parts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"amd didn't have any budget oriented choices all this gen.

budget, if anything, meant getting past gens.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is budget in that sense that you can jump from 1600/2600 to 5600 without changing your existing platform.,and for many people that enough.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, true, but for the same price at the moment intel seems to be better choise, it mighjt get more in amd favor if they slash 50-70$ off the price of 5600x/5800x.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they might be having chip shortage issues?,the 5600x was barely on sale in germany.,cheapest it was going was 249 for less than 2 weeks back in the summer 2021.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but even then due to shortages are overpriced,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not cheap but 5600g is at least priced about the same as 12400 and you can use on lower cost b450 / 550 boards.,we do need more sub $200 usd choices though on current gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"people who are on zen 1 or zen+ likely have 300 series boards, which amd artificially is blocking from upgrading to zen 3 because they are trying to force people to buy a new motherboard (to make more money).",if you read the amd sub you'll see people selling their 300 series boards and going to 12th gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ant one with those cpuâ€™s more than likely has a motherboard incompatible with zen3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is the plan as of now.,trying to find a 2600 at â£100 ish.,theyâ€™re going very high rn unfortunately.,same case with 3600 going upto â£160+,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wish.,since i had to rma my 5600x i am left stuck with a x570 board.,where i live a 5800x costs more than a 12700kf.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is there shortage in a cpu market?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
end even if you have b450 board it might be a better choice to just change the board entirely and go for something like 12600k which is comparable to 5600x in gaming as well as a being much better productivity cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
poor amd!,how dare they!,"i have haswell, how many times has the platform changed since then?",5x?,every year new socket for each pseudogeneration?,:),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's not artificially lol, they simply can't guarantee the performance and stability on such older motherboards, especially because board makers didn't bother making the first boards good and i really don't fault them.","amd at that point was being beaten to death for years and almost bankrupt, they just made some lazy boards and called it a day.","now compare the boards for 400 series and then 500 series, it's another level of quality and features.","am5 on the other hand will be amazing right out of the gate because now board makers respect ryzen and it's an established brand, and if it's supported for at least 3 generations it will be a huge win over the two and done from intel.",amd so far is claiming it to be supported for as long as am4 which is awesome.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"off, that sounds bad, i hope your case will be resolved soon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at least in england with anything that isnâ€™t a 5000 series.,yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think he meant older gens like the 3600 is selling for 250+,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"but then you'd have to spend much more money, intel boards are way more expensive than amd boards.","in fact, i suspect intel makes more money on the chipsets than cpus in the diy market, and it's just a tool to obfuscate the real price of the cpus.",what's the point of having an awesome 12600k for 300 bucks if the cheapest z690 boards cost double of an entry b550 or x570 and can barely run it without throttling lol?,"of course right now buying into am4 would be a terrible choice, but if you are already there it's not bad to buy an existing ryzen chip and call it a day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if by ""soon"" you mean ""never"" i agree.",this is the new normal and it sucks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 5000 series was also in shortage the first few months after release btw.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have to say i only checked zen3/ some intel stuff, there are no problems with those.","holy sht, 3600 is practically unavaible and it's so expensive it's better to get 5600g  or  11/12th gen i5",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's just ridiculous, especially when 5600g costs the same as 3600, i know it's not much faster than it's zen2 counterpart, but it has quite powerful gpu in it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s the discrepancy that i was talking about.,for a person at least in the ryzen space.,it is a sad state of affairs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"jup, 3600 used to be â‚¬140 bang for buck.",a 5600x will set you back like â‚¬299 here right now... 5800x was 299 on black friday but more expensive now.,amd doesn't really seem to offer budget options anymore currently.,it's a shame.,a 5600 non x for â‚¬190 would be killer.,they just don't have the wafer capacity to produce anything cheap on tsmc 7+,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thatâ€™s a little on the hot side.,i have mine on an aio and it stays in the 70â€™s when gaming.,i also donâ€™t overclock.,if i do the temps get into the 80â€™s.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i recently applied new thermal paste to my 9900k and temps hit 100c but it was due to poor contact on the heatsink.,you may want to try reseating your cooler.,that had fixed it for me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can use it at 100c the issue is your cpu thermal throttles.,get a bigger case with better airflow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would the noctua na-fd1 help?,is the cooler facing a vented area?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
turn off mutil core enhancement or turn down clock a bit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or try undervolting using the intel extreme utility trust me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it is safe, but you are going to be losing performance.",if you want to lower temperatures without changing the cooler you may undervolt or reduce the power limit.,for example if you put pl2 at 65w the cpu should be able to stay under 90c even on the stock intel cooler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for gaming that is a very high temp and i would not want to run that for any length of time and no doubt you are throttling.,i could not see what case you are using but can you let me know?,"if you have space for another fan, use it!","also if you can fit even a 120mm aio, i would go that route as it will make a difference.",finally you might want to consider de-lidding and using liquid metal tim.,i did that with my 8700k and dropped temps by near on 15 degrees c. it is not as difficult as one might think...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
need pic of your rig,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what motherboard are u using?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes that's a new game so its can be normal but its not safe to be a long time on 100 degrees but its ok you can still play on helo but something is can appnd,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i use a noctua l9s low profile cooler, the case is the only one i want apart from the phanteks evolv shift but that one choked my gpu instead",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is space for a fan inside the case would this make a difference?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the cooler is facing directly at a vented area the issue is is overheated like this even outside the case,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

z390i gaming strix,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
undervolting is your friend!,i undervolted my 10850k to 1.07v at 4.3ghz all core with max temps of the high 70s on blender using a noctua l9i.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depending on where itâ€™s located it may help reduce temps a little.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"probably, you can also undervolt it to decrease temps a bit without losing any performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think you'll need to undervolt.,i don't know much about it but i think it would help.,then maybe try add more fans and try the fd1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it does have downsides, it makes the system less stable.","but its honestly one of the least dangerous tweaks to do in a system, in the worst case scenario your pc crashes a few times until you figure out a safe value.","still, the gains, specially nowadays, aren't very impressive.",most of the time you will just reduce power consumption / heat / fan noise a little.,if you are power/temperature limited it might improve performance a bit as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"can i undervolt in the uefi i don't want to have to run third party software for that, and do i really lose no performance?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do i undervolt in the bios is there really no downsides at all?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
theres only space for a single fan in this case,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yes, the bios.","undervolting is more or less the same as overclocking, but instead of giving the processor more power to work with, you're making it work harder for less.","simplified, modern cpu/gpus are restricted by one thing: heat.","even before they reach the thermal limit, they will throttle down and reduce power usage in order to stay cooler, which causes reduced frequencies.","in other words, throtteling is your main problem.","with undervolting, you measure the maximum voltage the cpu/gpu draws under heavy load.","then you start reducing the voltage, ""forcing"" the processor to reduce its power/voltage consumption while maintaining *equal* or *higher* frequencies.","thus, you're not letting the processor reach its throttle limits,hence it can maintain higher frequencies for longer periods.","the result is often increased/similar performance, with high/moderate reduction of thermals (depending on many other factors).","frequencies are not the clue here, contrary to common beliefs, but consistency.","so, benchmark before and after to measure the true impact.",it is also better for your hardware.,"the reason it's not done at the factory, is because they cannot fine tune each and every chip, and each chip is potentially very different (a.k.a silicon lottery).","i don't know your setup, but i have a ghost s1 of 8 liters and thus i'm limited by airflow and cooler capabilities.","undervolting both the gpu and cpu, and fine tuning the fans for optimal airflow and timing, has gives me higher benchmarks and considerably lower thermals/fan noise.","you also have to be realistic with what you can aim for; if your case/airflow/cpu/gpu cooler is limited, your performance will be limited.","so for most people, reducing heat generation, not overclocking, leads to better performance overall.",edit: grammar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it would be very interesting to know if 12900ks or 5800x3d has more availability.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 5800x3d is kind of doa, its coming in ""spring 2022"", that's like 5 months away, by then we will probably have raptor lake performance leaks, since its supposed to launch in q3, and zen 4 in q4.","and if your on zen 1 or zen 2, its probably going to make more sense to buy a regular 5800x when it eventually goes on sale, rather than the premium priced 5800x3d.",i honestly dont think either of these chips will be good buys due to bad price to performance.,"like the 5800x3d will have a few percent better gaming performance than the 12700f, which costs $314, but the 5800x3d will lose badly in multithreaded performance and definitely cost a lot more.","the 12900k is also already a premium chip, despite being more cost efficient than the 5950x, so a binned 12900ks wont exactly be the best decision.",they are both more of halo products trying to get the performance crown than products people should really be buying.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

spring is mid of march not 5 months away.,secondly in gaming its going to compete against 12900k not 12700f,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"good summary, both chips are released so that each team can build their marketing on winning the dick measuring contest.",i donâ€˜t think either will be a good buy.,"i also donâ€˜t get the oem only for the 12900ks, this is an elite enthusiast chip.","that target group doesnâ€˜t buy pre-builds outside of high-end pre-build boutiques, no?",i donâ€˜t see those going into alienware pre-builds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

q2 ends at the end of june - as does actual literal spring in the northern hemisphere (june 21st is the solstice),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then when do you experience summer?,"summer starts around april 3rd week and stays till july, u can easily feel the heat.",spring is mostly in month of march.,check temps and not google to tell facts as sometimes it can tell wrong things.,go to any equatorial region country in june and then tell how are they experiencing 40â°c in spring.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i experience summer weather starting in early to mid may - you are right about when the season is actually happening.,"all i am saying is that the technical dates for the season are slightly different, and when a business says they are releasing a product in the spring, they mean q2 (4/1 - 6/31).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"why using 2 different way of saying, they could have just said q2 instead of spring and they announced it as 2h for ryzen 7000 and using february for first ryzen 6000 chip laptops instead of using q1.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all mce seems to do on 12th gen (for asus at least) is remove power limits.,at least i saw no other potential performance differences when testingâ€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"mce does different things on different boards, it is not a standardized feature.","unless you know exactly what it does on your board, leave it off and then manually adjust settings (power limits, cpu multipliers) if that is what you are after.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"on the msi z690 a pro, the only thing mce seems to do is to force the cpu to run at boost clocks when it doesn't need to",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"should it not be on ""auto""?",atleast mine is on an asus board.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hopefully my experience can help you.,i have a similar setting (12600k on a gbt z690 gamingx mobo) and played with mce a bit in the past few days.,"when mce is enabled in bios:

\- when running cinebench r23, all p-cores turbo to 4.9ghz (vs 4.5 when mce is auto), cpu power draw is 198w (vs 125w), cpu temp is 89â°c (vs 60â°c), and r23 m-core score improved by 6% at 18,598 (vs 17,540).",i have a noctua nh-u12a cooler.,"\- under normal workload (playing games / just browsing websites), cpu fans tend to spin-up more frequently.","i have an nf-f12 ippc 3000rpm cooling fan so can tell the differences in noise level

in all, the trade-off is 5-7% performance gain (depending on your tasks) vs. 50% higher power draw, 50% higher temp, and more noise (ymmv if you use a different cooling method).",i end up disabling mce as i find the trade-off not worthy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">is remove power limits

so in theory it should allow the p-cores to boost higher clock speeds as long as there is thermal headroom?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i see, thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hey appreciate the detailed comment thank you!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
from what i saw it eliminates the pl1/pl2 limits.,"which, for the 12900k, is 241w which is like taking the cpu from almost not coolable to completely uncoolable.","so far prime 95 small fets takes about 242w on my cpu and does cause it to thermally throttle, so elevating that limit isnâ€™t very useful.",probably more so on lower cpus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, it's meant for people with beefy cooling solutions.",250w for me is 80c peak with a 20c ambient,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i see, thanks for the insight

>probably more so on lower cpus.",do you mean mce should work better on lower-end cpus?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what cooling are you using?,elite capellix 150 and 90â° with similar wattage output,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends.,"if the cpu is hitting its maximum power limits while still being thermally manageable, then removing the limit would offer potential greater performance.",but thatâ€™s likely in benchmarks only vs actual real world computing situations.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if anyone ever searches for anything related to this: i fixed my spiking issue by changing a setting in the asus bios called svid from auto to best case scenario.,apparently while on auto it was oversupplying voltage to the cpu that it didn't need.,"ran cinebench23 for 2 hours and saw no crashes with temps peaking at 65 and no longer peaking high idle so looks good so far, results may vary per silicon lottery though.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"voltage goes down during load, and goes back up while idling at full clock",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i guess it's normal?,scary.,but anyone else had the same voltage spikes?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
voltage goes up and down based some factors.,"ghz is one, so stock 1 core boost 5ghz is higher voltage reading, all core 4.6ghz is lower.",avx2 and avx512 also give boost to voltage.,"you can check these things easily with cpu-z benchmarks, it has many benchmarks (17.01 , 19.01) also for avx2/512 and you get to set the thread count.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i did.,"17.01 is normal, but avx2/512 on multi thread is 1.356v, but on single thread 1.526v.",is it normal?,on cinebench r23 all cores work on 1.24.1.28v.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that sounds about right, 11th needs more voltage than 10th.","my all core avx512 has core vids of 1.35v too, but i've played around with avx guardband (avx undervolt) and also slight undervolt generally so only 1.27 vcore.","1.44 single vcore, vids 1.48v.",going over 1.5 is not a big deal on one core load.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i went from a 6700 to a 12700. this question really shouldn't need to be asked.,"forget the 1%s and stutters, which will of course drastically improve.",realize that just swapping that one piece in your system will completely change the functionality of your system completely.,night and day.,that's how big the leap will be.,the 6700 is ancient at this point.,"sure, i could have kept going with it a bit a longer but the fact is it can't handle any recent releases at acceptable performance.","in contrast, gpus have held on much better.",basically anything from a 970ti and up can still manage to power a 1080 system.,this year was basically the perfect time for people with 6/7/8 gens to upgrade.,enjoy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

optane still has the advantage of insanely fast random reads and writes (accessing a lot of smaller files).,no consumer ssd's can match it.,the big performance gains we've had in ssd's is in sequential speeds (reading and writing very big files).,"consumers would actually benefit significantly more from the random reads of optane than the sequential speeds ssd's have been offering, since stuff like running windows and playing games is all about accessing a ton of smaller files.","but it's taken intel a long time to bring prices down, so they had to exit the very price conscious consumer market.","in terms of it optane would be good for you, it depends.","if the videos your editing are like a couple hundred huge files, not at all.","but if you were like a tiktok creator that has thousands and thousands of shorter clips, yes it would, or if your compiling a lot of clips or images into a single video, it would be beneficial there too.",the biggest reason not to get optane in general is the price.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

does optane still exist in consumer space?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in my experience video editing does a lot of sequential reading, which any nvme ssd can do easily.","optane is mainly beneficial for lots of really small operations, especially when those reads can't be queued in parallel.","this makes it ideal for stuff like databases and os drives, but i still put my videos on flash and magnetic storage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to be honest, the only prosumer use i can see for optane (which i have tested for myself) is rendering that demands huge amounts of memory.","i have a small 25gb optane module, one of those you normally used to cache hdd.","it's not nearly as fast as a 900p or better, but the random reads and write durability is still way better than traditional ssd, even though the bandwidth is a measly 900 mb/s or something like that.",so i used it as a virtual memory.,"i ran a test on it by running a agisoft photoscan rendering, a photogrammetric rendering where the software pieces together a lot of 2d photograps into a 3d model.","it is extremely memory dependent, but i limited my system ram to 3gb or whatever the minimum amount was to have windows running, and put the rest of the workload on the optane as virtual memory.","the render filled up more than half of the optane, so the absolute major part of the workload got put on it.",but the rendering time was only ~10% longer than if i would have run it all on native 3200mhz ddr4.,"i also tested playing forza horizon 4 on it, and it was horrible.",a lot of heavy stuttering.,"smooth driving for 3 seconds, then 1-2 seconds of buffering time.",so it really isn't good for latency critical use.,"but for non latency critical use, like renders that aren't done in real time, it is amazing.","my dream setup would contain 128gb of ram, but also a 480gb optane 905p or a 4801x (a similar one, but slightly better.",i think i got the model name right) to make huge renders.,"it would also be an absolute beast setup to make machine learning predictions on the stock market, as it constantly have to read and write a lot of data if you're monitoring many stocks simultaneously.","although, since the newest optane drives are 4 years old or so, the bandwidth on them are kinda crap if you compare to normal premium pcie 4.0 ssd's.",i really hope they release a pcie 5.0 x16 version maxing out at 100+ gb/s.,even an x4 slot running at 32 gb/s would be a monster.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">i remember reading in a few places it was almost as fast as the then new ddr4 ram and could even be used in place of it in some cases

those are optane dimms for high end xeons.",they're very useful for when you need multiple tbs of ram for your database server.,optane nvme ssds are a different beast.,"the nvme interface makes them a lot less useful, and in raw bandwidth they're not much different than conventional ssds, mostly due to how nvme works.","as a result, they're mostly being phased out of the nvme market, although intel still has some enterprise products aimed at niches where the lower latency of optane matters more than bandwidth.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"afaik level1techs allready tested optane with 11th gen (pci-e 4.0) and zen3 and while it did run as expected on 11th gens pci-e 4.0 implementation, the zen3 systems could not support it - amds implementation seems to have issue.","it doesnt look like it would be a great idea to use workstation hardware with your zen3 system, compatibility might be the bigger issue as finding a right use-case for the constant high random i/o.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, unmatched endurance, high random throughput, low latency, peak performance even when the drive is full, no thermal throttling and no need for slc cache.",the faster your cpu cores the better you'll get out of optane random iops until the drive itself becomes the bottleneck.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
optane's write endurance makes a pretty compelling argument as a zfs slog device in nas machines.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"while optane is faster at random reads/writes, i haven't seen anything to say it would make a noticeable performance difference.",nand ssds are already so fast for everyday performance.,it's not the same as going from a hdd to nand ssd.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™ve been known to purchase items outside the consumer space.,i like the cutting edge stuff when it really makes a difference.,i just havenâ€™t kept up with optane in a few years so iâ€™m curious now if people who might have experience with it can give me a good answer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the price is absurd and totally not worth it, but random r/w is extremely high even on nvme.","i think it's probably underrated if you're building a $10-20k pc, but not worth it at all for us mere mortals.",always wished i could find a cheap one on ebay.,no luck there...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah it's kinda the same here.,the b660 tuf is right between the b660 prime and the z690 prime here.,i'm guessing the tuf would still be better unless the extra lanes is needed (or manual overclocking).,the z690 tuf jumps quite a bit in price.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i dunno if there's a way to directly set lower power limits like that.,"unless some bioses let you set custom values for pl1/pl2, i don't know.",maybe one way to do it indirectly would be to underclock and undervolt until you reach the sort of levels of maximum power draw that you're looking for.,"if you run a stress test with cpu-z or prime95, and check the maximum power usage on hwmonitor, then i doubt the cpu would draw any more than that during normal usage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the speed of ram on intel platform isnâ€™t as relevant as amd platform.,any performance likely will be so small as to be within testing margin of error.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what board do you have and what issue you dont like with it?,is it something that reviews/user feedback talked about?,ram compatibility with a new memory controller is allways something that might cause issues.,"qvl ram or better user-tested mainboard+ram-kit combos are the lowest bar i would consider for my own system to keep issues with pure incompatibility as low as possible, since unstable ram means unusable daily system.","bsod crashes are maybe just annoying for people that tolerate it, but data integrity on storage is at risc as soon as you ignore the issue and just continue without solving the hardware issue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what are you afraid to bottleneck?,the cpu will guanteed be bottlenecked by that gpu.,just as you would want it to be.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">but idk if the bottleneck will be too much

you'll never have problems by having ""too strong"" of a cpu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's honestly still nice, and the 980 ti is going to be even better",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is always a bottleneck.,having the bottleneck on the cpu leaves plenty of room for upgrade later by just switching the gpu out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 with a 3060",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't know if it's just me or is op actually asking if the i5 would bottleneck a future-gpu upgrade and not the current 980ti?,"if that's the case, it's funny to see everyone missing the point here ...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what do you mean?,the cpu not getting pinned is a good thing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is not a good or bad thing.,op asked 'will there be bottleneck between cpu-gpu?,"if yes, how bad?'",and i answered the question and the possible bottleneck.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
take your time and bend it back.,it will be fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i will give the toothpick a thumbs up inuse a placket to both fix the leak and the pga it's able to get under the intel press springs or whatever you want to call them and will have some tendency to bend before damaging the spring as  for the amd it's just the right width to just start at a good point on a row and slide it towards the bent pins and then do it from the other direction as many time as it takes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
happend for me also.,"i was told by the store i bought it at, that they could send it to asus for a repair but it would cost 100 $.",so i paid for that and after 2-3 weeks i got it back fixed like a new board.,"&#x200b;

so ask the store if they can send it to repairs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the first time i bent a few pins like this i used a flathead screw driver to unbend it.,it worked but i wouldnâ€™t recommend anyone do it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"see if you can find a local repair electronic shop, since they may have tweezers small enough that can fix this situation.",.,"i was in the same position, but i was lucky enough msi service center was around my area, and within a week i was able to get a replacement.",ofcourse because of the warranty.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i had a similar issue used a kids magnifying glass and a sewing needle.,make sure you have your coffee before hand so your not too shaky.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
am i crazy?,i'd be spending hours bending that thing back.,probably would only take a few minutes though with a toothpick.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

how did u bend the pin?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this pin is vgt   
voltage rail for igpu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just a quick note on the tweezers.,i also have had a bent pin.,i have a pair of tweezerman tweezers from target.,they work great at bending pins back.,get a magnifying glass too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"use ur mobile camera to zoom in on the bent pin, use a pin or needle to unbent it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if that board is still under asus warranty just rma it.,i bent some pins on an apex xii board and did an rma and they swapped it out with a new one and it just cost me shipping to them.,that $100 dollar fee is bs.,took 4 weeks to get the new one though.,just don't state you bent the pin.,just say the system won't boot into windows,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this.,weâ€™ve all been there.,if you have any weird behaviour afterwards double check again.,i had a bent pin give me black screen issues once,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i did it the same thing.,used tweezers to very very gently put back close as i could.,system has been good for months.,to be clear i just used half the pincher tip to move the pin and didn't actually tweeze anything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

>good news: both are heavily redundant (there are loads of each of those pins) and should function normally.,"man, you would not believe how much time and effort we put into power delivery.","any drop in voltage, and everything in that area slows down.",it's a dang nightmare to design.,"but you're right, we do over-design for normal usage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this guy knows how to fix ""oopsies"".",just insert the pin into the nib part of the pencil and slowly bend it back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i donâ€™t think that trick will work on these type of pins.,theyâ€™re sort of z shaped.,theyâ€™re pretty tricky to bend back into position.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no that is for pga cpus not lga sockets,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you're an intel engineer?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks.,will remember for when this happens to me eventually,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they are more likely to spring back into position if he corrects its orientation.,you can bend it up so it pressures against the cpu again but remember not to over do it or those leaf spring like contacts will just snap off as your correcting it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wonderful,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what upscaling tool do you use?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
better a snapped pin than one that contacts the pin next to it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

probably almost all versions of the u series chips will have fanless models being it is a 9w-29w power envelope.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"off topic but msiâ€™s insistence on using mag/mpg/meg for their mobo branding is still infuriatingâ€¦ i think i have a mpg b550i gaming edge itx board in my mini pc, but because the font is so stylized itâ€™s hard to know when it comes time to update the bios.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
anyone know when the  b660 mortar is going to be available for sale?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there are b660 motherboards available on newegg now... but only gigabyte models,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can't overclock cpu with non z motherboards.,can overclock ram.,"these days you don't get much gains in performance from overclocking cpu but you get like 1,5x as high temps.","amd much better on that point, can play around with cpu even on non x motherboards.",vrm wise the b660 msi mortar models can handle 12700k easily.,12900k should be fine too but you should have some fans to cool the case down.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it will be able to handle a 12700k (hardware unboxed showed it handing a 12900k pretty well), however you will need a z690 to overclock.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just write it down somewhere.,i keep a spec sheet of all of my machines for the express purpose of not having to remember all of those little numbers and names come upgrade/replacement time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's more of a niche size, and with how covid has messed up component supply and shipping, companies don't want to spend millions on itx right now.","every itx board that is made, is components taken away from atx.",and the diy market is probably like 99% standard atx,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"got it, thank you.",is there any benefit of having a 12700k over a 12700 in a b660 tho?,like will it auto boost to a higher clock or no?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes you certainly do lol you dont own a 12900k and it shows.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i see.,is there a benefit still to have a 12700k over a 12700 in the b660?,like is there still a slight auto boost i will get by having the 12700k model?,the 12700k is $350 at microcenter so i figured i might as well just get that one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itll have slightly higher boost floor and ceiling.,"performance itself in numbers should probably be at most 5, very rare scenarios up to 10.

there's some videos that will show difference.",so in the end it'll depend on the price.,i've seen 12700k be on sale to similar price as the 12700 atm and in that case might as well go with the k one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hardware unboxed did a video comparing the cpus if your curious about specific benchmarking, but the short of it is the 12700k is technically clocked higher at stock, but in the real world you'll almost never see any difference (like at most 5%).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cool.,that was what i was thinking too.,12700k is $350 at microcenter and also has an additional $20 off if i buy a motherboard too so i was thinking i might as well do that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes 11th gen can't be undervolted using throttlestop.,try xtu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in my case, i had to install the oem's undervolting software (omen gaming hub -> undervolt tab -> install / update).","once i had followed instructions there, undervolting was enabled in throttlestop",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the problem is not with 11th gen cpu, the issue is with windows 11, and in a new pc it will come by default hence no simple way of going back as well.",the latest throttle stop beta allows you to use it along with windows 11 but i personally don't recommend using a beta version.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can definitely undervolt them.,"itâ€™s just that laptop cpus are already undervolted by a lot and you donâ€™t have a k series chip, so youâ€™re probably not gonna get far doing it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i see opposite behaviour on asus tuf f17 with 11400h, voltage offset is locked in xtu but not in throttlestop.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the omen gaming hub undervolt service also relies on the installed xtu.,may i know what is your xtu version?,i'm asking because in my machine this undervolt tab is not working :(,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
absolute codswallop.,i managed to get -180mv off my i7-8750h which meant it would hold 3.6ghz instead of 3.1ghz all core load.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not sure how to check really.,"my xtuservice says file version 7.5.3.3 through task manager, open file properties.",did you ever get undervolt working at all?,i also had an issue wheee i put a bad undervolt and undervolting stopped functioning completely until i ran repair on omen gaming hub.,"if not, try seeing if thereâ€™s an updated omen gaming hub in the windows store.",i think that could be the solution.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"out of those you listed i recommend the tomahawk as itâ€™s only 20 more than the pro a, you could also take a look at the asus tuf",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just built a 12700k rig with asus strix z690a ddr4.,couldnâ€™t be happier.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the msi one is the best buy.,if you care about overclocking you might want to look at an aorus one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
msi all the way.,memory try it is pretty awesome if you get your hands on a decent pair of ddr4s.,doesn't super tune your sticks but gets you pretty close to perfection with just 2 clicks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

is it for gaming?,"if so, why not to get 12400(f)?",this way you can save ~180$ and actually buy 3060ti or maybe?,3070.,12400 vs 12700k is ~5-10% difference.,while 3060 vs 3060ti is ~20-25%.,just my thought.,"and yes, all 2060+ and all 3050+ have dlss/rtx.",edit.,i'm dumb and didn't noticed that you want to stream and video editing too.,"well, 3060 might do it then, since 12700k is way better in production tasks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 3060 is not a great card, more like an adequate card.","i am guessing you would do the designing and editing with the video card, so i would recommend getting the 3060 ti and downgrade the cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you could try moving to a 12700 or 12600k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12700f and b660 is the move right now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 12700f would be the solution.,"saves op $100 ($314 msrp, $329 at newegg), performs the same as the 12700k, but without overclocking (little to gain) and no igp.",so op wouldnt really have to sacrifice anything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™ll go a step further: the 3060 is a painfully mediocre card which, while technically the best option in its price range, beats the 2060 by maybe 20%, and there were numerous cards out already which were ~10% better as options than the 2060 at msrp.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the locked i7-12700 is by far the best performance-per-dollar in the alder lake lineup, imo.",iâ€™d urge you to consider it.,"you really canâ€™t go wrong in any case, though.",there are so many good chips in this lineup.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"makes little sense to go for a 12900k unless you're chasing every extra fps you can get, [at 1080p on average the 12700(f) is within roughly 3% of the 12900k(f)](https://youtu.be/ydgn4w97esk?t=1152), at 1440p/4k it likely won't matter at all.","although, in the us the 12700 seems to be unavailable, the 12700f seems to only be available from newegg atm for $330.",an extra $259 for ~3% extra performance at 1080p seems a bit nonsensical.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have the 12700k and for gaming it is more than good enough.,"great for gaming and good on the production workloads, also it overclocks extremely well.",the 12900k is a beast but it is only fractionally better on the gaming front and uses a lot more power and will require good cooling.,you can't go wrong with either but with the 12700k you save the money and then spend the savings on a better motherboard or towards the gpu/ram etc...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don't bother with the i9 if you're just going to be gaming.,"the extra 4 e cores won't make a lick of a difference for most games, especially not for the additional cost.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i reckon 12700f, overclocking abilities are overrated and just suck too much power

youâ€™d be better of with an f processor and a b series board.","with all the money you save you can get a better gpu, psu and storage which are much more important for longevity",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"12700k is a great buy for any gamer and insanely overkill at that, my 11700k is doing fine with my assorted 1440p gaming.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it just isnâ€™t worth it because spending $300 more for 3-4% more performance isnâ€™t worth it.,"if you still have money to spend, spend that on the gpu not cpu.",for instance buying a asus strix over asus tuf would be more worth it than a 12900k over 12700k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12700k is better bang for your buck.,the 4 additional efficiency cores arent worth it.,if you need high core count above all else then you'd be better off with an amd threadripper.,"if you don't, then the 12700k is the sweet spot.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"nzxt builds in the past used to be kind of overpriced in some cases, i haven't dug much into them lately, but they're usually reasonably put together.",i mean don't expect much airflow in that case either.,"the i5-12400 is give or take better/worse than the 5600x, but the i5-12400 tends to be lower power.",if the i5-12400 was cheaper than i'd definitely go with that instead.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
better than the airflow than the pavillion at least.,"also seems like the 12400f and 5600x are about the same, don't know the prices tho.","also, the 3070 5600x build is pretty reasonably priced compared to a lot of other prebuilt imo, i was finding some with the same specs for like 2k instead of 1.7.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's possible igor owns a really bad 12600k and an above average 12700k that requires less voltage.,"in one of anandtech's cpu reviews, their 8700k used 30% more power than their 8086k did, and both cpus had the same architecture and all-core 4.3ghz boost.",don't read too much into the wattage imo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
having less cores can lower idle power usage.,but remember having more cores in a workload means you can get more efficient performance if the workload supports the extra cores.,"as an example, running 8 cores at 3 ghz is more power efficient than running 6 cores at 4 ghz because of how the power to frequency graph curve is shaped.","[https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3a%2f%2fwww.servethehome.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2021%2f08%2fhc33-intel-alder-lake-p-and-e-core-efficiency.jpg&f=1&nofb=1](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3a%2f%2fwww.servethehome.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2021%2f08%2fhc33-intel-alder-lake-p-and-e-core-efficiency.jpg&f=1&nofb=1)

in general, the power to performance curves plateau and it requires more and more power to continue increasing the core's frequency.","so in order to keep up with the 12700k in a workload that can use all the cores, the 12600k would have to run less efficiently at a higher frequency.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that the 12700k might use less energy than 12600k might be possible when fps is limited, for whatever reason, be it a fixed cap, or a gpu limit.","in igor's test, fps do not seem limited, but results are extremely close to each other, with almost no difference depending on cpu, suggesting another limit, typically gpu.","in such scenario, the 12700k may just achieve the same job as 12600k in less time, thus saving energy during sleep time.","this is not too far fetched, i would actually expect so, though i would not expect a ""large"" difference (which is also consistent with igor's measurements).","i also agree that customized parameters (undervolting, turbo limits, etc.)",would make a higher difference.,"but the key point here is ""same workload"".","in an unbounded scenario, if a more powerful 12700k generates more fps, hence deliver more, it's not longer directly comparable to 12600k workload.","and in such cases, i would expect 12700k to consume more too.","i presume most reviews use low-graphics settings to artificially highlight differences between cpus, thus ending in the second scenario.","but for some reason, igor's comparison doesn't feature such workload difference, all cpus featuring roughly the same fps.","which, btw, also hints that no one really needs a very high end cpu to game.",but that's a different topic.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"human error, and he switched the test results?","alternatively, the faster processor could have had an issue w thermal paste and be badly cooled.","running hot, it would have refused to turbo boost, so use less power?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
binning perhaps?,the 12700k he used might be a better binned part than his 12600k.,"better binned parts require less voltage, thus the power consumption is also reduced.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've noticed my 12700k sips power in idle/low(streaming video)/mixed(gaming) load uses.,"i recall a few other tests where low load and mixed load for the i7 and i5 were very similar, it may have to do with additional e-cores mixed with silicon lottery, or just a fluke.",the hybrid architecture is new for intel so we may see odd situations pop up like this while the technology is developed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"it's possible that on the 12700k it is running more p-cores at lower clock speeds, which is much more efficient.",the 12600k with fewer p-cores may be more likely to ramp to higher frequencies which consumes exponentially more power.,"or, having fewer p-cores means the workload is more likely to spill over to e-cores.",the e-cores are less energy efficient... you can see this in plenty of reviews.,hence higher power draw.,"(they are ""efficient"" in using less die space, not energy).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

>typically on intel every 20c temperature difference reduces power consumption by 15%.,this is absolute nonsense.,the rule of thumb you're thinking of is that static power in a semiconductor is halved every 10c (not 20c).,however the fraction of power consumption that is static is usually small (especially for finfets) and varies dramatically (by orders of magnitude) between different cpus and between different process nodes.,on intel 14 nn it was incredibly low.,haven't seen numbers for intel 7/10.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"one if them on the top is in and last one is out, it actually works.",the front 3 are really bad at bringing in air.,i have also tried with case completely open doesn't really help much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wow thanks for the information i will try that and get back to you.,also for the record i managed to reduce my idle temps to 40c mids after closing a rouge process running in my task manager but while gaming i am still getting around 77c to 80c while my mate with the same cpu 11700k and coolermaster 212 evo gets not more than 60c to 62c max.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tried everything already not much of a difference in temps.,complete open bench and so on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how?,by staying restore default settings?,i have already done that and i have also updated my bios.,no solution yet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
those are exceptionally good temps if you ask me.,i am not sure how you managed to get it so low.,after a lot of optimisation i managed to get the temps as low as 43c idle there is not much i can do to lower it more my ambient is around 25c.,"i am starting to think, one of the things i own is defective.","could be the cooler , the mobo or the whole pc itself.",after a long hunt managed to grab this prebuilt it turns out it was the last piece excaliburpc.,"my gpu also runs hot, hitting 77c the case is bad but removing all the vents give me around the same temps 3c less maybe.",mostly motherboard.,as much i know fuma 2 is a pretty good cooler i would be happy if it even gave me 65c while gaming.,"remounting and pasting it, done it like 4 times in the last 2 months no change what so ever.","can you tell me, while mouting the fuma 2 did you place those plastic thingys with the rubbery end towards the board, against it or the other way round.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah those temps are perfectly acceptable.,"the idle temps might be a tad high, but the load temps are what really matter here and those are totally fine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"all those temps are safe, but not ones i'd expect.","i got nh-d15 with 11700k (stock), and as i'm typing this cpu package temp is 30-35 celsius with 35~ watts.",you might have more bloat software installed.,fuma 2 shouldn't be that much worse with temps.,how much is your cpu package power when you are at 41-45 celsius?,mine idles at 20 watts.,also i currently have only one fan on cpu @700rpm.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is the first really in?,"i see the orientation to take air out, but you should know better than me, you see it and feel it live.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i loaded my intel tuner to the same page you have up.,when you hover over the (i) it tells you what the default settings are.,i have everything on default except for the thermal velocity boost 'enabled' and my multipliers.,"my reference clock is 100mhz, yours says 102.3 not sure if that's default for your cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">5\~ watts

around 26w i get 41c is that weird?",or do my ambient temps seem to be just on the more side?,i am assuming inside my house it's like 29c to 30c.,i live in uganda.,but the temps keeps jumping between 40c to 60c like randomly jumping.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am getting around 65c at 125w tdp is that ok. if you don't mind can you give me your temps?,i want to compare the results and turns out the ambient temps are about 28c so 40 makes sense right?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hey you are right, actually it turns out a picture i took while i was trying different variations of in and out.",the most suitable one turns out to be the 1st fan in and 2nd fan out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"true actually, i tired to set it to 100mhz but no difference yet.",will try to set it up again.,"it was always 102.3, i am not sure if my mobo is doing that by default.",my is pl1 288w and pl2 is 288w i tried changing it to boxed cooler i.e pl1 125w and pl2 250w but haven't got any change in my thermals.,still the same.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yea i did the same with it, but there is no way i am getting less than 40c ambient temps not sure what the issue is",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"your high ambient definitely explains a lot of it, but 20 degrees jumping doesn't seem normal unless something is using the cpu.",my ambient is only 23 c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> i am getting around 65c at 125w tdp is that ok

that is ok.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wish i could help more.,all i can say is try running your fans at full speed and see if thereâ€™s a drop in temp.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah, but tell us about the discount you got.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how much was the cpu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice.,you should be fine fore a long time.,"i undervolt my 3070 to help keep temps, and noise down.","not that it runs too hot, or loud, but it helps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"from my 2970wx, it's a huge upgrade.",not in terms of maximum throughput because a 24 core cpu will always win for that but for everything else it is.,"ipc and frequency are much higher for single, few, and all core workloads and latency is much lower.",unlike the 2970wx which could only maintain a stable ddr4 memory frequency of 3200 mt/s the 12700k can hold the kit's full rated speed of 3600 mt/s without having to loosen timings.,that said there is a thermal tradeoff to be made with that but my 280mm aio seems to be able to cool it decently enough.,"for gaming the 12700k provides a huge uplift and for productivity workloads, in practice, it's also better.",there are very few workloads where core count alone trumps everything else and the upgrade to the core i7-12700k proved that out for me.,even my software development tools run much smoother on both windows and manjaro linux and somehow i've noticed shorter compile times for the same codebases.,overall its a gnarly cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i always had the feeling that for intels motherboards the engineers put more thought into it.,"let it be the pcb layers, layout, peripherals and bios.",i just love the way they are put together.,furthermore you have the ssd/nvme drives from intel and of course the cpus (and very soon the gpus).,it is worth mentioning that you don't have to work your way through an endless list of ram compatibility for your cpu (amd).,intel just gives you one max two ddr speeds with which the cpus work.,"if you'd like to go faster, there is xmp 2.0.

when i built my pc everything just snapped together without any struggle or hinderance.",sadly when i tried the same with an amd ryzen 2700x with motherboard and ram the first problem was: which cpu and ram set are compatible?,does the motherboard support the ram specs?,the motherboards pcb felt much thinner and less peripherals.,"if you don't know that, like i did, your experience building an amd pc is terrible.",with intel it just works.,my next pc build will be intel only.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the r23 score was 24,075 for multi and 1987 for single.",still a way to go as i have seen better!,"as to the aio, i have the corsair h150i elite lcd and the case is the lian li lancool ii mesh...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you too, install that bad boy asap!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no problem, i'm glad you didn't get butt damaged over an opinion lol.","for real, though, there is a disturbing amount of misleading hype out there, especially among the techtuber community.",even the ones with a great deal of integrity like gamers nexus can inadvertantly skew public opinion on products.,"i mean, i love the hit piece on the 11900k, calling it a ""waste of sand"", but it's a really damn good cpu.",i had a little battle with my bro who just got a 5950x with a 360mm aio h150i and i still beat him by 15% on cbr23 core for core and i'm on air cooling.,"not a land slide victory by any stretch and of course i get my shit pushed in on multi-core, but for gaming, it's still a win.",and thats what i mostly do.,"in all honesty, once you start messing with the i7/r7 going higher starts to become overkill anyways.",only recommended if you want future proofing or if you like to tinker.,"my ex used to get mad at me for how much tinkering i do with muh rig lol ""you work on that thing more than you actually use it!""",the bitch.,i miss her.,what?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

bulldozer/piledriver and the fx series were amd's netburst and the first bulldozer releases in 2011 weren't any better than previous generation k10  phenoms and way behind intel's sandy bridge.,i don't think amd will make that mistake with zen4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i agree,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm it tech for almost 8y i test hundred of little squares.,i can tell you wut i prefer despite wuts better.,i know ryzen zen3 was better than intel but i still keep on blue team after all and i don't regret.,intel has better support behinds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
agree if money is a problem then go amd.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
amd is switching to a new socket for zen 4 and will not be backwards compatible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"technically, intel has been using the same socket for 4 years as well for 6th gen until 9th gen. the comparison you want to make is chipset support.","anyway, by 4 years old i assume you meant the first gen board?","well tough luck, x370 and b350 does not support ryzen 5000 even thought they are basically similar to x470 and b450.",while inferior a320 get 5000 series support for some odd reason.,so stop being a blind sheep spreading lies.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wym, the igpu is really good.",for intel uhd graphics that is.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"b660 here is 15k yen = 13.6k yen pretax = $118, so im sure there are gonna be cheapish boards in europe as well",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sorry for misunderstanding but you said the igpu is not good as if its a negative to not get it.,last i checked any processor worth its salt from amd doesnt have any igpu at all.,how can you use the fact that it has a igpu as a negative?,"really who cares you say mobo prices are higher, well lemme tell you buying a gpu right now is way more expensive than the difference in price of a z690 motherboard.",shit you can get a z690 on amazon for 180$ is that really breaking the bank?,i dont think ive ever payed less than 250 on any board in the past 15 years for amd or intel.,you get what you pay for.,if you arent ever going to overclock or buy the top end of the cpu line then go for the cheap no frills boards.,plus the cheap line of boards are dropping in the next month or two so price is irrelevant unless you need a pc built this second.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wouldn't mind the higher intel mobo prices if the company supported more than 2 generations on one socket.,"but as you've seen, amd extracted the margins elsewhere from their customers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
from the i3 to the i7?,hell yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"depending on mobo, z690 mobos are not cheap, easily more expensive than 12700k, even 12900k.",every strix out there is more expensive than 12700k or the same price.,for sure i don't want a bend pin on my apex.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"me too accidentally bent pins on my motherboard once :-( 

but fixing cpu pins are relatively much easier compared to motherboard",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel mobos with an exception for z690 chipsets (they cost a bloody leg) are actually as cheap if not cheaper than amd offerings here in australia.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes and power consumption doesn't matter to me much as long as it's not a headache to cool the chip down and delivers the performance i want out of it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">consumes more power

only in very specific scenarios, of which gaming is not one of those.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a rtx 3070. the igpu is just a backup.,you know the gpu market rn and if in an unfortunate event my gpu needs to go for rma i would want my pc to still run with a display.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah exactly.. i'm glad i waited for intel and didn't get a 5900x before the alder lake launch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not too be that guy but as a system builder who has a personal ryzen gaming build, i don't have issues.","intel is a great choice though, just clarifying none of my friends and family have any issues with their builds either.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"alder lake has some rough edges, zen 3 is well ironed out right now.",the only area where intel will definitely offer a more polished experience is with vr headsets which violate the written standard for xhci (which is an intel protocol).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what issues?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah motherboard's pins can be a nightmare if bent but i believe there's a more risk of processor slipping out of hand and pins bending than something falling into the covered socket of motherboard.,"so, its like choosing the cheaper mistake out of two lol.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how are they easy to bend?,if you have never installed a cpu before and try to shove it in sideways or upside down maybe.,every time i see a bad board on ebay i just wonder the story behind it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i've heard about that as well.,i would do try that too once my build is complete.,thanks for sharing that :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
damn!,now i'm more excited for my build lol.,my build should be ready by february i hope it will be worth the wait.,also thanks for explaining all of that :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is complete fud.,"both brands are very plug and play, period.","also, regarding mobo pcb thickness, from your description you bought a bargain bin b320... pcb layering has more to do with sku price class than maker or cpu manufacturer.","it's this type of willful ignorance and blatant misinformation that causes red and blue team ""wars"" where the only loser is the consumer.","also, saying from the get go ""my pc will be all intel"" while you're in your right, it's your money, it's profoundly stupid.",there aren't even reviews or accurate performance details for arc.,this embarrassing level of fanboyism attached to a religious like ignorance is what kills the market for the rest of us... just sad!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this explains a lot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh that's a good score.,i'll be using lian li galahad 240 and case will be lian li air mini.,would love to see pics of your build if you post them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

intel cs is great imo.,i have a 10900kf with heating issues.,"one representative called me, i explained my build and issues.","we chatted for a bit, tried helping troubleshoot the issues over the phone.","it helped, however my temps started getting wacky again.","contacted intel, started another support ticket, now theyâ€™re sending my a new 10900kf :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you living under a rock?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hopefully.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sat on a 7700k until 10900k, and now ill probably upgrade to 14900k or whatever.",don't understand why people need to upgrade every year.,the best upgrade you will get this day and age is a gpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the accident or the price?,"when trying to put the cpu socket cover back on a board, i thought the plastic cover went underneath the socket bracket.",rip my pins.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™ve fixed numerous amd cpus with bent pins over the years.,but the one time i fixed an intel motherboard with bent pins was an absolute nightmare.,although going forward that wonâ€™t be a problem since am5 is supposed to have pins on the motherboard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have never once bent a mobo pin and it boggles my mind how anyone manages to do so.,"like, i've seen boards on ebay with bent pins and it usually looks like someone tried to shove the cpu in sideways like how?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yea i tried and couldn't fix the pins, neither could asus so i told them to scrap it and no refund cos my fault.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"seriously lol, i have no idea why people keep bringing up power draw of intel cpus as a con when in gaming scenarios it frequently uses less power than the 5900x.. just check any benchmark on youtube.","95% or more of people buy the 12700k to play games, not benchmark on crazy ocs",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
usb issues still are plaguing some people despite being 'fixed'.,every other day on the amd help forums people are trying to figure out why they have usb dropouts or high latency.,"its better than it was before, but its definitely still an issue for like 5% of people",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ohh nice.. very nice build!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh nicee... i'll be getting a galahad 240 as i've seen it competing with 360 rads pretty well.,i believe custom loops performance better than aios so idk how better r23 score i'll get within good temps.,which case are you using though?,i'll be getting either a lian li air mini or o11 d evo (galahad 360 for that).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

different experience for me.,i had stability issues and motherboard issues and memory clocking issues on ryzen 2000 series with b450 motherboard.,why are you here on intel sub trolling for amd if you are not an intel user?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your kidding right?,lol ive built a amd and intel pc every generation for the past 15 years.,ive never had a stable system on any amd cpu.,maybe what you consider stable is what you are used to with computers.,"but blue screens, programs not responding, slow performance, programs not opening when you click on them.","random program closes are all normal things that happen on amd platforms, im not saying intel hasnt ever had any issues like this but they get resolved in quick updates and do not last long where amd pretty much is what it is.","i litterally skipped ryzen 5000 because im at ends with amd because the the amount of hours ive spent trying to track down all the gremlins its time ill never get back, but im just a guy that does this because i enjoy working on my own computers and from  my experience intel is just flat out better and you can expect it to just work.",also id like to add i have several friends that are amd fans and they praise it like its something holy which ill never understand but i can say the only friends that do this litterally have never had a intel system.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was able to get my rtx 3080 fe for msrp.,it was most exciting thing happened to me in 2021 lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m using a msi gungnir 100. nothing special but i can fit a 360 rad on top and up to 420 on the front.,from what i hear 360 rads are what you want.,you really canâ€™t get a 240 rad to compete with a 360 though.,a thicker rad with net you a couple degrees lower than a thin rad but itâ€™s not much.,just make sure itâ€™s a copper core it conducts heat the best.,my max temp is 75c on r23 in games iâ€™m in the mid 40â€™s for both cpu and gpu and this is with low cfm fans not designed for static pressure running at 1000rpms lol 5.1 p cores 4.0 e cores and 43 ring,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just make sure you get a lga 1700 back plate with the cooler so you have correct mounting pressure or you could have core temps all over the place.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"as i said, iâ€™ve been in amd since bulldozer, started with the fx6300, then upgraded to ryzen with an r5 1500x, and now currently using an r5 3600 (with the last two cpus being on the same b350 mobo iâ€™ve had since 2017)

other than the teething issues that came with 1st gen ryzen and memory support, iâ€™ve had no issues with any of these cpus whatsoever",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wow and well done, that is an amazing gpu at msrp in fact probably one for the best gpu's ever launched at that price.",the performance is just immense and i love my 3080 and will not part with it at all...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well if i remember correctly gamers nexus benchmarks for galahad aios showed galahad 240 competing with arctic liquid freezer ii 360 under noise normalized benchmark and even beating it (marginally) at 100 percent fan speed.,the cpu was running at 200 tdp.,correct me if my calculations are wrong about galahad 240 but i believe with a good air flow cabinet it should be very good for 12700k.,"also, i would've gone for a 360 but lian li air mini sadly cant fit a 360 in it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes yes i'll do that for sure.,thanks for reminder though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just look at your post history you use amd parts.,why are you here to troll and spread misinformation?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"consider yourself lucky  i had problems with my 1700, 2700x and 3700x.","swapped motherboards, ram, cpus, ssd's, fresh windows and nothing got these system stable.",did memory checks with no faults and still problems persist.,im not saying it was a every time i used my pc's they would mess up but there isnt a week that goes by where i dont have atleast a couple issues here and there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah tbh i wasn't able to sleep out of excitement when i realized that i actually got a rtx 3070 fe at msrp lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
both have different fan setups and pumps so itâ€™s possible in the aio space to have situations where a smaller rad keeps up.,iâ€™ve been custom liquid cooling for 15 years and tested dozens of rads and can say size and thickness and quality in fans will have all the impact.,higher flow pumps help your rad keep temps regulated better too.,for aioâ€™s itâ€™s probably accurate what you saw but iâ€™m fairly sure if you took like for like fans and put both in a push pull configuration the artic will do much better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just looked up the review you mentioned, the artic cooled was the best performer, they also used a 360 and a 240 galahad.",the 360 galahad was .2c warmer than the artic and the 240 was 5c warmer.,5c could be the difference of hitting a higher clock but if hitting max clocks isnâ€™t something you care about then iâ€™d say the 240 will do.,"gn also mentioned there is pump whine on the galahad so thatâ€™s something to keep in mind too, they mentioned turning the pump down does help keep the whine down but thatâ€™ll sacrifice performance.",edit i guess i needed to watch the entire video lol stock for stock when fans are at 100% the 360 galahad takes the lead.,pretty much can say itâ€™s because of the quality of fans based off the video because they spin 2500rpms faster on the galahad.,artic works better at lower speeds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's best to know information of both sides to make sure you're getting the best parts.,who cares about amd vs intel.,it's about what ends up working better.,it's all about being on the side with best performance.,and how are you supposed to know which is better without looking at both sides?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the subreddit isnt solely for intel users, it's for everyone.","i might be on zen 3 personally, but i'm still interested in what's going on in the hardware space and i've been watching to see how alder lake pans out long term.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes i've heard about the whine but since i had to decide a 240mm cooler (because of case support) i choose galahad 240 keeping that in mind.,but what you're saying makes sense.,i might wait for o11 evo and go for arctic 360 in that case because i mean if i have a 12700k why not use it's full potential lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i agree about overclocking.,b660 allows memory tuning so just buy that with either 12400/12500(full igpu and more boost for $10 more)/12700 locked chips.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
id recommend the 12700f at $314 though over the 12700k at $420.,"you lose the igp and cpu overclocking, but save $100, and as mentioned overclocking isnt that big of a deal anymore.",and the 12700f is only like $30 more than the 12600kf.,"while having the full 8 performance cores+ 4 e-cores, e-cores clocked higher, more cache, higher pl2, and better memory handling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes the cpu's are compatible.,typically cpu's and gpu's do not have compatibility issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what made you think they wouldn't be compatible?,"funny enough now i remembered early athlon's not working well with nvidia cards back in the day, in like 1999/2000.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,compatible.,where'd you get an rx 580?,i had a bunch of them sold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes 100%, you can pair even with a vega 56 and still works",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"good question there.... are there any cpus that won't work with a standard gpu that are made today....

i think the only type of cpus that wouldn't work are arm cpus?",not even sure about that lol but i'd assume they wouldn't work out of the box with a standard gpu they'd have to have some type of translator in between for the instruction set.,that's just an assumption as i truly don't know.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i didnâ€™t they just look cheap and the specs are good enough,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if the cpu supports pcie and the gpu has drivers for the operating system in question there is no reason why cpu and gpu would not work together.,if you have some weird obscure cpu the problem will likely be that the os will also have to be weird and there wonâ€™t be working drivers for the gpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you can get one for decent price they're great 580's great card.,get to 8 gig if you can,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the 12700k would be a very nice upgrade, it has better a architecture, higher clock speed and the 4 extra e-cores.","but the 6900k should still be a very good cpu, unless it's holding you back i would not upgrade it, maybe wait one generation or two.",what are you using the pc for?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i can't tell you whether to buy or wait.,that's a personal decision based on your needs and wants.,a 12700 non-k should be ballpark 2x as fast as a 6900k.,bit less than that st. bit more than that mt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah this is for wifey,  she does light games and research works.",i build myself a 12900k sheâ€™s wondering if she should upgrade too lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i don't know what you exactly mean with research works, but for light games it's definitely not worth it, the 6900k is already capable of running any of the latest games at very high framerates.","btw since you already have a 12900k (which is pretty close to the 12700k, it only has 4 extra e-cores and a bit more cache) you could measure the difference yourself and decide if it's worth to upgrade.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12400 is more than enough from the sounds of it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what kind of games and work?,"the 12700 is significantly faster in st and mt, more than twice as fast (in general, even faster in certain accelerated tasks), while using less power, but if she just plays 2d games and uses excel, its not going to make much of a difference.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think you took the wrong path traveler, you're in r/intel 

either way for the answer; the 1600 is fine, it's not a tremendous gaming machine since it's on the 1st zen architecture and that really didn't make it all too much of a gaming beast back then and still today, but still has a lot of horsepower 

for the 1600, it still does moderately fine in 2022, not gonna rush with the highest frame rate but it'll do just good",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i saw a few videos on how to undervolt the 12900k.,"most people were using around -0.07v , mine went down to -0.15v until the temps were reasonable at 85-87c (1 minute test).",why is mine needing to be down double the value?,"ran several times and i was getting a score between 28,400 - 28,500 .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s not indicative of your actual temp.,also have your tried reapplying thermal paste?,is it ocâ€™d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's probably a bad reading, and it looks like a chipset/mobo temp not cpu.","i recommend hwinfo, it may give you better labeled data.",for bsods you want to either look up the error codes or check event viewer.,top 2 causes would be bad overclock (including xmp) and drivers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not oc'd, i'll try reapplying thermal paste and see if that helps",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think you misunderstand me.,i do not feel adl is a performance jump over zen 3. they are just catching up to amd and zen 4 with ddr5 is looming allready.,"but i do feel it is an impressive performance jump for intel, compared ro rocket lake, coffe lake and so on.","taking into consideration intel was stagnant for a while, it is impressive to see them ramp up again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yes,but price can be adjusted.","but if you don t have the skus to compete on technology side,then no price will make it look better.","just imagine,that 5900x would be lower price than 12600k.",12 core vs. 10 core cpu.,"if amd wouldn t have such sku,then you have nothing to adjust.","and in 2 years in 2nd hand market,the prices will be completelly different anyway.",so i rather tend to compare core to core and what top stacks can offer.,"because you can cut down top stack any way you want and put any price tag... with adl it is little bit more difficult,because no doubt big core is more performant than zen3.",but intel can have max.,"8 of them,because they are big and hot... so for me up to 8 performance cores,intel is a clear technology winner this time.","in case of total package above 8 cores,it is not so clear.. but again it doesn t change the fact,that 2026 laptop cpu will beat todays desktop and will be more efficient than both zen3 and adl.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is the kicker for me.,my colleagues want me to switch to m1 max and iâ€™ve been really trying to stay with intel.,was hoping adl would give me some good news.,my colleagues showed me a demoâ€”8k 6 minute render footage and the max didnâ€™t sweat.,all this on battery power and on my lap.,my current 11th gen mobile setup is not friendly for my mobile workflows so i hoped alder lake would improve that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the m1 can perform those tasks better because its locked to only 3.2ghz, what is in general one of the sweet spots for silica these days.","its after that, that we see the efficiency to power ratio drop.","intel has the bad habit (imho) of turboing at the start of any intensive task, overdrawing power and heat soaking the cooling.",if you can enable full performance but disable turbo boost.,your probably going to see better performance on a laptop.,turbo boost just eats battery life even on unplugged state.,i never understand why amd and intel keep this bad habit of turboing.,"yes, its great for benchmarks, especially the single thread tests but its not great for battery life / laptop cooling.","you tend to get those massive heat spikes at the start, forcing cooling to enable in mindblower profile.","where as with the m1, their is a much more gradual heat buildup and they ramp up fans as it reaches 99degreec.",intel and amd just do not want to change habits...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"depends what you mean by ""doing ray tracing"".",various forms of ray tracing/casting etc have existed for many years.,"the ""special"" thing about rtx is that it was the first implementation available on and designed for gaming gpus for real time operation.","so i don't think ""intel started it first"" is proof that intel will do it best.","in fact if we're going by usage, the prevalence of ati in animation in the 2000s would suggest that amd would be better..... except it wouldn't as this is completely different.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"by that logic pixar were doing ray tracing long before intel, i can't wait for those pixar gpu's",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
raytracing has been done since the 70s.,the algorithm is extremely simple and (at least with montecarlo based implementations) can produce essentially arbitrarily good images so naturally it has been used in computer graphics since enough computing power was available.,you could easily write a very good rendering algorithm yourself if you know some programming language.,the thing nvidia did first is enabling real time raytracing in games.,this isnâ€™t easy.,running montecarlo path tracing as the professional 3d graphics software do takes forever compared to a game frame.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what does intel control with respect to gaming?,"nothing, zero, nada.","amd has the ps, the xbox, and gamers.",nvidia has gamers.,so which studio will code for intelâ€™s version of ray tracing seeing as how theyâ€™ll win zero marketshare by doing so?,one that intel pays.,intel canâ€™t afford to pay for much as theyâ€™re in the process of loosing their server revenue to amd.,so i donâ€™t see much happening on this front.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the 1165g7 is a quad core 11th generation cpu which differs from the 12-core (4 performance cores and 8 efficiency cores) of the i7-1260p.,you can't directly compare them clock for clock being they're completely different architectures.,the i7-1260p will wreck the 1165g7 overall.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[removed],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how can you compare them though?,is benchmark testing the best method?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when does a processor reach higher than base clock speeds?,i thought that only happens when the user overclocks?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
actually it will be well below base clock in those cases.,"base clock is a performance metric, not a clock speed target (unless you disable boost algorithm that is).",base clock is a useful metric on laptops because it indicates minimum speed under heaviest possible load at the base power level.,so if you run longer heavy workloads base clock tells you the approximate speed the cpu is going to run at.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep benchmarking is the best way to compare.,a common comparison is a benchmark called cinebench.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
overclocking is when you go higher than turbo.,"very few mobile chips support overclocking, so unlikely you could do that even if you wanted to.",higher than base is anytime there is cpu load and the processor isn't overheating.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you very much.,may need to wait for public benchmarking stats to come out before making a decision.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i mean, from a performance standpoint it's going to perform vastly better at least in multi-core.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
perfectly fine to have on.,you may want to check your temps while playing games.,"you technically could stability test it with a ton of different programs, but if you have no problems in the games you play i wouldnâ€™t even worry about it .","if you do critical things on your pc other than game, you may also want to do some stability testing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
should i have a threshold for the cpu and gpu temps?,75 c?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what do you mean threshold?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
set it to run on the performance cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i just ran the bench on my machine with a 12700k and got 
ans = 0.3029    0.1778    0.1933    0.2600    0.1495    0.1115",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't know if it's really a thing but from what i've heard.,windows 10 sometimes got thread directed to wrong cores.,"try disable e cores and see what will happen, or considering win 11 could help.",also some matlab benchmark depends on memory speed.,what exactly is your config ?,i have a 12900k too and my result was slightly better due to better ram speed the two first test.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did it tho?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hehe or do you mean it cooled off?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
doesn't make sense that your cpu would be throttling in the low 80s.,but low 80s is a great temperature for 12900k.,that cpu runs hot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can undervolt it with barely any performance penalty from what i know.,i have a 12900k but no board so i can't give you my results until the manufacturers decide they want to grace the market with more ddr4 itx boards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ok, which cooling system is good for me according to your experience i see that you have a system just like me thanks",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok according to your experience which cooling system performing well on 12900k?,thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you have good cooler.,nothing wrong with your cooling.,in fact your temperatures are really good.,cinebench causes these cpus to run like an inferno.,"if i were to run cinebench on my setup, my cpu goes to the mid 90s.",i would change nothing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well i haven't actually turned it on yet because i'm waiting for the rest of the build.,but from what i've heard from multiple sources is that you can undervolt to save like 10c and lose little to no performance at all.,so that's my plan since i'm sticking it in a meshilicious with a 240 aio from ek.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
keep in mind that it's about 80c when run cinebench while for everyday work is about 26 - 40c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ok, really thanks this is good news :) but why in the previous post you have said to me that ""but low 80s is a great temperature for 12900k"".",if i don't run cinebench the temperature stay on 26c or 40c depends.,if i don't run cinebench the temperature stay at 26c or 40c depends.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thats normal.,what i meant was low 80s is a great temperature for 100% load on cpu.,less load on cpu=less temperatures.,your perfectly fine.,dont worry.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">what i meant was low 80s is a great temperature for 100% load on cpu

it is not offically supported.,technically yes if you disable the e-cores.,however it is rumoured that with the next bios update intel will force motherboard manufacturers to lock the option.,it is not officially supported so i would wait and see what they do now that they are launching p-core only cpus and may not want those to have some sort of edge in avx-512 since on those the instruction set could always be kept active without disabling the e-cores since there are none to start with.,more can be found on igor's lab who is the first who reported the removal of avx-512 support from the next unrelased at the moment bios version for z690: https://www.igorslab.de/en/intel-deactivated-avx-512-on-alder-lake-but-fully-questionable-interpretation-of-efficiency-news-editorial/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, intel said it will be removed, but my board also did not support it out of the box, you have to find the right bios update that's not too old, not too fresh.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not for long, aparently.","current batch supports it unoficially with current bios, future bios will disable the feature.",it is not know if intel will make microcode updates for future batches to disable avx512 altogether.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

wait until alder lake is out and reviews start coming and we'll see.,but in terms of efficiency i don't expect intel to be even close to m1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
alderlake is a good product.,a lot of the negative media press and negative user comments are focused on one specific benchmark.,cinebench and peak power.,and that is how intel products get mislabeled as power hungry.,for most users intel products are actually more efficient at daily tasks than the competitors.,unless the daily task for the system is rendering 24/7.,here is the benchmark in question.,"[https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/12th\_gen\_cinebench\_r20\_power\_trace.jpg?quality=50&strip=all&w=1200](https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/12th_gen_cinebench_r20_power_trace.jpg?quality=50&strip=all&w=1200)

the first roughly 30 seconds of testing is the multi-thread portion.",and we can see that the intel unit does in fact use more power and both products appear to complete the task at roughly the same time.,the situation changes when the benchmark is running the single thread portion (this is to simulate the user actively modeling/editing/using the system) and we can see that the intel product uses less wattage and finishes the task a good \~50 seconds faster than its competitor.,so the jury is still out whether m1 beats intel.,but intel products are not as power hungry as they say.,"and yeah, the overclocking community does not help this fact either.",i mean overclocking uses more power that is the whole point of doing it.,"edit:

the problem its also a issue comparison with the m1.",your comparing a 10nm(lets say 7nm by tsmc standard) to a 5nm(tsmc) chip.,that alone is going to skew the results in apple favor.,a lot of the m1's performance is actually dedicated encoding/decoding hardware.,what unfortunately a lot of apple centric reviews over focus on.,"when you step outside that realm, performance / watt drops a lot.","it also does not help that amd/intel favor turbo boosting for performance, where as apple uses the way more efficient 3.2ghz max.",amd/intels solution are way more efficient if you disable turbo boosting.,"my old t480 easily pulls 12h on its 48kwh battery, by disabling turbo boost.","and yea, old cpu and it does get slower but tb eats battery life.","the m1 get worse when your running any application that requires rosetta, like half the software currently.","sure, rosetta delivers 70% performance of x86 but people ignore the massive power draw it requires.","the m1 is optimized for a apple specific workload ( content creators, ..) and its shows.",great product but you will suffer issues if you step outside that bubble.,another issue is that you can not compare apple efficiency cores with intels.,"one is slow as a dog but is really only designed for running background tasks at very slow efficiency ( but extreme good battery life ), where as intels are very kind of over powerful full blow cpus, that are very efficient for their performance.","both platforms are so different, that comparisons are always very skewed on what your testing and how.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i am not sure what you mean by a fraction of the price.,currently laptops that are equivalent to macbook pro m1 max are between $2500 and $3k.,the macbook pro 16 m1 max 32gb 32gpu is $3499.,from what i have read the alder lake laptops will be pretty expensive and a little more expensive than current prices as dd5 ram is expensive and there is less chip availabilty.,i thihk the savings will not be much at all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i think they'll narrow the gap for sure, but i wouldn't expect that they'll be better than the m1 max.","arm is just on a whole other level as far as efficiency and you have to take into consideration that the m1 max is built on 5nm, while neither intel or amd have moved below 6 or 7nm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you have to keep in mind also the software limitations you have on macs and you don't on windows.,"performance wise, i think the i9s will beat the m1 max, but they will consume more power.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the problem with intel and alderlake is that they are only able to control their own chip.,intel doesn't control the hardware or the software.,"apple controls the chip, hardware, and the software.",so you have to shop and compare with a good vendor in order to get the alderlake to a level of good performance.,but you are purchasing a mobile laptop.,and there are tons of compromises besides just the cpu chip.,however often windows based laptops have very good cooling solutions setup by their hardware vendor.,and it also needs good power delivery.,so many factors go into a good laptop.,i only see dell and maybe razor coming close to the fit and finish of a macbook.,"but when i turn to the internals, the mac always looks better.",but the windows based machines are usually better bang for your bucks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

rosetta eats battery life for breakfast.,m1s performance / battery life  is highly centered on dedicated hardware ( enc/dec ) and native arm ( and that involves a lot of times apple their own software ).,a lot of people complain about battery life when they run software that runs on rosetta.,"as this triggers massive power usage, compared to the performance.",stupid things like chat clients draining battery life.,"unfortunately, intel/amd do not have the luxury of steering reviews to specific software as their platform is much more broader.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
some of their older brands and the lower line of laptops can be misses.,but their newer equipment is solid.,dell xps and gaming books are not bad.,and they come with solid software support.,"from what i've seen, only dell currently offers a power manager that allows the user to protect the battery with a plug in constantly mode.",supposedly it leaves the battery charged at 80% and extends battery life from 300 charge cycles to an estimated 1000 cycles.,so they have their good and bad like any company's products.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that is an ai tweaker tab.,ai means artificial intelligence - your board will automatically overclock by itself.,strange that that's the only tab for tvb.,perhaps we can dig up some information in the bios patch notes.,it could be that asus is just grouping tvb into this section because tvb is basically intel's own over clocking that it does when there is enough power and low enough temperature.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i've been looking for patch notes but i couldn't find anything about last bios update only that :  


1. improve system performance and compatibility

3. improve dram compatibility  


in the meantime:

i changed mce from auto to enabled and now the cores are going to 5.3 ghz but the frequency of the processor stay always up to 4.0-4.9 ghz even in idle, so i don't think this is the right solution, very weird cpu used to work normally before that bios update, i also reinstalled the bios update and nothing changed.","one more thing that i remarked when mce is set on auto is that in games for example now i am playing far cry 6 a game that is very demanding on cpu single thread the cpu is not even going at 5.1 ghz, is going at 5.1 ghz only if i stay on desktop doing browser and other basic tasks, but in games is not passing 4.9 ghz i tested multiple games.","i searched on the internet about tvb and asus, everyone says that asus mb have by deafult tvb setting on, tvb from ai tweaker is only for oc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

by default 12900ks will run on svid voltage... imo it would be just like the 9900ks where the yields were good enough most 9900k could run faster than they originally tough would be the average so they just put out a ks and made an extra profit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what i mean is that the svid voltage doesn't state if there is any vdroop under load.,"if the chip is stable after voltage drop, then the actual voltage to run stable is not svid.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most asus boards are now listed at scan in the uk too.,"i need the itx asrock h670, hopefully its the equivalent of $60 less than their z690 itx too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

are asus releasing any itx boards with ddr4?,"asrock h670 and 690 are ddr4 whilst i think asus are just doing ddr5 for itx, so triple ram price vs same board 1/3rd ram price",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh my, half of â£230 for their cheap z690 would be â£115 for the asrock h670 if thats true, i'm waiting impatiently for them to drop.","the two boards are identical minus the cpu overclocking and a few usb ports, all the latest features for everything else.","b660 only has a single m.2 slot on itx boards, maybe the same for larger ones too which is meh.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i wouldn't count on the gigabyte having better audio.,i'm guessing it's the same ancient alc897 as the asrock because gigabyte won't tell you what it is.,i've found asrock's onboard audio to be good in general.,"the gigabye board uses 90a power stages vs the asrock's 50a, so probably a much better vrm.","the gigabyte also has much better cooling on the vrm, so definitely a win.",i'm don't care about the preinstalled i/o shield  (not many agree with me on this).,intel ethernet is generally considered better but their 2.5gb controller was terrible until revision 3.,(not going to be an issue on a new board).,asrock also has a 1g intel nic in addition to the 2.5g realtek.,the vrm on the gigabyte will help if you will be running an i7 or i9 with power limits removed.,"i'd feel more comfortable recommending the gigabyte for this reason, but i have never used either of them.",buy the asrock if it's a lot cheaper and you will be using an i3 or i5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"b660 has a lot less features than the h670, the latter is identical to the z690 minus overclocking and a couple less usb ports.",the biggest difference imo is the extra m.2 slot.,"the ethernet on the asrock h670 itx is 2.5 gbit, the one on their b660 is only 1 gbit so thats a hard pass as i will be using this as a media, remote play and nas build.","gigabyte b660 itx also has 2.5 gbit, so on that part its the same, but b660 has a lot of things cut down from z690 and h690, tty google searching for the differences between the three.","whichever vendor you choose, z690 > h670 > b660 > h610.","heres a link to the full specs https://www.tomshardware.com/uk/news/intel-h670-b660-h610-motherboard-roundup

"i don't think phases matter if you aren't overclocking the cpu, maybe only if getting the 12700 or 12900 non ks as you suggest.","i don't think memory overclocking depends much on the phases, and the asrock boards support up to 5000 mhz overclock on the ram anyway.","for any of the i3 or i5 non ks, best to get the cheapest board with the most features.","i just realized that the realtek 2.5 gb lan might not be as good as an intel one, so i will look and see if theres any other itx h670s planned from other vendors, but it doesn't look like there is.",my main motherboard already has 2.5 gb intel and they will both be connected through the router.,steam remote play for 4k needs all the bandwidth it can get.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"right, but none of the b660s have 2xnvme m.2 slots for starters, the chipset can't support that.","even larger b660 boards that do have more m.2 slots, those are running off an add in board on the pch, not from the chipset.","if that doesn't matter to you, go ahead and get a b660.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"maybe, but i don't see any with 2 m.2 slots with chipset lanes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the raid support is iffy if you combine motherboard lanes.,i've done it on my main pc only because 4tb nvmes cost too much so i got 2x2 tb raided for a single 4tb partition.,"combining a chipset and mobo lane gives the increased capacity, but a little less speed than a single drive.","the only way to get full raid 0 benefit is if both slots are cpu lanes, as chipset ones cannot handle any higher speed.",then again i don't actually know if both slots on these new boards are chipset as it doesn't say on the adverts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

other than the obvious overclockability of the k, and its e-cores and extra 2mb of cache, the main difference is the clocks:

12400 / 12500 / 12600 / 12600k

4.40 ghz / 4.60 ghz / 4.80 ghz / 4.90 ghz

so you're actually getting pretty close to the non-oc'd 12600k clocks with the 12600. whether the 0.4 ghz that it has over the 12400 will actually make enough of a real-world difference remains to be seen when more benchmarks come out.","memory support, etc.",is identical across all four cpus.,"one difference is the integrated graphics: the 12400 is the one with the worst igpu of the lot, while the other 3 all have the same one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"and in non-saturating tasks like gaming, alder lake is at similar efficiency or higher efficiency to zen3.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so what you're saying is if we want an intel itx build we only use the 12400 and ignore the higher performing chips but at the same time don't use a high performing amd chip that does work in an itx build?,"don't just highlight a plus while ignoring the negatives, that's what we call a bias.","can you build a 12th gen itx build, sure, can you build a higher end 12th gen, maybe not.",say it how it is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so?,what you said is irrelevant.,itx is already a small niche where motherboard makers only release 1 board variation per chipset because that's the kind of volume they do.,under those conditions they can't release a board that only supports the bottom half of a product stack or only if they limit it to intel guidance specs and then another board to support the two or three high end chips.,the other point is people who are doing 12400 are likely doing it for budget reasons and itx is not going to get treated as budget for several reasons.,that niche is for micro atx at present.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's only the unlocked cpus running very hot.,preliminary tests of the 12400 e.g.,showed it was more efficient than the 5600x with equal to higher performance.,"if you don't want to cram the highest-end cpu, you can definitely run alder lake on itx.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's hot out the box.,"a undervolted 12900k at 150w loses like 4-5% mt performance and no st. drop it to 125w and mt performance drops down to 7-8% with again no loss to st.

re-read the thread before posting accusations of bias.,"the previous user posted that 12th gen was ""was designed to be performant, not efficient."".",this is a total generalization and not accurate and i posted evidence to support that.,even the 12900k is only power hungry in fully loaded avx loads like when running cinebench.,"in most real world uses such as gaming, the 12900k quite literally uses less power than the high end amd cpus:

where did i claim that only the 12400 can be used for an itx build?",you obviously can use any 12th gen cpu in an itx build.,sure if you go with a high end itx board and a 12900k you will not be able to use every cooling option you might be able to with other builds due to clearance issues but that doesn't suddenly make it infeasible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"any non k will be fine, just don't try to overvolt / overclock in an itx case, and even try to undervolt to the lowest that the cpu will take for stock speed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the previous poster said ""the problem is 12th gen is ill-suited to itx since it was designed to be performant, not efficient.""",and i responded with evidence that clearly shows that his generalization is false.,it is as simple as that.,i'm not sure where you are having trouble comprehending my response.,i made no comments about itx.,"sure the big beefy vrms and cooling requirements on most z690 itx boards can reduce the number of cooling options, but hardly to the point of making the build infeasible.",if you aren't going with one of the high end k series chips you can also just get something like a asrock h670m-itx and run a 12400 or 12600.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oki, thank you for answering!",i believe i would also be limited by cooling (will be running 140mm aio).,"regarding the pl1 limit, i thought it was confirmed to be 150w in the bios?",are you running the latest bios?,"this is where i believe i'm misunderstanding something..

but like i say, i think i would be limited by cooling before that limit would happen anyway.","will definitely try to do some underclocking, really good tips!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fwiw - the k series are actually as efficient as 5600x in gaming scenarios;  it's running them at max power limits on certain benchmarks that breaks the efficiency.,(igors lab has good testing data on this).,12600k should be manageable even with those benchmarks on itx.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

so you aren't overclocking and not gaming so why do you even care then for the heat?,there are far more things you should be concerned about when buying a cpu and even if you would game or overclocked the last thing i would be interested is the temperature,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
overheating in laptops is almost entirely about the cooling and tdp the oem provisions.,the cpu itself almost doesnâ€™t matter when it comes to temps.,so you will need to do research model by model.,what the cpu can do for you is be more efficient at a given tdp.,"that will generally show up in performance, not temperature.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sorry, who looks at reliability of cpus?",only time you need to worry about that is if you overclock it or use a poor cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the only thing that i can think of which could indicate reliability of a cpu is driver quality.,"intel used to be the best at drivers, but iâ€™m not sure how they compare to amd now.",look at the forums to see how many driver complaints there were.,"heat wise i suggest you check the power rating of the cpus, as more power tends to produce more heat.","i know that intel and amd measure wattage differently, but i think linus tech tips did a video on that a while back.",good luck!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also the tdp depends upon oem as it can be configured from 10-25w iirc.,so depending upon cooling capacity of laptop chassis and tdp configured it may or may not overheat.,ps ryzen r5 5500u is a zen 2 part unlike most cpus from ryzen 5000 series which are zen 3 based.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

seeing how much more efficient the 12400 is to the 5600x and 11th gen pets was crazy.,5600x being ~70% less efficient at some point.,it's just a testament to intel's intel 7 process node and makes me super excited for mobile chips as i think we'll still see efficiency improvements over tiger lake.,i think intel's dominance hinges completely on how fast they can get to intel 4. it seems like currently intel 7 can match tsmc 7 and maybe even 6nm nodes but if ryzen 7000 is launched with no meteor lake in sight intel may be in big trouble.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hwu did a test with the 12700 (non-k) using the new (small) intel boxed cooler at 65w tdp with great results in avx2 and absolute perfect for just gaming.,alder lake with the non-k variants looks really good for smaller systems and you dont have the high idle/gaming wattage issues with soc designs - like zen2/zen3 has to deal with.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the worst part is they're entirely cosmetic.,"a proper finned heatsink could dissipate the same heat in less volume, and would cost less to make.","**edit:**  but i looked up [a picture of op's board](https://www.gigabyte.com/fileupload/global/keyfeature/1981/innergigabyteimages/thermal.jpg) (on gigabyte's abomination of a ""website""), and it looks like maybe they made the vrm airflow-obstructor excessively tall to be even with the daughterboard?",like [look at how tall that is](https://www.gigabyte.com/fileupload/global/keyfeature/1984/innergigabyteimages/memory.jpg).,it's nuts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i fit the u12a on after.,"but yes , you have to take the m.2 heat sink.",i have 3rd gen pcie m.2.,i think the heat sink is that big for 5th gen pcie.,whenever that comes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the vrm is super high on the board.,i donâ€™t think it would work.,im not too heart broken.,it was just a warning because i had used the fuma for my z390 itx just fine.,i had bought a u12a preemptively.,just in case my scythe fume 2 didnâ€™t fit.,iâ€™ll just sell my fuma 2 with lga1700 mount kit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
d15 is listed as non compatible with strix z690f boards in standard orientarion.,so it's not like it randomly happened to you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did it fit?,i'm planing to buy the same cooler and motherboard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
engineers should be experienced enough to look up the damn keep-out zone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the worst thing about these stupid design is the fact that these vrms are overkill for most people.,these stupid gaudy gamer design on motherboards are just hindering the cpu cooler compatibility to try to look â€œcoolâ€.,in fact it makes it look terrible.,i also have problems sticking stupid screens on motherboards yo justify their stupidity inflated costs.,gamer brand is just a way to skyrocket costs.,thank goodness msi z690 pro a has none of these problems.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it was unexpected though.,i was suppose to use a gigabyte board that was fully supported but to get ddr5 i had to buy as a package with a motherboard (which is how i ended up with the z690-f) and only had about 30 seconds to make the decision (and i already had the d15) so i bought without checking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it fitted perfectly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"noctua published what coolers are compatible for every z690.. he had to check, from my point of view these z690 are aio friendly",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's an itx board.,sometimes the engineers make compromises and you can't put your dual tower air coolers in.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
understandable.,"i was in a similar situation, to be honest.","i was eyeing the strix, but i wanted a d15, and after much headache, i impulse bought a gigabyte without too much research, because i read the d15 incompatinility right when i was heading to the store.","funny thing is right when i was heading back home, a bit unease because i was reading all the ram issues gigabyte boards where having, they put a flash deal on an asus tuf, from 350 to 260.

headed back to the store, returned the gb and bought the tuf and i was happy as i could be.",bought the d15 from amazon as they were the only ones i could find was selling the lga1700 adaptor.,"they delivered next day, turns out, my d15 already arrived with the adaptor in the box.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"screenshot says: ""selected application is shown via golden color on ... utilization bars""

""hitmans"" is selected.",golden color is shown on **both** p and e cores and appears to be the majority of the utilization on both.,the extra apps listed under efficient cores might also be (predominantly) on e-cores but they are not the dominant cpu consumer.,hence the confusion.,that however isn't failure.,if a game can use all the cores it should.,and if the game then goes cpu idle (i.e.,while waiting for the gpu to render a frame) then the p-cores might not be 100% at all times.,but nevertheless this is going to be confusing to laymen asking why their game isn't just 100% using p-cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

have you tried removing and reseating the cooler?,it sounds like the issue might start somewhere there.,"if itâ€™s not mounted properly, the temps would be very poor, like yours are",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is no mystery here.,"you either have a bad cooler, bad mounting/thermal paste application, or you are feeding it too much voltage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sounds like you cooler is doing absolutely nothing, like it's not completely touching while seated and thermal paste isn't helping.",or the thermal paste isn't working.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's seating or thermal application.,the fact you can oc it represents a working cpu.,voltages might be too much for your cooling.,try a negative offset -- you'd be surprised what that can do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what size of aio do you have?,if itâ€™s 120mm then itâ€™s not as efficient then most good tower coolers on the market.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you apply thermal paste?,"can you take the cooler off of your cpu, make sure it touched, and then reinstall again?",did you use enough thermal paste?,i consider myself pretty decent at this but even i put too little on there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i also have this problem with my i7 8700 .,i didn't even overclock it tho it's a locked cpu but sometimes it reaches about 98 to 100 c at 4.28 ghz like yours .,so i decided to change my cooler to corsair h100x from cooler master hyper 212 turbo led .,then i could be able to see some reasults .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
check your fan speeds on your aio.,see if they're scaling with load.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as some have said, you're cooler must be dead, poor seating of cooler or way too much vcore voltage.","i have set up two 9700ks, one wced at 5ghz & one air cooled 4.9ghz and neither will get into 70c temps under load.",using around 1.275vcore.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ive done the original placing when building, and then when noticing the temps, reseated it and added extra thermal paste just incase (no difference).",i have tightened the screws on my cooler as tight as possible too so no air pockets cld form if that was the issue,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thing is ive had this cooler for about a year so i know it itself works.,"i have now reseated it 3 times, each time putting too much thermal paste just to be sure",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
240 mm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i put so much thermal paste that it ran off to the side and barely touched the mobo.,i was testing to see if i didnt put enough just incase.,"i cleaned the copper part of the cooler, placed thermal paste on the cpu die and seated the cooler.","when i took it off again, there was paste on the copper",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they are at 100% all of the time since connected straight to psu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"itâ€™s possible that your aio just shit the bed then, or itâ€™s not strong enough, and you need a new one.","i used to have a 9700k, and i was able to handle a 4.9ghz all core overclock with a 240mm aio.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pumps fail.,"my 2 year old aio just went out last week, my temps were doing the same thing.","i could still hear the pump working so it wasn't obvious, but after replacing it with a new unit my temps are back under 70â° again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
more is not necessarily better.,unless you almost had none before.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"here in italy, amazon already listened i5 12400f and i7 12700 with some asus and msi h610/b660 motheboards, guess they are almost here at last!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
xmp is memory overclocking.,"you should really only be considering an h610 is youâ€™re just building a general purpose, business-class desktop.","if youâ€™re planning on using the computer for content creation, productivity, gaming, or any other less generalized purpose, and you donâ€™t have a very tight budget, you should be looking at one of the other chipsets.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would go with the b660 as it will let you use the 3600mhz ram @ 3600mhz and you get dual channel support.,h610 would limit you to 3200mhz on your ram and you would only get single channel memory.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this video explains it: https://youtu.be/_fjkcvfoa_c?t=126

for a non-k processor, i would get a b660 if i could get one for cheaper than h670.","but i'm not seeing any cheap b660 boards in my shops - so i might as well go with the h670, which has more sata, pcie, and usb connectivity, for virtually the same price (in my specific case).","the price and availability situation may be different near you, and more b660 boards may hit the shops in the next couple weeks.","for a k processor, i would definitely get a z690, since that's the only one that can make use of its overclockability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
610 only has one memory channel!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"weird, so that slide actually says the h610 has only one channel, and where people got it from.",it's different to what my linked comparsion says.,"and they can't be both correct same time, as the boards do have 2 ram slots.","but yeah, b660 would be fine for me, but sure, it's price difference is very small here as well, about 15 dollars.",h610 price would have been much more tempting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"pretty sure that point in the comparison means it only supports 2 sticks, 1 per channel.",but i googled about xmp and for intel it means overclocking so h610 is out of the question.,so for me it's more between h670 and b660.,"there's about 30 euros price difference so if i wouldn't lose anything relevant, i'd rather keep the money, or use it for something more relevant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ughh, the existence of a lower priced option with one memory channel doesnâ€™t raise the price of h boards.","h boards back then didnâ€™t even support memory overclocking and could thus use super cheap trace layouts on 4 layer, low copper pcbs along with cheap vrms built to only handle 95w locked chips.","todays h boards are way more capable and unlike cpus who benefit from routine transistor improvements, copper trace layouts and pcb materials are a â€œsolvedâ€ science that donâ€™t get much cheaper.","20gbps usb is expensive, gen5 pcie is expensive, memory traces that can handle high speed ddr4 are expensive, mosfets that can handle the ever increasing power draws are expensive.","if you want a $70 motherboard, itâ€™s going to be a 4phase matx board with a single gen3 pcie slot, a couple of gen2 pciex1 slots along with 4 sata ports and like 2 usb3 ports with locked memory speeds to 2400mhz cause the traces cant handle anymore than that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

intel could have easily won if they told us more about their upcoming video cards.,the gpu market are extremely thirsty for gpus and they told us almost nothing at ces.,intel you dropped the ball really hard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

intel squandered a great opportunity to generate hype for arc.,no one really gives a shit about 12th gen mobile chips.,itâ€™s not like we werenâ€™t already expecting this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the majority of people tuning in were anticipating an announcement of arc video cards.,intel had been leaking information for months building up to a launch only to deliver nothing.,"the discrete graphics market is a nightmare for any enthusiast or system builder trying to buy a card at a reasonable price thanks to supply shortages combined with bots, scalpers, and crypto miners.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

how much do u think i can sell my mother and cpu for and how which motherboard and cou should i buy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
z170 is in high demand because the chinese are making mutant chips from laptops to fit the 1151 socket lol.,i bet you could take at the very least 100 bucks for your cpu and mobo combo so you'd still spend more or less 200 to get into a newer and better platform this way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

        intelâ® deep learning boost (intelâ® dl boost) - a new set of embedded processor technologies designed to accelerate ai deep learning use cases.",it extends intel avx-512 with a new vector neural network instruction (vnni) that significantly increases deep learning inference performance over previous generations.,"though avx-512 is not mentioned directly, it says dl boost is on top of avx-512.",removing such features post-launch is really makes intel not trust-worthy.,my decision to go for intel after long time for a deep learning machine build is held up due to this understanding.,how about intel's contribution to numpy on optimization based on avx-512?,"are they not available for latest desktop monsters, only for a narrow selected xeon processors?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"purposely killing functionality post launch... classy move intel, will affect my next platform decision!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not at all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, because avx-512 is a clusterfuck.","it's a family of loosley related instructions, marketed under the ""avx-512"" banner because intel wanted to promote something amd didn't have in their cpus.","it was never useful for anything consumer-oriented, outside ps3 emulation...same as tsx, come to think about it.","avx-512 is useful for three things:

* highly niche hpc workloads that would probably be done on gpus
* ps3 emulation via rpcs3
* showing an intel cpu beating amd by 700% in benchmark slides during a product launch",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"unlike previous gens, the avx512 worst case thermals on alderlake aren't that bad strangely.","in prime95 smallfft, avx512 enabled runs 3c cooler and uses 10w less than the fma3 code path on my 12900k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"it doesn't affect pcsx2, as that can only use avx2 and is already so fast on potato pcs that i'm not sure what the benefit of avx-512 support would be.","avx2 isn't even the default yet, though.","you have to run an executable compiled to supporty avx2, `pcsx2-avx2.exe`, which is in the root pcsx2 folder.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which begs the question - why not just ditch the e-cores and complexity and just offer avx-512 w/p cores only.,"seems yields would be better, entire system less complex, cheaper..... um.. wtf are they doing this!",?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'd imagine this can still vary from workload to workload, since (assuming we are working on something that can be done on both 256 or 512-bit vectors), without the e cores we loose half of our vector units, but we know have avx-512 which is twice as wide.","so if the p cores are faster with avx-512 than the e cores are with avx/avx2, then we would loose some performance.","add ontop of that the more specialized and wide range of avx-512 instructions which allow for more optimization of the code itself avx does, you might be leaving a significant amount of performance on the table.",on the other hand far from all code/every workload can be optimized to take good advantage of avx-512 and for the average user without a specialized workload i'd agree that having the e-cores is better then avx-512.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'd take it if you have  youtube/chrome up while you play those e-cores would take care of them while you play.,on my current 9900/3080 i need to make sure to have twitch at 360p or else i start to notice it effecting the game's frame pacing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i was essentially pushed to go with a regular atx build with the pathetic z690 itx board offerings (one is way too expensive (asus), the other is still expensive but riddled with issues (gigabyte)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
anyone who knows when the gigabyte b660i will be available?,"as far as i know it should be release, but i dont see it for sale anywhere....",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"strix b660 is ddr5, both asrock boards are ddr4.",if your looking to save your ram asrock or gigabyte b660 is the only option right now.,the vrm cooling on the asrock boards are non existent which is worrying on a 250 dollar board.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can find every h610 / b660 / h670 / z690 mini-itx board from the /r/sffpc google sheets [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1addrvgwj_f4b6uc7_iftdivudvc8cj8sxluqlxvscz4/edit#gid=523597416).,there are currently 13 boards in total (8 ddr4 and 5 ddr5 models).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm wanting to upgrade to 12th gen but the itx boards are in a sorry state, seems to be very limited options in the uk for ddr4 boards and the pricing is insane",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the asrock z690m-itx/ax is a super nice board btw.",i have it.,absolutely zero issues with it.,use it with a 12700k and 3060ti,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"gigabyteâ€™s b660 itx ddr4 board looks pretty good to me if itâ€™s not insanely overpriced: https://www.gigabyte.com/motherboard/b660i-aorus-pro-ddr4-rev-1x

the biostar board should be good value although not sure which country it'll be available at,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at least you can get the asrock z690 itx board.,itâ€™s nowhere to be found in the us.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
asus is just terrible this generation.,they don't get it at all.,most of their boards are overpriced comparied to their competition in terms of feature set and a lot of the boards alienated people who uses big air coolers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i don't think biostar are available in the uk, and i'd normally prefer asus or asrock, only going with msi if the other two don't have what i want.",gigabyte boards are attrocious for ram overclocking which is the only extra thing i would want the board to do,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was wondering the same thing.,absolutely no information to be found.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea the asrock z690 itx is just as similar an eyeroll as the rog strix b660.,little vrm cooling is fine for non overclockable boards.,"looking at the specs, i'm going to try and hold out for the h670, as i would like the 2.5g lan since its gong to be remote streaming from my main pc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can fix that by using a downdraft cooler like the nh-l12s.,does benefit the ram too.,vram easier to cool with airflow then with heatsink.,scythe big shuriken 3 rev.,"b (full black fan, newly released this month, might not be available everywhere yet).",this one wont go over the ram tough,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"its not so much that they are limited, but that they aren't released yet.",i'll simply have to get the asrock z690 itx if ddr4 b660 / h670s dont launch soon.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the planned h670 version has all the same features minus the cpu overclocking, i really want that one instead.","its going in a vented media cupboard and not going to be overclocked, but i could use the 2xm.2 slots and 2.5g lan, as well as the pci-e 5.0 guaranteeing being able to get a future midrange gpu running at full speed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
where did you buy the board?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i will never risk buying biostar again.,i have a faulty z590 that i bought abroad so i can't rma it.,"it looks and performs great, has tons of features but it black screens the hell out of me.",i'd rather buy from the big 3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh the gigabyte b660 has 2.5 gb lan too, but only 1 m.2 slot, but that doesn't matter since 2.5 sata ssds are fine for a media pc with games streaming from my m.2s on the main pc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in general with them is always like this even on am4 platform and gpus.,"in the past i've got many products from them, good but nothing special, at this time i think i will give a try to asrock and gigabyte.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, the gigabyte z690 and biostar b660 are the only ddr4 boards with a decent realtek soundchip.",biostar should at least be available in germany.,my pcgames hardware magazine said that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well currently limited at least, but i'm struggling to even find listings for future releases.","i did laugh at the rog b660 though, â£250 for a board that you can't even overclock on is pure madness, strix or not.",the asrock seems like the only real option at the moment but it looks a bit barebones and not been able to find much on whether the vrms are any good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why the 2.5g lan?,"my amd board has it, but i cant find any routers or switches that have more than like 1 2.5g port that are actually reasonably priced, they are almost as costly as 10g switches.","edit: oh, i guess for media center/server usage i can see, get a router with 1 2.5g port, and multiple devices can pull data off the 1g ports and wifi all at once.","i really wish i could get switches with like 2x2.5g ports for around like 50 bucks, i have 2 switches in my house, one on each floor, and 2.5g between them with another 2.5g port for my pc would be ideal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
europe.,was readily available from a common computer webshop (one month ago!).,actually one of the cheapest socket 1700 boards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh, while i did forget about the sound, i'm more than happy to get another external soundbar or some such if needed.","and that reminds me that my 7.1 thx speakers are still at my dad's house, i don't need to buy any new speakers, but whichever tv i get soon should have built in speakers to use until i can haul the rest of my belongings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mentioned somewhere i have an email from asrock confirming availability of their itx budget boards by the end of the month.,"i feel the same way about the rog strix b660, its nothing but a cash grab for a non overclocking board, but a few people on this forum have said that they absolutely want it for some reason.",b660's features are so lacking that its a dumb move by the aibs to do that as opposed making such a board with the h670 chipset.,"the only thing they can overclock is the memory, as for the thing on last gen budget boards where you can reduce power limits for stronger boost clocks, that feature was only listed for previous generation boards, currently it hasn't been applied to h670 or b660, and maybe intel won't allow it.",let me find the link.,"link: https://www.asrock.com/microsite/2020bfb/

i think it was only asrock and asus boards that supported this anyways, via asrock's bfb above and asus' multicore enhancement.","even then, simply increasing the boost frequencies on an i3 or i5 still really isn't much that needs a beefy overclocking board.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so i can actually game at 4k on the mere uhd 770, by streaming from the main pc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i also have a ~100â‚¬ am4 board with 2.5 gbit/s ethernet.,there are plenty of 10gbaset capable switches out there and i currently using a css610-8g-2s+in at the moment... got it for 89â‚¬...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the response.,looks like my itx pc will be collecting more dust for the time being.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 i am kinda disappointed that they did not show any desktop skus at ces which makes me think that it might be until q2 2022 for desktop skus to be available to us.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
theyâ€™re suffering supply issues just like everyone else and donâ€™t want to release a product that they canâ€™t deliver.,youâ€™re overthinking this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"honestly they just might be stockpiling more cards before release due to shortage

or theyâ€™re trying to tweak drivers so that their first lineup of cards work perfectly 

either way, i would much rather them release a finished great product late than have a terrible product release that kills the lineup

"they are entering the largest market, laptop gaming market is currently \~60% larger than desktop, and is projected to be double desktop size by 2025. so of course they want to go after the largest and fastest growing segment first.","from what i've heard, its not even a capacity issue with the actual silicon... its the components of the laptops/gpu boards, etc.",$2 components that hold production of laptops.,it's a supply chain issue now.,"&#x200b;

my guess is that we might see them in early summer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
might be for oem?,we know that intel wants to saturate the market with intel arc gpu to make it worth for developers to optimise for intel arc and the ai upscaler.,"by selling to oem only, it ensures that every gpu sold goes to exactly 1 device (unlikely to end up in a crypto farm since the roi has to account for the entire laptop, not just the gpu price)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"desktop gpu before end of 2020* was the first marketing

also leak have say since few month 

q1 for laptop 
q2 desktop",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's getting very frustrating waiting for arc, ofc nobody wants an unfinished product to be released but this constant vague information..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my bet is laptop makers bought every single gpu they had available.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel will be outclassed if they launch any later than june.,the new amd and nvidia gpus will appear not much later and then there will be little reason to go for arc.,intel seems to be making another i740 here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

stuff getting delayed is pretty normal even at the best of times.,"as a wise man once said, predictions are hard -- especially about the future.",bringing a major new product line with a ton of complexity and compatibility requirements involves a lot of uncertainty.,never trust a vendor's promises about the future.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the delay is due to not having enough supply on hand.,they're using tsmc and they're already booked with silicon orders for amd.,intel doesn't want to follow nvidia and amd with paper launches.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"https://videocardz.com/newz/intel-arc-alchemist-desktop-discrete-graphcis-cards-now-rumored-to-launch-in-march-2022

"last er they harped about ""having the capacity"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my money's on drivers.,they don't have the history the other two do and as we've seen with the dg1 they still need a bit of polish.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

interesting.,"there's no shipping 'now', so the 'next quarter... or two' sounds like q3, which may well mean the last week of q3.","another flip side to this could be rtx 3050 and 6500 xt getting reduced to paper launches only, since the only reason nvidia and amd announced these entry level cards was in anticipation of intel (yeah, sorry gamers it was not for us).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because new asml machines destined for new fabs with construction time of years would have any impact on chips sold next month?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the capacity they're buying from tsmc who hasn't been able to keep up as it is?,lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they may have the capacity at foundries but shortage of hundreds of other components other than gpu itself,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s not the only supply issue semiconductors are facing.,they are facing shortages at board level too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's common to get ram faster than the cpu supports.,technically it's oc but xmp works most of the time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you don't have to but ram will adjust the clock accordingly to whatever the motherboard or cpu limit is.,so ddr3600 is compatible in a board/cpu that only supports up to 3200.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if the speed of the memory exceeds that of whats oficially suported by the cpu, it's up to the motherboard bios to polish compatibility.","too high of an xmp profile might not boot, but you may make it work setting the speed and timings manually a bit lower.","if it is too too high, then you enter luck of the draw with the quality of the memory controller of the cpu itself.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most of the time ðÿ˜¬,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there's always some fringe cases of certain kits not being compatible with certain boards but it's rare on the popular boards with popular kits.,also there's rare cases of a cpu having a weak imc and struggling to run oc'd ram stabley.,again it's rare to have such a weak imc.,in general moderately out of spec ram will run on 99% of cpus and boards just fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no you got to manually turn on the xmp toggle in your bios.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™d check that youtube video one more time.,"uhd 770 canâ€™t be *that* much better than 730, but maybe itâ€™s worth 20 bucks?","donâ€™t worry about the clocks, though.","in practice, they donâ€™t actually lead to a measurable performance difference.","(the low base clock especially is meaningless, as itâ€™s a number youâ€™ll never see.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"https://youtu.be/bnepp6iex7y

granted he says the gpu heavy effects are still using the 3090 but he demonstrates the igpu being surprisingly great at playing and scrubbing a lot of codecs.","not all, but most at 4k

isnâ€™t high single core performance ideal for lots of games?",i heard amd handles productivity better in general (pre-12th gen) but they sometimes lose out to intel in games that require strong single core performance.,"but yeah, i am waiting for the 12600 reviews too...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it is, yes, but the difference between most modern cpus in games is negligible.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"under 3060ti/144hz or less/over 1080p/not competitive ( csgo type ) games

no difference.",240+hz/csgo/1080p or less etc 12400,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, the difference for gaming would be too small to notice.","12th gen is better for upgrade path but if youâ€™re not going to upgrade till ddr5 cheapens, just go 11th gen and save the cash",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i5 12400f.,you will be on a platform that will age tremendously well as proven on basically any review you can find online.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i would suggest waiting for cheaper lga 1700 boards, mainly h670 and b660 and then build a ddr4 system, but if you don't want to wait the 11400f is also a valid option.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i5 12400f._x000d__x000d_  
1- you won't be on a dead platform._x000d_  
2- 12400f is faster and draws less power.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"im playing 75hz 1080p, should i go with 11400f then?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh really?,i think the 12th gen socket bowing would make it age tremendously worse.. id rather save over $100 for a barely noticeable difference if any in normal gaming scenarios.,only reason i see would be for ddr5 support but nobody is pairing a 12400f with ddr5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for $100 more thats not enough to justify buying it over an 11400f.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"like said, under 3060ti and no csgo you get more by putting that 100$ on the video card budget.",unless you want to upgrade to a really expensive video card next year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"get a 12400f now, and then upgrade to 13400f when it comes out.",if u get 11400f u save $100 but then ur stuck with that.,long term planning is better than short term.,"imagine for $160-180 ish (sell 12400f and add $60-80 to get 13400f) u can have 13400f instead of 11400f, that is 100% worth it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you don't think that a cpu that's 20% faster in games, 66% faster in multithreaded workloads on a platform that allows you to upgrade to a 12700/12900k or even raptorlake in the future while also drawing less power isn't worth $100 then nothing will convince you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
honestly rather have longevity and cooler temps over a bending ihs but thats just me i dont ever waste money upgrading to a better cpu from the same socket its smarter to skip a generation or two and wait for an i5 13400f or something which will probably be cheaper and just as fast as a 12700. this is coming from someone who used a $1000 x58 cpu for almost 10 years so yea gonna take more than that to convince me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think they applied tbe same logic as was with first gen core i cpus, e. g. i7 860",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"my guess is the ""a"" is representing the ""alchemist"" generation.",the numbers behind will be just a indicator of where the product stands in terms of performance/market segment which means we might even see 7xx and 9xx in the future.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
let's just hope they actually release some gpu's that aren't apart of oem pre-builts.,i've heard that there's some speculation that they are going to push the dates...again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

makes sence because a could stand for alchemist and b for battlemage but then again a could stand for arc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i don't think a stands for arc because my understanding is arc is like the product name, similar to amd's radeon and nvidia's geforce which means arc will be used from generation to generation until intel rebrands the product.",well.. that's my guess and only time can tell.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what's your hardware configuration?,"cpu: (example -  core i5-11600k)
motherboard: (example - asus z590-e gaming)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is already a desktop cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i didn't know laptops cpus still came in sockets.,"what laptop is, just out of curiosity?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
should be fine.,socket 1151 motherboards are still around.,for an 8700k iâ€™d go with a z370 motherboard.,i liked my aorus gaming 5 but there are plenty of good options.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
op clearly have a clevo laptop.,"you can definitely swap your gtx1060 for something better, up to rtx2080 super since your board already support coffeelake or if you can be fine with modified driver, up to rtx3080.",i did swap my gtx1080 on my p775dm3 chasis for a rtx2080.but pratically i would say it's not worth it.,"the problem with mxm module is that although you have a nice upgrade path, it will be too costly in practice, and lots of headaches to make things work too.",rtx3080 mxm module clevo costs around 2000usd on ebay.,i'm not denying the fact that only thick laptops can be enough for hardcore gamer while still have the needed mobility.,"i had that mindset when i was in college, had to move around across the country for various reasons like internships, exchange... but when you finally settle down, you better switch back to desktop for a proper gaming experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you need a new motherboard then it honestly isn't worth keeping, the new 12400, 12500 and 12600 are so much better.",you cold sell the chip and get an alderlake mobo and i5 instead.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes you can.,i had a metabox laptop with the i7-8700k.,bought 400usd worth of parts and now have a pretty kick ass mitx minecraft/titanfall 2 server machine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sell it and get a new pc with 12400 or a laptop.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
obviously,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what was the gpu what died?,and how?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what laptop is that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes you can i believe.,it is a desktop cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if ur dedicated laptop gpu is dead u should be to use the igpu of the 8700k on the same laptop,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, if that motherboard is 1151 v2",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if your laptop has a desktop cpu inside of it then it also probably has an mxm gpu and you could swap it for a different one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"too many times i have heard ""this pos hardware is dead!""",only to find that a windows update fixes the problem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
may want to look into why the laptop failed.,it could be a fairly minor component that burned out which a trained tech could replace cheaply compared to building a new system,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nein,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
check what the socket is on your pcâ€™s current motherboard.,you may be able to use it in your pc since your laptopâ€™s cpu is socketable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good luck finding a gpu for your new build!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,"most dtrs and some heavy duty workstation laptops have lga socket removable desktop chips, as they can provide enough cooling to support them.",you can put this cpu in a desktop motherboard and it should function normally.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what laptop is this?,kinda curious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes but you need 300 series mobo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as far as im aware you can,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can you not use the laptop with the igpu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,the notches on the motherboard are for a ninth gen intel and the processor it self is a tenth gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"huy what do you think laptop with cpu
amd ryzen 9 5900hx , will last at list 3 years for me , mostly will be usable for rendering and graphic design ( this is the full model : laptop asus rog strix g513qm (g513qm-ws96))",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so my laptop had a desktop cpu inside,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i dunno what laptop it is but there are still some companies out there that run desktop cpus in some of their laptops and they tend to be pretty chunky,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah that must be a damn hot laptop!,and thick.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my bet is clevo or one of the brands that use their designs (e.g.,schenker xmg).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
monster,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
some laptops spec in desktop cpus.,it's literally a desktop computer that they shoved in a (probably giant) laptop chassis.,in such cases it will have a socket and can be exchanged just like any other desktop cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"some dell produced ones do, makes it easier for warranty work.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes i was thinking about z370 as well.,you are not happy with aourus whats will you suggest ?,and i have concerns about rams as well should o buy 3200 or 2666 seems 8700k supports 2666,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the explanations .i will not give any dime for the laptop.,i am switching to desktop.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's it op, you can get like 150+ from your old cpu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i think i will go for the alderlake.,i was thinking for 3060ti or 3070 not sure.,i am playing competitively fps games so frames is important for me i will do the math and probably go for the 12700k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gtx 1060oc 6gb so it was a laptop 4 years old.,had a overheating problem than suddenly stops functioning with burnt smell.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am hardcore gamer so igpu will not work for me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
laptop.,never again ðÿ˜…,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"thicc and hot, just as i like them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
literally.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i run my ram at 3200 on my z370 strix with my 8700k and it's been fine for years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i was happy with my gaming 5, but it depends on your local market.","i had ddr4 3000, and the system had no bottlenecks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
z370 boards support xmp.,"3200 c16/ 3600 c18/ 3600 c16 kits are the sweet spot now and they all perform similarly (3600 c16 is the fastest on paper), you shouldnâ€™t go wrong with any of these.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dont know if you want to use the ram you currently have in your laptop.,but that is sodimm ram and not compatible with most motherboards.,just a heads up :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well i travel alot and cant deal with moving a full pc with screen all the time...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good to know that thank you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have never heard of this, this is, delightfully cool",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your not wrong but your wording will confuse people.,so i will try to make it more clear.,"desktops almost always use socketable lga (pads) or pga (pins)

laptops almost always use soldered bga.","but the key word is 'almost', there are a handful of laptops that use the full performance socketable cpus, typically used in desktops (for extra performance).",and there are also some desktops that use soldered bga chips typically found in laptops (to save money and better efficiency).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a lot of laptop cpus in the past have had removable cpus.,itâ€™s not uncommon just modern day companies like to solder them down now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not all laptop cpus are soldered to the board.,my last laptop (thinkpad w540) had a socketed cpu.,although it looks like intel has abandoned their old pga laptop sockets for cpus that came after it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wording is a little messy.,both of my latitude laptops all have removable cpus.,"but they are not ""desktop"" cpu's.","at-least the e5400 isn't, it is a t7250 with the ppga478 (socket m).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's not true, in this case this guy has a non-soldered cpu in his laptop (8700k)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you should mention, there's a few special very high end laptops that use desktop cpus with desktop sockets.",just to make things clearer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>did you even look at the ops post before you wrote this?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my laptop (lenovo g410) has pga socket, it's intel 4200m iirc",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

tl;dr itâ€™s about as fast as a 5900x when running at pl2 in productivity apps.,power usage is also about the same.,performs better in games and highly single threaded apps.,more power efficient in games by 20w or so.,quite efficient at 65w.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"definitely an interesting cpu, but the pricing doesn't really make sense if it's accurate.","i'm sure it does great at gaming, but for like $30 more you can get a 12600kf with the 4 extra gracemont cores",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's just a binned 12600kf which is already binned pretty hard.,"it's probably so rare that it's not worth retailing in more than 1 country, might as well be the country that it's manufactured in to keep things simple.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"intel only has an assembly and test site in china so the chip would not be made there (fabs are in usa, israel and ireland).",but china is usually where all weird limited quantity products are dumped.,the market there is strange.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, even all those engineering samples end up in china.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's a good point, you reminded me that intel's fabs are us based.",i should've said that it's because all intel cpus end up there for some reason.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's weird.,but the dl boost on alderlake is the regular avx(not 512) version of vnni that operate on 256-bit registers rather than the wider avx512 version of it.,"see here:

intel continues its leadership in the worst stock cooler section,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is a solid review.,the higher end non-k parts for alder lake also show great performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's going to be like $450 based on how they compared it to the 5900x and 12900k and refused to give a price.",it also won't be released for months.,"am4 is also effectively dead with no more upgrades coming, and it has less features than intels 600 series boards.",it also will not see any multithreaded improvements.,it's still going to get stomped by a 12700 and 12900. the 12700(f) is a mere $314 and will destroy it in mt.,i don't think you can really compare it to the 12900k or even 12700k anyways since both have extremely better mt.,the 5800x3d will be more like a 12600k with slightly better gaming performance.,100% not worth $450.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no it's not damaged.,"as for hitting 115c in bios, it's possible to do, but it should've taken a bit of time because you still have a block on it with a thermal mass of water.",next time you boot it up just make sure the pump is running.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thanks a lot for the help.,it definitely did hit 115. the next time i booted up i saw it was at 55 and it was rising 1 degree a second.,in around 1 minute it was at 115. so if it was at 115 and it shut down on its own.,that temp for that duration won't damage it right?,it's just it's brand new and it's still under warranty so i wanted to understand if it was possible to get damaged in any way.,thanks a lot for the quick reply,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

don't mean to piggyback on this post but i'm starting a new build myself and have been ootl for several years.,my main concern is regarding the amount of storage media i can use on a b660.,"i have one gen3 and one gen4 nvme, along with 2x sata ssds and 2x hdds.",so 6 storage devices in total - will there be any bandwidth issues on a b660?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it doesn't affect the processor.,"it only affects pcie devices that run off the chipset, and specifically ssds, which use enough bandwidth for it to matter.",the performance difference is zero in most cases.,"you'll only see an impact if you need to run more than one ssd off the chipset, especially in raid.",b660 is still overpriced and i would just get z690 unless it was much cheaper.,i don't like the idea of paying $200+ for a mid-range micro atx board.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bro ty!,no where i cud find this info.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no issue whatsoever.,run the gen 4 ssd off the cpu and the gen 3 off the chipset.,"you still have plenty of bandwidth left over even if you happen to be using all of your drives at the same time, which you obviously won't be.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i posted 12600k comparison results in [my review](https://adoredtv.com/reviewed-intel-i7-12700-cpu-with-noctuas-nh-u12a-and-intels-rm1-stock-cooler/) of the 12700.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is the hu review but in writing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that was my first reaction too.,so what i did was i watched the [12600k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzhwvluvork) and the [12700](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydgn4w97esk) on different monitors and compared the benchmarks.,think the results were quite similar with the 12700 mostly lagging on the 65w tests on apps and the 12700 pulling ahead on 7-zip.,but then i also realized that hu never disclosed what cooler they used for the 12600k benchmarks so i guess maybe it wouldn't have been a fair comparison?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am truly temped about cancelling i5-12600k order which should be delivered tomorrow and ordering this one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at $314 msrp for the 12700f it's definitely huge performance for the dollar.,"basically best gaming/st performance, and like you said competes with a 5900x in multithreaded, which runs about $540 these days.","but its hard to say it's the best cpu of the lineup when there are so many good choices coming out of 12th gen. with 11th gen, only like the 11400(f) was an easy recommendation against amd, now that's completely changed where most 12th gen skus are easy recommendations against zen 3. like the only segments intel does have an obvious recommendation in is workstation where the 12900k wins in st, but uses more power than a 5950x in mt, and in igp performance for people that never plan to buy a gpu, otherwise basically every other consumer segment is a win for intel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why would you overclock something that is already at 5.0ghz ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i mean it's not like the 12700kf is ""expensive"" to begin with and it also offers greater resale value in a couple years time when you decide to drop in the latest lga1700.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so sell it.,you'll get close to msrp since it's new and surely you have the box right?,won't be a hard sell,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">overclocking it is a total waste of time

i mean i have my preferred cores at 5.2ghz, the rest of the p-cores at 5.0ghz, e-cores at 4.0ghz and ring clock at 4.2ghz on my 12700k and it's a notable improvement on single and multi-core.",runs fine on an air cooler even (nh-u12a).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

oh techspot is hu in writing.,aha no wonder itâ€™s the same test suite lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm still considering the 12600. what convinced you to go with 12700 instead?,edit: looked at dudes gaming benchmarks.,yep i'm now convinced.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for 30 bucks more, the 12700f is a better choice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do it.,it's just a little more for the 12700f,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most?,i think the only mainstream cpu from amd that's truly worth considering at current prices (in the uk) is the 5600g?,and that's mainly thanks to its strong igpu and cases where that might be useful.,"though it's also decently fast still as well with a very low max power draw even compared to other zen 3 parts, and even as just a cpu alone it's price/performance isn't too bad.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
scalping cpus is a losing business unlike gpus.,they can pump out 10 cpus per top end gpu and it is not used for mining.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what?,these cpus literally sitting on store shelves,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got multi-core from 4.7 to 5.0. i was stress testing the vrm.,"someone wanted to know if i thought my motherboard could power a 12900k, so overclocking was the way to bring the power draw up to 12900k levels.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

even when not enforcing the p2 limit of 65w?,"i would think that under full load for longer times, it would ramp up massively in temps?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in the end did not go for 12700 since the price difference is about 100 usd here between the two.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, but here the difference is 100 usd in the end :( so i'm staying with the i5 pick.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

intel still doesn't have a good answer to the 5950x.,intel doesn't yet have the ability to put 16 high performance cores in a desktop cpu.,amd's problem is they don't have the i/o to match.,x570 is amd's best chipset and it has similar connectivity as b660 which is a budget chipset.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why even bother,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
haven't run it.,"i don't have any issues running cb r23, xtu benchmark or kombuster cpu burner though which all tax the cpu far more than i use it in day to day use.",i think max power load i've seen on chip when benchmarking was 303w but it doesn't usually exceed 275w in heaviest loads i've run and for gaming never goes anywhere near 200w.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>even when not enforcing the p2 limit of 65w?,"the most demanding ""real life"" load i found was cinebench, which consumed 150w on average.","while not 100% comparable because it's slightly less demanding, even the worst cooler i've tested handles the 12900k with plenty of thermal headroom when limited to 140w

big oof :(,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's because x570 and zen 3 are out for quite a while.,with zen 4 and am5 they'll be toe to toe with intel again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, the 5950x is still unmatched as a mainstream workstation cpuâ€¦ but it also increasingly looks like a dumb halo product.",i donâ€™t think amd will be able to price these things at $750-800 anymore now that intelâ€™s shown themselves capable of planting $500-600 i9 skus within single digits of them in multicore.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, but i am not really into gaming lately and i just need an upgrade over my current i5-6500 for work related stuff; even the i5-12600k is going to be a huge jump in reducing compilation times etc., so i am not really complaining (and can use the $100 for more important things) :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"am4 was already 4 years old when zen 3 came out, which explains the lackluster i/o for such a beast of a cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the $700 street price for a 5950x is totally reasonable.,it fills an important niche between mainstream desktop and hedt / workstation.,x299 is a dinosaur and even the cheapest threadripper is way more expensive.,amd generally has an advantage with motherboard pricing.,the problem here is that you have to spend a fortune on a motherboard that borrows cpu pcie lanes from the graphics card if you want to get around the bandwidth limitations of am4.,raptor lake is going to be a beast.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh yeah, a 12600k will be a gigantic upgrade for you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would for sure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on what you're doing with it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is the biggest performance jump intel has done in a decade.,and the prices absolutely don't reflect that (aka they are fairly cheap for what they are).,your 7700k also doesn't have official window 11 support.,"and while people have mixed opinions on it now, most people weren't happy with w10 on launch and now it has like 70% of the windows marketshare, so you'll likely want to use windows 11 at some point.",even the low end 12400f for $167 would be a big upgrade from your 7700k.,but you might want to get something better than that.,"plus there's now intel 7 node (more efficient than 14nm), pcie 5.0, new usb speeds and type-c, etc.",i upgraded form a 9700k to 12700k and am happy with that decision.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is it a good time to get twice the ips and more than twice the cores?,"gee, i don't know.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have upgraded from 9700k to 12900k and it actually made a huge difference, i mostly play games on 1440p.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i went from 7700k to 11400f and then to 11700k, as due to the pricing being completely out of whack, i sold the 11400f for more than i bought it.","the jump from 7700k to 11400f was dramatic, to say the least and then the move to 11700k pushed even farther.",you will have a very good time if you upgrade now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah i thought potential short circuit that's why i felt convinced at first it when i took off the cooler and it posted until i simply placed an air cooler without brackets or anything and then it began boot looping as if the added weight/pressure was to much for the socket... i've had a good look at the pins/contact pads on the cpu/socket and all look perfect.,i must of just got unlucky with the board :/ appreciate the info though brother!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"early leaks say amd will also move to big.little with zen 5. chill out a little, these companies plan their releases many years in advance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
some people.,was it really that traumatic ?,?,"i would love to see what you would say for 13th gen, which will be just an iteration on current gen. stagnation eh?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"amd are currently more interested in the server market but even so 3d cache is a huge innovation especially in that market also the future for 3d cache may be more than just adding additional cache to a cpu, the process amd have developed for bonding and stacking chips also they managed to thin down the main cpu die to accommodate it.","big little architecture in the server market is kind of pointless, especially for x86 based platforms because if they need that functionality they could just use arm based machines and do it much cheaper and much more efficiently.","the 7th gen amd cpu's will be the ones to watch out for, zen 4 architecture with all full fat cores, possibly stacked cache and if tsmc's claims about the 5nm process are to be believed  it will almost certainly come in more efficient than anything intel can make.","meanwhile in the intel camp they need to get back on the ball with power consumption, especially if they want to be competing in the data center market in the coming years.",meanwhile thread director is good and all but it still has issues with enterprise applications and virtualisation on 12th gen is kind of weird with the e cores not being able to be used fully if they are allocated to a vm and compatability with anything that isn't windows is kind of all over the place.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is zero resemblance to the the excavator lineup.,"first of all, zen 3 is still a very good core ipc wise, compared to the excavator and bulldozer lineup in general.","plus, zen 3+ is just a stop gap towards the real next gen which is zen 4.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"amd's ces has been disappointing, but competition is good for consumers, so its a shame they didnt have better products to show off.","the 5800x3d with no price, no release date, lower frequencies than the 5800x, extremely disappointing when you could just get a 12700f for $314 and have similar gaming performance, cheaper price (guarantee it), and stomp it in multithread.","the 6000 mobile is what was expected of it, decent igp bump but not enough to make them cheap gaming laptops, especially since they cut down the igp on the cheaper processors- you know the ones that wont have a dgpu, the ones with the better igp will probably have a dgpu anyways..

while intel seemingly did a good job with their non-k skus, b660 pricing, and mobile cpu performance gains.","we will see when more reviews are out (ive only seen a couple early ones), but it looks like outside of the top end multi-thread 5950x vs 12900k, every other segment is intels, unless you desperately need igp performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
finally someone speaks the truth.,"when alder lake was released and all the skus were competing with a tier higher of the amd 5000 series, this subreddit was flooded with people saying â€œjust wait for zen 3d.â€ well itâ€™s here, and itâ€™s wholly disappointing.",only the 58003d with the lower end market completely neglected.,a $167 12400f achieves the same performance as a $299 5600x.,intel is even offering sub $150 i3â€™s and pentiums for the ultra low budget.,i donâ€™t care how you slice it.,amd has fucked itself until 7000 is released.,thatâ€™s 3 quarters of intel dominating the low & mid end consumer cpu market.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
back and forth is the best way to ensure rapid innovation.,"just look how far weâ€™ve come since 2017.

regarding this generation: alderlake mobile vs rembrandt 
cpu performance looks to be an intel win.","on desktop, you needs to compare 12600k to a 5800x.","6p+8e vs amd 8c/16t
except maybe not that hard since maximum multi threaded performance consumes a lot more power on intel desktop which will cut into the lead.",also rembrandt is monolithic and on 6nm which means even more efficiency compared to desktop.,"intel win, but closer than one would expect.",we also have yet to see how zen3+ performs and how zen reacts to ddr5 memory.,"regarding graphics though, this is likely gonna be an amd clean sweep.",the best of intels graphics edge out amds 8cus of vega.,"now that they are moving to 12cus of rdna2 and at faster clockspeeds, iâ€™m expecting an over doubling of performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"amd has a different mindset towards the industry, they're building big on cache layouts, bigger, more complex cores, and efficiency.","frankly, seeing how fast their cores are, while still being ""big"" and over one year old, i can't really blame them for that line of thinking.","it's good that intel has their niche, while amd keeps theirs as well - it gives us set of different products and technologies to pursuit.","zen 4 sounds awesome, so as raptor lake.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i make a different reading.,amd doesn't need big.little stuff because their most power cores are already very efficient.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well i am no oracle, but biglittle designs open the door for other designs.",like big/medium/little.,"that is for me, the key innovation is on the threaddirector, whether the implementation will be with 2, 3, or n different types of nodes can be fine-tuned.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3d cache is junk for ryzen, the 5800x lost 200mhz top, 400mhz base

and after 6+ months of working on it, there's no 12,16core with 3d cache

so it will die out pretty fast, i doubt very much they will have stock

still with my 3900x after 2years, nothing really worth upgrading to from zen2 on amd side",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
too soon to reveal too much about zen 4 i guess.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hopefully b660 is actually decently affordable.,"intel just made their best cpu generation since at least the core 2 days, but they havenâ€™t made a good platform in a while.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
limited number of wafers.,amd are selling whatever they can produce.,this is the reason no price cuts on ryzen skus and the very same reason only one model with 3d cache was launched and that too with single chiplet.,they are prioritizing higher margin data center market while leaving mid range to low end market for intel up for grabs (can easily be win with superior products later).,datacenter market is hard to grab but once you are able to win a design it goes a long way (multiple upgrades over next 3-5 years).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why so much hatred?,you sounded like amd murdered your love ones.,rejoice that intel rises up because amd pressured them.,else you will still be using 4 core cpus.,"in the end, we as customers win.",thatâ€™s the most important.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel went for small cores because big cores were not die efficient.,16 big cores may not be financially feasible due to defect rate and very high power consumption.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, 3d cache is a bit too expensive for the average consumer market, but it will be quite a hit for the server market",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"its not a consumer product, even on the 5800x its a prosumer product, gaming and normal productivity are likely to see little or no benefit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

edit: there is a msi z690 itx but its 150â‚¬ more expensive than asus rog z690 itx...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what a stupid move from intel.,this is the first generation that's been a thing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seems unlikely.,1 dimm per channel is better for overclocking.,2 dimm per channel require chaining or t-topology.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
according to asus prime h610m-a d4-csm and prime h610m-e d4 specs they have dual channel memory.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah!,i think it'll be updated when all manufacturers announce their stuff officially.,"a bunch of them got leaked earlier, so it's only a matter of time till it's updated :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
annoying how it only has a single m.2 slot.,deal breaker for me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you are missing the h610 itx option from asrock

i created my own post, summary of all itx ddr4 boards i could dig up

[https://www.reddit.com/r/intel/comments/ryds2s/alder\_lake\_itx\_ddr4\_motherboards\_all\_in\_one\_place/](https://www.reddit.com/r/intel/comments/ryds2s/alder_lake_itx_ddr4_motherboards_all_in_one_place/)

also the msi z690 itx is ddr5, type on one of its spec pages got me excited that it was ddr4 as it has some very nice features (3 m.2 and tb4).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i checked the specs and manuals for a variety of asus, asrock and gigabyte boards to try and figure out what the deal is, and all of the documentation does indeed state dual channel.","i'm wondering if this is an error on intel's data slide, or another late change to the platform which wasn't corrected in time.","it's worth noting that every h610 board i've seen so far only features two dimm slots, so they may have meant to state something along the lines of ""system memory dimms per channel.""",hopefully we'll find out soon.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, my bad omitted that one as i was just not considering getting a h610 lol.",currently looking at either a gigabyte b660i or z690i depending on whichever one shows up first in my country for a reasonable price as well of course.,"(only z690i ddr5 available atm here)

was considering asrock z690/h670i as well but not too sure about that nic.",can recommend you go [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1addrvgwj_f4b6uc7_iftdivudvc8cj8sxluqlxvscz4/edit#gid=523597416) to compare the boards,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you looking at dimms per channel?,all that means is that the h chipsets are limited to 2 modules since there are two channels.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
right?,"i bought h410 boards for my roommates when i upgraded them, i didn't even bother looking at that.",that absolutely sucks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this is the slide the articles are basing it on: https://images.anandtech.com/doci/17162/2022_ces_pre-brief_dec%2015%20final-page-029.jpg

here's the chipset spec sheet: https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/218829/intel-h610-chipset.html

h510 also shows 1 dimm for that data field and supported dual channel, so it definitely looks like it was a major mistake on the press slide.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah i am also worried about h610 as well, mostly for power delivery/stability to the 12900k that i would be pairing it with.","but honestly the io of the h610 is likely sufficient, i could drop down to a single m.2 and deal with the slower usb 3 (5gbps) without much disruption.",but would rather spend a little more for h670 if they would be available at around the $200 mark.,"i am thinking the h610 boards will be around $100-130 price mark, with b660 around â‰ˆ$160 and h670 $200+ but we'll see with all the shortages what actual prices end up...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yep, that was the slide i was referring to.",somebody goofed!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
perfectly fine temps!,enjoy your games :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
70-75c is perfectly fine long-term.,"you only need to begin to think about cooling when temps exceed 90 degrees, as it is typically when thermal throttling will take place.",the system can sit 24/7 at that temperature and itll be happy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i didn't understand this statement towards the end of the article -   
""intel also made a handful of other small announcements about its laptop lineup, including an update to the intel evo branding umbrella that includes wi-fi 6e connectivity, and the briefest of mentions about a discrete intel arc gpu for laptops with h-series chips.","the company shared very little about this mobile arc gpu in its press conference other than the fact that it exists, but we'll be keeping an eye out for more information.""","didn't everyone catch the ""iris xe <--> alchemist"" interfacing presentation in intel evo laptops?",was i just watching a different version?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
where do i buy these?,!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this will be great for my next work laptop.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that just means that amd supports higher memory speeds for lpddr5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the intel cpus also support ddr4, the amd cpus don't.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
technically true but what does it have to do with the question?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the title is a statement with a question mark at the end.,the question in your post is meaningless.,what part do you think is an error and why?,having lower officially supported speeds due to the imc supporting both ddr4 and ddr5 makes sense to me.,"alder lake desktop officially supports ddr5-4800 and ddr4-3200, although 6600 is on the xmp qvl.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you know you could have said this in the first place, right?","these are laptops, do they even have xmp?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
some laptops do have xmp option.,not very common but they do exist.,supporting both ddr4 and ddr5 memory types will inevitably require more complex memory controller design which can have negative effect on maximum achievable memory frequency.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this week unless your in a region that gets delayed releases.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"depends on the market, some countries are already selling them.",i would guess that they should hit every market in a week or something like that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the i5-12600 is a pretty pointless sku.,"get the 12400, 12600k or 12700 instead, imo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
h670 is delayed?,i wanted an itx h670 :(,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you would think that was important info to show as ces.,but all these companies do is shill their ai tech.,ces is basically an investor infomercial as this point.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
theyâ€™re on sale here already but really expensive in my region (uk),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you will keep checking local stores and online sites,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok so just keep searching local stores and online sites i guess.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not thinking of going with k model z690 boards are out of budget for me.,so 12400 i guess,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for $30 more than the 12400, you get 33% more igpu cores",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i already checked that asus made only rog strix b560 boards last gen and no rog strix h570 boards, b660 and z690 seems like the focus mostly.","and the only b660 rog strix mitx boards from asus i found where ddr5, kind of messed up imo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thats just the stupid asus one with ddr5.,none of these mid range boards should have ddr5 or cost as much as the asus does.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the current asus rog strix b660 for pre order is an idiot motherboard.,why make a motherboard that high end for a non overclocking platform?,"yes the memory can be overclocked, but you can do that on any plain board.","no itxs from msi this generation at all it seems, or at least you can't buy any.",just high end / low end from asus or asrock.,"fortunately my main case is being upgraded to a lian li air mini today so for that i no longer need to stick o itx boards, but i will be using it in matx mode (customizable backplates) as the atx mode prevents a lot of cooling options at the tops and bottom.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
kind of seems they realised too late that ddr5 is not ready yet for meeting demand.,like i only find asus ddr5 mitx boards wtf.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i would want a high end b660 strix board, it's not stupid, but its not ddr4.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
long story short the e-cores basically have similar performance to your 8700k cores.,while the p-cores are significantly faster.,"as to which is recommend, get the 12700k it has all 8 p-cores (best for gaming long term) and has 4 e-cores (great multithreaded support).","the 12900k is overkill unless you absolutely need the best multithreaded performance (like it's your job to render models or compile code)

in terms of overclocking, there is less performance to gain on modern cpus, and overclocking comes with a lot worse efficiency (higher heat, power use) and with an air cooler there isn't much wiggle room.","so the 12700k, 12700kf (no igp) or 12700 (no overclocking), or 12700f (no overclocking and no igp), are the cpus you should be looking at.",from most expensive to least.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"don't save $20 buying an f. if your gpu ever dies or has a hiccup, you'll really appreciate having an easy igpu solution, especially when it happens in the middle of the night.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in my country, igpu cpus are about 50euros more.","its better to have an older, cheap gpu lying around for when u need it, rather than spending that much money for a barely useable igpu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
basically the same performance at 1080p and above as a 5600x but uses 40% less power than the 5600x.,"and only costs $167..

yeah, that's impressive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the i5 12400 with ddr4 ram seems like the next best budget build.,very impressive!,now to wait for budget motherboards,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
power consumption while gaming is tremendous.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how does it compare to the 11400 ?,is the price diff worth it ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"price wars, here we come!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
motherboards are a bit pricy though vs b550.,not enough to make it a tie but enough to close the perf/$ gap significantly.,a small 5600x price drop though and that gap is closed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">tremendous

choice of that word threw me off, i thought the power consumption was too high!",checked the review and pleased to see the 12400 is sipping power at under 40 w mostly.,"a promising product, but i wonder if it's overkill for pairing with a more modest gpu like 3060 or the new 3050. the 12400 and its f variant would be the cheapest 6-core cpu on the market currently anyway, i suppose.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you already have an 11400, its not worth buying a new motherboard+cpu to upgrade to.","but if you dont, there are good gains and it uses a lot less power.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, strangely the review has neither the 11400 nor 10400 to compare with 12400. an oversight in an otherwise quality review.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
honestly if they released b660 we'll have proper competition and then i expect a 5600x price drop,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
b660 pricing starts around $120 based on the ones that have been announced already.,motherboard pricing is no longer an issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why are you being down voted for an obvious point?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i already bought the 11400 a month ago.,i didn't know they were making a 12400 otherwise i think i could've waited a little longer.,the 11400 is a beast anyway so no big lost.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the prices of b660 starts at 175â‚¬ at the moment where i live, b550 starts at 60â‚¬ with boards i consider good at 100â‚¬.",the 5600x is 290â‚¬ and the 12400f 213â‚¬.,"total cost for the 5600x+good b550=390â‚¬, 12400f+b660= 388â‚¬.",unless the b660 motherboards gets a bit cheaper it's not a clear win for intel where i live.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was thinking b660.,igor did a comparison with the b660 mortar wifi ddr4 vs b550 mortar and there was a 70 euro difference in his market.,not seen the prices in the uk market to do a similar like for like comparison.,in any event while amd could do a price drop match the price/perf proposition they can't match the perf/watt and there is every possibility amd would rather eol the 5600x and use those dies elsewhere than drop prices.,it really depends on a lot of factors which we are not privy to.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ah that's good to know.,where i am a good b550 board is about 140 euro so it's definitely up to regional pricing.,but good competition is always healthy for us,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think the the watt usage is nice.,i was thinking 5600x fo but my next sffpc but now i'm thinking 12400,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
launching this week and next depending on your region,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thanks!,"that shop looks sketchy af, doesnt it?",and anyway the price is just 20 bucks less than the k version on amazon.,might end up pairing a k with a b660 board (which is what im trying to avoid).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the b660 mobos on scan are more expensive than a few of the z690's.,i was waiting for b660 specifically for the drop in price :(,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thatâ€™ll be an interesting one to see - does the ipc gain make it pull ahead of a 10th gen i5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its supposed to match a 11400 from that early benchmark.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™ll probably match a 10400 in multi-core.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

rembrandt says hi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think p28w cpus are  most interesting.,> 2 performance cores and still will be part of thin and light laptops.,i hope they launch later this quarter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so the newest generation is the fastest?,weird.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
considering the amount of skus iâ€™d say they havenâ€™t solved a lot of issues they face with the node,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wait till you hear something like a 1.9kg legion slim 7 can sustain 65w.,"hell, macbook pro 16â€ could do 65w.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
didn't amd just announce the fastest mobile processor ever too?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rembrandt is just kabylakeâ€™d on the cpu side.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"~~9+ months until that release though afaik, not exactly what i would call relevant competition.~~

never mind that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28w segment has no chance against rembrandt.,alderlake will shine in higher tdp segments.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why do you say that?,they have good yields.,they are releasing a 12900ks variant at 5.5ghz!!!,"that's just 500mhz away from 6ghz ...

who knows... we may see 6ghz from a consumer aio soon...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"under stress tests well cooled laptops can draw upwards of 90-120w

most will thermal throttle without liquid metal though.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rembrandt is not zen4.,"notebooks with it ships next month, same as adl.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i dont know why you are downvoted.,it's just a 2 horse race for x86 consumer laptops.,intel and amd can both compete.,the world needs more computing.,and china's market is huge.,india will be becoming more and more online in the coming decades.,so i believe the market demand is there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it remains to be seen what that 'segment' is.,"what amd is doing this year is that they gut their ryzen 5 offerings, because those have been too popular at midrange prices.",last year the rift between the ryzen 7 and ryzen 5 igpu were not that great.,"(vega 7 vs vega 8, barely 1 missing cu and vega 8 is actually clocked lower).","this year, the ryzen 7 igpu is doubled in cus and clocked higher compared to its ryzen 5 counterpart.","looking at the claimed numbers, the 6600u will barely outperform the 5600u, while its bigger brother the 6800u stars in higher-end ultrabooks.","the p-series will prove quite an adversary to the 6800u at the sub-1000 ultrabook range, while depending on how much the 6600u brings, the 12th gens will probably be sharing the scene.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
base clocks are only low for all core.,for low thread intel has been boosting much higher than amd but they had no e cores to mitigate the higher power floor required on tigerlake.,"if they can actually get their lower power band (15~45w) comparable to amd then the question will be can rembrandt compete, since its rembrant is still zen 3 with an ipc deficit compared to zen 3 desktop and alderlake.","on the gpu side rembrant looks like it will easily roll over intel's offerings, though.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i won't be surprised if 13900ks is the first 6 ghz sku.,intel engineers have done an amazing job salvaging 10nm from the mess it was back in 2017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because of the sheer amount of skus..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you make a compelling argument.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that could be true, can you offer up evidence that more product skus mean lower yields on the node?",i see intel instead opening up new fabs with 10nm (intel 7).,"fab 42 in chandler, arizona opened in 2020. and they will be opening fab 52 by 2024 also in arizona to manufacture intel 7 and beyond nodes.",this is in addition to intel's existing fabs that were manufacturing 14nm chips.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"given that they're combining two different architecture cores, it makes sense that they'd have twice as many skus as previous gen since they likely have to bin nearly twice as many chips now for two different architectures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah ces was mostly trash for all 3 amd, nvidia and intel",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
personally i couldn't understand a thing about performance of any of the future products they mentioned.,seems we gotta wait for a real presentation and reviews from tech youtubers :/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel wasted my time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s funny to me.,"despite intelâ€™s presenters being by far the most bafflingly incompetent of the 3, they had easily the best products.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ok that was a little funny - seeing mobileeye advertise their latest chip being on 5nm..   a tsmc process..  during the intel broadcast,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"all of mobileye silicon has always been on tsmc, nothing new there.","it's like a subsidiary, acquired in 2017 but basically separate",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i know - it was just funny that literally during the intel keynote, intel brought mobileeye in,  whom took the time to talk about someone else's process.",doesn't anyone see the humor in that?,":) 

it's like in the usa when chevrolet made fun of a feature that a ford pickup track had..  that chevrolet didn't.",they effectively advertised their competitor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not really.,automotive life cycles are super long.,"the eyeq announced today won't be productized until 2025.

but don't forget, intel made the mistake of switching silicon too early when they acquired altera.","they moved all future products from tsmc to intel 10nm, and when 10nm stalled, altera was stuck with designs in the pipe and no way to manufacture them.","altera's market share plummeted, and intel's large acquisition dropped significantly in value.",it still hasn't recovered.,there's no point moving too quickly on these things.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ok if i can't share dry humor with a brit then i'm culturally lost :) 

(they could have highlighted their products during the keynote without drawing attention to using a competitors process..  that would have been a little more of an internally politically astute thing to do :)  i agree completely they're using the right process for the right reasons, currently..)

1) isn't 3200 mhz considered as part of the jedec / factory frequency of ddr4?","i asked that because even a 12600k can support up to 3200 without modification  
am i getting that right?",2) are you using the f6a firmware?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i also have an i5 12600k in it.,"coming from an i7 4770k, i'm just amazed how good this platform performs, the price point in my opinion was pretty decent for a z690 board, mine was 239â‚¬.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3200 cl20 22 and 24 are jedec anything better than that is not jedec.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1. i would guess so, but i've even tried manual oc to 3600mhz cl17 and it ran fine i guess a part of some minor instability during test

what motherboard do you have?,gigabyte z690 release bios has memory oc issues.,i have 4000 cl15 sticks and it would not post at all if i enabled xmp and set it to gear 1. i had to up the vccsa voltage to 1.25v and ddram voltage to 1.5v.,i later updated to the newest bios version and now it posts if i turn on xmp gear 1 without me messing with voltages.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
z690m aorus elite ax - apparently the only matx board available in ddr4 flavor.,i did see a bios update with 'improved memory compatibility' in the gb support page for the board - also the one that allows the disabling of e-cores for compatibility.,i'll install that and see how it works.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i'm 5 years deep with my 7700k too and i'm waiting for a 12 core intel chip with only real performance cores, none of that mobile tier eco core garbage.",hopefully 13th gen delivers but if not then i'll have to wait for 14th.,"i am not under any pressure to upgrade as of today and with it overclocked to a modest 4.8ghz, my cpu-z scores are much fairer than these reference stock numbers.","533 single, and 2900 multi.","chip still has the same ipc as any 8th, 9th or 10th gen chip and so is still quite relevant.","4 cores is getting long in the tooth but i blame sloppy, wasteful coding practices for any real issues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well deserved.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think it's worth noting that the 7700k released at the end of a decade long streak of 4c being the most you could get on a regular consumer grade platform.,"the 11700k was a similarly lame release, but 8c in 2021 was more modern and high end than 4c was in 2017. most pc builders are still on 6c cpus like the 12400 and 5600x.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">7700k adopters were basically blindsided by coffee lake

this is somewhat me except with kaby.",i bit the bullet and grabbed a 7900x kaby lake barely a year after getting a 7700k.,wanted the extra cores for productivity.,"7900x has been a great workhorse for a mix of productivity and gaming, but it's starting to show it's age where single thread performance has any importance.","will probably upgrade at the end of 2022 - presumably comparing raptor lake vs amd zen 4. 
looking for cpu value, performance, but good ddr5 and pcie-5 support will be super important too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sometimes i wonder why they even bothered releasing the 11th gen at all.,"often times in desktop benchmarks it came out too similar or *barely* better than the respective 10th gen. i only have an 11th gen now because it came in my framework, but i wasn't necessarily ecstatic about it, i might've preferred ryzen or even intel 10th gen over the new one.","12th is a monster, indeed, but i still wonder why 11th even released and didn't get cut off before production.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well obviously people will list it as ""flagship processor"" i7 to sell",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what do you expect when i3-103xxs are still selling at i5 prices?,prices won't always drop with relative performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same here!,still gaming hard with a 6700k and a 1080ti!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i'm still rocking my 6600k.,works fine for my needs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my 6700k is delidded, overclocked, and makes one hell of a plex server.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this.,"had a 6700k @ 5ghz, and a 7700k @ 5.1ghz.",nothing could touch those chips.,people forget how slow zen 1/2 was for gaming.,itâ€™s why i had intel for gaming and threadripper for work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yea dude this 12100f is a monster in single core performance, i originally bought my i3 10105f for its pretty good single core performance cuz i play my fav game which is planetside 2 and its a game that really loves single core performance, but damn seeing this makes me wish i waited a little longer to get this 12100f instead.",damnn it man lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1080/1080ti is an one in a decade situation.,"those cards rock at 1080p even in 2021, of course no fancy things like dlss/rt or >144fps but still holding if you can't manage to get a 3000 series at a affordable/reasonable price.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nah, i got a 1080 ti and iâ€˜m fine.","itâ€˜s not holding me back at all, itâ€˜s still better than a 3060. the 7700k on the other handâ€¦especially when doing productivity tasks like editing my astrophotography is just plain annoying.",it aged horribly and i run it ocâ€˜d to 4.8ghz stable.,"also 6-8 cores a becoming standard for games, while the 1080 ti is still beasty if you donâ€˜t care about rtx.",best piece of hardware i ever bought.,i do regret the 7700k tho.,"my next system is probably gonna be all amdâ€¦i need better multicore performance, and although the newest intel are great, the new ryzen gen will probably trump them in multicore performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i am gaming sub-100 fps on both 1440p and in vr, and i am mostly held back by either the gpu (3080) or the ram.","cyberpunk runs 70-80 fps, while dcs in vr ironically only uses half of the threads.","i am looking to upgrade by the end of this year, but even then the primary driver will be the need for better ram which is more often a bottleneck.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have 3770k with a 1080 too and it does the job well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"mine is entering it's last year of service, but actually still does he job.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"similar here, but the echo chamber says 7700k is obsolete.","i just posted above that in my use case having only 16gb ram is a far worse bottleneck, and will be the primary reason to upgrade to a new (ddr5) platform once it matures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i don't quite know about workstation/server so i can't have any useful recommendations for you, just some feedback about getting a 12900k.",i'm gonna say it's overkill for gaming and also inefficient for a 24/7 calculator (i'm a researcher on fem structural simulation).,"also, it's not a good idea to have a desktop, consumer grade psu and graphic card for a workstation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think he just upgraded it.,it's not common for a processor to just die.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's not that it's bad, it's that finally it has been completely outperformed by the lowest product of the lineup.",it no longer serves as a higher end part that is still on par with things releasing today.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"still a bit quicker than a 2 year old i3, i guess it won't be that far behind a 12100 either if you put some actually good memory with manually trimmed timings... haha",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
imo intel should go with 12 large cores (along with a similar number of e-cores) in 14gen meteor lake so there's actually a real difference between i9 and i7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep.,imagine where'd we be if amd didn't finally step up.,"pretty sure most builders are still on 4 core cpu's, and that 12100 is the new flagship after the hardly available 3300x.","gamers on steam show higher end cpu's, and they are still selling plenty of the 10th gen intels (bought several 10700k this holiday), and 3k ryzens.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but why did 11th drop 2c??,"the 10th was actually competing with ryzen zen 2 back on release, at least in gaming, then they drop 2c off the flagship and it just completely flopped.","i'm a massive intel fan, but even i was thinking of switching to amd during that era, had i needed to build a new system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think it was largely an r&d effort and they hoped to recoup some of the costs by releasing.,intel wanted to learn how to build a backportable architecture.,it was probably a hedge as well in case alder lake got delayed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the i5-11400f was great.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
framework?,you mean the laptop?,"11th gen mobile (tiger lake) is a huge upgrade over 10th gen mobile, both ice lake (10nm) and comet lake (14nm).",it's nothing like 11th gen desktop rocket lake.,"tiger lake has better ipc and is on a better process node, it was one of the biggest upgrades in years until alder lake.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well one of the big things rocket lake released with was was avx-512 support.,"alder lake doesnt officially support it, but rocket lake does.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my guess is that 11 gen went not as planned but it was too late to cancel it, so they released it anyway",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my card is older - 980ti in sli...an obnoxiously power hog  but i can live with it.,not into modern games that does not take advantage of sli.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the best combo.,"as time passes, the 1080ti just looks ever better lol.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice!!,that is too much power for a server.,i am still surprised that i got this elitebook g1 4770k used as a dlna server and it is still powerful (4k streaming) while doing some simul but light applications.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well at some point you say ""fuck it i cant wait forever"".",i really needed a laptop for uni and kept waiting for tiger lake h as it was supposed to be really strong.... no stock was available until dec 2021 and i needed a laptop by oct 2021. so i went zen 3 with a 5800h instead.,bit of a compromise as its around 12-15% slower but eh.,its no slouch and it can match a 3800x/11700k in multicore easily.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yup, i still remember choosing between 3300x and 10105f which single core performance is almost the same, but the price and availability is really huge difference in my country, that's why i picked 10105f for my casual gaming system (that love single core performance of course - heroes of newerth and aoe4).","well,, its time to upgrade to lga1700 (if the red team didn't release any new/refresh cpu 4c/8t skus).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you won't regret going to amd as someone who upgraded from a 7700k to a 5950x.,my 7700k and motherboard have been relegated to nas duty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same.,perfect setup.,"havenâ€™t really needed to upgrade, tho i do want to eventually",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"mine is looking at the 12700k boxed, and it doesn't like what he sees.","but he was a good boy, so i'll keep it as a backup.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i wonder if this still stands if the 7700k is oc'd as it should be, it seems the benchmark was done against base clock only.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"would you recommend an upgrade to ""the lowest product of the lineup""/ is the performance increase to cost ratio that good?","i use an asus prime z270-p, i7 7700k, an rtx 3060, 32 gb ram and my case is pretty busted",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the sad thing is that many people are already falling back into the old mindset of â€œlol amd bad, intel goodâ€, which isnâ€™t helpful to anyone.",some people just never grew up past high school it seems.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
die area.,2 more cores would have simply made the die too big to fit in lga 1200.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you mean zen 3?,thereâ€™s no way a 3900x is out gaming a 10900k for example.,and even zen 3 was a toss up against 10th gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they should've just released the i5 and i7 and said ""no i9 this time, wait until the end of the year"" instead of tarnishing the i9 brand.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"looking at benchmarks again to refresh myself (i barely paid attention to 11th after the massive disappointment i had in intel) i see that the i5-11600k was supposed to be ""the people's favorite"" at the favorable price and ""holding its own"" against amd, while still coming up short.","i don't have direct benches of the 11400, but comparing it to those benchmarks, i assume it's better due to price?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"sure, itâ€™s a bit overkill, but it was left over from a few upgrades ago.",and the 6700k handles transcodes like a champ due to the hw acceleration.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12700k (especially as it has a 7 in it ;) would be also my weapon of choice now.,"the reason i'm waiting for an upgrade is that i want a good ddr5 platform, and that is not available today still, so i'm sitting on my hands.","btw i think my 7700kis also a keeper, the kids will get it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what's the cost ratio to you?,for all i've seen it's cheaper to go for 12100+b660 than 7700k+z270.,that's why it no longer is worth to search for that combo unless you get a really good deal for it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think it's more that people are annoyed with the amd stock crowd overruning any subs remotely related to hardware and sperging out non-stop.,"when zen 1 came out, and didn't outperform skylake gn and hub were getting death threats.",after a certain point when a brand has fans that obnoxious people start to associate it with the brand itself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ye it was 160â‚¬, was better than the 10400, 20% better than the ryzen 5 3600 and the ryzen 5 5600x was more than 300â‚¬.","imo the 11900k should not have existed, 11700(k) and 11600(k) was okay for oems to get sth new and 11400 was epic value.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well not really, they made back their investment and it's not like adl would have released any faster â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)\_/â¯

generally 3600 is better but we donâ€™t know the price difference and the timings which are pretty important,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3200 cl14 i read is on par with 3600 cl18 - 3600 cl18 is more available than the former too and from my searching when choosing ram, cheaper too.",3600 also is better suited to gear 1 as it's natively in sync so i'd go with 3600 really.,"plus, that's what i have and just today managed to get working stable with no errors so far in karhu ram test!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3200cl16 and 3600cl18 are similar.,identical 1wl for instance.,"3200cl14 is far superior, especially if flat 14. i run my flat 14 kit at 3866-15-16-16-34 for instance.","op, if you aren't ocing, get a kit of 3600cl16 stuff and call it a day.","if you are, are you targeting gear1 or gear2?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
one should always target g1 on alder lake with ddr4.,"even if you have a good overcloking kit and can boot 4800mhz at g2, it usually lags behind some 3600c16.","for instance, i run my ram at 3733 14-14-14-28 t1 g1 and it benchmarks better than 4600 and looser timings g2.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, but gear 2 is fun-er ðÿ˜‚

everything you said is correct though, there are only marginal benefits in certain workloads on gear 2, and gear1 it's probably what you want to target most of the time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

would have been really bad ass if they made a i3 12300k that was 4p cores 2 e cores for say 200$.,i feel like a ton of people would chose that chip over the 12400 because of the overclocking potential and it would offer 2 e cores for background tasks so you can get that sweet gaming fps.,"iâ€™d call it the best budget chip ever lol product stack would be i9 8p8e, i7 8p4e, i5 6p4e, i3 4p2e.",seeing how intel is upping core counts with 13th gen maybe itâ€™ll make the i3 have a k sku.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"er, the 12400f where i live with cost $210, also i bought this for review only, my main rig already has a 12700k and a z690 board",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just look at his profile he has a lot of different hardware,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"comparing f to f it's an 80 dollar gap, that buys a couple games that won't tell the difference unless you are at 1080p low with a 3080.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, 10th gen i3 and 3300x were a wash depending on application.",7700k walked away when overclocked though as 10th gen i3 had same ipc and lower clocks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you mean 10 gen i3, it mostly matched the 7700k, and lost when the 7700k was overclocked.","11 gen, was win some, lose some, like all 11th gen vs their counterparts.",this one will thrash it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
reviews are yet to be uploaded.,i5 with just 6 cores basically challenge the once mighty 10 core 10900k.,6v10 it's a technical tie.,"it's just expected that this i3 can challenge even the 8700k, that wasn't far behind the 9700k on gaming, but maybe that's a bit of a stretch, given it's only 4 cores, and some games these days can ocupy 6 and 8 easily.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 12300 matches the multithreaded of a 9700 non-k and the single of the 12400. i would say the i3 would take the win in most scenarios but we will have to see.,9700k overclocked would pull ahead in multithreaded a bit but not catch up in single.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are having stores?,"(yes, i did indeed ask if you had stores, let alone stocks)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i can't even look up the specs on this thing.",=p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is the price more or less than msrp?,(97usd = intel msrp),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but what motherboard are you going to use?,a z690 with this?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
damn!,that thing should be more performant than a 1135g7 then!!,for some reason i thought this was going to be an 6 or 8 core though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so, i7",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most of them are ddr4 right?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ohhhhhhh please please bench the g6900 i'd like to see if it matches my 6700k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
damn already on par?,bruh maybe i should've waited for the 12100 to release before getting my i3 10105f lol oh well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"12100 non f is â£40 less than the 12400f in the uk, so the 12100f will be even less.","between the i5 prices, it was only a â£50 gap between the 12400f and 12600.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah okay, you're right.","trashing is not matching, forgot that",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ah, thanks!",thatâ€™s wild.,"i wonâ€™t be upgrading anytime soon, but i know the time will eventually come for me now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it doesn't matter how many cores you have only what they are capable of in total.,threading a process does not force it to need a certain number of cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

how much did the board cost?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
$280 is what i paid,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which g.skill 3600 kit?,are the timings 16-19-19 at 1.35v?,that stuff is crap.,buy the 4000 16-16-16 kit itâ€™s like $20-30 extra.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was an intern and it was a great experience.,pay was super competitive and the responsibilities were exactly what i wanted.,"my role was very different from the one that you are asking, but general idea should be the same.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you have questions, feel free to reach me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
make sure you're running dual channel ram.,most laptops ship with a single stick,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a quick google search says you need uhd 620 or better for hdr support.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, thanks.",i read conflicting things but this seems right.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 computers are a chain of bottlenecks and as you upgrade you usually just move the bottleneck elsewhere.,unfortunately many games cannot spread out the load and use every core you have available to their fullest extent like productivity programs can.,is your ram running at jedec 2133 by chance?,if so go into your bios and enable xmp to get the speed you paid for.,memory speed is just another bottleneck in the chain especially if you're turning settings down trying to hit very high fps.,how are your cpu temperatures?,keep hwinfo running in the background and it will show how hot everything got while you were playing your game.,if you see any of the sensors turn red you may experience throttling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"out of curiosity did you use the cooler that came with your i3 on your i7, the stock intel one?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is normal when you are cockblocked by single core performance in games that cannot use all your cpu cores.,"you have no tools to know what is going on, and you need experience to be able to tell what is going on.","general rule of thumb is that if the gpu is not at +95% load, your cpu/ram speed is not good enough.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what temps?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
will fps get low if temp is too high?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"with the i3, it came in a prebuilt bundle abt 3 yrs ago, so probably",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when the processor gets too hot it will throttle down the clock speed to avoid any permanent damage to itself.,"so yes, this can lower your fps if your cpu is the part holding your fps back.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you were to look up stock intel cooler you will know.,if it is that cooler then it's definitely not up to the challange of cooling the i7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"currently, the cpu is the best part in my build.","the gpu may be a throttle but when i upgraded from a i3 8100, the first boot had high fps on everything, but over time after boot the frames started to dip and suffer.","i checked coretemp and it read 100 c, i have not been on my pc since, as i am afraid that the temp might damage something",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"one other thing to not is that after i turn it off and hover my hand over my gpu, its significantly hotter than my cpu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
okay if you're seeing 100c then you have a cooling problem.,sometimes people forget to remove the clear plastic film that comes on the cpu cooler.,this film prevents heat transfer and causes these issues.,"for example https://youtu.be/fdogikanaac?t=18

sometimes people forget to even apply thermal paste or maybe the cooler isn't mounted properly to the motherboard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's ok, your gpu is being used more than your cpu anyways so i'm not surprised.",my gpu will sit around 80c when playing cyberpunk and that's totally fine.,pc parts are really good these days and if the heat was a problem they usually shutdown.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i will invest in a new cooler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if it only became a problem after time you might just need to really dust your computer and also make sure the cpu cooler fan(s) are actually turning.,sometimes the fans breakz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ive air dusted my computer after turning it off,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
were the temps fine with this same cpu in the past?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"also what i meant by after some time is when i first booted after installing the new cpu and mb the frames were fine at the start, then started to suffer as i assume the pc got hotter",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i got the cpu on christmas, i was ysing an i3 with the same fan so i assume that the fan isnt compensating the extra cores of the new one",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

iâ€™m excited for intel gpus to break the duopoly between nvidia and amd.,if they can come in at an acceptable price than we could see the gpu market change overnight.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you'll get the same answers as the last time you posted this.,the speed increase is due to turbo boost.,[look it up.,](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/190883/intel-core-i59400f-processor-9m-cache-up-to-4-10-ghz/specifications.html),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2.9 is the base clock, basically the guaranteed minimum speed it will run at load, assuming itâ€™s being cooled and powered properly.",basically every cpu released nowadays will by default run faster than their base clock as long as itâ€™s cool enough and has sufficient power.,"itâ€™s more complicated than that, and there are other factors like how many of the cores itâ€™s currently using, etcâ€¦ but thatâ€™s the gist of if.",thatâ€™s why every model usually lists itâ€™s base and turbo speeds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had to edit it :/.,"thanks though


edit: why ru all down voting my comment",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ty!,i just thought it was quite un nessissary to run it so high,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
turbo boost,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
base and boost frequency.,your base clock for the cpu would be 2.9ghz and your boost clock (max turbo frequency) can be up to 4.1ghz.,"so your cpu , depending on temps and power and other variables will operate between those to speeds.",so at idle your frequency should be closer to 2.9 unless youve overclocked it.,and while performing tasks your cpu will automatically increase its frequency if it is able to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m curious why you went with a small form factor / low profile cpu cooler in a full size case?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i get avg 45 celcius in recent aaa games with a 360 aio.,your cooler looks pretty weak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no 82c is fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"op, 82c is not fine, sure it's still under allowed thermal limits but what happens when the ambient temperature in the room will be higher?",in my opinion you're severely reducing the lifespan of the cpu.,i would strongly advise switching to something like nh-d9 or nh-u12a.,i'm running 12600k with nh-d15 and in gaming the temps never cross 56c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
go into your bios and lower the core voltage.,the auto voltage mode draws too much power.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"lower your core volts, if you haven't.",will help out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"82 definitely isnâ€™t the coolest temp, but itâ€™s still safe.",next upgrade in your pc should be a beefier cooler tho.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that thing will run at 100â°c for a few years straight if you let it.,"don't worry about it, just sent it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have i7 12700k with nhd15 chromax black however i have replaced the 150mm fans with noctua nf-a12x25 pwm fans.,"when i ran the cpu benchmark or cpu stress test from cpuz, my temps were around 96â°c for two cores atleast and rest were above 80â°c.",could you let me know if i replace the 150mm fans back or do i look into other settings???,i am on asus z690 hero mobo with the right capacitor soldering and on bios 203.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i though that could be enough... as i said, i built it by myself and i tried to select the best way i can... :(, if you have any advise about what fan i can use, please help me :d",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm having zero issues with the nh-u12a on the 12700k and i'm mildly oc'd to 5.2ghz on preferred p-cores, 5.0ghz on the rest and 4.0ghz on e-cores with 4.2ghz ring clock.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
noted thank you!,i will do it.,"for example that nh-d15, is compatible for 1700 socket or should i find something to attach it?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"agreed - 82c isnt the coolest of temps for a cpu, but well within its limits to run properly  for a very long time.",enjoy the 12700k!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the temps shouldnâ€™t lower the cpu lifespan by any relevant amount.,"i believe that these cpus can all run higher temperatures, even long term but i agree that a larger cooler would be a good choice given that op has the space for it and they should do the  best they reasonably can for the cpu temps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you a lot!,i will search to buy one of those.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"after checking your suggestions, and taking some measures at my case, i have bough the nh-u12a as it is the best one that fits in my case.",i have not enough space for the nh-d15 unfortunately.,once i have it i will do some tests!!!,thank you for all your advise.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have the same setup except i didn't replace my 150s.,i do have phanteks and a12 case fans though.,"my max under load is 64.

what case you got and case fans?",the key is what kind of air your getting to the cpu cooler fans more so.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you a lot guys!,i was worried about this :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
make sure you have enough fans in your case to bring in fresh air and push hot air out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"good choice, looks like it's compatible with your motherboard according to the info on their official page and they've started to include mountings kits for the lga1700 socket with this cooler since january.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hi there, current situation, replaced the 120mm with the default 150mm on my noctua nh d15 and also replaced my cabinet to phantek enthoo pro.. 
previous cabinet was corsair 300r which would not allow me to have the 150mm with the gskill ram.. but now, i don't see temp rise even to 60â°c above from quite a long time... so looks like things are all sorted now..  :-)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have just installed the u12a and after some testing, the temperatures are an average of 55-60, with some peaks at 72âº in only two cores playing at the same game (doom eternal).",thank you a lot!,i am very happy with these temperatures now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you weren't able to shift the fan upwards on the 150?,"you can technically shift it up a little bit

"not normal, likely gpo related.","most people don't have network shares, how would they install it?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's exactly why i'm asking.,"i can run installers for any other program locally, except the latest intel dch, so it's not gpo related.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i don't think it's referring to having it local when it says ""please move to a non-system folder.""",and instead either knows or thinks it's inside of a windows os related folder (i.e.,"system32 for example, program files, maybe even the root c:\\).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was finally able to get it running by having it install from c:\temp.,it would not run from program files (which is where i run every single other deployment for every program i deploy) nor from the desktop.,"in the past, i've always been able to run intel dch updates from the desktop as needed.",this is the first time i've ever encountered this error,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
use case?,12600k is pretty good bang for the buck,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"bro, just like the k just without igpu lol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12700f with a decent b660 board would be the best option for gaming performance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's the kf, not the f alone.",non k f might clock a couple hundred mhz lower at least.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what's eye catching it's the cache clock at 4700mhz.,"&#x200b;

right now it's limted to 3600 with ecores active, and rarely go above 4300mhz on a tuned chip.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this would be ridiculous :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"this looks liek a 12900 ks  5.2 ghz all core  and he has e cores on  and the ring cache is  above 4.3 ghz m,ax its 4.7 gzh ring with smaall cores on .",maybe the 12900 ks can do 5.2 ghz all core + ring above  43 to 4.7 ghz with e cores on  intristing !,my 9900 ks does 5.0 ghz @ 1.18 vrout and 1.32 vrout for 5.2 so  i def buy this current 12900k i have does 5.1 ghz @ 1.28 vrout and 5.3 light load boost with 32 gb 4000 mhz cl15 gear 1 ram ill buy it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think the ring is limited to the speed of the e-cores, correct?",does that mean the e-cores are running at 4.7ghz in this part?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"5,2 ghz at gaming is not getting that toasty.",and the whole point of this cpu is the gaming crown.,don't mistake toasty intel cpus in cinebench with intel cpus at gaming loads.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can get it to run much cooler.,"mine has a voltage offset of -.150v at 5.2ghz, adaptive voltage set to 1.375v.",water cooling means it peaks at about 75c while doing cinebench23 multicore.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i predict that this is going to have intel regret making the cpu package 37.5 mm wide.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's probably not the best comparison.,"intel released 13 different versions of the 486 cpu, each of those versions available in 2-4 different speeds ranging from 16mhz to 100mhz (depending on model)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
amd sub is that way.,>>>>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why panicking?,they are just releasing pre-binned 12900ks for the overclocking market.,rapotor lake is coming this year and meteor lake the next.,this is just a way to get some extra margin on some of the better 12900ks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what if i told you given adequate cooling the 12900ks can do 6.0 ghz single core?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
manually you can make the cache run slightly faster than the ecores.,"say 4200-4400 for the ring and 4000 for the ecores, before you hit a wall of stability.","on this capture you can see the ring at 4700 and the ecores at 4000, so the ecores are not the limiting factor on the demoed chip.",they must have changed something.,"4700 is hard to reach stable without high voltages with ecores off, and seemingly imposible with ecores on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
binned cpu.,aka handpicked from 12900k batch but has better silicon resulting in more performance that they can sell for more,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i know - i was only thinking this / asking because earlier rumors were that raptor lake would go for both clocks and ipc.,seems surprising they're going to get 5.5 ghz even out of a single core with 12th gen.  it's a good sign for intel 7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the difference between 12900k and 12900ks would be the equivalent back then of a 53 vs 50 mhz 486dx though :).,"or if you want to make it look better -- 100 vs 106 mhz..

each speed bump offered well over 10% speed increase:

16 --> 20 --> 25 --> 33 --> 50  ..  lowest bump there was 25%.","above that they offered 50, 66, 100..  they only didn't offer 40/80 to try to reduce the legitimacy of amd's offerings.","(though you can at least argue the 12700k not only has slightly lower clocks, but atleast 4 less ecores, for a throughput reduction of 10-15%..  call it 486dx2-80 vs 486dx-100..)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">4700 is hard to reach stable without high voltages with ecores off, 

this isn't true, i was running at 4700 ring with e-cores off on 12700k for a couple weeks without any issues at normal voltages.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"these cherrypicked intel cpus used to be referred too as an emergency edition, though with alder lake there's no real emergency since standard edition 12th gen cpus are already ahead of amd's current ryzen offerings.",intel most be worried about ryzens with 3d v-cache catching up with alder lake in benchmarks and am5 ryzens that are supposed to be released later this year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it would appear that intel 7 has higher clocks than even the 14++++ node used in the 10th gen cpus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
big.little.^chungus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well there is no reason to panic when you can't do anything to change it but wait for raptor lake.,also 12th gen has enough of a lead to be about the same as or at least competitive with 3d-v-cache.,also when has a manufacturer ever shown cooling/temps.,we just get slides with the results normally.,"the benchmark is probably to their favor, using tvb etc to get the most out of the chip with its factory overclock.","i am excited tough about the zen4d/5 and meteor lake, can't wait :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what intel is showing here is that their 10nm silicon can run even faster.,zen 3d v-cache however hasn't proved it can even run at regular zen 3 clock speeds.,"zen 3d will be nothing more than a ""special edition"" limited series, so it does make sense to counter a special edition chip by another special edition chip.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tried small ftts on occt?,"i've tried to run 4700 with ""normal"" voltages and any real stress on the caches meant insta shut down.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"but if they are at 4000mhz, they are not idling.",some load has to be put in order for them not to be at low clocks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that will depend on yields.,"my guess is if there's a 12900ks, yields are good.","the reason we saw 10850k vs 10900k is that yields on 14nm making 10900k werent very good, since that chip pretty much pushed the limit of what 14nm could do.",that's why there was never a 10900ks.,"so you had all these chips too good for 10700k but not good enough for 10900k, so they because 10850k.",if intel has enough chips to make a 12900ks i don't think they will need to make a 12850k.,just an educated guess i don't have any industry connections to support this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they got rid of the xx850k/xx900k naming in place of xx900k/xx900ks.,they did away with the xx850k in the 11th gen with the 11700k.,"10850k/10900k ( ~100mhz diff )

"doubt it, and even if it's amd focused, this isnt really going to help performance all that much.",it's a goodie for the obsessive few that would like a prebinned 12900k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you need more cooling and/or more vcore.,4.7-4.9 ring is totally doable with the e-cores turned off.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"hm very strange, yes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, i'm not saying it's not doable, i'm saying it needs higher voltages.","and that begs the question, how binned is this chip to run 4700mhz and at what voltages.","only thing visible is the core vid at 1.38v, which is fairly low for over 5ghz cores, but  non conclusive on its own.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i would say go with the 11th gen. it doesn't hurt to go with latest architecture, and if going with h series processors (rather than u), there is a good performance uplift with 11th vs 10th gen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

11th gen can mean a lot of things.,"in fact, both the ""gen"" and the i3/i5/i7/i9 monikers are mostly meaningless for later generations of intel processors (at least for laptops).","an i5 or even an i3 can be faster than an i7, even within same cpu ""generation"", depending on the power consumption level both of the cpu design and of the system it's designed into and the needs of the user (single thread or multi thread).","unfortunately it's hard to get things like thermal design power from the webshop page of a laptop, only a review will show you if it performs as expected.","careful investigation of what the user values most, like battery life, weight, single thread performance and/or multi thread performance is needed.","if weight and battery life is most important, you would go for a 15w design, while if single thread performance is most important then maybe one of the 28w g7 chips fits best (and then there would be no discernible difference between an i5 or an i7), while if multithread performance is most important then maybe one of the 45w chips is best fit, and now  there most certainly is a difference between i5 and i7.","i don't know the adobe suite enough, so i don't know if single thread or multi thread performance is most important for that, but i would say that the g7 cpus of the  lenovo carbon x1 you mention in a comment generally sounds like a good tradeoff.","but there's no discrete gpu, which would help a lot if the user is using any of the adobe video tools, while it probably makes no sense if it's non-video tools.","dunno if this helps at all, but just like any bit of engineering, investigating the use case is the most important part of the project.",good luck.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i've been reading so many conflicting things regarding cpu bending on lga1700 chips.,i just bought a 12600kf and a msi tomahawk 690 before i really knew about this issue.,"based on the washer mod creator's video, he states that bending of the ihs is normal and has been a thing since 1150 and others.","i guess i am just wondering if i should do something to prevent the bending now, or just install it normally and then see if i have any heating issues later?","however i would rather not bend the cpu if possible...but as the video states, not everyone should or needs to do the mod.",i do feel like its getting a bit overblown and people (myself included) are just being overly paranoid.,is there a specific cooler that will work best even if it gets bent a bit?,"just curious on the consensus here, or if i should preemptively put nylon washers on the ilm?",could this be fixed in the future with simply a new ilm?,wish intel would say whether or not this was a feature or a bug.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yesterday i had two intel chips overheating heavily, both sat at about 45c at idle but within 30 seconds of being under load (even light load like heaven benchmark or userbenchmark) the temps would spike to 100c in hwinfo64.",i ended up replacing the 9600k with a 9400f in the same system and did not exceed 52c in cinebench all core.,"the 10700 temps drop back to 45c within 30 seconds of being taken off load, so clearly there isn't an issue with either aio.","it seems odd to me that i would have these issues all of a sudden on two intel chips, and it's made me think it has something to do with the maybe a recent update and chips having inbuilt display, as the issue was not replicated on the 9400f.","the 10700 places in the 99th percentile on userbenchmark so it doesn't appear to be thermal throttling, atleast in the very short cpu and ram test that it provides.",has anybody had a similar issue or know a fix?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hi there.,is there any progress on this?,were you able to reproduce the issue?,is there something i can do on my end to help further diagnose the problem?,"in the mean time i tried running the nic on an older intel platform (z590 + 10-gen cpu) and it was working fine there, though that's a pcie gen 3 platform.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks i will try it!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ah, understood.","but from your answer, i gather that there is nothing in the non-k cpus themselves that prevents them from maintaining pl2 indefinitely.",that's remarkable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hi thanks for the answer !,i used to get always intel processors since 20 years ago and they was always at clock base but my last one was 4690k from 4th gen in 2014 and probably they didn't have this feature to use less speed when doesnt needed and to speed automatically when is needed.,i checked my bios motherboard and verified that i actually use the last bios.,anyway my i5-12500 and 3080 setup run fine in games :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
okay thank you!,"it has never risen over 100c, that's the max it's hit, so it's quite confusing, but i don't know if it's because that's the max core temp wants to show",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for those useful links and for your reply.,"could you comment on the now-infamous ""washer mod"" that seems to be required on the ilm of z690 series boards in order to reduce temperatures by 5-8c to more reasonable operating temperatures?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thank you for your reply.,i am using the machine at stock configurations with the default bios as any other business user of these machines would use them.,i don't think there is anything wrong with the machines or the intel cpus inside.,"as an enthusiast and pc builder for 20+ years, i'd still like a better explanation about why the i7-1186g7 in the thinkpad p14s gen 2 (and i7-1165g7 i've tested in the thinkpad t15 gen 2) are both outperformed by the i5-1135g7 in the thinkpad t14 gen 2. others in the community are asking the same questions, and feeling misled by intel about the performance benefits of i7 mobile processors.","perhaps they are capable of higher performance, but at least in the manner they have been delivered they are not achieving this performance.","i suspect it to be because of overly-aggressive turbo behavior (instant pl2, tempts to tj max 99c in under 10 seconds), performance throttling and aggressive downclocking is the only result one can expect.","in my considered opinion, these processors are technically impressive but very poorly tuned.","if intel opened intel ""extreme tuning utility"" back up to mobile cpus as it had in 2018, it would be easier for users to tune their purchased cpus to the highest possible performance.",i would think that intel cared enough to give the buyers of their products better performance than they have been thus far.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you aware at all on anything at all on how to deal with this issue?,"it appears to be an issue that a lot of people with this specific ethernet adapter has, with basically no decent resolution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i followed their instructions to update to their latest drivers, and the problem still exists.",have you got any other ideas?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"fantastic, thank you.",i've two more questions that i hope you don't mind handling.,does intel have some sort of online product registration for my cpu?,"and since i am to be running stock voltages/speeds for my memory, is there no benefit in higher speed memory?","for example i purchased some ddr4-3600 cl18 memory, thinking it would be an upgrade over the ddr4-3200 cl18.",should i just return the 3600 for the 3200 because i'm not allowed to go beyond intel's specifications if i'm looking to save a few dollars?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'm having same issue - keyboard disconnects and doesn't work unless i reboot.,if i plug it again it works for couple of seconds.,"this happens only if plugged to usb 3.2 gen 1 socket - gen 2 does no such thing, but that's not a solution.","what have i tried before:  
\- update bios, firmwares, drivers, asus software  
\- changing power settings within device manager  
\- messing with usb/power settings in bios  
\- disabling fast boot (although i'm leaving it off for wol feature)

this thing just happen to me few minutes ago, i didn't rebooted yet nor changed usb socket.","since i use asus mb, i removed their software called ""armory crate"" and all their software.",plugged keyboard again and it still works.,not sure if that's a solution or just temporary behavior.,"specs:

i tried everything with that same combination.,my oculus rift s would cut out any time it wanted to.,"in the end after trying a 11700k on a asus rog strix z590 a 12700k on a asus tuf z690 and a 5600x on a ryzen b550 board, 
â€¦i got a b450 tomahawk max ii â£60 and a ryzen 3700x..â£130 and sent the rest back.",saved me about â£450.,â€¦now everything runs great..no usb disconnects at all.,you could buy an initeck powered pci-e card but it didnâ€™t fix it completely for me.,iâ€™m going to wait for the newer amd boards and cpuâ€™s at the end of this year.,best of luck.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, literally the same i had.","i downloaded usbdeview, saw it only showed my keyboard disconnected.","i swapped cables, changed ports and seems to be fixed now.",you could try that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've noticed that the problem only happens from a cold boot (not a restart).,"for example, i'll load up csgo and 5 minutes into the game the mouse, keyboard, etc will cut out.",i then restart the pc and the problem doesn't happen again.,it's like restarting the pc fixes the issue but only until the next shutdown.,when my pc goes into sleep mode and then starts again the problem comes back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tried both and both helped with the code 43 error.,the disconnecting happens even with hubs tho.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes i tried, they do not work.",only the front 2.0 work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thats interesting.,"i fixed my issue by swapping keyboard cable, but you probably have different issue.",did you try pluging the webcams into powered usb hubs?,"i feel like the motherboards have some power instability issues on usbs causing this, so that might help.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i haven't tried the disable and restart in device manager yet.,i usually can fix the issue by a restart of the pc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
try downloading usbdeview.,it shows and can log usb connects and disconnects.,"in my case, all disconnects started with a keyboard so i swapped cable and port.",since that it didn't happen.,"i even bought a new mobo before that and on the new one, actually only the keyboard disconnected, not all devices as on the asus.",i think the prime has some issue that turns off usb ports when something disconnects.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same issue on my gigabyte z690 ud.,itâ€™s obviously not limited to one manufacturer.,i thought about getting a pcie usb hub to see if that fixes the issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
update on this: my issues practically disappeared after i under clocked my cpu from 5.0ghz to 4.0ghz so probably a power delivery issue/heating issue or performance issue within the usb traffic on heavy loads?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks for the idea, however as i said in the comments above, it was probably just a bad keyboard cable.","if the issue reappears, i will try xchi.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"interesting idea, hope you found the culprit!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh, that is a line of experimentation i havenâ€™t delved into this evening.","iâ€™ve been on games the last few hours, and when i was playing dying light 2, which will have definitely used my gpu to power some if not a lot of the game, i did get the usb disconnect issues.","whereas, switching to minecraft, which is mostly if not all cpu, no disconnects.","could it be something with the chipset / pcie gen 4, or the gpu drivers not playing nice?",i know it canâ€™t be the gpu itself because 3 days ago when paired with my old board it was perfectly fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

having the same issue with my z690 hero.,i use corsair usb audio headset so don't think it's your logitech.,"my flight sim throttle is illuminated and when i lose audio, the lights go out for a second and then back in.",having same problems with losing audio in sim.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i've given up and bought a msi motherboard.,it actually has the same issues so i think it is something with the 12th gen architecture.,i'm just using the usbs that work as i didn't find a solution.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same issue here with a gigabyte gaming x ddr4 on f8b bios... same issues...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sadly not, bought diiferent mb and it happens only like once per 3 months, but still happens sometime.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i've rebuild the pc, changed some hardware and it works now.",dunno what the problem was.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i fixed my issues by plugging the problematic usb device directly to a port on the motherboard.,"as for the rest, i connected them to a new powered usb hub.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a usb hub in my monitor which i only use for charging my watch and phone.,i also have a second hub that is connected to my keyboard and two wireless mouse receivers.,those are all usb 3. i also have a wacom tablet and a usb dac connected to their own ports on the back of the motherboard and an xbox 360 controller plugged into the front of my case.,i've tried disconnecting several devices and/or using different ports but to no avail.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think i may have have found the problem - windows fast startup.,i disabled it and it seems to have gotten better.,iâ€™ll do some more testing to see if it continues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my bad, its usblogview.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"interesting, so it could be a problem with hybrid shutdown, which luckily can be disabled in control panel (search shutdown, click ""change what the power buttons do"", click ""change settings that are unavailable"", then uncheck ""turn on fast startup"".",give that a try and let me know if it works.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then probably the other internal header would work as well.,thereâ€™s some weird note in the manual about all 4 of those ports sharing bandwidth.,might need to try a different extender for better compatibility.,or perhaps itâ€™s a total power draw issue if the extenders are bus-powered.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i the post i said i tossed them on a powered usb hub with no change.,i do find that if i deactivate and then reactivate the usb composite device i can get it to work.,this resets settings i have in place though so this is not ideal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sorry, it's actually called usblogview.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

have you tried running a gpu stress test?,i can make the usb disconnect thing happen by running msi kombustor for example.,it also happens when playing games such as csgo which arenâ€™t that gpu demanding.,however it never happens during normal use such as web browsing etc.,so i am guessing it could be gpu related as there is a post on the nvidia forums from when the 30 series was launched describing the exact same issue.,like i mentioned before i thought it was a wireless issue so switched to a wired headset.,it started off with audio cracking and then the audio went off completely but the usbs did not disconnect.,after that my pc froze completely and required a restart.,the weird thing is that itâ€™s works fine after a restart so this has me guessing that it must be software or driver related rather than a hardware issue.,iâ€™ve tried switching to pcie 3.0 in the bios but this did not fix it.,iâ€™m also going to try using latency mon to see if there are any driver issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'll give it a shot will those freeze all my usb ports?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my problem was solved by disabling the rgb lights on the logitech speakers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
any change after removal of armory?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mind if we talk somewhere for a while?,i want to get to the bottom of this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
may i ask how you identified the problematic usb?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i would recommend you to download [https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/usb\_log\_view.html](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/usb_log_view.html) (download usblogview down on the site) for me, the program allways show my keyboard disconnecting first.","on the asus board it disconnected all usbs, same as yours.",i bought a motherboard from msi and now actually only the keyboard disconnects.,i changed the cable and now it happens only like once a week.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"whats the update, with fast startup?","i lose keyboard functionality sproadically, no sleeping of the rig, just like watching a 10 minute video on youtube and then the keyboard has to be pulled and plugged back in.",z690 asus prime a. tried different ports on the motherboard as i want functionality before i start putting in hubs and 10 more things i have to check.,mind i can sit and play ex.,"cyberpunk for 8 hours straight with no disconnects, but walk away for a sandwich and come back and have to cycle the keyboard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i already tried disabling fast start up in windows but it doesnâ€™t seem to solve the problem.,i have basically tried everything that i can including installing a pcie usb hub but it hasnâ€™t fixed it.,"i noticed that it happens at the same time as a drop in power to my 3080 - see the graph here:

"yeah, so far it seems as a power issue, will probably try changing the motherboard and see how that goes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh i missed that sorry.,one thing that seemed to help me was using a short usb extension cable.,"windows recognized it as different communication method and it worked, so you can try that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes i am indeed.,iâ€™m currently investigating if it my wireless headset that is causing interference with the usb ports somehow.,after this iâ€™m basically all out of ideas.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i ended up getting a different board (msi z690 gaming pro).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™ll try a stress test today.,i have got the realtek audio drivers installed.,maybe theyâ€™re due a change?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s possible but worth a try.,you could also try measuring your dpc latency using latency mon.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i didn't have rgb on my speakers but i do have an ekwb rgb cpu cooler.,unplugged that after weeks of frustration and all the usb issues seem to be resolved.,maybe rgb is an issue on the board,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nope, disabling pcie native power management fixes all my issues (i think)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i don't think i can help you honestly, as i said i even switched motherboards so it is probably not the culprit.",i'm convinced it must be a cpu usb controller issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i use the logitech brio to sign into windows via facial recognition.,"i already noticed that there are times when the webcam does not properly enumerate, so i couldn't log in with it.","i also noticed that in the device manager, there is a usb device that has a yellow exclamation icon so with trial and error, i traced it to the webcam.","these days, i just try to avoid connecting so many external drives at the same time as much as possible and that seems to help as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"good suggestion, i will try this.",thank you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i ended up switching out the motherboard and itâ€™s been fine since.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you tried disabling power control for the usb?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
open device manager> look for intel usb 3.2 controller.,right click and go to properties>power management.,uncheck 'allow this computer to turn off this device to save power',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what program are you using to measure the power drop?,i want to measure it myself.,"also, do you notice audio problems?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did this fix it?,it seems that is not limited to any one brand or model of motherboard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
let me know how you get on.,"i currently use a small usb bluetooth adapter, to connect to a bluetooth receiver which receives the audio to plug into my headphones.",maybe weâ€™re in the same situation?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

can you filter system event log by acpi source and see if you're getting any warnings?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have tried plugging into a hub and in the back of the motherboard.,so i donâ€™t think i have a faulty usb.,based on the number of other people who have the same issue i think itâ€™s a power issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my audio cuts out because i use a wireless headset.,iâ€™m using occt to measure the power.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have tried bluetooth headphones and wireless (2.4 mhz) and have had issues with both.,iâ€™m now trying wired headphones.,could you also try using wired headphones instead of bluetooth and see if you still get issues?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sadly the issue has come backâ€¦..even with a wired headset,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"this, thank you!i was having similar issues when transfering a lot of data over usb.","i was trying to rebuild a backup and every so often all usb devices cut out, including the drive, ruining the backup.","i blamed the usb drive of course, so started switching cables and ports but it persisted (using only on-board ports for the drive).","nothing worked, roughly once an hour it would just disconnect all usb devices and instantly reconnect.","i had no idea why...

thanks to you i downloaded usblogview and it showed my webcam was the first to disconnect (strange as i was not even using it at the time).it was in my monitor's port, i unplugged it and plugged it into an unpowered hub.","the next time, the monitor's usb hub was first to go.",so i unplugged it and not had an issue so far.,backup has been building for four hours now (fingers crossed).,so don't forget to look at usb hubs or even your monitors usb ports as the culprit even if nothing is really plugged into it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

just built a new z690 hero maxiums system w/w10 for the wife.,same annoying network drop out issues.,"research shows, could be a bad cable or even an older router or switch (serial timing off somehow?)",.,this is a problem - but whether it's  an unfixable hw design or windows is still up in the air.,perhaps asus and intel could work with ms to figure out if it's the driver.,i do think it's somehow related to resume from sleep - but not sure.,i did replace a perfectly good network cable - and it still drops out randomly.,also have a new small table top switch - but haven't tried it yet.,but what does work - as reported elsewhere::: - get or use a usb 3.x to network dongle.,that has worked perfectly for 2 days now.,i'm going to use that until someone figures out where the problem lies.,"i ended up with a  15$ tp-link usb to ethernet adapter (ue306), foldable usb 3.0 to gigabit ethernet lan network adapter... working well so far.. in win 10, i don't ever recall a mobo ethernet port having the wifi ssid name on it in control panel ""network connections""..that really seems like it's a win10 problem.. afaik..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
network drop out issue solved!,"ok guys here is the issue when you update the rog z690 hero's bios   
make sure you also download the current   
meupdatetool !","this updates the micro code on the processor   
here is how i fixed it:  
   update the bios to the current one, let it do its multiple restarts takes like 3 restarts on its own dont touch it until its done...  
when you have the bios installed and all looks good   
boot into windows and go to add remove programs and uninstall the current   
intel management software, - (in my case i never installed it from the website)  
go to the meupdate tool you downloaded from the same bios page on the asus website   
right click the asus install exe and (run as administrator) that's important!","after it is installed reboot ...  
now go to  - device manager   
go down to - system devices  
look in there for intel management engin interface and double click it   
go to the firmware tab and make sure its updated to the same me version you downloaded !","thats it network drop out issues solved    
as i found out its a tiny os all to its self that handles the intel software like video while the pc is running, and in low power mode and networking everything else intel..  
   if the intel management software is not installed ( like in my case ) when the pc would go into low power mode after being left for a while   
 the network would just disappear gone nothing but a globe in the taskbar.","it would show everything working with drivers, adapters but no connection what's so ever sometimes even a reboot would not fix it this did .. it took me 2 motherboard returns to figure this out even intel tech support didn't know why the drop out were happening..  


so make sure when you download the current bios you also on that same page have the current meupdate tool also .. good luck hope this helps !",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

unsure if thats true as my rev 3 b550-e using the same network card and drivers randomly started dropping connections even so far as to getting timed out when pinging my router,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i ended up installing windows 11 3 times due to network troubleshooting, and on all of them all i did was run the asussetup program after doing a chipset driver install.",all of their drivers seem to be modified that way.,"side note: if you enable the intel gna device in bios (donâ€™t need it but i like to get everything working, lol), that the provided asus drivers did not work for me, and i had to download a newer gna driver from intelâ€™s site listed specifically for nuc devices.",edit: the code 10 error seems a bit different from prior issues.,even the system thinks the network card isnâ€™t working right.,"i might be wrong, but i also think during this there was only a blinking activity light on the jack and no link light, as is normalâ€¦ kind of like what happens when you first turn the system on before the card is initialized.",maybe a chip-level lockup or inability to leave standby mode?,might be something a firmware/bios update can address.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes it's also an i225-v. i thought at the beginning it was my internet connexion because i changed silmutaneously my computer and my residence, but this old version of the driver has completely solved the issue!",don't you think we should report this to asus or intel?,i deactivated windows update for 7 days to prevent a return to a more recent version of the driver.,you said windows installed another version with the bug after you deinstalled the v1.0.2.14 to get the v1.0.1.4.,if you deinstall again you can get v1.0.1.4 again no?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when you check windows control panel it should tell you what step you have (2 or 3).,based off of that you might be able to troubleshoot a bit better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm experiencing the same issue, good to know it's not something wrong on my end but platform/bios issue.",for me it happens at random during reboots/crashes.,good thing i had wintogo and win10 + win11 on separate disks installed so i could check if i borked windows files/drivers somehow.,i had this with latest drivers from mobo website and without any drivers at all (windows default drivers).,"the problem fixes itself when the ethernet adapter goes fully offline, that is no power to the system at all.",have to fully unplug power because the ethernet stays powered on even when pc is off.,i assume the issue is what you said - some sort of lock up state or something and full reset fixes it.,"that said i'm also experiencing some sort of weird things:

my mouse stays responsive but keyboard stays locked/off until 1-15 seconds after booting.",i can move mouse on windows login screen but i can't type anything but what i pressed will be sent to the pc with a delay.,"sometimes there is no delay and i can hit enter then type my password, sometimes there is 10s delay and i hit enter and nothing happens until 10s later.",there is also weird issue with my audio - when i'm idle and there is no sound going on i assume the audio chip is turning off to save power but when i make noise (for example discord noise or windows volume up/down) then the sound comes off with about 1 second delay.,then there is no delay with the sound until i go idle (no sound) for 10s or more.,and i also think there is higher audio delay than my old system.,"sometimes i can see and hear different things, for example sudden short noises are very easy to spot.",animation of gunshots and sound of gunshots are off.,skills in games.,not sure if i'm tripping or the delay is there but i think so and i have no clue how to reliably test that.,lastly sometimes after reboot/crash my pc becomes very unstable.,"i think some settings are not applied correctly, for example ram voltage or something.",cold boot fixes that so maybe there is more widespread issue with platform where certain things become locked in a weird state or do not load fully.,do you or anyone reading experience any of them?,ps.,you can fix error 10 on network adapter by going to bios and turning off network card then saving and rebooting then turning it on again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

interesting and unfortunate that you still had disconnects.,i havenâ€™t encountered *any* since i installed v1.0.1.4.,"thatâ€™s not promisingâ€¦

i did reach out to asus support about this.",they tried to get me in and out as quick as possible and told me to return the motherboard since iâ€™m within amazonâ€™s holiday return policy.,"and to note: while on v1.0.1.4, windows 11â€™s â€˜check for updateâ€™ would consistently pull a new, but not newest version â€” v1.0.2.6 â€” and reintroduce the issue.",so i disabled windows 11 from ever pulling device updates via group policy editing.,"not ideal, but it works to keep me on v1.0.1.4.",you can simply go to device manager > â€˜the i225-v lan adapterâ€™ > right click > properties > uninstall device > restart pc.,"this will automatically have windows pull a base driver version, which is v1.0.1.4.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for your advice.,"i don't want to return my motherboard, that's too complicated for me \^\^.",but is the problem the motherboard or the intel driver?,i would suspect the latter so maybe it's a problem to check with intel and not asus?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™m not confident in saying either way, but seeing as how one specific driver version seems to work just fine for me, i would suspect itâ€™s the drivers/software.","however, given the track history of the i225-v lan adapter whether itâ€™s revision 1, 2 or 3, it could very well be that the hardware is *still* faulty.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

did you already buy the cpu?,if not then literally just wait a week because you'll be able to buy b660 + 12400 for almost the same price and have like 30% better performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not much difference but the pro vdh will be cheaper.,both will be good enough to handle a 10400,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it mostly likely wouldnâ€™t be the same price though.,"the 10400 would probably drop more in prices and for gaming paired with a 3070 level of gpu at 1440p, 10400/11400/12400 runs into a gpu bottleneck.",b560s are so much cheaper now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
interesting bit about the jmp insertion.,"i wonder why the architecture can't automatically swap instruction fetch/decode stages on its own, though, or at least automatically insert them into the pipeline?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they changed that to gracemont, it can automatically balance load between the decoder clusters (at least according to chipsandcheese).",but tremont relies on the branch boundaries.,i'm not sure if it makes sense to automatically insert artificial taken branches.,i think that knowing where to put them might require knowledge of the program that the system doesn't have at that stage.,a compiler on the other hand would have access to that knowledge.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that seems like pretty moderate temps for a 11400 when under load, especially demanding like gaming

youâ€™re all good, just avoid the thermal throttle limit or anywhere above 90c really",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
those are both cpu intensive games (for different reasons) and 70-75c is perfectly fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there is for sure something wrong, did you remove the plastic under the cooler?","check the thermal past, if this doesn't work check the screws of the cooler try tightening or loosening and check every time the temp, i've the same cpu and i hit 55â° in cinebench 23 with a cheap gammax gte v2",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
something is wrong or your case is hotbox.,"11400f@fuma 2 in nr200, pl unlocked and i'm getting abt 55 celsius gaming (60-80w package power) with very relaxed fan curve - i think abt 700-750 rpms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
first thing to check is how well the case is ventilated.,"solid glass/metal panels are famous for not letting air through, so if you have one of those superfancy *letsshowoffrgbfanswithaglasspanel* or *letstrytodampensoundwithsolidpanelsandpadding* cases you've found your culprit, especially if you also have a video card toasting the cpu-cooler from beneath.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

even the most premium motherboards including x570 or even the z690 ones don't have three output ports.,that's because you don't connect your monitors to the motherboard io if you have a discrete gpu.,"the monitors should go inside the ports on the graphics card itself, not the motherboard io :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

gtx 1650 has three ports.,"his motherboard, doesn't.","he could've googled it, yes.",but what if somebody don't know where the cables go?,so you're magically expecting everyone to know everything about computers?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am still very confident about most premium motherboards not having three output ports.,only a few of them do.,i don't need a validation from an arrogant piece of shit trying to be demean people for not knowing something.,have a good day.,"also, try to be polite the next time you're trying to talk, it's doesn't cost a thing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cables floating midair between the case and monitor - too short?,i guess it couldn't be helped.,"otherwise, looks great and congrats on your new rig.",cozy setup!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

sooo much rgb.,i went the totally opposite direction and got chromax.black everything and have a nearly completely blacked out system.,just have a bit of red static lighting set on the mb and 3080 and that's it.,"also maybe i'm just tired, but where is your psu?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
really nice.,for some reason the photo of the whole system is low quality.,would have loved to see more detail.,how are the temps for the 12900k?,how does it idle and what about after a game load?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hidden behind the motherboard.,idk what pc case that is though.,i would've guessed lian li o11 dynamic mini but it looks to be a bit too big for it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the temperature runs great, i was able to get p core all5.1 and e core 4.0 @ 1.175vcore with -.050 offset .","idle around 26c , gaming never above 50c  , run cr23 for 30mjns , other than package and one p core at 73ish rest donâ€™t even break 70.  gpu idle around 32c, under gaming it never get above 72",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"besides getting a better cooler, no.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,"you can overclock for only gaming in mind, so just ignore heavy workload stresstests.","i can run my 12700k allcore 5,2 in games with 60c, 130w with 160 fps limit and 30% load.",https://i.imgur.com/pq1u1vh.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i was under the impression that setting a â€œflatâ€ vcore offset could produce instability at lower frequencies which are already much lower voltages, and that those lower voltages already donâ€™t produce much heat, which is why the general recommendation was to use the v/f curve and apply an offset to the closest multiplier to the all core turbo speed (48x in this case).","however, this is just based on my reading, as undervolting is new to me.","what i described is working well on my 12900k, but iâ€™d also love to learn what else should or can be done.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would recommend  for watching a video [upgrade the alienware aurora r12 from i5 to i9-11900k](https://youtu.be/eu4tafe6mba).,there is a point there to upgrade aio fans.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"&#x200b;

you're doing good with those scores for sure.",alienware has locked down the motherboard on the r13 pretty tight.,i've yet to be able to tune mine to get beyond 25xxx on cr23.,"gaming wise, i don't have the problems that you get with the synthetic benchmarks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that sounds great!,how did you overclock it?,"i don't render or anything, just purely gaming",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"after spending so much on the rig itself i don't really want to purchase an aio, as the thermals arent that bad while gaming, around 70ish degrees which is perfectly reasonable for me, i just want to tune it manually for best gaming performance",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just go bios, press allcore that ghz, go voltage offset + or - until its stable.",might wanna check some youtube tutorials,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your chasing a couple percent if you overclock it for gaming performance.,its really not worth it.,"you already have the best cpu on the market for gaming, and out of the box its pushed pretty hard.",getting an extra 3% performance after overclocking isnt going to be noticeable in games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cant :( alienware bios doesnt allow it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think alienware really undertuned the cpu by default, on stock settings my cinebench r23 score was 24500, with my oc it was 28000,but i lost some gaming performance so i reverted back to basic settings with slight undervolt",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you have a k cpu?,maybe its not a z board?,else you can still use intel extreme tuning utility in windows.,you would have to activate the saved oc setting then after every new start,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not sure what motherboard i have, the cpu is for sure 12900kf",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ye theoretical only z690 boards are out but not sure if oem builders maybe have special b660 based boards or so earlier, just look what you can do with intel xtreme tuning utility",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i can get my 8600k to 100% utilization if i'm playing a game at 70fps or the same game at 120fps.,"same graphical settings, but much lower resolution.",but at 120fps it's obviously much more stressed.,i don't think utilization reported is actually accurate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ofcourse it is impressive and what cooler are you using?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"100% utilization, running what?","what's your ambient temperature, and is the h100i set up as intake?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
run cinebench and report back!,sorry to burst yout bubble.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"4.5ghz isn't impressive, maybe if you're running a 5900x it is.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's likely an incorrectly reported temperature.,wrong or defective sensor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its irrelevant.,its running within spec.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you could overclock that to 4.8-4.9. a 10850k is rated for 5.2ghz (not sure if that's all cores).,however do it in small increments like 100mhz.,dont do it extremely and because you dont know what temps are gonna be like,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it depends on what workload it is processing.,"avx at 100% people would call bs, regular gaming that is not bad.",my personal 10850k @ 5.1ghz gets to 70c at 100% during simulations.,"my question is, what are you doing that is maxing out all 20 threads?","edit: just saw you're encoding, that's rather impressive.",are you undervolting the cpu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"new update, i ran cinebench and it boosted to 4.8ghz for a while then dropped to 4.2ghz, and finished the test at 36.7 degrees celsius.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
where are you measuring the temp from?,guessing from a liquid cooling loop?,fluid coolers take time to thermally saturate so whilst temps like that will happen at first sometimes they're not generally sustainable if 100% cpu utilisation is maintained for an extended period.,"40 deg is a little ""too cool"" for sustained 100% all-core load on a cpu like that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a pretty old corsair h100i in quiet mode,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"running adobe media encoder, ambient temperature 71 degrees fahrenheit and the h100i serves as the only outtake in the system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"after a 10-minute cinebench multicore run on r23.200, i got a score of 13465 and the test ended at 36.7 degrees celsius.",it boosted to 4.8ghz all cores then the turbo timer ran out and it dropped to 4.23 ghz and stayed there for the duration of the test.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wasnâ€™t talking about the clock iâ€™m running stock clock speed.,iâ€™m talking about temperature,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m getting this reading from the cpu itself and the water cooler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m running stock settings.,thinking about overclocking,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh my lord i've been looking at my aio temps the whole time through icue.,i just realized that is not cpu temp.,any suggestions for temp monitoring software?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, just realized that.",im checking the icue temperature readout.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's a great cooler, quiet, and obviously very good at cooling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you have temperature head room try over clock,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
keep in mind it is exhausting hot air from almost fully utilized gtx 1060 as well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh my lord i've been looking at my aio temps the whole time through icue.,i just realized that is not cpu temp.,any suggestions for temp monitoring software?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"stock clock speed on the 10850k is 4.7 ghz all core, so you're running somewhat below stock.","if you didn't intentionally under clock you may be throttling, which could explain the lower cpu temp.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well i'm hitting 45-48c at stock on a i9-2900k so i'm not sure if yours is impressive, that 4.9ghz/3.7ghz.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"definitely worth it for workloads, not so much gaming.",my simulation times dropped proportionately to the processor speed increase.,the absolute biggest gain was from overclocking the cache and core.,"if you have fast ram, this is what you should do.",encoding and simulations aren't that different in terms of how the cpu handles the math.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hwinfo64 is one choice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is there any intel branded software that can monitor temps?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that'll do it ;) best to measure it via the cpus sensor and to measure worst case performance with liquid run it till it hit peaks (may take several minutes for larger loops).,i usually just use gpu-z for a quick check of cpu temp.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah iâ€™m going to after reading all of this.,i just havenâ€™t gotten around to it since i never really use all of what that processor can give anyway.,at most iâ€™m using 70 percent playing rust at high settings with two minecraft clients in the background with recording and premiere open in the background.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm very impressed that it can do such temperatures in that environment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hwinfo64, msi afterburner, aida64...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mm maybe that speed isnâ€™t right lemme check,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my bad itâ€™s 4.79 ghz stable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™ve got 3200mhz ram.,itâ€™d be nice if a cpu over clock would decrease load times in a game like rust but i do render a decent amount of video so that would be useful,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
grab hwinfo64.,itâ€™ll give you a read on everything you ever did or didnâ€™t want.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if the aio is acting as exhaust and the gpu is also heavily utilized, the intake temperature of your aio is likely 30â°c or more.","a delta-t of only 10â° stretches the limits of ""impressive"", possibly into unbelievable.",do you have hwinfo or some similar application that tells you what the cpu package power is?,"i'm not familiar with adobe media encoder specifically, but it sounds potentially heavy.","if it's gpu-accelerated, maybe it spends time waiting for the gpu, that your os accounts as on-cpu time?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then after turbo timer runs out it drops to 4.2 ): is that normal?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my system does have very good ventilation and 3 fans in the front to get the gpu air out but still,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"itâ€™s gpu accelerated and utilized the full 100 percent of the cpu, and then uses like 70 percent gpu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fans in the *front* to get the air *out*?,you have back-to-front airflow?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"when task manager says ""100% cpu utilization"", it just means windows has a thread scheduled on every hardware thread 100% of the time.",it doesn't tell you anything about what kind of instructions those threads are executing.,"if they're busy-waiting on spinlocks for the gpu to return some result, (or for each other to return some result), that doesn't use much power.","or if they're doing something with abominably bad memory access patterns like iterating through a linked list, that doesn't use much power.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sorry, the front fans are pulling in the air but it flows air to the back which removes the gpu hot air.","sorry, bad explanation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i didn't know that.,"here's something i found an article saying ""adobe premiere pro and adobe media encoder can take advantage of available gpus on your system to distribute the processing load between the cpu and the gpu to get better performance.","currently, most of the processing is done by cpu and gpu assists in processing certain tasks and features"" so i believe that it is using the cpu at least close to max.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sounds like a pretty light load.,try a stress test and you'll probably be a lot hotter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's probably due to the game you're trying to run.,"get some beamng.drive going and spawn 20 ai vehicles, if you want to game with 100% cpu usage.","most current games won't take advantage of a 8+4 core cpu, but they will in the future.","don't worry about it, and enjoy your new cpu.",things are working as expected.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">but cores 5,6,7 still do jack shit.",most games don't actually make use of that many cores.,that's why 6 core cpus are the sweet spot for gaming pcs.,though as games get more demanding we will start to see more games make use of more cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not all games will utilize all cores of a cpu.,what youâ€™re experiencing is completely normal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

wow wow guys thank you for all the quick reposes.,thank you for clarifying and assuring me that my chip isnâ€™t a dud!,i bought the cpu intending to use it for the next 4-5 years so i am happy to hear iâ€™ve got substantial headroom to grow.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the scheduler is directing the os which cores will be assigned to process threads.,"your game doesn't create that many threads, and so not all cores need to be utilized.","also, the scheduler doesn't do anything on windows10 at the moment, instead the application relies solely on the operating system for assignments which is mostly fine, but not ideal in all use cases.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

alder lake has controversial to previous gens power algorithms.,"in a simplified form, before a process was spread among all cores at their full speed until a cpu reached max conditions and starts throttling i.e reducing its clocks.",now a process starts interleaving among  cores trying to keep their clocks max as long as possible and keeping free/underloaded cores as many as possible to have a room there.,once a core reached max conditions power algorithms are looking for a core is being under max conditions and move the process there.,this is why as more p+e cores  your 12th gen cpu has as faster it can be potentially.,this is a way for 12900k to get so incredible performance.,this is why it can conflict with the windows task scheduler from time to time.,it's some marketing mistake that imposes an idea of two different pieces in one cpu while p- and e- cores process everything all together.,actually you just get 6/8 boosted cores and extra nominal ones.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you so much for clarifying.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah it just depends from game to game.,typically ray tracing uses all cores so imwoukd advise playing rtx titles with dlss if you want to see all core usage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

myeah it might not ramp up the fans or pump under load.,100c on the cpu doesnt mean 100c in the cooler.,an aio has to soak up the heat different than an air-cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the base clock is largely irrelevant, as the boost clock is where your performance cap is going to be.","between these two, the kf has a 5.3 max boost, and the f has 5.2. fwiw .1ghz is basically irrelevant anyway.",there won't be a functional difference between these two unless the k is on a z590 board and allowed to overclock (auto or manual).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
base speed is useless in this day and age for intel cpus.,it's a guaranteed clock speed you can get with the cpu for heavy work loads.,"it's useless because all intel cpus have boost clock speeds, and the boosts work 99% of the time.",the 11900 / f have a 100mhz lower boost clock than the 11900k / kf.,that's the clock speed difference to look at.,they will perform almost the same and 11900 will conserve power and be cooler due to the 100 mhz lower turbo.,psst alder lake has a ton more performance and efficiency.,12600k is faster than the 11900k.,it's also the currently most energy efficient chip in the alder lake lineup.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there will not be any real noticeable difference in game unless the 11900f is severely power throttled.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
unless you manually overclock the cache/ring speeds on the kf (and that's if your sample can even do that) the difference won't be anything meaningful.,"the slightly lower clock on the non-k will probably lower your temperatures by a few degrees too, especially since the 11th gen seem harder to reach high clocks, more voltage is needed and thus more heat.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the kf should perform *slightly* better because it's clocked *slightly* higher (it's also unlocked), however with alder lake out neither of 11th gen i9s or even i7s are worth getting (11400 is probably the only one somewhat worth getting, but only because currently aren't any other ""budget"" options, but the 11400 will be completely pointless once the 12400 and b660 are out), especially the i9s as they were ridiculously overpriced to begin with since the 11th gen i9s were just *slightly* higher clocked i7s.",an 12600k would be a better cpu than an 11900k(f) while also being quite a bit cheaper.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

for the gpu around 40 idle and 65 under load and cpu 35 while idle and 45 under load,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not to be captain obvious here but rgb is so popular because you can change it at any time.,majority of people would rather have rgb fans and other things because you can make it what you want when you want.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as someone who is about to build in the 7000x rgb with lian li al fans, this was perfect timing lol.",i was wondering would they looks like in the white case and build.,do you have a light strip in there or is all that light thrown from the fans?,i'm hoping the latter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the asia horse cables i bout only came with 2 pcie cables, so had to do a pattern with the default psu pcie",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the reason people place things under the gpu in the first place like that is to combat gpu sag.,"my point was that pushing up isn't usually a great idea, and that while over the long run gpu sag is a problem, it's not something that's so immediate that you need to tolerate pushing it the other way just to fight it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you kinda like aped into the rgb but got a meh gpu (gotta get the 3090),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
put a real load on her and report the temps.,intel xtu or cinebench r23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"hey, youâ€™ll love the case!!",the illumination is all from the fans.,although if you have light strips i assume they should bright up the case as well just as good as the fans.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"haha, yeah i meant 3600",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well good then no need to wait for games to get fixed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ah ok. besides that awesome pc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 3080 is not â€œmehâ€ but ok,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gpu prices have doubled - the 3090 truly is not worth it right now unless you need the vram.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"11400f, its worth the extra money, but you do lose the igp, which can be useful as a backup and for quicksync, if thats a big deal, then the 10400. if you do get the 11400, you might as well just wait till you can get 12th gen (or newer, depending on when you upgrade), as it is pretty good, and buying an 11700k, 10700k, 11900k, whatever, isnt a worthwhile upgrade unless you can get them for used cheap, youd be better getting a 12600kf+b660.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"rocket lake for pcie 4, avx 512 and video encoding.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
since you're stubborn and don't want alder lake even though it nearly doubles the single core bench of your current cpu and adds many more threads over rocket lake.,i say don't upgrade at all.,not worth it.,wait it out til raptor lake comes and do an affordable upgrade to 13th gen and ddr5.,"edit: sorry for the bluntness, you hurt my feelings when you said you're not interested in alder lake, it should've been out of budget instead.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

agree - rocket lake will give more performance on a smaller cooler than comet lake for ops use cases,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's not that i'm completely opposed to alder lake, but it goes well over my budget for the currently available parts.","the improved performance of alder lake certainly looks enticing, and there's budget parts coming on the horizon from leaked information i've seen, which includes the non-overclockable cpus and the cheaper chipset motherboards, but i don't know how long it'll be until those parts finally release.",i'd prefer to not wait much longer since my encode speeds are pretty slow right now with my haswell build.,the current price of alder lake hardware is more than i'm willing to pay.,"i'm not going to be overclocking so there's no use in paying for a k-line cpu, nor is there any use in paying for a z-series chipset motherboard for features i'm also never going to use.","all of that factors into the total cost, including having to replace the cpu cooler.","lga 1200 just seems like the better option for the time being until the new alder lake parts release, that being due to the surplus availability of parts and also the cheaper cost.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

are you using avx512?,"if not, this does not affect you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just ignore the debate, it's of literally zero relevancy to the normal user.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
\> is this article saying that avx is better for performance but has potential to damage cpus and therefore is being disabled?,it's saying people are upset intel is disabling an unofficial feature of alder lake cpus (avx-512).,it also decides to touch on there being a hidden frequency limit of 5.1 ghz when the cpu is processing avx2 instructions.,then they tried to provide a reason for why they think intel would limit the frequency to 5.1 ghz.,they guess it's because if it went higher the cpu could get damaged.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"standard answer - avx-512 can accelerate performance for workloads and use cases such as scientific simulations, financial analytics, artificial intelligence (ai)/deep learning, 3d modeling and analysis, image and audio/video processing, cryptography, and data compression.","so for very specific use cases...

but it uses a lot of power and to be honest is just not that relevant especially on normal desktop usage or even on the gaming front.","hopefully other can chime in with a better answer..

https://www.prowesscorp.com/what-is-intel-avx-512-and-why-does-it-matter/",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, the explanation is completely wrong.","the default avx2 offset is -1, which just so happens to be 5.1ghz when running at 5.2ghz default max turbo.",also the avx2 offset only kicks in on certain instructions that require higher voltage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
update: unplugging the computer for 20 minutes fixed it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if it happens again, you can try disabling the device under device manager and re-enable it.",just happened to me yesterday after an update as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you have 1 dimm then yes it'll get a lot faster.,it'll still be extremely slow though since that's a 5+ year old low end gpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hey could you be more specific about where you want to see more performance?,what program are you asking about.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah but if op ever gets an gpu it would make an pretty big difference,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

check what your vram max is set to in your bios.,"it's possible it has a small maximum limit so a ram upgrade will do nothing, and perhaps you can improve the graphics performance now.",see this link for more details - https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000041253/graphics/graphics-for-5th-generation-intel-processors.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then everything is fine.,but i recommend skylake or newer.,imo i3 is needed + ssd and 8gb ram.,"but if u have 1080p display, 8gb ram with haswell or ivy is fine",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
literally anything within the last 5 years.,probably like a i3-10100 and a cheap board though.,"or wait for the new i3-12100 and b660 in a couple of weeks, it will cost more sense its new, but better performance.",or just buy a refurbished office pc for like $200 total.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok so what the 1080p i dont have cpu yet but im build one for the first time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ok yea i was wondering how old to go back so 5 years no later 

yea i was debating  on buying parts refurbished also",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ok i see,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i run a nh-d15 but with only a single fan (second didn't fit).,"about 30c at idle, and 86c with cinebench.",ambient temp is about 20c.,i have the all core enhancement enabled.,meshify case with a single 120mm intake fan and a single 120mm exhaust fan.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nh-d15 2 fans, 30-35c idle.","50-70c gaming (depending on the game), max 89c in cinebench for me in a meshify 2 compact case",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have a nh d15 chromax black replaced the default 150mm fans with noctua chromax black 120mm ones and i get temps around 26 at idle or min and at 100% load while testing ( until now did just intel diagnostic test cpu load) i see 96â° celcius.,its on corsair 300r cabinet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have the exact same setup as you, your temps seem to be within the same ball park as mine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"at stock settings my 12700k reaches 72â°c in r23 with a single fan nh-d15 in a corsair obsidian 450d (2x 140mm intake, 1x 120mm exhaust), ambient temps are around 18-19â°c",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"100 c easy after a few seconds, because the stock settings on my msi pro are not limiting the cpu, allowing it to draw 230 w. (feared i didn't place the cooler right and re-did everything, but it did not change anything)

they sell a 120mm fan that fits the clips?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what kind of tool are you using for undervolting?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nope.,but i changed it to 120mm due to the cpu clearance constraint on my cabinet.,"i have corsair 300r and its 170mm cpu clearance however with 150mm, the fan is nearly touching the cabinet side case so i decided to go with 120mm which kinda works fine for now.","looking for a phantek cabinet here in my location p600s, so i can finally use the default nhd15 fans and 120mm fans for the case",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how did you get it to fit the clips?,or did you mount it some other way?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just that about a cm or so is left out on both the sides of the cooler thats on fins, but it fits well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so the original clips can stretch to fit it?,"what about the height, was that the same?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes absolutely.,the clips can stretch and its just good enough to close my side panel without any issues â˜ºï¸,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

wanna... trade :) nah fr tho it's nice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which fans are those?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

exactly.,it still does good on 1440p and i wonâ€™t replace it until prices go down closer to msrp,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

iâ€™ve seen it.,iâ€™ve considered a vertical mount.,"however, iâ€™ve decided to stick with this option because:

- it costs almost 80â‚¬ in spain
- it is pcie 3.0, however this z690 board supports pcie, so it will kill my future upgrade options
- iâ€™m not really a fan of the aesthetics.","it hides a big piece of the motherboard
- i donâ€™t like the fact that it adds an important amount of distance between the pcie and the cpu/northbridge so this has to hurt somehow.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

oh yeah!,i bet you're loving that upgrade!,i think i can get another year or 2 from this 7700k.,my resolution is 3440x1440 so i'm more gpu limited than cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah man!,"in euros, depending on your country this may vary slightly",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

oh you are good.,the 7700k is still a hell of a cpu and would still be in more than 2 years from now and even more.,i also do 3440x1440 and my gpu goes to 99% when my 12600k sits at around 40%,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i find the i7 would be the most cost effective yet good long term solution that should last you a long time, the 12600k is good but the 12700k will give the best benefit for your uses",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m going with the i9.,my budget isnâ€™t as high as yours so iâ€™ll use ddr4 that i already have.,"ordered my heat sink adapter to fit the new board and luckily i already have a 3080. 

really i just need a board and cpu.",for your use case the i7 would be better.,put the extra savings in the video cards and or motherboard.,get you a gen 4 nvm if you havenâ€™t got that already.,even the 12600 is an awesome cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 12700k with the full 8 performance cores and more cache will age the best, excluding the more expensive 12900k.",should last you 5+ years.,"the 12600k is great too, but with only 6 performance cores, a few games are already using more, so in 3+ years it won't age as well",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

12700k seems to like the extra cores over the 12600k when it comes to cod so i'd probably recommend the i7.,most other games the difference isn't major between those two.,but since you also wanna do some creative work then the i7 is even better as well.,so yea i7 will be best for u,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"those temps are all normal, check your radiator placement, fan speeds, airflow",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its not good if its thermal throtle with 360 aio..i had same problem but only high temps when using cinebench or something like that..my problem was that aio was not making good contact with cpu so cooling was not good..make sure you screw hard enaugh and that aio cooler is making good contact with cpu..i have same cpu and 360 aio and with cinebench all core i get max 75c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
check your aio fan speeds and try setting them higher.,what does hwinfo / hwmonitor say about your fan speeds on idle and on load?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

edit has been made,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your temps are way too high for gaming when using a 360 aio.,there is definitely a lack of proper contact on the cpu.,make sure you use enough thermal paste and firmly secure the aio cold plate to the cpu.,you should see temps at the mid 60s for gaming.,also make sure that the pump is at full speed and fans are at 1500rpm at the minimum while gaming.,"here is a great approach for undervolting while maintaining high clock speed: https://youtu.be/r460nl_wdgc

>just wanted to post this in case anyone was considering ordering the specific brackets for lga 1700 cpus or thought their cooling was fine with the old lga 1200 kits.,well... this is very cooler dependant subject because some aio like asus strix lc 360 and noctua nh-d15 there is literally no difference which brackets you are using.,then there is some aio which gonna have issues with lga 1200 brackets so they require lga 1700 and maybe even air coolers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"z690 asus tuf ddr4 and nzxt kraken aio with lga 1200 kit worked perfect for me, i tried arctic aio with 1700 mounting kit and it didnâ€™t work at all, no matter what i did the aio would not make contact with the cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i know this is an older thread but i figured i'd post because i haven't found my answer yet... i have a h100i elite capelix that didn't come with 1700 standoffs.,i have the z690-a strix board that supports 1200 brackets but i've seen that there is a slight height variance with the standoffs... just wondering if anybody has used this combo and can confirm if the 1200 works with this cooler or if i need to use the retrofit kit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m in the same boat as you.,thanks for the advice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"on my strix z690-a motherboard and silent loop 2 360mm cooler, changing from the lga 1200 to lga 1700 bracket made 0 difference in temperatures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"im running a h100i rgb pro xt on a 12600k using the  lga1200 bracket and standoffs, under 100% load i peak at 70 degrees.",i actually broke one of the stand off screws and currently im only running 3 with zero issues.,so depending on the cooler lga1200s work perfectly fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am using evga 280 clc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so your telling me i can use the lga1200 bracket from strix lc 360 with 12900k?,how do yoiu know this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have the arctic 320 and even though i had the bracket kit for lga1700 i still thermal throttle on cinebench runs, guess this explains it?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i also want to know this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"can confirm the lga 1200 bracket also works flawlessly with nzxt kraken z73, msi z690 tomahawk (ddr4) and i9-12900k",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hey!,so i can report that it works just fine.,i did order the new standoffs but i haven't switched them out.,i've been using it with the normal standoffs since posting this months ago and have had zero issues.,i keep an eye on temps because i'm a nerd and no issues there.,everything has stayed cool and happy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

with k you can run a separate monitor using the hdmi/displayport off the mobo and enjoy multi monitor setup.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this guy-is correct.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

spot on.,there's zero differences with the 3 currently released k skus and their kf equivalents besides igp.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very nice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"was thinking of going 12700kf but bought k at release, had to troubleshoot the gpu when rebuilding the pc, thank fuck i bought with an igpu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it took me a while to figure out that you were talking about the graphics part.,for a second i was like: wtf is he yakking about.. low graphics on a 12th gen..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"earlier this year i was considering going with an intel cpu for the igpu, but ended up just going for ryzen due to how i never had a gpu die on me in over 2 decades of pc gaming.","just a few months later my 2080 ti died, lol.","it was still under warranty though, gladly i had a laptop good enough to still do my work (noticeably worse than my desktop though) and could borrow a friend's gpu to backup useful work stuff from my desktop.","it wasn't disastrous, but that stress and downtime wasn't worth what i saved by not getting igpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
take the intel with a igpu.,it supports 8k video playback (av1 decode) which is supported only on nvidia rtx 3000 and amd rx 6000 series gpus.,if performance is similar op will be able to opt for a older but still capable gpu for gaming and only needing to plug in the igpu for watching 8k content when its more widely available.,and having an extra gpu gives op the option to flip it if gpu prices go even more bonkers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wow!,that is impressive.,going to be ordering the k version soon anyway but this has cemented it for me.,cheers u/fnkytown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"other from integrated graphics, no, they're the same",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is maybe not significant but cpu with apu will get hotter so you might get better cooler for k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
press f to pay respects to the dead igpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
provided you have a motherboard with a video out port.,some older generation enthusiast boards did not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
k just means unlocked.,"doesn't say anything about igpu

f means no igpu (or disabled)

kf = unlocked and no igpu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you don't need a processor with an integrated gpu if you have a dedicated gpu.,the only drawback is that if you dgpu dies or malfunctions you will have no igpu as backup.,"otherwise, the processors are identical.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if i'm right, you don't need a cpu that has an integrated graphics in it if you already has a gpu but you don't have a gpu you'll need a cpu that has integrated graphics in it cause with out you'll get no output display on your system.",and if i'm right there is no benefits in having both integrated and a dedicated gpu cause the integrated will just get disabled by the gpu.,\*correct me if i'm wrong thank you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not any evidence of that that i have ever seen.,"if you look at the intel website specs sheet for each one, they are exactly the same except for the igpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
kf perform better.,its the better choice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
right?,"it's $20 for an incredibly handy cpu option that when you need it, you really really need it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"edit: just saw your comment, thank you!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gotcha,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nope that's false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i can't think of a single board that takes a 12600k that doesn't have a video out.,"f's only became a thing with the 9th gen, they've all had video out since then.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
got it.,exactly what i was looking for.,"and if i have both dedicated gpu and integrated gpu, the computer will know to use the dedicated one?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
didnt you mean you dont need cpu with apu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not necessarily.,check out this direct x 12 article from 2015 about being able to use both integrated and dedicated gpus.,"[https://www.pcgamer.com/directx-12-will-be-able-to-use-your-integrated-gpu-to-improve-performance/](https://www.pcgamer.com/directx-12-will-be-able-to-use-your-integrated-gpu-to-improve-performance/)

the ability to have a spare gpu is also priceless.",perhaps having the integrated graphics disabled gives you more thermal headroom on the cpu since of course the entire cpu shares one ihs.,"if you follow benchmark websites, there tends to be a pattern of the kf cpus being extremely marginally faster.",1-2%.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
windows can actually assign apps (usually non-gaming) to the integrated gpu in order to save power.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
k and kf have the same performamce kf only don't have integrated graphic card,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if gpu is disabled it'll perform identically.,the difference is marginal and likely due to the tiny amount of power it draws (more than anything).,it's also still useful for troubleshooting if disabled as after a cmos reset most boards enable it by default.,"literally every spec on the chips is the same on f models, it just has a disabled gpu.",if setup the same they perform the same.,publically sourced benchmarks aren't exactly controlled - they omit little details like that and are prone to other variances.,"i expect they'll hold true however in this instance, i'd also expect that the gap would close if the k sku were tested with gpu disabled.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as the saying goes, better safe than sorry",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"troubleshooting, additional video out (handy to just run a tv off a second hdmi or something sometimes), and intel quicksync transcoding.",it's a no brainer for me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you can't game on a 12600kf without a gpu, you need one",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wdym explain pls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"right, just saying there were older than 9th gen intel motherboards that dont have outputs.",i had one.,makes the igpu is useless.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yup the computer will use your gpu rather than your igpu if you have one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"two different ports for the monitor to plug in to, so its not an issue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you plug a monitor into the gpu it will use the gpu.,plugging it into the dgpu if you have one is the recommended configuration.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i fixed the post, small typo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oooo thank you for the clarification!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes thank you for clearing that up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"okay, the k and kf cpus are identical except the kf has no integrated graphics whereas the k chip does.","using a dedicated gpu there would be no difference in performance, other than slight variance in silicon, any difference should be put down to margin of error, buying a different cooler really wouldn't change temperature of either the k or kf chips much, especially when using a gpu.",some chips are better binned and clock higher at lower temperatures.,with a dedicated gpu they would perform almost identical.,in my opinion for only a slight increase in cost the k chip is the better option as it provides a convenient tool in case you were without a gpu for a period of time or for troubleshooting purposes.,"if you are on a budget sure go for the kf, but the price difference is small, especially when factoring in the high cost of other pc components currently",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

probably disabling the igpu closes the distance as the most likely cause is the active igpu's influence on power and thermal limits,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i doubt the tests are lying, there's likely other factors at play however.","if i got results like that i'd be manually setting everything, and trying a different board/bios revision as the kf is simply the k with the gpu permanently fused off.",i wish i had a 12th gen setup on hand here and a few motherboards - i'd be testing this one out thoroughly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if there is no graphic output on the motherboard side, it's likely that it doesn't have a power phase for the igpu.",both motherboard and cpu must support it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i've had a 9700k with a d15h and it cools it great - and i've not noticed any sag after 2+ years.,"however, i think it'd be overkill for you given you've got a 9700 on b360m motherboard so will be limited 65w.",given that's the same limit as your 8400 the stock cooler will probably be not much  different - so if you could tolerate that before you'll be fine.,if not - a dark rock 4 should be fine.,i've had one in the past and it worked great on a 88w ryzen 3600. just a small warning though - when i tried it on an intel board one of the screws broke (though i might have just got unlucky).,maybe consider the noctua u12-s redux?,it's cheaper than the options you're looking at and would be fine for a 65w part.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"to be fair, avx512 was never officially supported or advertised by intelâ€¦",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is avx512 for?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe buy a cpu that's actually advertised to support avx512 if you need it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1. this was never an advertised feature of the processor, it's not supposed to be there.",2.  the performance implication for normal workloads that these cpus are designed for are negligble since the cores downclock.,"3. moreover, you can only ever enable it if you disable all your e-cores in bios which generally isn't a good idea for both performance and efficiency
4. and if your thoughts go towards ""what about the alderlake cpus without e cores"" and my answer would be that it doesn't matter.",nobody buying that low end cpu is actually gonna care about the seconds of time savings rendering out their video.,5. it not a certified feature and might actually be broken on some peoples cpus.,"idk about you, but getting calculation errors and random bluescreens in my avx512 workloads as well as the reduced overclocking since the cpus are not binned or certified according to avx workload.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i half expected this to happen one day, just not this soon.",i suppose this means that the 12900ks would never have avx512 in any form which is a deal breaker to me as someone who's interested in getting one for rpcs3.,one commenter on igorslab made a good point that intel could've done this to prevent board makers from enabling avx512 by default on 6+0 alderlake cpus.,this could be a potential problem if customers rma their cpus which crash at stock settings because it had nonfunctional avx512 units that intel explicitly stated was not supported.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what are you actually using avx for?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is a setback.,the whole point is around the future of avx-512: who's the user and who's the developer?,"say, how to cultivate the ecosystem?","sure, there are scattered fantastic ones, e.g., [https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.05109](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.05109).","but overall, there are so few because when it comes to acceleration, people usually go to cuda.","despite the programming model, everyone can access cuda devices, and my code that runs on my gaming gpu can also run on serious production systems.",what if i want to program avx-512?,"i can't unless i access some server-grade cpu (#), nor can i infer avx-512 use from avx-2 code (long story, can be concluded as non-practical).",*# i'm not going back for 11th gen.*,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i totally agree.,"in regard of the upcoming amd's zen 4 competition which will have avx-512 across the board, this is poor decision making from intel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"from the article, avx-512 can be enabled by those who still want it on alder lake.",">community members have already managed to inject an older microcode version into new bios releases, effectively providing a modified bios image with avx-512 support.",.,.,.,the deactivation of avx-512 is reversible and there is no downgrade-protection to the microcode version â€“ at least at this point.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if they disable avx512, i will choose amd in my next build, currently using i7-4790.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why do people even care about avx512?,it's essentially a highly parallelized set of floating point calculations right?,"gpu's already handle those types of workloads better than cpu's will...

i just don't get why you wouldn't want that math dumped off to the discrete gpu to begin with (assuming you have a decent one).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
shouldn't the 12600 and lower fully support avx-512 since they don't have e cores?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"by being (or not being) advertised, it really means the marketing department decided how a product delivers functionality.","\*rumor\* says that the engineers were in fury (if it's true, i can understand).","previously, they wanted to push avx-512 (actually, a subset of it) for dnn inference: this adds value for sure.",and now avx-512 instruction meeting little core could be fatal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i remember seeing comments from intel that it was specifically *not* supported.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"useless for most people, but very useful for certain workloads",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"instead of 64 bit wide numbers, it's 512bit.","or, as i understand it, you can do the same operation on 2x256 bit numbers, or 4x128bit,or 8x64bit,or 16x32bit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
faster operations with vectors.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the only people who need it right now are *intel*.,"specifically, they need software developers to actually have avx-512 capable machines so they can add avx-512 support to libraries for shits, giggles, and blog posts.","then maybe, someday, intel will be able to sell a bunch of avx-512-capable cpus because someone needs it.","this is a blunder, imo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
logic does not always work over the internet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are there any that fit a lga1700 socket?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the problem is if intel ever wants avx-512 to be widely adopted, it has to be present in many cpus.",firefox didn't require sse2 until 2011. sse2 was introduced back in 2000 with netburst.,"and then you get some ""unique"" developers that are super laggards or lazy, such as bethesda using only x87 instructions for floating point calculations when they launched skyrim in 2011 because their code wouldn't compile with optimizations (probably because the code was s*** to begin with).",no sse or mmx at all.,it took a modder to add sse support to get a +40% fps boost.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hedt?,plenty of boards/cpus for cheap used and new.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m sure the tens of people outside of intel who actually need it will buy cpu tiers that are actually supposed to have it instead of relying on a workaround for professional workâ€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's integers and floating point.,gpu's 64bit performance is usually trash.,gpu to cpu and vise versa transfers have high latency.,"adding cpu vector instruction support is a lot easier compared to adding gpu support, sometimes even for free with just compiler optimalzations or trivial when already optimized with older vector instructions.",cpu can be used in gpu bottlenecked workloads.,avx512 also extends axv and sse instructions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't think the cores were designed with hybrid in mind.,golden cove having avx512 makes sense since its a sapphire rapids core.,getting mixed in with gracemont was probably not intended until the last few years considering intel's original plans were 7nm around 2020/2021.,on 7nm they may have been able to make small cores with avx512 without breaking the bank in power/die area.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and if you bought a 12th gen cpu for the avx-512 instruction set you are basically screwed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
software didn't widely use avx2 and avx until years of older cpus being replaced with newer ones that replaced them.,i recall 1-2 years ago a gaming developer said that they still optimize their game for 1080p 60 fps because there was no point in catering to niche users (same reasoning that lead to multi-gpu support being killed off because only a small fraction of gamers had multi-gpus).,same with sse versions.,firefox 4.0 required sse2 back in 2011 or so.,which that instruction set was introduced in 2000 with netburst.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"idk, but why would you buy into a socket with no compatible cpus if you have such special needs?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seems obvious intel doesn't want it adopted or it would be supported in alder lake.,the e-core design probably made it too challenging and/or they pumped their gimmick instruction set beyond usefulness and are dumping it.,it might as well be dead now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">hedt

not really hedt.","hedt is for production, while i need a local machine with cutting-edge technology to prototype something.","therefore, a small-scale full-fledged system is desired.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
let's have that conversation again when consumer class zen 4 raphael launches later this year with avx-512 support while intel doesn't support it and see how it gets publicly perceived by then.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if this were true, why do tools like cuda, opencl and vulkan etc.",seem used regularly while avx512 is almost completely ignored by most desktop applications?,"if it was *that* easy to implement, why doesn't anyone bother including support for it at least as an optional optimization?",the behavior of coders doesn't align with your explanation.,"everyone would be looking to take advantage of it if it were that great and that easy to use, yet very few seem to care about it, and some big voices in the industry seem to actually shit on it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what u talking about.,it's already 7nm now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and if you bought ~~a 12th gen cpu~~ **any cpu that isn't advertised or rated for avx-512** for the avx-512 instruction set you are basically screwed.,well i mean... no shit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not really, just donâ€™t update your bios",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
were the cpus advertised as supporting those instructions?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"considering they never sold them as supporting it, if you bought one for avx-512 that's on you",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what's with all the responses here?,any influence from intel employees?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not sure i understand-do you not want to build a system to mess around with avx 512?,if yes then hedt could be a good option.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"cool, still 99% of people buying zen 4 won't have any use for it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"because most platforms don't support avx512 yet, so it's not worth it yet to enable to have potential bugs for a small group.",it's to costly to support a build for only a few users.,this was also true for sse and avx at some point.,"sse is used so much more than cuda/opencl, if you run linux and compile from source i guarantee you that you will have more applications with avx512 than opencl/cuda (every memcpy call will be avx512).",also i'm a coder and idk what your last point is other than that vector instructions require different coding style if you want to take full advantage of it.,but this is also true for sse/avx.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"alder lake is 10nm esf, not 7nm",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well if in the future you want to use a better ddr5 ram kit you may want to update your bios and at that point you are done, it is a pity that this kind of things happen, opefully intel rethinks about this",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"until you install windows and it automatically updates on your laptop and you can say goodbye to undervolting, along with other neat features",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

windows can upload a new bios firmware to your bios but you still get a confirmation on boot up from your bios asking if you'd like to proceed with the flash.,this is good until intel pushes the seamless firmware updates to windows as well (becoming a linux server feature shortly).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

your cpu clocking at 4.2 is not why your fps is lower.,"at best you would expect a 9% drop in fps if you were 100% cpu bound and scaling were perfect, which is very doubtful.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4.6ghz is probably one core under perfect conditions.,in game you have a lot more than one core stressed so thatâ€™s probably it.,"even so, in a laptop the thermal budget is limited, so giving more power to the cpu can take away from the gpu, which for the vast majority of games will result in lower performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msi z690 edge wifi d4 is winning so far,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
occt is afaik basically just linpack.,linpack is very memory bandwidth heavy and so gets hotter the less memory bandwidth starved the cpu is.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what latencies are you getting on ddr4 vs ddr5?,i am on tuf ddr4 mobo and thinking of moving to ddr5 with similar ddr5 ram.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why not get a usb sound card?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
take quick look at your voltages.,i've tested a few intel launches now where mobo manufacturers amp up the voltages and enable things like mce to give themselves a benchmark advantage and then later undo it in a bios update.,"also manufacturers that just screw it up and run the processors hot, gigabyte x390 boards as an example.",this can vary board to board even within the same manufacturer so it's worth checking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is it just linpack when running variable large data set which is supposed to give good error detection rate using normal mode which does not put nearly the stress the tougher modes do.,temps get so much higher when using small data set.,"&#x200b;

for liquid coolers does not matter or for those mobos with ram slots so far away from cpu or small air coolers which obviously small air coolers not good for today's higher end cpus.","&#x200b;

what is your intended use case?,"keeping xmp is on the preferred state, so long as it's stable.","with your linpack bench, it's running hotter because you're feeding the cpu faster so the cpu can do more work per second - but it gets proportionally hotter.","if you're primarily going to be gaming, this heating will not be an issue and the xmp profile will only benefit you.","if you're mostly doing algebra, xmp will also be better, but i guess you could choose to run more slowly and stay cooler; however, i feel like tuning the cpu would better serve this purpose than gimping your ram.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not so much ddr5 bandwagon but more the fact that ddr5 boards are better all around and more choices with better features.,plus there was part of me that just thought ddr5 is future and can upgrade ot faster ram down the road without taking whole system apart.,"&#x200b;

but probably would not have if the options of ddr4 boards were much better.","&#x200b;

ddr5 is expensive (even not including scalper prices and shortage) and it makes cpu run hotter if you cool it with large noctua cooler than ddr4 ram.","&#x200b;

just wish there were more options for ddr4 that were good boards.",the msi tomahawk and edge z690 look like good options with great onboard audio for z906 5.1 surround sound and good vrms with solid thermals.,just wish i did not have to wait until tuesday and could find someone to pick it up from as i have been stuck in purgatory with my build.,gonna have to probably wait but it is what it is and important to get it right.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that will depend on the game you're playing and the settings you're playing it at and the framerate you're aiming for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes to some games such as spiderman, battlefield 2042, far cry 6 etc.",source: my own experience !,[gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its fine.,dont worry about it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you afford a 3080 you can afford a decent processor that ""goes with it"", just get one, it will be much better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes it will bottleneck.,some games no but if you're trying to play big modern titles then yes it will bottleneck.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whats your monitor refresh rate.,if its 240 hz than you need to change the cpu.,if its 144hz or 165hz  than i think you should be fine mostly.,the cpu will bottleneck 3080 but you will be doing 100 fps or so.,so no need to worry.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a bit, but if thered be one word i could just remove from the entire pc building community itâ€™d be the word â€˜bottleneckâ€™.",people worry so so so much about it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just get a 12400?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably will be fine unless your playing many cpu intensive games,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes but who cares?,have fun with  it and upgrade the cpu later when you get more budget; nbd.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, even a 3700x is a bottleneck for a 6750xt, i get 50-60 fps in acv when the same gpu with a 13600k gets 80-95",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
spiderman needs at least 8 strong cores?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so it wonâ€™t bottleneck?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a 12600k probably isnâ€™t too much more expensive than a 10400, but op might just be getting it for free",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i will need to replace mobo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not really, i replaced my old 10400f with a 13600kf and the performance is much better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you want a yes or no answer, the answer is yes, there will likely be a bottleneck.",***how much*** of a bottleneck it will be depends on the games and settings you play.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there will be a bottleneck.,quite a large one at that.,but whether it matters or not is up to you.,"even within the same generation, a 10900k will give you significantly more frames than a 10400.

and then ryzen 5000 series will give you a few more frames than a 10900k, meaning ryzen will outclass the 10400.

and then thereâ€™s the 3d cache stuff, 12th gen, 13th gen,  and ryzen 7000, which all perform significantly better than ryzen 5000.

in that scale, the 10400 is way behind in fps produced.","however if you think the performance is fine, then donâ€™t worry about it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, as long as you set to ultra, 2k is gpu intense.",btw don't listen to many of the people here who solve everything with go top 15900k and problem solved.,many of us don't have a  dad or mom who give a couple of houses and a porsche and a boat and sometimes so  investing on a better cpu when you have a lower income or other prioritary expenses(a mortgage to pay or kids education bills) is a secondary expense.,i could treat myself with a 30000â‚¬ build but i would not feel good knowing that i could have done more interesting things with my money.,"anyways i love gaming, but i don't need to have the newest fanciest tech, because it outdates almost instantaneously.",i need a decent build that allows me to play tww3 or mass effect decently.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
play at 1440p and its fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10400f is kind slow.,1440p resolution will limit the graphics card a bit.,around 20% i guess.,"the lower the resolution, the worse it will be.","4k should be fine, but youre unlikely to be satisfied with 20 fps",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
enjoy your 3080 till you can get a better processor/mobo processor combo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"especially with what intel is doing, we are comparing 12900k to 13600k, only 1 gen after",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
untrue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is the answer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"more like 12900k to 13700k, and my understanding is that intel slapped on more cache for the improvements for the most part.","things are gonna get much more spicy as they shrink down to 4 and 3nm, though",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

nice dude enjoy.,the driver updates to arc are giving good gains.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
congrats.,hopefully intel keep up their good work on the drivers and continue to improve performance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have the same 1070 strix, itâ€™s showing its age",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm gaming it should only be about 30-40% faster.,still a great deal!!,but definitely not 90% better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ðÿ¥³,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nice, that's a fairly surprising uplift from a 1070!",also arc gps are beasts at rt so you'll be able to enjoy those features much more than people with lower end rtx cards.,i've been heavily considering grabbing a 770 cause i'm getting more & more curious what they have to offer as the drivers keep getting better & better.,also would like to foster some support for a third player in the gpu market.,with as off the rails as nv is getting i think my current 3090 may be my last nv gpu for awhile...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
arc will also be my next gpu given the nonsense price of both amd and especially nvidia â€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
congrats!,love the clean design intel used on their gpus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
guess you missed the video linus tested that card vs 3060. hopefully your games are all dx12 compatible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"good stuff, what would be the nvidia equivalent of this card?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"don't compare intel gpus with 3d mark, intel has cheating optimizations in their driver to boost 3d mark score.",that's why 3d mark scores on arc gpu often show up as invalid.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this card really performs under any workload.,i love my a770.,just wish intel made it slightly faster but for the price it cant be beat.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would like to buy 750 too but the power consumption is way too high imo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"im considering an intel a380 because, slot power",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so, arc a750 is low end and 770 is mid-range?",are they planning on something high-end?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks a lot!,"synthetic tests are looking really good, just want to move some games from the hard drive to make some real game tests to see if it can hold up with the gains",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there are still some bugs i encountered by now, but nothing that couldnt be fixed by restarting my computer by now.","itâ€˜s not perfect but now its comparable to amd, at least in my time with the 5600xt.",nvidia still holds a special place in my heart because they where just out of the box usable and never made me problems.,but only speaking for myself!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for now i just tested forza horizon 5. full hd with everything bumped to extreme with ray-tracing without fsr or anything , it still holds 60fps.","same settings on 4k it barely holds 30fps average, but i really cant complain for 277â‚¬.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same here it was a good card but its time to retire the old boy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in games of the 1070's own era, yeah 40%

in modern titles the arc will pull much more ahead (as would an rdna2 or ampere in the same class)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
true these are synthetic tests.,"at least in forza horizon 5 the difference is day and night, the 1070 has to eat a lot of dust in comparsion to the a750.","witcher & cyberpunk are downloading right now, kingdome come will follow also as fallout 76. i recently had an accident at work so theres plenty of time to test the hell out of this new competitor",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i considered the 770 but saw the performance uplift wasnt that high.,but i think it should be fine if you want to go 4k all the way.,"also, i think the 3090 still beatâ€˜s the a770 with ease so i wouldnt consider changing your gpu.","but the arc looks and feels reeeeeaaaally solid, no gpu that i had in my hands feels so nice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
weâ€˜re driving the same boat ðÿ˜ had the exact same feeling and thats why i went intel (also because of asthetics and the flex to say i have an all intel build.,"never had a cool pc to brag with it) and by now, i can say that im more than happy with the performance for this money.","only thing that bothers me is the watt-usage while idling, itâ€˜s pretty high compared to the competition and that makes the card a little too hungry.","but thats really nothing that makes me re-think my choice, just a small slap in the face from intel for being a beta-tester",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for this price you can get an 6600 xt from amd whic beats a750 in overall performance.,arc isn't some magical price/performance wizard ....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks a lot!,it also feels like it looks.,"for me, not one single gpu felt that good built wise, not one single other card regardless of the price.","it has a lot more weight than my 1070, but doesnt sag at all.","with that said, all they have to do now is getting more power and better drivers out, then i can safely say that there will be no other option to me.",at least they know how to build a properly product,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nah, didnt missed it.","but also i read recently that they had an big update, so i gave it a shot.","i didnt had any major problem meanwhile, from emulated ps1 games to cyberpunk everything worked fine.","except after frying the card with 6000 benchmarks, it would not start any game till i restarted the pc.","error code showed â€žno gpuâ€œ ðÿ¤· 
also, as far as i see : the arc surely gives the 3060 itâ€˜s run for money now.",there are games where arc outperforms nvidia and vice versa.,forza horizon 5 is running totally fine and more comparable to the 3060ti while borderlands 3 is still nvidia/amd turf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends.,"most of the time, itâ€˜s 3060/3060ti turf.","but there are some games i found out that ran ok, and some where even a 3070 would have to keep up.","but i would say, in my case, overclocked 3060 most of the time",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>that's why 3d mark scores on arc gpu often show up as invalid.,that just means it's an unverified driver.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
really?,i havenâ€™t experienced an â€˜invalidâ€™ score.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just wrote a comment stating that i want to see if it can hold up the promise from the synthetic tests ^^ need to move some demanding games from the hard drive to the ssd to see whats up.,"i think its a good  baselinetest and to see if it can handle stress, but we will see if it can hold up its promies as soon as my games are moved to the other drive.",time will show,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks a lot, im enjoying the hell out of it.","cyberpunk with raytracing maxed out with average of around 30fps with some dips into the 15â€˜s is more than enjoyable, since i never played this game anywhere over medium or high on 1080p.","and all this for 277â‚¬, no questions asked",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i dont bother too much about the consumption, since its not that high compared to other cards in its class",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes for an ultra clean build, that card should fit its purpose ðÿ‘œðÿ¼ there is something sexy about pci-powered gpus",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
possibly.,"at least they feel premium, no green or red card i ever had in my hand feels this well put together",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah the a750 sits in a really good value spot intel should price the a770 down to make it more juicy too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"but nvidia now is overpriced af, i got my 6750xt (runs better in litterally every game i play compared to my friend, who has same cpu, amount of ram but a 3070, i bought the 6750xt for 450â‚¬, 3070s were arround 750-850â‚¬",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™m stuck with my 4k tv because my fhd 144hz monitor just broke, i don't play very demanding titles so i think i'll do this upgrade too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah pascal is really weak at low level api performance and the opposite for arc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thank you for clarification threeleggedchimp, theres no one that could have an more logical answer to this statement than you â¤ï¸",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was upgrading from a 980gtx and 2700x to the arc 770 and 5800x.,i was shocked to find out my 750w psu couldn't push it.,"had to go to an 850. is this normal, or was my 10 yr old 750w on it's last legs?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its almost 10 times higher in idle compared to the amd 6600,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i meant performance-wise,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thats def.,true for gaming and most of us dont do any other stuff than that.,"i understand that nvidia comes with a higher price tag, since they got features that amd snd intel doesnt have.","also (at least in my case) i never ran into problems with nvidia, out of the box into the tower and thats it.","i bought the 1070 over a year ago after i sold my other computer to someone and the last driver update was in july, gamed till yesterday without one single error.","amd wasnt that bad like people want to suggest in terms of driver issues, itâ€˜s comparable to the problems i ran into with arc.","small quality of life issues, thats all i got.","or in other words : you dont need to drive a mercedes, a mitsubishi will do its job just fine.",but you can safely say that you feel the difference in the way the car is built and drives.,"in the end, both will get you from a to b",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i only have a 4k-tv with 60hz.,i think for this purpose and for this money its absolutely well placed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's not normal at all, you should be able run that combo with a high quality 550w, let alone 750w.",the arc is power hungry but not extraordinarily so in games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh, yes!",the idle power and fan curve is definatly something that bugs me a little bit.,"but considering the gpuâ€˜s build quality and closed-style, it cant run 0rpm silence mode.","also, i never let my car run on idle either :) but itâ€˜s def.","something they need to work out next time, i give it a pass for now.",theyâ€˜ve just learned walking,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"theyâ€˜re both mid-tier in my opinion, at least the arc750 can compete with 3060/rx6600 without any troubles.","even exceeding the performance in some games, but also underwhelms in other games",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes but i didnt have any problem with drivers i mean it just always worked fine, rdna2 is not like polaris, and im sorry but i dont feel like paying almost 1000â‚¬ for a gpu with only 8gb of vram.... if 3070s were 16gb i would have thought about having one or waiting for a discount or something, but tjen there is the 6900xt for 799â‚¬ (same as 3070) and is way way better",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
let me rephrase that.,it would not power on.,"pushing a x570 mb, two m2 ssds, 2 older ssds and 2 hdds.",i made an assumption that i didn't have enough powa.,thus the 850 psu purchase.,seems like ole corsair 750 may have been near the end perhaps?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i didnt have major problems either with the 5600/6600xt that i recomended.,"only one time we had to ddu the driver trough safe mode, and thats nothing to cry about, most of the time a reboot helped fix everything that occured before.","they are fine for their price ðÿ‘œðÿ¼ and yes i totally agree nvidia really needs to step up their game, they charge way to much for graphic cards with that kind of performance",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if it wouldn't power on, i'd say that was the end",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah your psu was dead or you plugged something in wrong and didn't realize it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah and 4070ti for 1000â‚¬ msrp is a shame, the downgrade in corecount and vram of the 4060 vs 3060 (3072 vs 3840 and 8/128 vs 12/192) is a shame, the price is going to be 499 vs 329 of the 3060, and it will perform arround 3% betterðÿ’€",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, not so much.","the 2700x was on an old b450 mb, and the 980gtx was all installed in my nephew's rig.. they worked fine.. weird.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe the 750 was a bit weak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there is actually a video on youtube from linustechtips (ltt) that explains about why leaving your sticker on the bottom of your cpu cooler impacts the performance massively compared to the proper use of removing the packaging sticker.,donâ€™t worry if your cpu thermal throttles this is another way your computer cools down as throttling usually means that motherboard chipsets or the cpu reduces power output thus reducing the clock speed until the chipsets or cpu is able to run at a more suitable temperature whenever that thermal throttling stops that is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"maybe check your cooler's mounting, i was installing the same cooler but in 280mm last weekend on a 12400, the temperature went to 80c, then i removed the head and just saw only half the plate was covered with thermal paste, i remounted the head and the highest temperature from c23 benchmark was 65c.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"had same issue, used upgrade kit for 1700, make sure u installed it correctly.","now 83 c on stress test, 50-60 c in gaming",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have a 13th gen and i'm seeing similar things.. when i do normal operations it is sitting at 35-ish, if it is at 30% processor use, it is up to 45-50, and when i run it full blast 100% processor, it bounces around 90-105 a bunch.","&#x200b;

does yours seem to have a pattern of the temps going up and down really fast?","mine can go from 50 to 100 in a matter of a few seconds if conditions are right, and then the fans and pumps kick in and it bounces back down to 90, when i cut the usage back to idle (5%-10% processor utilization), it will drop to 45 within 10 seconds.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thanks!,"iâ€™m running cinebench now and itâ€™s still 99c but at least it wasnâ€™t hitting that during idle, lol.",iâ€™ll test it with its an actual game next and iâ€™m sure itâ€™ll be fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was getting 100c on cinebench too.,but after i installed thermalright's contact frame it went to 87 max.,you can check my post about it.,enjoy your build xd,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"check power draw during cinebench, it gives you a rough idea of whether or not the temperature is reasonable.","according to guru3d, this cooler should be able to handle 380w, which means there should still be some issue with the mount/contact, if the cooler isn't defective.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

$200 more for a cpu capable of 8 channel.,"then at least that, or more, for a motherboard capable of it, then 3~4x that on the memory to use it.",you are at an easy $1000 difference despite the cpu price only being $200 more.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, price is very bad  
higher than cascade lake-x per core",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most of the atx form factor motherboards probably won't support neither the super high number of pcie channels nor 8 channel memory.,both of these features require physical wires on the motherboard.,so those advantages will be lost on people who are not specifically building the system for them in the first place.,there might be advantages in the monolithic die vs the tile version.,"not sure about that, we need to wait for benchmarks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah, the pricing is moronic.","especially when you take into consideration that those 24 cores wont be really more performant than 13900k/7950x, that cost 4x less.","yeah, they offer more io and memory channels, but how that justifies said price-increase, i would not know.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this.,especially for an oem customer the difference between them in price will be large due to the memory and motherboard.,"it's tempting to think that intel only thinks about what the handful of people on reddit want, but this is really not the case.","they're thinking what dell, etc want since they're placing most of the orders.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i feel like they should have had two different chipsets.,"ie w770 with quad channel udimms and  56 pci-e lanes, and w790 with eight channel r-dimms and 112 pci-e lanes.",that would have coupled the 2400 series with cheaper boards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
exactly my thoughts.,i was always wanted to get x299 since it launched because itâ€™s cool.,but donâ€™t have chance to until they axed the price with cascade lake x. while everyone said it is bad refresh but performance wise it is holding its own till 13th gen mainstream and even now memory speed is still on par.,"with the new hedt and its cost for entry, means i have to go to mainstream for my next build.",for op of course they priced the sku as it is to incentive people to spend on more expensive one.,isnâ€™t it always like this with literally anything else too?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[they do,](https://www.asus.com/motherboards-components/motherboards/workstation/pro-ws-w790e-sage-se/) that's a silly take given older boards for threadrippers and such.",the asus w790 has 7 x pci 5.0 slots that run in 6 at 16x and 1 at 8x.,all pci 5.0 don't get silly about claiming it doesn't count because it's eatx.,"it also supports 8 channel memory, 4 channel if using a w2400 in the same board.",w790 boards can use either processor and the lane/channel limit is set by the processor.,so that's not it.,latency between the xcc cores vs the mcc mono would be different but not in a way that would matter for the workloads that these things would face.,"no gamer is going to use these over an i9 13900, and the difference in latency is lost by being able to use so many more cores for workloads that benefit from the high thread counts that can be pulled.",ie: those extra 4 cores are worth their weight in gold.,so it still stands.,what is the incentive?,or the logic.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this.,if end users were buying htpc platforms then intel's x series and amd's threadripper wouldn't have gotten axed.,sales in that area are very low.,the big money is in the workstation.,intel just realized they could throw a bone the htpc way here without any other competition.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it makes more sense for niche parts like this to allow the same boards to work with both processors.,that way oems can still offer a budget option without having to design two motherboards.,otherwise they might only offer one line of processors and note both.,"for home users, in practice most boards are probably going to be designed for one (e.g.",4 channels) or the other (8 channels and doesn't fit in atx).,i wouldn't be surprised if some only support one set of processors even if the chipset could do both.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, you found the absolute most expensive option available which does indeed support the full features of 3400 series.",however that seems to be the only board so far that does.,asus's other w790 board has quad channel memory and 64 pcie lanes.,asrock board also has quad channel memory and 64 pcie lanes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm just proposing that the chiplet branding be changed to easily identify the boards designed for the quad channel boards,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[removed],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are just arguing my point.,you have listed one more extremely expensive large motherboard that doesnâ€™t fit normal cases and another normal size board that has limited pcie.,people would have to really plan their build around that motherboard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

first of all -250 is insane undervolt.,"i think your problem is badly configured llc, you should find llc setting in bios and adjust it.","if im not mistaken, highest preset on asrock boards gives lowest voltage.","llc is cpu load line calibration, its called different on every motherboard, but name should be similar to what i said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have noticed now that after putting llc to level 5 out of 5 that my vid idle and stress voltage seems to be roughly 1.27v and 1.24v respectively and my core voltage per cpu-z is at 1.168v at idle and drops to 1.144v during stress test.,i would assume this is as good as itâ€™s going to get.,this is also with a -100mv offset on the cpu core/cache voltage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1.3-1.4 is totally normal for 13th gen in light/gaming loads.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why are you trying to undervolt an i5 out if curiosity?,i get an i9 and maybe even some i7s but don't understand the need for an i5.,heat dicilatikn issues or concern of longevity?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
try bios 9.03. the second round of 13th-gen-compatible bios for at least some asrock z690 boards tends to overvolt a lot.,mine was pushing past 1.5v and after the bios was rolled back it stayed at 1.3v or less.,also you should manually set the tjmax.,default is 115c and intel specs 100c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the only things configured are those that are pictured.,"and as far as -250 being insane, i thought the same when i saw 1.58v going through my brand new processor.","i only can seem to find llc offset settings in bios and all of them are set to auto

edit: i didnâ€™t get enough sleep because that clearly is pll offset iâ€™m referencing above.","i have a â€˜cpu core/cache load-line calibrationâ€™ setting set to auto which is level 4 out of 5. by the looks of this extremely basic graph, this is just to compensate for vcore droop and higher values allow it to go lower.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
vid when playing hogwarts legacy(crucify me if you must for playing this game) is at 1.34v and vcore is at 1.23. i am more than happy with that as the temps have come down and now i only see 87c at maximum.,it averages 60-65 while playing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"itâ€™s not necessarily undervolting an i5, itâ€™s undervolting it on this specific asrock board because it was sending 1.58v to the chip out of the box.",which was causing me to see temps of 105c+,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the heads up on the new bios.,did you have change any settings with 9.03?,or did bios come with better defaults?,if you did have make changes can you tell me what you changed?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, so select highest.","each motherboard is different, but asrock have extremely bad stock settings.","first of all, this  cpu should never go above 100c, because stock tjmax is 100c.","on asrock, for some reason, its 115c.",so change that.,need to find good llc and undervolt balance.,for example i too have 13600k.,"my default llc configuration was good on gigabyte board, i did simple -0.125 offset from stock adaptive offset, now my 13600k under full load goes only to 1.1 vcore and vid, max power usage is 130w, and max temperature after 20mins of cinebench r23 is 68c.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wow!,undercoating might be a good idea then.,that's crazy!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the defaults were correct with the earlier version.,default max vcore was about 1.3v on the 9.0x bios and 1.5v on the 10.0x on my board.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i found that using the cpu vcore compensation setting on level 1(out of 5) and removing all of my previous fivr configurations has dropped the voltage to ~1.27v on idle and 1.3v max.,the stress test on cpu-z actually drops the voltage down to 1.23ish instead of before where it would spike to 1.48. also no more temps over 87c on stress test whereas before it would hit 105+,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"also, where did you set your undervolt offset?",in fivr config or in voltage config?,"i posted what i have as far as fivr configuration options but in voltage configuration, i have the option to set cpu core/cache into offset mode, this only allows for a maximum of -100mv.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good.,"try doing simple offset of -0.05, should be stable and even better temps.","as i said, this cpu can easily go on stock speeds at 1.1vcore",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have different settings because my motherboard is different.,"anyway, from your screenshots.",leave system agent voltage alone.,leave ring voltage alone.,try doing vf offset.,"or, cpu core/cache offset, 100mv is enough if you core drops to 1.23v under load, that would give you 1.13v under load, which should be stable and close to limit of what should be stable",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it does not make sense.,save your money.,upgrade 4/5 years later.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"intel needs money, i say throw them a bone and upgrade.",your purchase today is helping bring future intel 3 chips for the rest of us!,if you donâ€™t want to give intel free money at least wait for the rumored 13 gen refresh coming later this year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"controversial opinion, i think itâ€™s worth upgrading.",the upgrade would be under $400 and youâ€™d essentially get a big uplift in every aspect.,youâ€™d be getting within 2-3% of the top gaming performance thatâ€™s currently available as well as major improvements in other daily tasks.,"if it involved updating the motherboard, iâ€™d say itâ€™s not worth the effort involved but since this is just a drop in upgrade i think itâ€™s worthwhile.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thanks for response.,yes 8 degrees is worth it.,iâ€™m thinking i should prob get one ordered.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how was the installation of the contact frame for you?,"i tried to install it today on my 13900kf, asus z790 maximus hero, and eventually gave up.",i found the frame rocked back and forward lengthwise which prevented it from actually screwing into the backplate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"iâ€™m running a 13600k and an ak620, which also has a convex plate.",i actually saw temps drop anywhere from  4-6 degrees when using the tg contact frame.,edit: will most likely vary from mobo to mobo though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
both.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the stock contact frame is that tension rod thingy, the reason why people use these new ones is because the stock configuration doesnâ€™t apply even pressure, so either cooler doesnâ€™t work as well as it would if the cpu was flat.",seems to be worth it to lower your cpu temps a few degrees,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the contact frame is a replacement for the stock ilm (the thing on the motherboard that holds your cpu in the socket that has the little lever).,"the reason people use it instead is the stock ilm doesn't apply even pressure to the cpu, so your cooler's cold plate gets less direct contact due to the imperfect pressure by the ilm.",these contact frames amend it by having pressure on all sides of the cpu heatspreader.,it works for both air and aio coolers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tg is made in germany with high labor costs.,tr is made in china.,i'd have gone tg if i could have found one for normal price just to support them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"well shit, my 13900k with unlimited power setting (+300w), gets 40500 points from cinebench, it hits max 94c with 360m aio, without using contact frame.",so contact frame isnt a must for every scenario..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the frame is a totally different thing.,whether or not you need it is up to you.,go to youtube and watch gamerznexus video on the frames and youâ€™ll get a better picture of what they do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,although probably possible you could very easily damage something like your socket pins if you try and install the frame on a mounted mobo.,"the frame should be installed when you are first building your pc and are ready to install
your cpu and cooler.",way easier.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you have evidence of this?,i've got a z790 board and a 13900k and have been debating installing one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,intel released a statement that doesnâ€™t actually acknowledge the issue and says their procs are running within spec on z790 boards.,they did not fix the issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have the cheaper thermalright, and that is very straightforward as it makes direct contact with the mobo.","the tg version however does not, hence it is possible to overtighten and damage the pins.","gn has a great segment on both frames, incl.",installation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i used one for the first time while installing the block for a custom loop - only real advice is to have the cpu installed using the stock ilm, remove the stock ilm, and install the contact frame.","using the thermalright one, had no (more) issues that normal, with an ek magnitude block.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the plate moves around.,you're supposed to drop it fully in place and then secure all 4. starting diagonally.,otherwise there's no point in using it as it'll be uneven.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you watch the gamersnexus video on it, theres a section where someone shows you how to install it correctly because the instructions it comes with is really vague.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you have experience with some high end cpu or full monoblocks with the easy mount backplate for a simple example, then this will make sense, but it's not difficult, but likely there is that ah ha moment.","i have 13900k and for sure i need to get one of these plates asap, i also plan to go with delid and direct-die liquid metal as i managed to score a killer sample on my 1st try!","back to the subject though, i have changed many contact plates on servers low end to super high end boards, though never for this reason, so i'm confident this will apply...

ok so what most people do even if they know you must do it diagnol to screw it in, its not quite that simple.. although i do own a .06nm torque driver which will be helpful but same as with backplates, just because you place screws in diagnol does not mean you can do it in 2 tries per screw... patience... get it on there and do not come close to your final tightening until the very end, i make about 10-15 rounds on each screw like 1 revolution or a half of one diagnol, repeat.","this way it will be even and you can adjust it on its way down and will be loose at first but when you get to that final point and its lined up properly you simply tighten the first one to the fullest and diagnol with the torque driver its like slight movement and then click, across, slight 1/5 turn click, and so forth, this method takes an extra 4 minutes and saves hours of unneeded headaches or potential damage..

when i swap cpu's or add a block for a build for a customer or my own pretty much monthly i learned from my neighbor who is electrical engeneer and super smart, he doesn't do much with computers but still knows all about them, and his friends all play with ln2 and even liquid helium.. they work at a nucluear plant so im sure tools and space is easy to come by as supplies!","the best tip i got from him though on mounting blocks was that his friends use a dental mirror, a two man job and apply super light amounts of paste on ihs when they use them, but they mount the blocks so even by using the dental mirror and some kind of borescope or something endoscope maybe, but they go around all sides and carefully view how high off the block each side is and also where the thermal paste is moving to first to counteract it.. they claim that alone makes an 8-10c minimum difference just on an aio over most peoples mounting... the magnification wouldnot  be needed but the mirror could also probably assist in this procedure!","i am about to order mine today and i can report better and shorter results...

that said, given i have experience should i go with the thermal grizzly or no?","i use their products proudly, but not too proud to find a plate that does the same job for much less money... no offense to steve from gn, i appreciate the fact he leaves nothing in the wind, and is very thourough just really tests things to their absolute fullest possible extent and i just have a hard time watching all that sometimes id like to see jay do a video on it, but hey, ill still check out steves videos  too... idk.. any input is appreciated if none i understand and i will manage, just thought id ask while tossing in my 9 cents.. lol.. sorry for the tldr..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i had no issues installing at all, following the gamers nexus video, there are multiple steps to making sure youâ€™re applying the right amount of force and applying it correctly.",did you install it with the mount for your water cooler or aio screwed in to hold the backplate stable while you installed the contact frame?,that was a huge help for me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there is actually a video on youtube from linustechtips (ltt) that explains about why leaving your sticker on the bottom of your cpu cooler impacts the performance massively compared to the proper use of removing the packaging sticker.,donâ€™t worry if your cpu thermal throttles this is another way your computer cools down as throttling usually means that motherboard chipsets or the cpu reduces power output thus reducing the clock speed until the chipsets or cpu is able to run at a more suitable temperature whenever that thermal throttling stops that is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i just edited to add i wouldn't consider the 12700k at all.,the 13600k is a better deal entirely.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
trying to future proof isnâ€™t always a good idea.,it makes the current system more expensive for needs you might not ever have.,a 12900k is great for highly parallel workloads but it is a very hot cpu.,"so if you future proof with it, it makes your cpu and case cooling requirements higher and more expensive.",any of the cpus on your list would be great for normal uses.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

video editing.,fusion work.,in the meantime i watched some benchmarks.,also longer ones.,there's no overheating.,not even mentioned once.,and like i said: a 3060 or 3070 has been tested with that system.,i just need some advice which would work better in my case.,"if someone could provide hands on experience, that would be cool!",btw 1440p is native resolution.,found someone that runs a i9 9900 with 4080 fe for editing and gaming.,no overheating whatsoever.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7700 holds up pretty alright.,turn down a few cpu intensive settings in todays games and youâ€™re good.,i had the non k version before i upgraded.,"and although some games did stutter like battlefield 2042, turning the settings down got rid of them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
youâ€™ve misheard me - overheating isnâ€™t the issue.,"itâ€™s that an old cpu with a new gpu frequently results in heavy cpu bottlenecks (where the gpu is capable of *drawing* more frames than the cpu can *calculate*), heavily limiting performance.","in addition, nvidiaâ€™s gpu drivers are too bloated (â€œoverheadâ€) for modern games, and it makes this problem worse: https://youtu.be/jleijhunaw8

(for your case, iâ€™d be interested in the i3-10100 data - itâ€™s basically an i7-7700k in most respects.","notably, the rtx 3070 is supposed to be 35% faster than the rx 5700 xt, but in most cases comes out the same or even slower with this cpu.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh, forgive me!","yes, i've misread that!",i appreciate the info!,will do some research about that!,a platform upgrade is not possible atm.,"i'd need to make do with what i have + a few upgrades on ram, gpu and ssd.","if i'd go with a platform upgrade, then there's no video editing, because i couldn't afford video equipment --> gettting a new camera with 4k 10 bit 4:2:2 that eats most of my spare money.",i would be ok with some bottlenecking.,"if i cannot run a 3070 ti at it's full potential, it's still an upgrade from a 1070 ti as i understand it.","i can edit 4k material, which is not possible with my current setup.",how much worse would the decrease in performance be?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"at 1440p itâ€™s manageable, but using an rtx 3070 you can still expect to lose ~3-15% gaming performance with a 7700k/10100 compared to a ryzen 5 5600x, depending on the game and settings.","there isnâ€™t much test data out there for specific configs, sadly.",hereâ€™s a funny idea - playing at 4k is probably comparatively the best option.,"you should still get ~50-60 fps at ultra settings in modern games with a 3070, and itâ€™ll shrink the impact of the cpu bottleneck, as well as allowing you to see the content youâ€™re editing at its native resolution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3-15% would be ok for me.,"here's a complete overview what i run (for the sake of completion:

*msi z270 gaming m3*  
*intel i7 7700k (no oc)*  
*msi geforce 1070ti (1440p monitor)*  
*2x8gb ddr4 ram 3000 corsair vengeance dimm lpx cl15 288pin (no oc --> 2133mhz)*  
*ssd + hdd*  
*win 10 home*

my 1070ti is quite slow when it comes to it's decoding capabilities.","i have worked a lot with 4k30/60 cellphone footage, and because of its h.264 codec, this is not editable (without proxies, etc..).",and proxies i'd need to render.,and also convert the resolution.,with the new camera --> in h.265 this might get worse.,might take longer to transcode.there's my motivation for a stronger gpu.and the ram will help with effects --> 32gb is a minimum recommendation.,for that --> davinci resolve is a gpu heavy programm.,a 3060 with 12gb vram works great in higher resolutions.,"but i have no idea if the 3070ti could compensate with it's speed...that's where i'm at...

i have an aoc something... monitor with a native 2k 1440p resolution.","in some games i've seen the uhd resolution.when i'd choose that, will the game be calculated in 4k, but only shown in my native reso?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s correct.,"upsampling beyond native is never worth it, imo - you just donâ€™t get enough of a benefit to image quality to justify the massive loss of frames.","also, enable xmp, my guy.",itâ€™s an overclock in name only - any ram that comes out of the factory rated for a certain speed is *designed* to run at it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i hesitated to run my ram with xmp, since i read somewhere the lifespan gets diminished...might be mumbojumbo...

my mobo should support up to 3600 (oc) like stated on msi's hp.",would you say i could run two 32gb dimms in my system?,it is a dual channel board.,"and the comment from that other guy, could make sense --> the qvl doesn't state that support because 32gb bars weren't a thing back then.","still the comments on the compatibility of kabylake and 32gb bars goes into both directions...  
some say it's impossible.",others state it should work without any problems.,and a third party says it's a hit and miss...and when i inquire about more infos i only get silence.,what's your opinion?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i donâ€™t see any reason why it shouldnâ€™t, but iâ€™m not sure.",the comments about diminished lifespan are just wrong - that only happens with *unsafe* overclocks.,xmp is essentially just stock operation - all ram modules are extensively tested for it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
reasons could be that the memory controllers were only designed for 16gb each.,"or that the newer 32gb bars have some protocol communication issues...chipset differences...

....yeah, i don't know either ;)!",but thanks for the input!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"good stuff, what would be the nvidia equivalent of this card?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"don't compare intel gpus with 3d mark, intel has cheating optimizations in their driver to boost 3d mark score.",that's why 3d mark scores on arc gpu often show up as invalid.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this card really performs under any workload.,i love my a770.,just wish intel made it slightly faster but for the price it cant be beat.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would like to buy 750 too but the power consumption is way too high imo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"im considering an intel a380 because, slot power",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so, arc a750 is low end and 770 is mid-range?",are they planning on something high-end?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks a lot!,"synthetic tests are looking really good, just want to move some games from the hard drive to make some real game tests to see if it can hold up with the gains",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there are still some bugs i encountered by now, but nothing that couldnt be fixed by restarting my computer by now.","itâ€˜s not perfect but now its comparable to amd, at least in my time with the 5600xt.",nvidia still holds a special place in my heart because they where just out of the box usable and never made me problems.,but only speaking for myself!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for now i just tested forza horizon 5. full hd with everything bumped to extreme with ray-tracing without fsr or anything , it still holds 60fps.","same settings on 4k it barely holds 30fps average, but i really cant complain for 277â‚¬.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same here it was a good card but its time to retire the old boy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in games of the 1070's own era, yeah 40%

in modern titles the arc will pull much more ahead (as would an rdna2 or ampere in the same class)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
true these are synthetic tests.,"at least in forza horizon 5 the difference is day and night, the 1070 has to eat a lot of dust in comparsion to the a750.","witcher & cyberpunk are downloading right now, kingdome come will follow also as fallout 76. i recently had an accident at work so theres plenty of time to test the hell out of this new competitor",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i considered the 770 but saw the performance uplift wasnt that high.,but i think it should be fine if you want to go 4k all the way.,"also, i think the 3090 still beatâ€˜s the a770 with ease so i wouldnt consider changing your gpu.","but the arc looks and feels reeeeeaaaally solid, no gpu that i had in my hands feels so nice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
weâ€˜re driving the same boat ðÿ˜ had the exact same feeling and thats why i went intel (also because of asthetics and the flex to say i have an all intel build.,"never had a cool pc to brag with it) and by now, i can say that im more than happy with the performance for this money.","only thing that bothers me is the watt-usage while idling, itâ€˜s pretty high compared to the competition and that makes the card a little too hungry.","but thats really nothing that makes me re-think my choice, just a small slap in the face from intel for being a beta-tester",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for this price you can get an 6600 xt from amd whic beats a750 in overall performance.,arc isn't some magical price/performance wizard ....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks a lot!,it also feels like it looks.,"for me, not one single gpu felt that good built wise, not one single other card regardless of the price.","it has a lot more weight than my 1070, but doesnt sag at all.","with that said, all they have to do now is getting more power and better drivers out, then i can safely say that there will be no other option to me.",at least they know how to build a properly product,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nah, didnt missed it.","but also i read recently that they had an big update, so i gave it a shot.","i didnt had any major problem meanwhile, from emulated ps1 games to cyberpunk everything worked fine.","except after frying the card with 6000 benchmarks, it would not start any game till i restarted the pc.","error code showed â€žno gpuâ€œ ðÿ¤· 
also, as far as i see : the arc surely gives the 3060 itâ€˜s run for money now.",there are games where arc outperforms nvidia and vice versa.,forza horizon 5 is running totally fine and more comparable to the 3060ti while borderlands 3 is still nvidia/amd turf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends.,"most of the time, itâ€˜s 3060/3060ti turf.","but there are some games i found out that ran ok, and some where even a 3070 would have to keep up.","but i would say, in my case, overclocked 3060 most of the time",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>that's why 3d mark scores on arc gpu often show up as invalid.,that just means it's an unverified driver.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
really?,i havenâ€™t experienced an â€˜invalidâ€™ score.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just wrote a comment stating that i want to see if it can hold up the promise from the synthetic tests ^^ need to move some demanding games from the hard drive to the ssd to see whats up.,"i think its a good  baselinetest and to see if it can handle stress, but we will see if it can hold up its promies as soon as my games are moved to the other drive.",time will show,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks a lot, im enjoying the hell out of it.","cyberpunk with raytracing maxed out with average of around 30fps with some dips into the 15â€˜s is more than enjoyable, since i never played this game anywhere over medium or high on 1080p.","and all this for 277â‚¬, no questions asked",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i dont bother too much about the consumption, since its not that high compared to other cards in its class",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes for an ultra clean build, that card should fit its purpose ðÿ‘œðÿ¼ there is something sexy about pci-powered gpus",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
possibly.,"at least they feel premium, no green or red card i ever had in my hand feels this well put together",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah the a750 sits in a really good value spot intel should price the a770 down to make it more juicy too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"but nvidia now is overpriced af, i got my 6750xt (runs better in litterally every game i play compared to my friend, who has same cpu, amount of ram but a 3070, i bought the 6750xt for 450â‚¬, 3070s were arround 750-850â‚¬",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™m stuck with my 4k tv because my fhd 144hz monitor just broke, i don't play very demanding titles so i think i'll do this upgrade too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah pascal is really weak at low level api performance and the opposite for arc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thank you for clarification threeleggedchimp, theres no one that could have an more logical answer to this statement than you â¤ï¸",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was upgrading from a 980gtx and 2700x to the arc 770 and 5800x.,i was shocked to find out my 750w psu couldn't push it.,"had to go to an 850. is this normal, or was my 10 yr old 750w on it's last legs?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its almost 10 times higher in idle compared to the amd 6600,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i meant performance-wise,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thats def.,true for gaming and most of us dont do any other stuff than that.,"i understand that nvidia comes with a higher price tag, since they got features that amd snd intel doesnt have.","also (at least in my case) i never ran into problems with nvidia, out of the box into the tower and thats it.","i bought the 1070 over a year ago after i sold my other computer to someone and the last driver update was in july, gamed till yesterday without one single error.","amd wasnt that bad like people want to suggest in terms of driver issues, itâ€˜s comparable to the problems i ran into with arc.","small quality of life issues, thats all i got.","or in other words : you dont need to drive a mercedes, a mitsubishi will do its job just fine.",but you can safely say that you feel the difference in the way the car is built and drives.,"in the end, both will get you from a to b",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i only have a 4k-tv with 60hz.,i think for this purpose and for this money its absolutely well placed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's not normal at all, you should be able run that combo with a high quality 550w, let alone 750w.",the arc is power hungry but not extraordinarily so in games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh, yes!",the idle power and fan curve is definatly something that bugs me a little bit.,"but considering the gpuâ€˜s build quality and closed-style, it cant run 0rpm silence mode.","also, i never let my car run on idle either :) but itâ€˜s def.","something they need to work out next time, i give it a pass for now.",theyâ€˜ve just learned walking,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"theyâ€˜re both mid-tier in my opinion, at least the arc750 can compete with 3060/rx6600 without any troubles.","even exceeding the performance in some games, but also underwhelms in other games",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes but i didnt have any problem with drivers i mean it just always worked fine, rdna2 is not like polaris, and im sorry but i dont feel like paying almost 1000â‚¬ for a gpu with only 8gb of vram.... if 3070s were 16gb i would have thought about having one or waiting for a discount or something, but tjen there is the 6900xt for 799â‚¬ (same as 3070) and is way way better",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
let me rephrase that.,it would not power on.,"pushing a x570 mb, two m2 ssds, 2 older ssds and 2 hdds.",i made an assumption that i didn't have enough powa.,thus the 850 psu purchase.,seems like ole corsair 750 may have been near the end perhaps?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i didnt have major problems either with the 5600/6600xt that i recomended.,"only one time we had to ddu the driver trough safe mode, and thats nothing to cry about, most of the time a reboot helped fix everything that occured before.","they are fine for their price ðÿ‘œðÿ¼ and yes i totally agree nvidia really needs to step up their game, they charge way to much for graphic cards with that kind of performance",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if it wouldn't power on, i'd say that was the end",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah your psu was dead or you plugged something in wrong and didn't realize it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah and 4070ti for 1000â‚¬ msrp is a shame, the downgrade in corecount and vram of the 4060 vs 3060 (3072 vs 3840 and 8/128 vs 12/192) is a shame, the price is going to be 499 vs 329 of the 3060, and it will perform arround 3% betterðÿ’€",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, not so much.","the 2700x was on an old b450 mb, and the 980gtx was all installed in my nephew's rig.. they worked fine.. weird.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe the 750 was a bit weak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is your pc mainly for gaming?,"if so, what resolution and fps can your monitor handle?","if you end up getting a new system and really want to squeeze out as much performance as possible, i think you should get at least ddr5-6000 kit.","but then again, your gpu will most likely be limiting factor then.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not worth the upgrade tbh.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"only 1080p 144hz haha, so maybe iâ€™ll stick with what iâ€™ve gotâ€¦",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you a really bad upgrade itch:

if you want to do a cheap upgrade, look for a faster 11th gen cpu.",they should be dirt cheap by now.,unfortunately you may have to upgrade your cooling as well.,check youtube and some reviews if this helps at all in the games you play.,a bit more expensive option would be to buy used lga 1700 ddr4 board and used i5-12400f (or new i5-13500).,either of these should speed up things quite nicely.,but of course this is more money.,you could also try to overclock your ram (might run at 3600 with few tweaks).,youtube has tons of cpu and ram speed comparison videos.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

so what cinebench score is an i7 13700k supposed to get as a baseline anyway without any oc?,and i thought the 13700k base/default boost clock is 5400. i don't understand why my cpu is not hitting it in cinebench.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you have any other apps or tasks running?,if you want peak scores you have to isolate r23 and ensure nothing is taking context away.,"you can also try running it on high priority mode....

 control+shift+esc>details>right click cinebench>set priority>high.",also watch how much power your cpu draws.,is it getting to 240watts?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
stock i7 13700k and kf should be 30000 +/- 500 around this range.,check clock speed when running cinebench.,sometime when you leave the windows to put it in sleeping mode.,"it cause cpu to run lower speed and ""locked out"" at lower speed.",i don't know how to fix it unless restart the windows.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nah, nothing else running besides my monitoring software like hwinfo64

cpu package power peaked at 236w but continuous it's more like 220w

ia core power was like 210w continuous

"yeah
 
try high priority r23, otherwise gotta dig into why you're not hitting your power limits exactly.",maybe thermal throttle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

cool.,i will totally buy it as soon as i can hook up my ac unit that's blowing directly in my radiator to my power plant that has to push this plus a 4090.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pah.,my i9-13900k was pulling those numbers months ago.,(it isn't any more cos i told it not to),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"considering we all know a 13900k can easily pull that and more, i really want to see a real apples-to-apples comparison to see how well binned the silicon really is.","like, if i donâ€™t want a 320 watt profileâ€¦ how well does it do at 250 watts or 200 watts?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

while the ks are usually better binned the extreme profile makes it seem like its just a regular chip with a higher limit lmao,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
guess i'll rebadge my 13900k as a 13900kss since it pulls 340w at stock,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it draws more than a whole board of rtx 4080.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hey intel!,how about a processor that goes faster but uses less power?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tetris must be mind blowing at pl2 ðÿ‘œ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's a lot of juice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so they increase max power draw to 320 watts, and that makes the average frame rate jump up massively from 227 fps to 231 fps?",this is just sad.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"what the hell intel releasing these for, even the kf thermal throttles out of the box in bench tests.",in the other hand because of my 13900k i ran into some info about diamond powder that might interest us.,apparently you can purchase powdered diamond in 60k-100k grits (higher the smaller the better) mix it into thermal paste and get very good results because diamonds are the most thermally conductive material in the world.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"don't understand why intel even bothers with this monstrosity just because of ""gamers"".",imo it's actually making really really bad pr for the company.,"it's like if intel was yelling: ""look people!",we made a cpu which with 3x the power draw and higher price almost comes near the performance of cheaper competitor cpu ryzen 7800x3d!!!,"so awesome pls buyyy!!!!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

they're aimed at people that want the most power that they can get out of a chip.,"for instance i game, so i want the best performance i can get out of a chip in that respect, but i also render so i want something that will also give me superior performance.","at the end of the day i want a chip that will last me 4-5 years, and the 13k series are it.",my last intel chip i had for about 6-7 years and it was a rock solid performer that never skipped a beat.,"i am done with amd after having used a 5800x chip, it's ok, but with the constant driver issues i have experienced, no thanks never going back.","also there is no head room on those chips, where as the k series is pretty awesome and the overclocks i can get out of the box are pretty amazing.","i admit i hate the e core design, but it works, unfortunately only on windows at the moment, which is sad.",i am waiting to see what happens with the new hedt chips from intel.,"amd is for budget minded mid tier gamers, or content creators on a budget.",that's it.,"i find for me you can't have all with amd, you can't be an enthusiast, a gamer, and a content creator all out of one package of cpu.",intel is the way to go if you want to cover all your bases in a high end package.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then amd is probably stupid that they don't have such product.,"i believe they could make some 7950extreme with 350w, 6ghz, price it at $1000 and done",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

in addition, most 3070 ti cards will run at 310w power limit.",that leaves 350w for the rest of your system.,"you probably also have some memory, fans, ssds, and other stuff drawing power in your system.","30w seems a likely estimate, leaving 320w.","then you have the vrm, which is also going to dissipate some heat, efficiency above 92% is highly unlikely.",that means your 13900k is likely at 295w or so.,"and you ran a power supply test, meaning it's likely a power virus like prime95 small ffts",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"then you have a misconfigured dc and ac loadline, or the worst 13900k in history",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sure if you got a golden chip and spent a week tweeking and tuning.,and amd was actually hitting 5.0 on boost on their 9590 by shoving a fuck ton of voltage and power into their chips.,didn't mean i thought any of it was actually realistic to eventually end up in normal rigs.,we were stuck at the 4.0-4.5ghz range for a really long time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a 13900k as well.,i donâ€™t really know that the high power on the architectures are intentional.,"the smaller dies can rake more power, so why would intel brick them by limiting it?","itâ€™s an implementation choice to have them run hot at stock settings, but every flagship processor of the forever has let users give it as much power/heat as the silicon can handle for diminishing returns.","as for why one would get a ks and then run it at lower powerâ€¦ well i donâ€™t know a compelling reason to get a ks at all, but it would run faster at 90w than a lower sp 13900k would at the same power.","but if efficiency was my only consideration, i probably would have got a cheaper rocket lake die.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no argument from me about that.,i think it's clear intel is selling these as premium binning for overclocking.,most 13900k can easily hit 6 ghz without much modifying of the stock vf curve.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">i am done with amd after having used a 5800x chip, it's ok, but with the constant driver issues i have experienced, no thanks never going back.","its funny, because cpus do not use drivers, they are directly managed by the so without any driver interface.",wonder how you managed to get driver issues when no driver exists for the 5800x.,"&#x200b;

>that's it.","i find for me you can't have all with amd, you can't be an enthusiast, a gamer, and a content creator all out of one package of cpu.","sure, the 7950x definitely can't be used for gaming and content creation lol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7000x series already does this.,it ships with essentially no power limits and is only constrained by thermals.,"if your cooler can keep up, it will keep boosting until it hits a very high ceiling pretty much only obtainable by the biggest loops.",the 7000-non-x just launched and is essentially the same thing with power limits.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is going to be the 7950x3d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s a pleasant side effect of an undesirable limitation.,"if amd could do 5.7 ghz on the cache die ccd too, they absolutely would.",because then youâ€™d have both the cache *and* the higher clocks together.,and then tdp wouldnâ€™t be lower.,(and they might well get there with through-silicon-vias: you can put the cache die under the main die and run the connections through it with tsvs.,"since the logic die is on top, you can push clocks back up.)",itâ€™s like saying that hitting yield limitations on larger chips is a good thing because smaller chips have lower tdp.,"sure, but at the end of the day people mostly want faster chips and donâ€™t really care all that much about tdp, and itâ€™s only happening because of a side effect of a problem that everyone wishes would go away.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you've got an msi motherboard, just use cpu lite load and try levels 3-6. it's an undervolt profile and should be pretty dramatic in terms of cutting power and heat, but not performance.","if not, these cpus seem to take a 0.1v (100mv) undervolt pretty well and that has similar effect.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sorry, i don't actually *own* a 13900k.","i figured my flair thing would've shown it but yeah, i have a r5 5600 as it was quite inexpensive for me and does everything i need it to.","[edit: unless you meant to reply to someone else, then my bad.]","but i know my fair share about both intel & amd (at least i like to think i do, haha) since i've had products from both.","i'd suggest downloading intel xtu or skimming thru your bios to undervolt your cpu, and do some kind of variable oc (since it has 2 different types of cores, you will need to tweak both accordingly) to achieve better efficiency as far as thermals are concerned.",be sure to stress test everything thoroughly in order to confirm stability as well.,unless you'd prefer to enable one of the power limits (pl1 or pl2) and just be done with it.,"#1 will be better for temps since it's 125w, but #2 shouldn't be *that* bad even at ~253w (vs 300w+ when they're disabled), just make sure you have an adequate cooling solution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how did you get one of those?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would explain why intel thinks my cpu is over heating alsoðÿ¤·ðÿ¼â€â™‚ï¸,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i9 core count also means power efficient.,just underclock and you sacrifice performance for the highest efficiency (on intel platforms at least) on both single/multithreaded workloads.,the t chips aren't really that efficient in daily workloads either.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">its funny, because cpus do not use drivers,

are you on crack of course they do, generally it is packaged in the chipset driver and also provided to kernel developers as micro code, these two provide the necessary driver support required for your cpu to work within the operating system and be able to utilize the hardware and peripherals connected to your motherboard.","then you have the bios, which is technically firmware, which is hardware micro code or a driver that allows the cpu for proper operation, because at the end of the day the uefi bios is just another operating system for your hardware.",">sure, the 7950x definitely can't be used for gaming and content creation lol

any 13900k smokes the 7950x, and look at the game benches for 7950x vs 13900k, then the fact that you can take the 13900k further with an oc this makes the chip a clear winner and way better value than any amd cpu.",then you can use ddr4 or ddr5 with a 13k series cpu.,"everything avout the 13900k screams ""winning!""",also the 13900k is cheaper than a 7950x.,also nevermid the failure rates of doa 5950x chips.,"i owned a 5950x briefly, then i sent it back the chip would bsod under load.","buddy bought a 5950x, same thing, he got a doa chip.","another buddy, same thing.",i've been building and pc gaming since for over 30 years.,i've never seen so many cpu failure rates as i have with the last gen of amd 5950x chips.,"looks like no one is buying the 7k series chips from amd either, then the 7k series radeons and their hot spots are not moving off shelves either.",you can be an amd fanboi as much as you'd like but you can ignore facts only for so long.,"amd has turned into shit, which is sad because now intel and nvidia have no competition in the market, that means you'll see higher prices incoming.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yep, zen4 non-x is about the same as the x skus w/ ""eco"" mode.","which is stupid--if you bought a higher tdp chip and *need* the extra performance, why would you handicap it?","might as well get a non-x part if you're worried about thermals/efficiency/etc...though tbh, the 7900 is fairly capable even at 65w (88w under full load), as seen on gn's recent review of it.","and if you require extra performance, pbo is damn near a one-click solution to disable the arbitrary power limit imposed on those non-x cpus to allow them to pull however much power is needed to clock higher (so long as thermals aren't an issue either).","they seem to be a better way to get the best of both worlds, either run stock for efficiency's sake or use pbo to get more ""oomf"" when needed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah and that one makes intel's 13900ks look like a scam.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm not quite as lucky with my 13700k.,anything higher than 80 mv negative offset is not 100% stable at stock clock speed.,games run fine with a 150 mv negative offset tho.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"theoretically the 13900ks is more likely to undervolt better, at any power level, than a regular k. and so yes, it probably hits higher clocks at 90w than the k.

the chips all self-report their vf curves to the motherboard.","ks are higher quality silicon, higher sp values, lower voltages across the vf curve.","so even at stock, without undervolting, good odds of the ks benching higher.",not a good way to overspend on silicon though.,"people buy a ks to put a custom loop on it, or play with ln2, and beat records.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the 7950x3d is completely different from the p/e core approach from intel.,managing chips with cores with different levels of performance is easy.,"but zen4 3d is a completely different approach, the cores in both ccx are the same, but in one ccx they have higher frequency and in the other more cache.",determining if a task requires more cache or more frequency before running it is almost impossible and then you need to group tasks so you minimise inter ccx communication on top of that.,amd/microsoft didn't even manage to achieve the second step in the last 5 years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you again!,not too worried about paying for unused silicon in this specific case.,"i think iâ€™ve settled on the 13900ks giving highest clock speed out of the gate, and therefor still be highest performing option with power scaling, regardless of any futzing with disabling /locking cores.","(any tweaking here would yield more power savings, not necessarily more performance).","but odds high iâ€™ve got this all wrong ðÿ¤ª

at least -50mv on core voltage offset will be safe and you improve your temps a little!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you have e cores on or off.,and what clock speed are p cores at under full load.,"i have e cores all disabled and p cores at 5.6ghz with 1.35v llc 6.

with my nh-d15, temps under full load cinebench r23 average 89 to 91c.",it runs hot though within spec.,i would have thought even at 5.6ghz with e cores off would have provided enough thermal headroom to have better temps.,if your e cores are on and p cores clocked nearly as high as mine my cooling setup or mount must be crappy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no it's not, are you running windows 11 or windows 10?",e-cores need windows 11 to run properly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

forspoken is really really bad optimized so i think it is a game issue rather that cpu or cooling issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

good.,i turn off too.,13900k in my gigabite z690 gaming x had turn on by default.,and bclk was set at 103.5 (clock go to 6 ghz insted 5.8 ghz) i change to normal 100.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hey i have a z790 hero with a 13900k.,how do i undervolt it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
definitely high for stock voltage i managed to get it under 1.4 for intel extreme utility with an undervolt of -0.100v definitely helped with temps,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i havenâ€™t checked i can take a look!,also did you use a contact frame on your build ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
everything is stock currently with e cores on.,it runs 5.5 or 5.8ghz.,i hadn't attempted to tweak just yet as the load temps were too high for my preference with such a beefy air cooler.,i haven't gone over 89c yet at 100% load but i only ran it for about 5 minutes.,"the back of the pc i/o panel is already too hot for my liking and i'll probably end up see how close i can get to stock speeds while under volting instead of what i normally do (maxing out speed)

i also switched over to liquid metal on my last build from paste and that helps with temps a couple degrees too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this was before any undervolting.,"i'd expect you should get no higher than 30s idle, but i'm not an expert, so please check with others.","i don't have a graphics card, which might account for a large part of my lower idle.",quiet cases do tend to run a bit warmer.,i have a front mesh (meshify) case.,"if your quiet case has a front door that you can open or front filter you can remove, try that.",also check your idle temp with fans at full speeds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

how would you undervolt with a z790 hero with a 13900k?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is not stable..  trust me.. maybe some test and a few games.. but the big ones that matter will crash eventually.,cyberpunk and gta v. 100mv is too much.,you should use a wide array of test and best in imo is hours of game play in ultra detail some high end games.,cb2077 and gta v is notorious for crashing a bad oc within 30min !,;),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

$200 more for a cpu capable of 8 channel.,"then at least that, or more, for a motherboard capable of it, then 3~4x that on the memory to use it.",you are at an easy $1000 difference despite the cpu price only being $200 more.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, price is very bad  
higher than cascade lake-x per core",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most of the atx form factor motherboards probably won't support neither the super high number of pcie channels nor 8 channel memory.,both of these features require physical wires on the motherboard.,so those advantages will be lost on people who are not specifically building the system for them in the first place.,there might be advantages in the monolithic die vs the tile version.,"not sure about that, we need to wait for benchmarks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah, the pricing is moronic.","especially when you take into consideration that those 24 cores wont be really more performant than 13900k/7950x, that cost 4x less.","yeah, they offer more io and memory channels, but how that justifies said price-increase, i would not know.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this.,especially for an oem customer the difference between them in price will be large due to the memory and motherboard.,"it's tempting to think that intel only thinks about what the handful of people on reddit want, but this is really not the case.","they're thinking what dell, etc want since they're placing most of the orders.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i feel like they should have had two different chipsets.,"ie w770 with quad channel udimms and  56 pci-e lanes, and w790 with eight channel r-dimms and 112 pci-e lanes.",that would have coupled the 2400 series with cheaper boards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
exactly my thoughts.,i was always wanted to get x299 since it launched because itâ€™s cool.,but donâ€™t have chance to until they axed the price with cascade lake x. while everyone said it is bad refresh but performance wise it is holding its own till 13th gen mainstream and even now memory speed is still on par.,"with the new hedt and its cost for entry, means i have to go to mainstream for my next build.",for op of course they priced the sku as it is to incentive people to spend on more expensive one.,isnâ€™t it always like this with literally anything else too?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[they do,](https://www.asus.com/motherboards-components/motherboards/workstation/pro-ws-w790e-sage-se/) that's a silly take given older boards for threadrippers and such.",the asus w790 has 7 x pci 5.0 slots that run in 6 at 16x and 1 at 8x.,all pci 5.0 don't get silly about claiming it doesn't count because it's eatx.,"it also supports 8 channel memory, 4 channel if using a w2400 in the same board.",w790 boards can use either processor and the lane/channel limit is set by the processor.,so that's not it.,latency between the xcc cores vs the mcc mono would be different but not in a way that would matter for the workloads that these things would face.,"no gamer is going to use these over an i9 13900, and the difference in latency is lost by being able to use so many more cores for workloads that benefit from the high thread counts that can be pulled.",ie: those extra 4 cores are worth their weight in gold.,so it still stands.,what is the incentive?,or the logic.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this.,if end users were buying htpc platforms then intel's x series and amd's threadripper wouldn't have gotten axed.,sales in that area are very low.,the big money is in the workstation.,intel just realized they could throw a bone the htpc way here without any other competition.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it makes more sense for niche parts like this to allow the same boards to work with both processors.,that way oems can still offer a budget option without having to design two motherboards.,otherwise they might only offer one line of processors and note both.,"for home users, in practice most boards are probably going to be designed for one (e.g.",4 channels) or the other (8 channels and doesn't fit in atx).,i wouldn't be surprised if some only support one set of processors even if the chipset could do both.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, you found the absolute most expensive option available which does indeed support the full features of 3400 series.",however that seems to be the only board so far that does.,asus's other w790 board has quad channel memory and 64 pcie lanes.,asrock board also has quad channel memory and 64 pcie lanes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm just proposing that the chiplet branding be changed to easily identify the boards designed for the quad channel boards,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[removed],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are just arguing my point.,you have listed one more extremely expensive large motherboard that doesnâ€™t fit normal cases and another normal size board that has limited pcie.,people would have to really plan their build around that motherboard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"get some professional help, seriously",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that does seem off.,i got 30500 at an 87 degree max with the liquid freezer 2 360 aio.,only about 225 watt peak.,i suppose it could be something with the motherboards settings?,it doesnâ€™t seem like a cooling issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it does not make sense.,save your money.,upgrade 4/5 years later.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's not really a worthwhile upgrade.,"if you have money to burn and want to buy pc parts, look at storage upgrades, cooling upgrades, a custom mechanical keyboard even.",just don't waste it going up only one generation.,it's not going to even give you results you can see.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you arenâ€™t cpu limited at 4k.,i run a 10900k with a 4090 at 4k and do just fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why are you even considering an upgrade?,not getting enough performance from your current parts?,or do you just want to upgrade for the sake of upgrading?,"if you actually need more performance at 4k, sell your 4080 and pick up a 4090.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel needs money, i say throw them a bone and upgrade.",your purchase today is helping bring future intel 3 chips for the rest of us!,if you donâ€™t want to give intel free money at least wait for the rumored 13 gen refresh coming later this year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"controversial opinion, i think itâ€™s worth upgrading.",the upgrade would be under $400 and youâ€™d essentially get a big uplift in every aspect.,youâ€™d be getting within 2-3% of the top gaming performance thatâ€™s currently available as well as major improvements in other daily tasks.,"if it involved updating the motherboard, iâ€™d say itâ€™s not worth the effort involved but since this is just a drop in upgrade i think itâ€™s worthwhile.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

makes zero sense.,"it's like you packing up your apartment, the time and effort, the money to move across town to save yourself $10 a month in rent.","besides, games are not cpu limited these days.",all you really need to do is focus on a gpu upgrade or monitor upgrade and if you don't need those items then you don't need to do anything.,i'm on a 12600k @ 5.1ghz with 32gb of 4400mhz ram and an rtx 3080 ti .. .there is literally nothing on the market that makes any sense whatsoever to buy.,maybe in 2024 i might find an upgrade that makes sense.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah, it'll be an active converter but if you've got a hdmi 2.0 capable adapter that works!",just wanted to point out that if you're doing an adapter (dp or usb-c to hdmi) a lot of those are only hdmi 1.4 speeds so that could limit you.,(as can the actual physical implementation of a true hdmi port.,the igpu can support hdmi 2.0 but if the port itself is only hdmi 1.4 then that's what you get.,some discrete gpus are like that - i've seen it on some cheaper aliexpress-tier cards before.),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
