touch the radiator after a while and see if it's warm.,also check if it's coming hot air from the ventilation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i had a similar issue with my i7 13700k.,it would instantly hit 100â°c when i started a cinebench run even tho i have arctic liquid freezer ii.,the issue for me was the cover on the base of the pump block was getting blocked by a piece of the motherboard so the cpu didn't get full contact with the aio.,i removed the cover of aio at the base and run cinebench again at peaked at 90â°c max.,take a look at this link and see if your motherboard is effected.,https://support.arctic.de/lf2-lga1700,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what is your vcore while running cinebench?,"1.4v is much, but that might just be a value when the cpu was idle.",in any case i would guess that you are pushing too much voltage to the cpu and that's just not coolable with normal means.,but in order to fix that you need to start your overclocks from the start and find out stable values that can keep you under the therman limits.,i personally have 1.3v during cinebench.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i donâ€™t think this will solve your problems.,you mention in your other comments you canâ€™t feel anything through the tubes and no vibration on the pump so iâ€™m leading towards a broken pump in the aio.,you sound like you know what youâ€™re doing so i assume you took the sticker off the cooler lol?,if you did then it sounds like your cooler is defected.,notice how your min temps at 26.5watts are 47c.,thatâ€™s not normal.,so leads me to believe there isnâ€™t any heat transfer taking place from cpu to radiator.,itâ€™s just boiling water in the aio.,try get a replacement aio and iâ€™m sure that will resolve the issue.,"also, just to confirm, when you have been remounting the cpu block, did it look like the mount was good?",as in the paste has been squished out to the edges across the whole cpu?,should look something like [this](https://www.ekwb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/08-1030x344.jpg),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12th & 13th gen is physically identical in terms of ilm.,just make sure you keep the ilm back plate on or you'll find yourself screwing into nothing and wondering why it won't work.,"here's some stujff you can do that should bring down the temps (if it's not a broken mount)

*cpu lite load down to 8 (should be 9 stock)

*long duration power limit 220w

*long duration maintained - 64s is fine, i would set to whatever the closest number to 100 you can put in

*short duration power limit 280w
 
*cpu core votage mode - offset mode

*cpu core voltage offset mode negative (-)

by the fact you're hitting 100c in 5 seconds.,and also no vibrations from the pump is a give away.,make sure it's plugged in properly or try a new fan or pump header,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think arctic recommends using the cpu fan header and they have a guide for different mobo manufacturers for setting up the fan curve.,"https://support.arctic.de/en/pwm-settings

you could give it a shot before going through the trouble of sending it back",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

your stuff is overclocked hard thats why temps so high ... check my stuff [here](https://imgur.com/4gz7ths),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
idle temps are high likely due to overclocking + windows being run in high performance mode locking cpu at max frequency all the time which causes the voltage to remain high as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

wow... i guess intel xtu is really pushing!,i also suspect it may be my motherboard pushing more voltage.... i heard that it can cause high temps so i'll look into it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"also, i just took a good look at your screenshots, if the readings are right, your cpu is severely overclocked, revert any ""optimization"" from xtu.",you are feeding the cpu with 1.4- 1.5v which is not healthy.,"at stock clock speed, you should consider undervolting to around 1.1xv.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

>why would the bios use more voltage than during a stress test?,because of vdroop,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
completely normal vcore.... the only time i would worry is if it was over 1.35,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"set it manual to 1,17 will be more than enough for default clocks, llc on 4 or 5",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to add to this answer vdroop needs to be designed in as sudden changes in load can cause voltage spikes or dips.,with vdroop when set correctly the voltage does not drop significantly lower than what is stable under heavy load changes.,nor does it suddenly go overly high with sudden drop in load.,you want the voltage not to drop below steady state voltage when sudden load is added.,without vdroop the voltage can spike downward below what is stable for cpu.,vdroop is controlled by loadline setting in bios on motherboards that support user voltage settings.,on asus motherboards a setting of 4 is recommended for overclocking but can range from 2-4 depending on other settings.,i have mine set to 2 & i am mildly overclocking.,it is stable there however.,if i wanted to overclock some more i would raise it to 3. i would not go over 4 on loadline settings as power usage becomes excessive & changing other settings to bring it back down will cause stability problems even if you manage to get same voltage under steady state load as voltage will temporarily drop below what is stable.,this can happen especially if you move the mouse when under heavy load.,it doesn't take long to freeze or crash a computer under these conditions.,on asus motherboards lower loadline settings result in greater vdroop.,"lower loadline settings will result in greater difference between idle & full load voltages, this is desirable within reason which is why i don't recommend settings outside of those in the 2-4 range.",ideally you want voltage to drop to steady state load voltage under load without going under steady state voltage & when load is removed it goes up to steady state idle voltage without going over.,loadline settings in this range can accomplish that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

e cores are lower clocked and take the entire average down,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
use hwinfo for example.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"task manager takes an average from all your cores, including e-cores.","e-cores run at a much lower speed, so they bring down the reported speed in task manager.","if you want to see what your cpu is actually running at, grab a tool like hwinfo64 and look at your p-core frequencies alone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what benchmark/programm are u using?,maby avx is the reason?,if a programm is using avx the boost is lower.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
use hwinfo64 to check; task manager is notoriously inaccurate and may simply be averaging your -p and -e core frequencies under a full load like this.,"if your cooling is adequate and you're not being power limited, you may see a more reasonable \~4.5ghz for the -p cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dont trust task manager.,hwinfo will do better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yo howd you get the windows 11 task manager?,"it doesnt seem to update for me...

oh and use hwinfo (idk the proper capitalization), bcuz its more accurate and sometimes task manager just adds up the loads of other frequency to show a >90% load...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"actual all p core turbo boost for the 12700f is actually 4.5 ghz according to some googling, so it's going down to 4.27 ghz either due to:-

1. power limit throttling - it's respecting the pl1/pl2 short and long term power limits.",2. thermal throttling - the cpu is not being cooled well enough.,"either way, task manager is a poor way to see hybrid architecture core clocks, it will show the average of p+e core clocks.",gotta use hwinfo for a more accurate picture.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this.,"also, your cpu will boost when you need it.",most likely you won't notice it when at idle just checking task manager.,my cpu is overclocked to 5.1ghz but usually reads high 4.9s or 5 in task manager.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was just installing a game,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"screenshot shows 100% utilization,  so op should be running at full speed.",it's the e-cores dragging down average speed most likely.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
check the boost speed with p95 (prime95) or cinebench.,"if the boost speed is normal in these tests, then it was due to avx, for example, although i can only think of a handful of games that use avx!",^^,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ahhh you are correct.,i didn't notice.,"question for ya then, how come my cpu runs up to 5.1ghz when the e cores are only set to 3.9ghz and p cores are the only ones set to 5.1?",wouldn't my e cores drag my system down too?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hehe worse on some level!,"it looks totally fine... but trying out a new power supply, processor, ram, and even a new video card on the board wasn't working.",could get no post screen at all.,"and when i put a new video card in the old board, it acted like it wasn't even plugged in (beep error codes).",tried everything 5 times.,"i finally bought and tried a new board, and it shot to life, but my original video card was throwing scrambling purple and green lines down the screen like an old dirty nintendo (even in post/bios screens).",new temp card worked flawlessly.,"i tried cleaning its contacts properly in case it was somehow dirty and such, but no dice.","the reason i say ""almost worst"" is because of how frustrating it was to trouble shoot everything else but the main board, the waiting and wondering aspect.",if it had just broke/fell at least i could have taken care of everything much faster.,i now know to take my shit apart and wrap it up individually if i am going to ship something like that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my pc was damaged in shipping from a cross country move.,my main board and the gpu both.,"so here i am... i spent $200 something already on the board, and don't want to waste more than half the cost of a decent gpu that can carry me into the future with a crappy card.",my computer is an essential item to have running at least semi decently (even if gaming technically isn't).,"i just wasn't expecting to have to replace a mb and a gpu randomly but they needed it or else, no computer...

revision 3 does still have issues.,and there are several.,"the disconnect issue (â€œa network cable is unpluggedâ€) can be related to driver power management, a poor quality cable, or the intel adapter simply not liking to communicate with whatever is at the other end of the line - and apparently there are a lot of devices it doesnâ€™t like communicating with.","a lot of people have success by changing what it communicates with, by inserting a different switch into the middle of the line.","iâ€™m using an i225-v r3 in a z690 board and it has no problem communicating with my hp gigabit switch, and used to have an issue where it would stop working during a reboot or after being in bios (â€œcannot start code 10â€) but that hasnâ€™t happened for some months now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yes this is socket 775, it was mainly known for core 2 duo and core 2 quad, but it does support some low end celerons and pentiums as well, it can also handle xeon from socket 771 but requires bios and socket modding (not that hard to do actually).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes because i know little to nothing about pcs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
where's the pcix/pci-x?,i see only pci-express x1 :p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you knowâ€¦ the sata standard was originally created in 2000?,and pci express in 2003?,"some motherboards still come with rs232 ports from 1960, and ps/2 from 1987. never mind usb that dates to 1996. old stuff!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i know the hero/ strix e and f / extreme z690 board will support it.,all you have to do is use the bios flash back tool which doesn't require a cpu to be installed to update the bios.,the msi unity mini itx z690 also has this feature but it booted up with the 13900k and posted without an update.,it wouldn't go to windows though until it was updated .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

most if not all of z690 should support 13th gen. you can look at the manufacturers website for a specific motherboard model that youâ€™re interested in to see if the latest bios update supports raptor lake.,"i have a z690 formula and ran it with 12th gen, then asus released a couple of bios updates that brought raptor lake support and the latest bios 2103 supports raptor lake very well.",my 13900k boosts to 6 ghz on 2 cores no problem at all raptor lake is a monster.,"the only thing i would caution is if you choose to go with z690 and raptor lake, you may need to do a bios flashback to first upgrade the bios to support raptor lake before you can post.",so make sure whatever board you buy has flashback support.,otherwise you will need to insert an alder lake cpu first to update the bios.,"the second thing to keep in mind is if you go with asus z690 (and perhaps other boards from other manufacturers but i canâ€™t comment on them) in addition to updating the bios, you will need to update the management engine to support raptor lake.",it is extremely important to do this.,otherwise your cpu may not run at full speed and you may not be able to use the m.2 slot closest to the cpu.,"unfortunately, you need to load the management engine updater from within windows as you cant do it via flashback.","so you may need to install your m.2 in one of the pch slots first, run the management engine updater and let it update the firmware etc and then you can put your m.2 in the slot closest to the cpu.",and you should be good to go.,but other than that raptor lake is pin compatible with alder lake.,lga 1700 goodness.,good luck to you !,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you go into the website for the manufacturer you should see supported cpus along with the bios version needed for the 13th gen lineup for example.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i bought the exact same board except ddr4 version.,i flashed the bios with the included usb and put a 13700k in and it's been working perfectly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

idle temps are around 29-31c on cores and 32-34c on the package.",gaming temps are between 50-65c so far.,tho i want to test hitman 3 since that's a really cpu heavy game to see what happens.,i dont run my fans at a 100% when gaming though.,i run a step curve with my fans to avoid constant ramp ups and slow downs.,so until 50c the cooler is at 40% pwm (the pwm for the pump to be at 100% rpm).,"at 50-70c i'm at 60% pwm, and from 70c forward i'm at 100% pwm.",my radiator is front mounted as my case (fractal pop air) doesn't support 280 rads on the top.,i'm curious to test more extreme undervolts though i don't know if ill get much benefit beyond a few degrees less at this point.,the chip seems to be running very well with the settings i'm using.,"edit (my specs):

yeah in terms of artificially stressing it using cinebench it does get to 90 then thermal throttle in pretty much an instant.,"in terms of just normally using it for gaming, editing, etc.",i do notice that the highs do spike up here is an image of all my temps as it stands currently with pc running for only a few hours [https://i.imgur.com/rfcusaa.png](https://i.imgur.com/rfcusaa.png) as you can see the cpu core temp has hit a maximum of 76c even though all i've been doing was listening to spotify and watching videos on my browser.,if i go in a game for a few hours it will hit a maximum of 77-85c however if i look over whilst gaming the temps are flickering all around 65c nowhere near what the maximum temps indicated.,"&#x200b;

tl;dr: yes, the temperature ramps up instantly on a sudden load i have noticed and makes the maximum temps on monitoring programs seems kind of worrisome but looking over at the ""current"" shows it's to be within normal, gaming hits a max of 77-85c for a second but averages at 65c.","&#x200b;

"the reason i bought a new cooler when i bought my cpu was because i believe the 212 can't handle the power output of the 13700k (from the posts i read about it), power = heat but the ak620 is rated to handle that tdp output and from the temps i am getting i'd say it's working!","make sure you install the right bracket for it, the lga1700 bracket and use the right ""setting"" it has like these numbers on it 1/2/3 for levels so make sure to read the manual for the cooler to get it right!",and of course when screwing down the cooler twist a few times on one side and then the other a few times and repeat until its fully tighten down.,i had some bad temps the first time around until i repaste and rescrewed it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"when undervolting make sure the number is in the negative (the ""-"" symbol) so for example my stable undervolt is ""-0.080"".","however, it may differ for you so i'd start at -0.010 then work your way up (down?)","in increments of 5 or 10 so next test will be -0.020 and run cinebench (i used r20) after every change and if the program fails to start the benchmark with a pop up or crashes mid-way through that means it's not stable so go back a step and run the test, if its stable then bam you found your undervolt.","again, please make sure it has a dash before the number if it doesn't, you're adding volts and that can lead to frying the cpu.","undervolt is just taking a way the power, worse that can happen from everything i have read and seen is you might have to reset bios but i never had that issue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that will depend on the game you're playing and the settings you're playing it at and the framerate you're aiming for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes to some games such as spiderman, battlefield 2042, far cry 6 etc.",source: my own experience !,[gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its fine.,dont worry about it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you afford a 3080 you can afford a decent processor that ""goes with it"", just get one, it will be much better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes it will bottleneck.,some games no but if you're trying to play big modern titles then yes it will bottleneck.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whats your monitor refresh rate.,if its 240 hz than you need to change the cpu.,if its 144hz or 165hz  than i think you should be fine mostly.,the cpu will bottleneck 3080 but you will be doing 100 fps or so.,so no need to worry.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a bit, but if thered be one word i could just remove from the entire pc building community itâ€™d be the word â€˜bottleneckâ€™.",people worry so so so much about it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just get a 12400?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably will be fine unless your playing many cpu intensive games,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes but who cares?,have fun with  it and upgrade the cpu later when you get more budget; nbd.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, even a 3700x is a bottleneck for a 6750xt, i get 50-60 fps in acv when the same gpu with a 13600k gets 80-95",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
spiderman needs at least 8 strong cores?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so it wonâ€™t bottleneck?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a 12600k probably isnâ€™t too much more expensive than a 10400, but op might just be getting it for free",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i will need to replace mobo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not really, i replaced my old 10400f with a 13600kf and the performance is much better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you want a yes or no answer, the answer is yes, there will likely be a bottleneck.",***how much*** of a bottleneck it will be depends on the games and settings you play.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there will be a bottleneck.,quite a large one at that.,but whether it matters or not is up to you.,"even within the same generation, a 10900k will give you significantly more frames than a 10400.

and then ryzen 5000 series will give you a few more frames than a 10900k, meaning ryzen will outclass the 10400.

and then thereâ€™s the 3d cache stuff, 12th gen, 13th gen,  and ryzen 7000, which all perform significantly better than ryzen 5000.

in that scale, the 10400 is way behind in fps produced.","however if you think the performance is fine, then donâ€™t worry about it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, as long as you set to ultra, 2k is gpu intense.",btw don't listen to many of the people here who solve everything with go top 15900k and problem solved.,many of us don't have a  dad or mom who give a couple of houses and a porsche and a boat and sometimes so  investing on a better cpu when you have a lower income or other prioritary expenses(a mortgage to pay or kids education bills) is a secondary expense.,i could treat myself with a 30000â‚¬ build but i would not feel good knowing that i could have done more interesting things with my money.,"anyways i love gaming, but i don't need to have the newest fanciest tech, because it outdates almost instantaneously.",i need a decent build that allows me to play tww3 or mass effect decently.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
play at 1440p and its fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10400f is kind slow.,1440p resolution will limit the graphics card a bit.,around 20% i guess.,"the lower the resolution, the worse it will be.","4k should be fine, but youre unlikely to be satisfied with 20 fps",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
enjoy your 3080 till you can get a better processor/mobo processor combo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"especially with what intel is doing, we are comparing 12900k to 13600k, only 1 gen after",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
untrue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is the answer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"more like 12900k to 13700k, and my understanding is that intel slapped on more cache for the improvements for the most part.","things are gonna get much more spicy as they shrink down to 4 and 3nm, though",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

am i reading your results correctly but it looks like your core speeds are really low?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"very interesting to read this and your old post, in your old post people saying all of that didnâ€™t seem normal.","i have a 13600k and it looks pretty much exactly what mine was like to, i bought the thermal grizzly contact frame but managed to bring temps down without needing it.","all 13th gen chips run ultra hot, even people who own a 12th gen which ran hotter than all previous years to are shocked at the 13th gen temps.","i have a 30mm 280mm aio and ended up sticking noctua industrial ippc 3000rpm fans on it and set them to intake, that plus thermal grizzly kryonaut paste.","that brought my temps down finally, in game now the 13600k sits between 60-68, but it was up there in the 75-88c range before.","i noticed yours went up to 199w, mine has never gone over 190w which is interesting.",i think yours was pushing to 199w to try achieve the clock speeds but would then thermal throttle.,now yours is reaching its clock speeds at 190w due to better cooling and so thereâ€™s no point it increasing the power.,"in your previous post, itâ€™s nice to see how many people read the brochure but donâ€™t have personal experience hahaha

saying the 13600k shouldnâ€™t go past 181w hahahaha obviously no research was done.",itâ€™s like saying the 13900k should be capped at 253w yet most motherboards will let the 13900k go in excess of 300w straight out of the box.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have better temps with non top air without any frames.,whatsâ€™s your vcore voltage under full load ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you undervolt or something?,your clock speed vary greatly and also your tdp dropped 10 watts.,its usually the other way around if you are cooling better the chip should be drawing more energy because its not getting throttled.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice.,"which motherboard, if you don't mind?",maybe others with this same board should use a contact frame.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i see your cpu is drawing close to 200w.,you can lower the temp further by setting the pl1 & pl2 lower (from bios or using intel xtu).,your cpu will use less wattage and performs the same.,i got the same cinebench results with a 125w pl.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why'd you buy a celeron?,genuinely curious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s ashamed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when i buy my first celeron (266) it was so much fun for oc.,a bit said it has downgraded to this tier.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that sticker is used when you want people to know you use intel but no have them shame you for using celeron,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's still made by intel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because its.. intel celeron?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
theyre moving away from some of their lower end brandings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

a sealed one was on sale for 15 dollars so i kinda impulsively bought it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah they were a decent product back then.,these days the name is attached to potatoes pretending to be cpus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i can tell ya that the atom team is very happy to have their work finally making its way into more mainstream products haha.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
atoms are actually faster than some core based celerons and pentiums.,shit microsoft still sells a dual core skylake pentium that is slower than an atom from 2018.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

isn't an atom like a single core out of a xeon?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yes, especially server based atoms can be really nice for all the accelerators they have",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, thatâ€™s why i said they can be a different class - the laptop ones really arenâ€™t great.",the server ones however can be really great as they have loads of accelerators so for certain workloads they are wonderful,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, the new ones are based on the efficiency cores for 12th gen i believe.","the new xeons (sapphire rapids) are based on the p cores from 12th gen

also they have multiple cores",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why do people keep saying this?,the modern atoms (aka gracemont cores) are pretty great.,"sure they're not as fast but also much cheaper and lower power, while easily 'fast enough'.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i was under the impression that atom in laptops/tablets was killed off a while ago, hence saying they arenâ€™t great.","i canâ€™t seem to find anything but the atoms for servers/network appliances and the like now, do they still make them for consumer devices?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you can't use offset.,only way is to use loadline .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"not sure about the stuttering, but gaming isnâ€™t a heavy multithreaded load, so this is expected behaviour.",the simple explanation for the e-core use is that alder lake and raptor lake cpus are programmed to dip into the e-cores before they start using the smt on the p-cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"had a similar issue, made a post, even caused stuttering and tearing, showed a vid of the problem with my hardware etc, everyone in comments swore to the lord it was because of v-sync needing to be turned on, and downvoted me into oblivion when i suggested that couldn't be the issue, and of course had to be neck beards and call me a dumbby.","another redditor posted it, but fix was turning off c-state in bios for me.",nice to see people are actually trying to help you with this and not being a-holes.,"that aside, your utilization looks normal, so i'm not sure you need to do anything at all.","frames are pretty good, too, for that 3070 and i5.",looks to be a non-issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what about some specs?,hardware and os?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
saw a pretty similar thing in another subreddit (there was just one or two cores under load) and disabling c-state was the solution that all cores were beeing used.,"maybe that would do the trick

edit: but yeah i would say it is a normal utilization",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not disabling the e-cores makes ac odyssey stutter very badly.,the two vulkan games that i tested do use all the p-cores and e-cores available.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most games donâ€™t make use of tons of cores so youâ€™re often going to see low utilization on e cores and the p coresâ€™ extra thread.,"in your image in every odd even pairing of p cores one of the 2 is being used much more heavily than the other, thatâ€™s showing that hyperthreading isnâ€™t helping you very much.",itâ€™s very common for games to cpu bottleneck without even one core showing 100% usage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, it is very normal.",i have a 16 core cpu myself and on most games only 2-4 cores are actually being consistently taxed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hence why i'm looking at xeon w for my next hedt/gaming build.,"unlocked and ecc memory, yes please!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"open the task manager, right click on the game and go to details, click on affinity and select all the p-cores and e-cores.",the game will stop to stutter.,i discovered it accidentally reading another post here on reddit for assassin's creed odyssey.,for a weird reason the e-cores are not selected by the game automatically.,this is the only solution to stop the stuttering.,the problem seems related only with the assassin's creed series.,all the other games that i play use the e-cores normally.,disabling the e-cores doesn't make any sense.,hope this helps,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
really?,"i didnâ€™t know that was a thing, what advantages does not using smt have over using it?",are the e cores just that much better?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i was mostly curios about the the fact that only half the p-cores were being used, but as other pointed out it would be better to use the e-cores instead of smt.","and yes performance is great in all the games i have tested so far, it was only ac odyssey that stutter very badly but that is now fixed thanks to the comment of u/advanced-ad-6998.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which c states did you disable?,"ive seen some people recommend only disabling c8 and c10, leave c1e (deep sleep) and c3 enabled - which is what i did",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are there firmware updates available for your motherboard?,maybe that would help?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not a single true thing was said here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this fixed the stuttering in ac odyssey.,thanks :d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the e-cores are probably better, seeing as smt has never really been observed scaling beyond about 30%.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"smt works best when you have some io bound processes doing networking, disk io, etc.","if itâ€™s all compute, it doesnâ€™t help.",e cores are going to do better in that scenario.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"your first, crucial error was getting an asrock motherboard.",don't bother with xtu either.,most likely it pushes an absurd ac loadline (not llc!,"), which ends up pumping tons of extra voltage when under load, may also introduce an arbitrarily high offset on top of that.",so disable undervolt protection in bios if it's enabled and check what ac loadline this motherboard pushes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you can always upgrade to ddr5 later.,if this is a brand new build then yeah id say you shouldve just gone for ddr5 for future compatibility/gen 5. if you already had the mobo and ddr4 then yeah you could keep it neow.,but id suggest upgrading at a later time since raptor lake 13th gen can take advantage of ddr5 more than ddr4.,not by much but it is noticeable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

been playing around with my sp107 chip cooled by a 420mm aio with great airflow in the case (11 fans total) and frankly i'm kind of disappointed so far.",i'm just an intermediate ocer and i don't know...i guess i was expecting a little bit more out of a top-binned ks chip.,it seems my pc is struggling to do a 5.8 all-core oc @ 320w power draw.,at that power and all-core load half of my p-cores are thermal-throttling and i can barely scratch the 40000 mark on cinebench r23 multi (usually around 39000).,"e-cores i can only oc up to 4.5-4.6 max, and forget about cache.",so far i haven't been able to oc cache over the default 4.5ghz without causing instability while i've seen many others have an easy time ocing it up to around 5ghz.,it's really wonky.,so far the sweet spot for my chip and cooling seems to be an all-core oc of 5.7 with maybe 2 or 3 cores doing up to 6.2 in light loads.,"relatively speaking these values are superb, but i think i'm just spoiled and underwhelmed by all the better binned chips out there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah i had the following:

p-sp: 116  
e-sp: 89

not that great?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm not sure either.,hopefully others can chip in with their scores so we can get a general idea of where our chip stands.,"however just by looking around at other forums and such 100-110 seems pretty average, if not on the lower side though.",i've seen people with 120+ but haven't seen anybody with something lower than 100 so...take that for whatever it's worth.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

huh that's interesting.,seems like these ks chips may have a pretty wide discrepancy between the p and e scores.,my chip has a difference of 27 and yours 32. perhaps they binned the p cores more on these chips...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that's the correct setting.,"the ks chip has an ""extreme profile"" that sets power to 320w which is what you have in that run.",let me try to duplicate the settings and get some benchmark scores for comparison.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok here are my results at stock settings.,note this is with asus z790 extreme + a corsair 420mm aio.,xmp was not enabled and ambient room temp was 20.5c.,i ran cinebench r23 for 1 min to try and closely match the duration of what you ran in your test.,"**test #1 ::: pl1=320w, pl2=unlimited**

**test #2 ::: pl1=320w, pl2=320w**

so anyway, just going back to your original comment of:

>hmm.",my ks does 40.5k cb23 at 240w i think at the stock 5.6/4.3.,this was probably incorrect as i don't see how you can hit 40k+ at 240w.,at least on my chip i need to oc to something like 5.8 all-core to barely break 40k but even my 420mm aio can't sustain the heat for long and throttles at that kind of voltage.,edit - ran some more tests at higher frequencies (5.7 and 5.8).,"**test #3 ::: pl1=320w, pl2=unlimited, oc to 5.7 all-core**

**test #5 ::: pl1=320w, pl2=unlimited, oc to 5.8 all-core + 75mv uv**  
[39,654](https://i.imgur.com/7mdooxm.jpg)

these are simple p-core overclocks so i can break 40k with a little more tweaking (xmp, e-cores oc, a/f curves, tvb, aioc, etc) but overall i'm still a bit underwhelmed by the ks chip (at least with mine...which is just average at sp 107).",it just feels like everyone else easily hits 40k+ with a similar setup but i guess all the reviewers mostly have super high-bin samples to showcase their benchmarks and my results reflect the norm.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

changed it to the lowest setting â€œboxed coolerâ€ (""pl1: 253w"") and it sits at 71c in cinebench.","cinebench score 35359

you should lower it and raise llc.,iâ€™m guessing you could do 1.35v at llc 6 ex.,and then lower from there or llc â€¦.,1.4-1.5v is too much.,"i needed 1,40v at llc8 for 5.8 all core which i dident want to daily.",when i reseat my cooler iâ€™m going for 5.7 probably alsoâ€¦..right now iâ€™m running stock with no limits â€¦.,kicks ass !,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it maintains 354w on prime 95 small fft for a good 30mins as i said with 2 cores bouncing between 98-100

depends on your goals really.,"if you are chasing the last fps or want to overclock for the fun of it, even if you get 5% gains with 40% additional power, then yes, you need some very serious cooling.","on the other hand, because the default operating points are already quite skewed to the performance side due to the competition, you can underclock/undervolt/set power limits with huge power reductions but minimal real world performance loss.","some people prefer a mora, others a sub-10l case.",and the nice thing is you can tune the cpus for both,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

on some boards (asus) you can do a global offset somewhere.,"itâ€™s considered less good since you donâ€™t want too much offset at the lowest frequencies but can drop it more for the top ones (or give it a boost if you are using a different undervolt method (ac/dc loadline, for instance) and need more power at the top).",the global offset can be also be done in the windows tool intel xtu which allows testing of oc settings without having to reboot each time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

remember gen 5th?",it could be something like that.,just very few sku are on desktop side.,or maybe even none at all.,it is not the first time intel made a new gen more specific to desktops or laptop.,"since this is mostly for power efficiency, which doesn't really benefit the desktop all that much.",there are some likelihood that might do something similar again and delay desktop until next gen. considering the desktop side is doing okay already.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i havenâ€™t seen any reliable information pointing towards the existence of desktop skus?,"reading between the lines of statements made by intel, it really does sound like meteor lake is mobile only.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its happened before but it was the exception.,im sure there will be desktop skus for mtl.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
true but intel canâ€™t be trusted anymore until something is really certain.,i will be very surprised if i finally get meteor lake instead of another raptor lake refresh.,i have 9700k.,the funny thing is that 9th gen is coffee lake refresh of 8th genâ€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

stay with 11th gen. you should only upgrade to high-na euv intel skews.,intel 20a processes.,if you had 10th gen intel chip (like me) i will be jumping onto intel 4 (euv process).,4 years is a good time to upgrade.,if you can stretch to 5 or 6 years that will be good use of your money.,3 years is too fast.,[https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/saxowk6binq6mamlbealvi-970-80.png.webp](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/saxowk6binq6mamlbealvi-970-80.png.webp) \- from tom's hardware cpu hierarchy.,from looking at this chart (purely for gaming) i would say if you had an i7 8700k (highest end intel chip for 8th gen) getting 125 fps avg and jumping to 12700k or even 13900k will be a good upgrade.,about roughly 6 year upgrade cycle.,[multi-thread performance](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hxcztqtaclquqxudfcadm9-970-80.png.webp) \- and you can see similar jumps in terms of productivity suites.,so from intel 9th gen upgrading to 13th gen would be a good upgrade.,but your i9 11900k is still at the top of the pack.,especially if you decide to overclock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

temperature/heat output has very little to do with the efficiency of cpus/gpus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you usually need to tinker with bios settings and so.,my 13600k can run with stock speed at 110-120watts in cinebench r23 after tinkering with ia ac dc.,now it pulls 190w at 5.6pcores 4.4ecores and 5.0ring.,so i'm gonna say it is darn efficient imo for the level of performance i'm getting from it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

14th gen is generally referring to meteor lake.,"however, the plan to have raptor lake refresh later this year, if not officially referred to as 14th gen (which i donâ€™t think it would be as it would probably just be a minor speed bump and not a silicon change), would then just be a continuation of 13th gen. maybe 13.5th gen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

heat is not entropy.,heat exchange increases the entropy of a system.,"the theoretically perfect gpu you are mentioning is actually something that physicists usually refer to as ""ideal machine"", which has a 100% efficiency.",an ideal machine has no heat loss.,the 4090 you mention here is much more efficient.,"despite it uses +33% more watts, the output(fps or whatever you want to measure to compare) is more than the triple of the 690.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> a 100% efficient gpu just means that all the heat produced was used to perform computation.,this theoretically perfect gpu would still require power and produce heat proportional to the # of computations it performed.,"transistors are generally very very close to 100% efficient, so power draw is always the main component when it comes to heat.",your cpu or gpu is basically just as good at turning electricity into heat as an electric furnace would be.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"even if you don't care about the cost, the noise, or the heat dumped into your room, temperature has become a limiting factor behind performance.",are you being deliberately obtuse?,performance can't be pushed further than the 13900k with current technology without reducing energy consumption because it is already at the limits of what can reasonably be dissipated.,the only people who would vocally claim to not care about a reduction in energy consumption are blatantly ignorant.,less heat means more headroom for performance.all you are doing with this post is very publicly looking like a fool.,you don't seem to understand that performance and energy efficiency are intrinsically linked.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

a new cpu will only show improvement if you are cpu bound right now.,"with gaming in 4k i doubt the cpu is what will hold you back, at that kind of resolution the gpu will always be the bottleneck.","the 3080 is capable at 4k gaming, but depending on you want in terms of fps upgrading to the 4070 or 4080 series from nvidia or the equivalent amd gpu might be a better move.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so, the 9900k still has legs and probably shouldn't bottleneck the 3080. especially if you have it overclocked at all.",but if you are looking to upgrade then i'd suggest a 13600k and a z690 board.,it'll run you about $400 if you reuse your ddr4 ram (providing its a decent set) and you'll have all the power you'll realistically need for at least another 5 years.,plus as an added bonus you'll have pcie 4.0/5.0 depending on the board.,or you can spend another $90'ish bucks and get the 13700k.,"that was my choice and my way of ""future proofing"".",you could also wait for meteor lake.,"though there's some confusion on whether or not there will be desktop cpu's for the next gen. last investor presentation i saw showed that there would be, but who knows.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

me too buddy.,in the exact same boat.,honestly i have a 5800x3d but that single core score off the 13 series is pretty interesting stuff.,i don't play mmos so single core matters.,also fml why did the 3080ti only have 12gb of vram.,it's like so good in certain games but i do get frame time spikes and shader stutter at 4k ultra settings (even though i don't hit 12gb the 1percent lows just kill) so i'm thinking i'll wait 1 more gen on cpu and gpu then upgrade and give my gf the rig,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah but its the only way you will get a reasonable boost in fps.,a z790 and a 13700/13900k is like 1200$ cad ?,for a little increase in performance.,a 4070ti should cost you 1200-1300$ cad aswell.,im not 100% sure on the prices im from europe.,"but in eu a 4070ti here is 1000â‚¬

- updating bios
- clear cmos
- remove 1 stick of ram (individually)
- switching ram sticks
- no oc at all
- remove all ssd and test to install one by one (no success)
- test ssd using crystaldisk, all good

after all this, i installed windows using another computer with hyper v, it was able to boot but when i tried to install audio, gpu, drivers and any other program i started getting the same error on window event logger so last thing i tried was switching the cpu, bought an i7 13700k and it works flawlessly no errors at all so no idea whats wrong with the i9 13900k should i get rma?","msi meg ace z690

works with coffe lake xeons and mutans cpus too ( is a lie xeons need special chipset for work,) since uses same microcodes ( you add them with coffe time program ), the only donwside is you need disables intel magnament engine ( or downgrade ) and maybe cant update to win 11/oficial support

my mobo is asus z170 pro gaming.,i will look it up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
upgrading to a 7700k would be expensive and mean marginal performance improvement.,it would be properly pointless.,a cheap more modern system (12th gen intel or am4) would be vastly vastly more bang for buck and potentially quite reasonably priced.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i disagree.,7000 series is more future proof,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
even buying a high end 7th gen isnâ€™t going to be much of an uplift.,itâ€™s not worth doing.,just save up for a new cpu + mb + ram.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"why would you upgrade to some cpu whose performance can be ousted by some cpu that is 100 usd, if not lesser?",use your common sense and google before asking a question.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
really?,show me a motherboard and cpu combo for 12th gen intel that costs 100 dollars!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe.. but about 50% more expensive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"best price i can find on a used 7700k is $160, and thatâ€™s used rather than new equipment.",a cheapish b560 mobo and a 12100k will be $40 more and in warranty.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm going off the price of the i7-6700k.,i'm finding ebay listings for it that cost 80-90 dollars infact!,"clearly the i7-7700k isn't a good deal, but the 6700k sure is!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it might be a good deal on paper but the performance gain from a 6600 is just not going to be worth the expense.,think of it as (i havenâ€™t checked actual benchmarksâ€¦) $100 for 10% more performance or $200 for 75% more.,obviously the best option is to save a bit longer!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hyperthreading being added, and much higher clocks, are not a 10% more performance improvement.","geekbench multicore goes from 3376 to 4991, a 47% improvement across the board.",(not 10% as you said! ),"while yes, a new mobo would provide better performance combined with a newer platform, op has stated they do not have the budget to facilitate this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
multicore is all well and good but itâ€™s not going to make the most difference in most scenarios.,though iâ€™ll concede 4c4t is limiting in some.,itâ€™s still a waste of money.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a blue screen is a kernel panic, something went so terribly wrong the os had no chance to recover and threw a fault.","kernel panics can be caused by faulty hardware (bad ram, dying ssd etc.)",or faulty kernel level drivers.,the first step to finding the cause is to determine what caused the blue screen to happen.,"windows makes a memory dump when this happens and with tools like ""who crashed"" and ""bluescreenview"" it is possible to read these memory dumps.",once you have the error and possibly the process that triggered it you can work towards a solution.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what changed before your pc started blue screening?,"when you say your fans didn't feel hot, did you use a software to track the temperatures?",try hwinfo and see what your cpu temperatures look like.,it could be time to dust and clean your pc.,you could use the same opportunity to re-seat the ram.,it may also be worth doing a clean re-install of windows.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the last time i remembered in the stop code it says system_service_exception and the other one it was something about the memory(?).,didn't say any kernel in the stopcode.,how should i troubleshoot that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel(r) core(tm) i5-4670 cpu @ 3.40 ghz 3.40 ghz
8 gb ram
64 bit system type",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my frames keeps dropping before blue screaning and my audio kind of distorted a little, and i just felt the fans with my hand and didnt feel warm or anything.",ill try cleaning my pc and reinstalling ty!,i'll see if it happens again,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the blue screen itself is formally known as a kernel panic.,the term kernel panic isn't mentioned ever on the blue screen itself.,the way you troubleshoot this is by downloading either tool i mentioned earlier and use that to look at the memory dump.,"you could also look in the event viewer and look for a bugcheck code, that should contain some information as well.","the `system_service_exception` stop code could indicate a faulty or misbehaving driver, but the memory dump will tell you for sure.",if the stop code is more randomized that could indicate faulty memory.,memory can be tested with something like memtest86.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i finally found the event finder this is what i saw and don't really understand what is says.,"[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uio7jajpxne6m4lwlp3jtrv5gjj\_4di1/view?usp=share\_link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uio7jajpxne6m4lwlp3jtrv5gjj_4di1/view?usp=share_link)

do you think so?,i was be to go to 5.5 with 277w package power but it will hit 93c-94c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it needs to be above 100c before you should worry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

should i worry if i hit 90c in bf2042,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok but if i play a game and it hits 90c should i worry?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most people would consider that to be high but it should not be dangerous,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ok i know 100c is tjmax and you don't wanna go to it or over it, but i figured if i was like 90c-97c it would damage the cpu or shorten it's life span.",i just don't wanna ruin this thing it was to expensive lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"technically you are shortening the life span of the cpu every time you use it, but if it lasts 48 years instead of 50 years then that's obviously not important for anyone.",many people use laptops that run at over 90c most of the time and they still work after 10+ years so i would not worry about it at all.,"if 100c was not safe, intel would make tjmax lower than that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i guarantee you it is as good as they say

\- a fellow i3-12100f user :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah they're super impressive cpus.,i keep booting up my test bench and forgetting it's the i3 and not the i5 or even i9 in there until i wonder why cinebench results suck or there's no igpu output!,in actual use it's snappy and capable as anything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would going from a i5 9400f to a i3 13100 a decent upgrade?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
works well for me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that chip is considerably faster than the i7-1165g7 in my laptop which is also 4 cores/8 threads.,"granted, i'm comparing a mobile chip vs. a desktop chip, but it's really amazing how big of a jump there is between the 11th and 12th gen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"itâ€™s a fantastic little beast of a chip, but that motherboardâ€™s way too expensive for it unless youâ€™re trying to bclk oc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"4c 8t... sounds like a modern  6700k 7 ys later, i would skip this one and jump directly to the 13400f",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is that better than an i5?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and yet lots of people are still buying 10400 combo at a much higher price comparing 12100 combo.,retail stores are trying so hard to clear their 10th gen inventory.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's pretty good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they have this cpu for $80 till christmas eve by me.,do you think if paired with a rtx 3050 it would make a decent gta5 box for my little brother?,i have everything else and a spare 3050 i was saving for a i5 but this thing looks sweet on paper 12mb cache and all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's a mother fucking beast disguised under the brand of core i3.,"i have one paired with a z690 (wanted to go 13600k, but stuff happened and resorted to a 12100f for a while) and let me tell you, i've yet to see a reason to go for 13600k.",runs fl studio with multiple instances of shreddage like a breeze.,"heavily modded stalker, no problem.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

itâ€™s a great cpu!,"a little quad core that can game better than 9900k, but comes with a more modern platform too.",good choice!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is your budget?,"if you can maybe dish out another 200buks or so, and as long you have a return time date,  you can get a 13600k or f chip, and actually be able to run it on your b660 mobo, as long the bios is updated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably a number of different gpus.,it's currently sitting in our testing rig while we wait for a bigger cpu to come.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i think i disagree with the other comment here, that would absolutely be a very good upgrade imo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i3 12100 / 13100 4c/8t would be an ok upgrade.,with 65% higher single thread and 43% higher multi thread performance in rendering.,"gaming won't show those levels of performance gains, especially if pairing with rtx 3070 or below class at 1080p ultra.","[outside of a few specific st games, i doubt see much higher average fps difference, though might see higher minimums leading to smoother experiences?","](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/intel-core-i3-12100f/16.html) 

though once vsync capped or gsync'd / freesync'd i don't think it would matter much.","i'd suggest aiming to buy a little higher on the cpu tier, such as i5 12400 6c/12t or the **highly anticipated upcoming i5 13400 10c/16t (6p/4e)**.","[there many online side by side videos and reviewers comparing performances across 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12th gens.",](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/intel-core-i3-12100f/),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"eh, i'd go for another i5 if you could.","it would likely be a boost, but the 9400f is literally on par with my 7700k roughly, and i'd personally want more than a 30% improvement for the price of a platform upgrade tbqh.",13500 in particular looks like it's gonna be just nice....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thank you so much for all of your answers, ill be checking out deals so i can upgrade.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah the difference is huge,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
awesome.,it's just a stop gap cpu in our test system while we decide on which bigger cpu to go for.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for gaming ?,does it even matter ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"depends on the i5... the 12th gen i5s are faster, any i5 with only 4 cores will be slower.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wonder if having more cores (though slower and more power hungry) offers any sort of advantage?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is currently in our test system.,"we do have a 10400 in our studio gaming system, seems alright with the arc a770 tbh no issues so far.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a 3050 would be great for this cpu.,the 12100f performs better than a 9900k in some games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this plus a 3050 will have zero issue running gta5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they still get the e cores, dont they?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, this is just a stop gap while we decided on a bigger cpu for the test system.",others have recommended the 13600k so might go for that one.,thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, if you want ecores, the 12600k/13600k is the cheapest option - for now.","why not pair it with a good b660m board, if you don't need the oc capabilities?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"itâ€™s extremely hard and expensive to get a board that supports blck overclocking, so i doubt he has one",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is currently sitting in our testing rig until a bigger cpu is coming.,was looking at the 13600k though so might go that route while we play around with this one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"agree; why pay for a new board and cpu and possibly ddr5 ram, just to go from 6ct/6t to 4ct/8t?","if you can afford it, then an i5 would give you a much more noticeable uplift in performance, as even the lowest 12th gen i5 offers 6ct/12t.","and with the 13th gen coming out right now, prices will hopefully drop.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so that would be faster than my i5 8th gen?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
agrees on the performance part.,but not so on the pricing part.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"according to the gamers nexus review, this cpu performed well with a 3080.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can confirm 13600k does wonders.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh yes!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you everybody i've been a little bit out of touch with the whole building a computer thing for a while and i wanted to hear somebody say it not just read it on paper i appreciate all the feedback,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"xmg here, thanks for linking to our announcement thread in op.",a few points for clarification and a timeline.,"**ancient past**

* voltage offset used to be unlocked on h-series cpus for ages
* after plundervolt (2019), intel [sent out guidance](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00289.html) to oems that they hide voltage offset from bios because safety first.",some oems followed suite.,"**2020**

* on clarification, intel confirmed to us in 2020 that we are still free to offer voltage offset if we understand and carry the risks, which we did.",* we published [this article](https://www.igorslab.de/en/undervolting-on-intel-laptops-in-2020-this-is-what-you-need-to-know-xmg-support/) on igor's lab with our official guidance based on intel core 10th gen h-eries (comet lake).,"**2021**

* with intel core 11th gen h-series (tiger lake), we introduced a fallback mechanism where the ec firmware can automatically reset all bios tuning options if the system fails to boot (post) multiple times due to inappropriate voltage offset or memory tuning values.",this fallback mechanism could also be triggered via hotkey (ctrl+b during cold boot).,this made undervolting via bios setup 100% safe and convenient for our users.,"please note, runtime undervolting (via xtu or throttlestop) is cumbersom on laptops because the laptop oem performance profiles (required for fan control and battery life) often overwrite such runtime tunings.","undervolting in bios setup is a more convenient, permanent ""fire & forget"" solution once you found your voltage offset sweet spot.","**2022**

* with 12th gen, intel moved all ""h-series"" (marketing name) to the ""alder lake p"" platform (technology platform), where voltage offset msr inbox was fused off, just like it was in previous u- and p-series cpus (e.g.","i7-1165g7, i7-11370h).","exception: i9-12900hk still allowed the msr inbox, despite being otherwise the same silicon as i7-12700h or i9-12900h.","* we have started to roll-out bios update to some of our 12th gen h-series to unlock ""ac loadline"" as a less powerful alternative to undervolting.","* in the same year (2022), intel introduced 12th gen hx-series, based on desktop chips.","codename: alder lake sbga (""s"" stands for desktop).",voltage offset was unlocked.,"**2023**

* when we learned of [hp's announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/hpomen/comments/yejp66/qa_for_vbs_and_impact_to/) about blocking runtime voltage offset, we contacted intel as a precaution.","this was still relatively low-key for us, because we felt safe in having voltage offset in bios setup (i.e.",not at runtime).,"* in 2023, 13th gen (raptor lake) continues the hx line-up, and voltage offset was still unlocked.","however, suddenly our odm partner advised us as follows:
   * the uncoming bios version will remove the â€œvoltage offsetâ€ option, because ""voltage offset"" values will affect bios update procedures when using ami's bios update tool (afuefi64, afuwin64).","it will cause a sudden ""power off"" crash.","* we tried -30mv, we tried -50mv, use afuefi64, afuefi64cap, afuwin64cap, all will have problems.","this is very dangerous, if ""power off"" crash occurs during a bios update process.",* we have announced that we will not be able to offer voltage offset in our raptor lake hx flagship models and that we are still pushing our odm partner and ami for a solution.,"* after now reading this write-up by op, we have contacted our intel contacts about this issue with additional urgency.","* we also read [this statement](https://boringtextreviews.com/2023/02/02/intels-lex-hoyos-clarifies-the-situation-with-undervolting/) from intel's lex hoyos, but it does not address the sudden stability issues that our odm partner encountered with the voltage offset options in bios setup on ami, so the issue is still unresolved for us.","**our position towards industry partners:**

* we want to allow undervolting for end-users as long as it provides performance-per-watt benefits.",* we are able to mitigate any risks and educate our customers about how to apply voltage offset without risking system stability (i.e.,"small steps, some testing, fallback mechanisms for system recovery).",* under our corporate nda we seek guidance from intel to educate us about how to offer reasonable tuning options via bios setup in a safe and orderly fashion on both ami and insyde bios.,we are currently uncertain as to how this is going to develop.,"so we are not able to promise to our customers that voltage offset will come back in our intel core 13th gen hx-series flagship  laptops, despite having committed all of our volume to the unlocked intel core i9-13900hx in this generation due to its superior thread count, cache size and ddr5-5600 memory support.",you can find us on [our discord server](https://discord.gg/xzykwqf) for further discussion or for sharing further insights on this issue.,a community member on discord pointed out this thread to us.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

summarize the deep points?,this reads like chatgpt generated word vomit.,muddies the water between laptop chip and desktop chip undervolting.,also lacking significant sample size data for claims that even a minimal uv on desktops would cause instant crashes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

how exactly can this have negative consequences?,when undervolting you are actively decreasing the stability through your actions.,how is it possible for the prevention of something that inherently decreases stability also decrease stability?,"that would suggest that undervolting can be a necessary for system stability... 

the entire idea collapses in on itself immediately if you think about the claim being made and try to apply logic to it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"for msi z790s, i see ""overvolt protection"" but nothing about undervolt.",anyone have any luck?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
undervolting is not good actually based on my limited experience.,i have desktop 9900k and 2x 10980xe which i tinker alot.,"when you undervolt, like when you overclock, it requires thorough stress test.","however we all know that most people will go with whatever they are comfortable with like few runs of cinebench, never test avx-2, let alone avx-512 because they are running too hot, etc.",so in a sense we are reducing the stability.,"with all of my cpus, it looks stable with -0.1v for gaming and daily task but with thorough stress test even with small -0.02v offset it will have eventual error running linpack xtreme let alone when you also overclock the cache.",donâ€™t forget that negative offset is affecting stability more on lower speed ratios than the higher ratio let alone max cpu boost.,for example with 1.4v at 5.0 ghz you would have room to offset by -0.1v to 1.3v total.,however with 0.8v at 1.2ghz that -0.1v offset is too much and will leads to instability during idle or transient.,"so i would say if you really need to lower power consumption, do it by lowering the max boost clock or better yet using power limit.",there is reason the vid is programmed at that value.,"sure there is small safety margin for error included but you can find that it is not much, like 0.015v in my experience with all my intel cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the whole undervolting fad is foolish and pointless,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in my opinion, this is an important feature to have enabled for most\* end users (95% to 99%) with the power users not majorly affected.",because the option is still there to enable it again.,the vast majority of users do not understand how to maintain laptop battery health.,and will routinely charge to 100% and hold it for a prolonged time or they discharge the battery down to 0% regularly.,this will over long term degrade the battery performance and lead to a drop in voltage.,"same thing with a car's battery, over time the lead acid battery will no longer beable to provide you 12v.",typically a good one will provide 13v and a bad one will dip to 11.5v.,cold weather will cause the battery to under perform as well.,back to the point.,when you undervolt and you have a degraded laptop battery (most users do not regularly measure their laptop battery voltage output) you can have a laptop that may not boot overtime.,"and most users don't service their own machines, they often take it to a specialist tech.","the tech many not know that a particular user has ""undervolted"" their cpu and will spend hours trying to diagnosis this issue.",anyway i think this is overblown and the rant is too long and spans multiple posts for some reason.,it isn't a blocked feature via your reference links to the official intel response.,"you can enable it if you'd like, but know that battery degradation is real and if the cpu has a degraded battery and is undervolted, the issue will crop up in the future.",most users will not be able to diagnosis this issue.,since most users don't regularly adjust their under volt.,it is a set and forget feature.,on desktop pc this is a non-issue since it has a steady supply of constant power.,no power fluctuations.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thank you, tom!",i have a similar experience with the bios provided by dell on xps 17 with core i9 12900hk.,"i think, the same is true for alienware systems using the same cpu.","the undervolting options (offsets) are still present in bios, but require enabling the **overclocking feature** in order to work properly.","if i specify the 40mv negative voltage offset, the cpu switches to a very weird safe-mode.",it drops the clocks to 400 mhz and sets nearly 0.7v voltage.,the new undervolting protection feature is enabled and there's no hidden setting or efi variable to disable it.,on the previous bios version with 0x41b intel's microcode the same system was fully stable with 150mv negative voltage offset.,"as for other devices like dell precision 7670 and 7770 with core i9 hx, the undervolting works and the undervolting protection setting is in the bios, but hidden.","if you try to enable it using efi variable modification, the performance also decreases significantly.",it looks like the current bios version is shipped with the old intel's microcode.,"on top of that, i saw similar messages from some desktop users.",the symptoms are nearly the same: bios update -> disable undervolting protection -> significant performance drop.,"i'm not aware of cases, when the device was bricked, but it's not excluded, because the voltage offsets are applied in the beginning of the device initialization before efi (pre-efi or pei stage).","i hope, this information will help you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's great!,"probably, gigagyte decided to revert the intel's code to the old version or found a workaround for that.",i wish dell will do that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do u happen to know what it's called in gigabytes bios?,i'm about to look but in the past i don't recall seeing it and i had to update the bios for 13th gen on their elite z690 ddr4 cariant mobo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you can still undervolt from the bios, but op doesn't like that they will have to go to the bios.",>intel states that the undervolting will still be available from the bios and is not affected by the new undervolt protection feature.,"they claim that ""adjusting voltages from bios is ... more dangerous"", dangerous how?",who knows,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have added the tldr.,"obviously, i had experienced this problem on my system and know about a few similar cases.","also, this is something confirmed by hp and xmg directly.",you may find links in the post,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there's no h-series desktop cpus.,undervolting is available on hk and hx laptop cpus.,"on h-series laptop cpus it is disabled since 12th gen.

the new intel undervolting protection feature may affect both desktop and mobile platforms if a motherboard vendor decides to block the undervolting or can't make it work with the new intel firmware.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you have an old cpu, you don't need to worry about the undervolting protection.","you, probably, won't get an update with this feature.","at the same time, there's no need to modify the bios if you want to access some hidden settings.",check [the undervolting guide](https://brendangreenley.com/undervolting-2020-dell-laptops-like-the-vostro-7500-and-more-tips-to-improve-thermals-battery-life-and-speed/#cpu-undervolt) for modern laptops.,you can do that on the desktop as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, if you undervolt your cpu too much, you may experience some stability issues, obviously.",that's why it's important to do appropriate testing during this process.,"on the flip side, i can't consider system constantly running 90+ degrees celsius as stable, just because the manufacturer decided to put more voltage to the cpu.",here's a real example with top precision 7670 and 7770 devices: [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68rcek3l0os).,they throttle almost instantly when you open a start menu.,this problem was quietly fixed only in december.,undervolting helps resolving this issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you use intel xtu or apply offsets through bios?,do you have the undervolt protection enabled?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i just checked and the undervolt protection was already toggled off, i assume by default or because i modified the offset, it triggered it maybe.",that's good though.,feels like asus did the right thing here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"undervolting through bios is for noobs ðÿ¤£

the real undervolters unpack bios, get variable offsets, and adjust voltages right in the nvram (it might be sarcasm, but for most laptop users, it's the new reality).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
from my experience two 12900hk samples were able to achieve -0.15v and -0.14v undervolt while passing prime95 and occt testing.,"let's do some very rough math and assume, that the chip is running on 2.8ghz, 1.0v voltage, and consumes 45w of power (typical laptop pl1).","if we lower the voltage by 0.15v, there will be two edge-case options:

1. we can lower the power consumption to (0.85 \* 0.85) / (1 \* 1) \* 45 = 32.5w while running on the same frequency.",2. we can run it on the higher frequency with the same amount of power (the same frequency as we had when we apply 62.3w of power).,"by default, the laptop will use the second option and we may have \~15% performance boost.","if we decrease the pl1 to 32.5w, we will get the same performance as we get without undervolting and 45w power limit.",the difference between 45w and 32.5w is nearly 10 degrees c and clearly audible.,"the laptop will generate much less noise (\~5 dba, usually).","your concerns about working on lower frequencies are correct, but you can adjust the v/f curve and specify some voltage boost for low frequencies.","in this case, you will be able to achieve even bigger undervolting on high frequencies.",classic voltage offsets actually shift the whole v/f curve.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh yeah, deep-throat that boot!","there you go, just like that.",good consumer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
undervolting is already disabled by default using features like memory integrity.,"we don't need another feature blocking it :)

as for the battery health, the undervolting has a positive impact on that: lower device temperatures, lower power consumption during light loads, etc.","actually, undervolting is the only good way to make a laptop work better, generate less noise and throttle less.","as for the intel's statement that the undervolting through bios will be still working, it completely depends on the motherboard manufacturers now.",some of them can't make it work with the new microcode update from intel.,"also, in the case of undervolting through bios, it is way more dangerous and can brick the device.","it's not a big issue on the desktop motherboards, where you can relatively easy clear the settings.","but on the laptops, it's the problem.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it should be called the undervolt or undervoltage protection, but it might be not working properly and significantly decrease the performance as i described in my post.",you may find more details here: [any way to undervolt on gigabyte boards?,](https://www.reddit.com/r/intel/comments/zcbp5j/any_way_to_undervolt_on_gigabyte_boards/),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"on the new microcode and inside sdk, if you specify a tiny 30mv offset, the cpu will be locked to 400 or 3600 mhz.","the performance, obviously, will be lower.",on the ami sdk the system won't boot at all.,that's why xmg decided to remove the undervolting functionality from their 13th gen devices till this issue is fixed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hp and xmg were talking about laptop undervolting.,desktop undervolting is a different beast.,maybe you could say more about your exact system to narrow down the issue.,youâ€™ve cast your net too wide and confusing vastly different chips by mixing desktop and laptop.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i wrote wrong, i meant k , maybe on basic boards, on msi and gigabyte it's still possible.","while the  overvolt , potentially dangerous, is allowed?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i use both bios and xtu.,undervolt protection is disabled to do undervolt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, asus might simply disable this option by default.",there's no valid reasons to have it enabled.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the thing is that is not the case with reality.,the lowest voltage we can activate a silicon diode is at 0.6-0.7v.,now cpu is usually running at ~0.7v at lowest ratio (my 10980xe now in front of me is running 0.732v at x8).,if you give it negative offset of -0.15v then it will never be stable at idle.,well i donâ€™t have cpu with adjustable v/f curve and that may work if you can let it stay at above 0.7v when idle but as i say try linpack xtreme instead of prime95 because it switched between sse and avx.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the reply and link.,have a good weekend!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hp is talking about the mobile and desktop devices.,"as for xmg, the mobile hx cpus are exactly the same as regular desktop skus.","internally, they use excactly the same s efi toolkit.","in a broader perspective, the laptop and desktop efi are using the same sdk from intel, insyde, ami, etc.. there are some platform-specific code, but it's tiny.",all other parts the same.,there's no reason to create and support separate sdks for different platforms.,you can even find a recent uefi leak from lenovo (intel + insyde sdk) and check it by yourself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it depends on the particular board and the intel microcode (bios version).,there's no restrictions for positive voltage offsets.,"at least, i did not find that in the latest intel docs.","at the same time, the cpu has restrictions on the minimal and maximal voltage and features like ia cep, but they mostly protect the cpu.","in a broader perspective, there are a few way to implement that type of restrictions:

\- **soft**

in this case the motherboard vendor simply hides some overclocking or undervolting settings from the bios.","the settings are still there and working, but a regular customer can't change them in the bios.",a good example here is the laptop undervolting.,it can be enabled by modifying some settings directly in the nvram.,i saw the overclocking settings on a lot of different laptop bios.,they are usually disabled or hidden.,"but if you try to enable them, they might work :)

\- **mixed**

in this case there's no hardware lock, but there's no setting either.",it sometimes happens with some new settings like undervolting protection.,"\- **hard**

in this case the intel's microcode will ignore them in bios even if you found a way to change them.",a good example here is the undervolting support on h-series cpus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, and that's why there are a few types of voltage protections.","the cpu won't request vid, that smaller or higher than some predefined values.","also, there's a feature called ia cep.","if you go from 0.9-1.4 (typical voltages for 12900hk with 45w pl1 and 115w pl2), to 0.75-1.25v, the cpu will work within the acceptable voltage range and you can get all the undervolting benefits.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sorry.,hadn't had a chance to reboot yet.,"in my z690 aorus master f23a bios it's under tweaker, advanced voltage settings, cpu/vrm settings, and then cpu vcore current protection.",mine is on the default of auto.,on previous bios (f20) it didn't matter what i set that to in bios.,windows wouldn't let me under volt in intel xtu.,now i can.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"on gigabyte desktop 12th and msi laptop 11th i have the latest bios and everything works perfectly, on asus tuf laptop instead you can no longer undervolt with the latest bios.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well you can under volt that much i guess itâ€™s because of the lower cpu temp while intel and i think their way is the correct way is to set the voltage while the cpu at itâ€™s max temp (slightly below throttling).,hence when temp is much lower you can enjoy those extra voltage reduction however this will introduce instability when temp rises for some reason.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks man for the follow up!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
laptops and prebuilt pcs often have a very limited bios.,"xmg, lenovo legion, msi, sometimes asus, and some other vendors do a good job here offering more settings out of the box.","in some cases, there's an advanced bios mode with even more settings.","at the same time there's an option to disassemble the bios firmware and get access to all the settings, including voltage offsets, v/f curves and other stuff.","all those settings are pretty similar across different devices, because they are based on the same sdk from intel.",vendors usually avoid making a lot of customizations there.,"yes, sometimes there are some issues with changing efi variables on lenovo thinkpads, but it's rather an exception than a rule.","and yes, it's also available on hp.","but even enthusiasts rarely go that deep in their tuning and simply accept the fact, that undervolting is locked on their devices.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are not correct.,"from the developer's standpoint, desktops and laptops are mostly the same.",this approach is easier for intel and easier for vendors and their partners.,there's no need to spend double or triple the amount of resources to support and develop separate sdk and tooling.,"there are the same settings, the same variable names, the same pei code, the same dxe, and other modules.",the fact that you see more settings on the desktop bios compared to the laptop one does mean nothing.,ui is the tip of the iceberg.,"and if you don't see some settings, it does not mean that they are missing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"fortunately, 11th gen systems are not affected.","as for the asus laptop, we need to check in the undervolting was blocked by the new intel undervolting protection feature.",you can do that using hwinfo64.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are not correct.,"from a silicon design standpoint, they are absurdly not the same, and the challenges you are seeing with bios corruption while undervolted are precisely the result when you try to make them the same.",it only looks the same to you because you have no clue what youâ€™re talking about lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i've been able to apply the -0.15v voltage offset on the old bios and get 15% performance boost in cb r23 mt.,after the update and the new intel microcode if i apply a tiny -0.04v offset through bios my device is working in the fail-safe mode with 400 mhz locked clock.,did i get the new silicon with the bios update?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok and how does that affect what i said?,"you developers tried to make them the same when theyâ€™re different beasts, and now you get to try and fix issues like bios corruption due to undervolting lol.","just because you guys want to make them 1 register, doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s actually the same thing lmao.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

trying to future proof isnâ€™t always a good idea.,it makes the current system more expensive for needs you might not ever have.,a 12900k is great for highly parallel workloads but it is a very hot cpu.,"so if you future proof with it, it makes your cpu and case cooling requirements higher and more expensive.",any of the cpus on your list would be great for normal uses.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

intel specs say 13600k has maximum turbo power 181 w

the setting ""turbo enhanced"" will let the cpu go past this, and this is where problems happend because most cpu coolers are not capable of handling it.",every cooler has a tdp limit if you look your cooler up you can see what max tdp it can handle.,so since intel recommends 181w you should disable turbo enhanced if you dont want to overclock your cpu.,and you can set pl2 in bios to 181w (powerlimit 2),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it will help, but even more importantly it is set up to use an unlimited amount of power out of the box.",if you change the pl1(power limit 1) and pl2 down to whatever your cooling solution can remove for heat.,so if your cooling can handle 125 watts then make pl1 that and then pl2 is a short burst so it can go a tad higher like say 150 watts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's a dynamic overclocking feature that only activates when the cpu is below 90â°c.,if he has cooling problems then it won't activate.,there's no harm in leaving it on.,what is really going to make a difference in temps is lowering the voltage and setting pl2 to a lower value.,"but, honestly, the 13600k isn't that hard to keep cool anyway.",if you are having cooling problems on this chip then you should have bought a better cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"most likely not, you can try yourself to run cinebench after you disabled it and see the temps and results yourself

basically the lower tier cpus will generally have higher voltage as intel basically chooses lower quality silicon to fab the lower end chips.",i'll note i did undervolt my cpu though and it runs fine at about 1.27v on light loads or 1.18v in cinebench without issue.,so you can still undervolt and save on power/heat output.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i also wonder if ddr5 in general is just bad or buggy and have heard rumblings of xmp problems with ddr5 everywhere and even someone recommended to a new person building a system do not buy ddr5 over on [overclock.net](https://overclock.net) forums.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am going to try those settings again but this time also reduce ram speed to 6400 and see if it helps.,maybe 7200 was just too much for mobo or cpu imc??,?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes and i have it installed and use it to monitor temps and power and such.,"&#x200b;

what should i see if ram is not legit.","&#x200b;

everything it says shows rated speeds when xmp is loaded.",and when on auto it shows fail safe spd speeds.,to me that seems legit.,or is there something else you are referring to.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hi there,

have you solved your xmp issues?",or are you using another brand of mb?,i was thinking to get a asus z790 but you are not the only one complaining that their xmp does not work properly....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13900k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"max stable ""i think"" is 7000 mhz but anything above causes crashes.",and i dont think any bios update will change anything about this.,i needed the first update to even get the ram supported at all but its still like this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hmmâ€¦iâ€™m on a z790 ace and corsair dominator platinum 7200. at xmp settings, i get about 150 errors in one pass of memtest86.","at the default jedec settings, iâ€™m fully stable after 4 passes of memtest86 (about 3.5 hours).",this ram is a die as opposed to m die.,iâ€™m thinking a bios update to 7d86v11 may improve stability.,"if not, i may need to manually input timings and voltages.",have any you tried the latest bios dated 12/20/22?,the 12/27/22 bios is in beta.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have aours elite ax z790 13900ks and teamgroup 2x16 7600mhz.,default xmp boots with 7600mhz but bsod in gaming.,so i tried cl 34 44 44 28 7200mhz  according to a yt video.,crashes too.,but is rock solid with these timings on 7000mhz.,my ram is on qvl but 7600mhz but as 1x8gb!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you have coil whine on your strix.,i have heard it is hit or miss though it seems the asus 4090 cards that have it have it worse than others usually??,"&#x200b;

i have heard best results for almost no or absolutely no coil whine is on asus boards with a good sample card from really any vendor base don responses form what mobo the ones who stated they had no whine were using.","&#x200b;

how is your 4090 strix in terms of coil whine on your asus board?","&#x200b;

its ironic because it seems maybe asus motherboards are best in terms of mitigating gpu coil whine compared to others yet they have the most complaints about coil whine for their high end gpus.",though its mostly gpu but it seems you need asus board and good power supply and a good card with right components to not hear any whine at all.,with other boards i speculate all cards even whine free ones that people report still produce too much audible buzz/whine.,but just speculation based on posts i have read on other blogs and no definitive answer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
id believe it if it was asus's fault.,i bought a strix z690e off hardware swap last week but it kept shutting down randomly in memory tests with 2 sets of 5600mhz ram ( gskill and corsair ).,so i was able to return it thanks to the seller but got a z790 tomahawk instead.,"i'll try that with the 6400mhz ddr5 kit i got a few days ago as well, running with a i7-13700k",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"circling back, looks like its an asus thing.",my z790 tomahawk and 13700k were able to post my 6400mhz trident z kit first try and lasted 1 cycle in testmem5 extreme config by anta777.,ill probably let it run 10 cycles overnight just because im very strict about stability but its good so far,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 13900 should run it no problem.,it has to be the bios settings or motherboard in my opinion.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had to use an msi z690 unify x and issues are solved.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
safe to say that sweet spot its probably 6800 then.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hey man, ive tried every bios since motherboard has released, not much change.",i have just bagged a 13900ks so lets hope the imc gods are with me :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no , my system is fine , i used to have a 4090 gigabyte gaming oc n that had a little coil whine ..but my pc now is fine only noise is my corsair aio lol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am now trying msi z690 unify x. i never had issues with ram posting.,it just failed occt tests in the middle of it randomly with a freeze or bsod.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i see nice to hear man!,i can imagine the stress you went through...not worth it!,yeah posts keep popping up on issues with xmp profile for these asus z790 boards your def not the only one.,i was leaning towards the asus z790 strix e but reading all the post made me hesitate.,"so im now left with 2 options:

msi z790 carbon

asrock z790 taichi (heard some good things about asrock being stable and reliable)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"asus maximus extreme z790 , i9 13900k and g.skill 7600 qvl.",xmp 1 had over 4k errors.,6800 had 0 on 2 passes before i had to stop.,you're probably right though.,6800 sweet spot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my ram kit is on the qvl so iâ€™ll spend a little more effort trying to get xmp stability at 7200. if i canâ€™t, iâ€™ve seen some benchmarks that imply that the speed difference between 4800 and 7200 may only be worth a couple fps.",not sure itâ€™s worth the time investment chasing it indefinitely though.,stability is much more valuable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is there no coil whine even when fans are silent and have side panel off and room is quiet and card is under 95 to 100 percent load when you are within 4 feet of the case?,"&#x200b;

and what power supply do you have and are you using extension cables for 12vhpwr adapter or a direct connect one?","&#x200b;

i ask this as i am desperately trying to find a rtx 4090 setup with no coil whine and need as much data as possible.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 it passed the 10 cycles overnight so looks like iâ€™m good.,hope that board works out for ya,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what about 7000 or 7200 ?,did you tried ?,"i was looking to same specs, but i'm now reconsidering, but still in hope that some magic bios update would fix that in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"by all means give it a go, i spent 3 days changing all sorts of settings to try and stabilise it, derbaur has a great video on hitting 7200 on a cheap gigabyte board and has given me many insights on what to change for stability ect, however ultimately it comes down to your imc.","most overclockers on yt have high sp chips and in my humble opinion give a false representation of what the platform can do, as that is a very small minority of samples which will hit it.","ultimately though as you say, theres not a lot in it, if you can run 6400-6800 (which i'm sure you'd be able to) then you won't miss that extra 1 fps.",let us know how you get on :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well , iâ€™m not really nit picking to that extent lol , but so far i hear nothing, the only thing that is kind of noisy n i can confirm is my aio .","i am using the msi 1000w pcie 5.0 psu, and i am using the direct connect cable (12hpwr) looks cleaner as well .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it worked with 6600 cl32 39 39 76 corsair vengeanceat xmp settings.,on msi unify x z690.,no way it would have worked on the asus board as even 6000 corsair vengeance was not fully stable.,"&#x200b;

seems to be an asus problem.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
update: updated to the latest bios that just came out (v1.2 dated 1/12/2023) for the z790 ace.,it looks like it's the stable version of the one that was released on 12/27.,enabled xmp on my corsair dominator platinum ddr5 7200 kit.,i ran 4 passes on memtest86 with zero errors.,it looks like i have stability now!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is your 13900k at stock settings?,"&#x200b;

and what is your ring clock at when ram is at xmp or even with xmp off?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
niceðÿ‘œ.,sucks that asus dropped the ball this gen because i much prefer their bios layout and features,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
had the same issue with my asus z790 board.,tried slots 2 and 4 only and xmp 1 and 2 were both stable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
msi pro b660m-a is maybe $20 more but it works well.. i am not sure about 13700k but it fully supports 13600k on stock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not on that mobo no.,it struggles with i5's let alone ~250w of i7k cpus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no ds3h will throttle.,you need b board with better vrm.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, not even a little bit.",that board canâ€™t even run a 12600k.,"alsoâ€¦ youâ€™re building a *budget build*, for your *family*, with a *13700k*?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"youu only get display output so it means it work as company laptop so games doest work at all

should be alright.,keep an eye on any bios tdp boost overrides like asus multicore enhancement if temperatures are getting too hot with your cooler.,not sure about that specific board but yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but big issue is it doesnt have bios flashback,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13700 non k is power limited by default so it would be fine on mostly all boards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it wont be alright because ds3h throttles even 12600k.,its one of the cheapest b660 boards and vrm is simply not good enough to handle anywhere near the tdp of 13700k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it will work but without the advertised performance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well they do sell boards with updated bios.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"figured, thats why i made sure to mention that im not sure about that specific board.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
majority of b660 boards come with older bios as they were manufactured before 13th gen release.,"there is a chance you will get it with updated bios, but chances are much higher you wont.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
any suggestions for b boards with potential to handle the load ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

reset bios because you disabled hyperthreading and probably a lot of other things,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you've clearly screwed with more settings in the bios because you've so how disabled hyperthreading.,"i would suggest you reset to defaults, enable xmp, and check that things are behaving correctly.",also use hwinfo to check per core speeds more reliably.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you have enforced intel limits on your bios not all of the 13900k chips can go beyond 5.2ghz due to hitting a power limit.,mine for example if i disable mce (enforce intel limits) and all of the other settings are 100% optimized defaults including xmp.,i can only get 5.2ghz in r23.,with intel limits removed i get 5.5ghz on r23.,but with hyperthreading off you should have more power headroom.,what are you using to load up the cores?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just a quick tip, for best performance (at least in my case) enable hyperthreading and xmp, increase the ram voltage by 0.1 for better stability and then limited the tdp to 240w to keep the thermals under control, i sit at 5.6-5.7ghz at 70-75â°c stable with 100% utilization",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you disabled ht thereâ€™s no telling what else you screwed up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just to give some more info.,asus 690 otherbaord with upgraded bios and intel me.,gpu- 3080ti.,32 gb ram at 4600 mhz.,xmp 1 on.,kraken liquid cooling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what are you doing to try and get it to boost?,"undo whatever settings you've changed, run hwinfo64 and then run cinebench r23 *single core*.","peak boost on your best cores should hit 5.7-5.8ghz, it shuffled the workload around normally between your two strongest cores.",all core will be 5.4-5.5 on p-cores so long as you're not power or thermal constrained.,however peak ghz is just an indicator that there are no constraints on boost.,be guided by actual benchmark results not simply clockspeed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
download couid and check there.,also you can right colicky on your cou screen and select view per core i believe.,this will allow you to see what all of your cores are doing and not just an overall usage.,you won't always see a boost cpu wide but you will see a few cores boosting higher than the rest when you set it to view all cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hey commercialcut3523, it looks like you are having a cooling problem.",first - dont be afraid of 100c.,its normal for laptops.,"if youre running a high tdp load with a desktop i9 cpu, this is inevitable.",if youre hitting 100c in things like gaming and lighter tasks - then we have a problem.,"if thats the case, the first thing you want to do is to repaste the cooler.",taking it apart and putting it back together will solve the problem more often than you might believe.,"double check and make sure youre using the proper mounting equipment - using lga1200 mounts on a lga 1700 system might work, but performance wont be ideal.",make sure to test the cooler under power limited conditions before assuming its not working right.,"most non-sff coolers can handle loads of 200w, so test with a 200w power limit.","if youre still experiencing hot temperatures after checking all of the above, then its time to return the cooler or file a rma for repair.","*i am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.",please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/intel) if you have any questions or concerns.,*,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ht for gaming is not really relevant.,don't listen to people saying you need it on for games.,ht is only beneficial for heavy multithreaded applications like benching programs or work programs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah just hyper threading.,its better for gaming is why i took it off,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your not getting the 5.5ghz because when mce is off that also turns off intel adaptive boost technology.,just set that to enabled in bios an dyou will get 5.5 again.,as long as you are under 100c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i turned off the enforce intel limits.,and i was using intel extreme utility tuner./ i put my p-cores to 5.8 it did a very good job at perforance but cores were hot.,i just thought getting an i9 13900k i would have seen it hit 5.8. or does it only go to 5.8 is needed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you should be able to run cinebench multi on 5.5 p cores and 4.3 e cores.,even up to 5.6 p cores and 4.3 e cores.,thatâ€™s all core full load.,temps will get up to 90c to 100c.,youâ€™re at 64c in that screenshot.,this suggests youâ€™re running pl1 and pl2 at stock values 125 and 253. pl1 at 125 and pl2 at 253 will change the boost curve so that you donâ€™t boost to 5.5 on all cores for very long.,maybe about 56 seconds.,itâ€™s hard to explain but if you set your pl1 and pl2 to 300w or even 4096 you should see 5.5 on all p cores more often and it will boost 2 cores to 5.8 briefly but really thatâ€™s a useless boost.,5.5ghz or 5.6 is what you can expect on all p cores.,just set your pl1 and pl2 to 300w or unlimited.,you see this will tell the cpu how good of a cooling solution you have and the cpu will adjust its boost curve to boost more often to the highest speeds.,"if you have a 320mm or 420 aio you can let the cpu boost more, not higher but more and for longer duration.",thatâ€™s what pl1 and pl2 controls.,at stock it thinks it needs to stay under 70c.,"with higher pl1 and pl2 wattage you can cool it and run the cpu closer to 90c which will boost more often and longer at 5.5

you can configure these chips to do a lot including running 2 p cores at 6ghz and 3 at 5.7, and 4 at 5.6, and 8 at 5.5. this means if youâ€™re only using two cores it will run at 6. if youâ€™re using 4 cores it will run at 5.6 and if all 8 p cores are engaged they will run at 5.5. these chips are pretty configurable.",it depends on cooling mostly and silicon lottery second.,but generally you can expect to see 5.5gz on all p cores and 4.3 on all e cores under full load and temps of 90 to 100c.,cool these chips the best you can and set the pl1 and pl2 to get the performance out of the chip.,read more about pl2 and pl1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4600mhz would imply that youâ€™re running ddr4?,and that speed would almost certainly imply that youâ€™re not in gear 1 mode?,which would mean youâ€™re probably getting worse performance than having it at 4000 or so in g1 mode.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you took it off because you have no idea what your doing!!,!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have the same cpu.,it's so powerful that i don't think ht  on or off would made any difference in games.,"as others have said, reset the bios to the defaults and come again.",have a lot of fun with it o/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's not 2012 anymore champ.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sure in some games ht really does better in almost every aspect, but in general you just might get more frames (if youre cpu bottlenecked) in trade of worse % lows.","better keep it on, it wil be much better overall.",if know game performs better with ht off you can disable the threads in task manager,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the amount of people that just say hyper threading is better with no reasoning how (most likely because they just go off what they heard) is absurd, how are people telling someone to change a setting that depends on the user preference?",i'm not going to suffer latency hits because ht can give some small boost in frame rate as if going from 700 average fps in valorant to 720 average or 175 average to 185 average in call of duty or some shit has to mean something to me because people like to know that their frame rate is as high as it physically can be for massive repercussions on their overall performance regarding hitching etc.,"i'd much rather disable ht to disable idle states running at 40 c and getting more fps than i would with ht on, the amount of people that don't know what they're talking about is absurd.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this completely depends on the game and even if the game likes it off, there's usually very little gains.",then there's a lot games that benefit a lot from keeping it on.,just keep it on imo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hyperthreading has been faster for gaming for years now.,this isn't a pentium 4 where it actually slowed things down for games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it literally shows 5.2ghz.,how is it not boosting high?,temperature and power delivery are key factors,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5.8ghz is only when 2 cores are loaded.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i like how you're drip feeding bits of info on what changes you made in the bios, while implying those are the only changes you made.","you've asked a question, people have answered.","just reset the bios, for the love of god, and leave it alone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh really?,thought you would always want ram at the max speed available when buying and yes ddr4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"removing ht will greatly lower temperature, allowing higher all core oc and imc speed.",some games will benefit from that lower latency and tarkov is one of them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
look up on gear 1 and gear 2 on intel systems.,for ddr4 the sweet spot is more around 4000mhz in gear 1 (higher can be achieved if you tweak).,"but in gear 1 the memory controller runs at the same speed as the memory (4000mhz is double data rate, so memory is natively 2000mhz and so is memory controller).",2000mhz is about the max speed for the memory controller without luck/tweaking.,"at 4600mhz in gear 2, the memory controller runs at half speed.",so memory would be 2300mhz and memory controller at 1300mhz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nope.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
damn i have never heard of this i always thought maxing ram speed was a must with higher speed rams.,the more you know.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
question.,1. do you keep hyperthreading on for gaming or general use?,"2. do you use mce, multicore enhancement
3. do you use intel adaptive boost?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
leave hyperthreading on.,"mce on 12th/13th gen only removes pl1/pl2 power limits, which you can also do yourself.","it does not do anything more to multipliers / voltages like it used to do on prior generations, as itâ€™s unneeded.",leave all boost/turbo settings at bios default.,"honestly, nothing needs to be changed.",the only thing you might do is enable tvb / thermal velocity boost if itâ€™s available on your cpu to add a +1 or +2 to all multipliers so long as the cpu is below a certain temperature (i think itâ€™s 65?,).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are worrying way too much.,anything below 80c is super cool and shouldn't be cause of concern.,if it goes above that for extended periods of time it could accelerate long term degradation but it's still unlikely it will have any noticeable effect.,arguably even running at 100c 24/7 might not do anything at reasonable voltages.,"unfortunately evaluating the impact different factors will have on the cpu lifespan is not easy, and what we can do most of the times is just educated guesses.",but we also know that cpus are extremely resilient and basically never die unless abused on purpose (rising the voltage too much for example).,"if you want to know what's the maximum temp the cpu will reach in the worst case scenario, download prime95 and run the smallffts test.","it's basically the heavyest thing you can throw at the cpu, and it will run 10 to 20 degrees hotter than any other workload.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/how-to-use-amd-smart-access-memory-and-nvidia-resizable-bar/?amp

you need a latter generation am4 processor to work with resizable bar, i would upgrade to a 5700x or a 5800x3d to take full advantage of it 

great choice of graphics card btw i'm looking to pair one with my 3700x",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2700x is a decent productivity cpu, and was, in its time, a ""decent"" gaming cpu.",but zen+ is a bottleneck these days.,even zen 2 is a bottleneck these days.,lots of benchmarks from techtube back this up.,"digital foundry, hub, gamers nexus, etc.","even at 4k, if you game at such a res.","zen 3 or intel 10th(ideally, 12th) gen are the minimum starting points you want to be at.",and luckily 5600non-x and 12400f are cheap as dirt lately.,"since you have the x570, just drop a 5600 non-x or 5600x in it.",it'll run circles around the 2700x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"op, listen.",you do not have rebar support.,you need at least a 400 series motherboard and a 5000 series cpu.,you need both to support it in order to utilize it.,just because you enabled it in the bios doesn't mean you have it.,the arc runs like crap without rebar.,"therefore, unless you plan on upgrading the cpu (which you should do anyway, because a 2700x is, what, 5 years old and missing relevant technology), then do not buy the arc.","intel ceo even said that if you dont have rebar, don't buy it.",go with a 3060ti instead.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is it for gaming or office ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have my 2700x working with rebar currently despite thoughts that it may be too old for some boards.,i am thinking in my case it will run due to the fact that it is enabled and seems to be functioning.,i checked this with gpu-z to make sure.,"though i will certainly agree a newer processor wouldn't hurt, particularly to get pcie 4.0 vs 3.0 https://imgur.com/a/cdqr1ej",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
problem is i have no money for a new cpu atm or i certainly would.,i just moved across the country and my motherboard and rx580 gpu both took a shit in shipping.,"new parts were not in the budget by any means, but i had to drop $220 on the new board already \*cries\*.",i was watching some benchmarks comparing the 2700x and 5600x and it seems once you went up to 1440p/4k that the differences closed in fps as the gpu took over the heavy lifting.,this doesn't of course address frame stability or whatever unfortunately which i am sure would also be much better on a new cpu.,"there certainly was a noticeable gap at 1080p with the card they were using for the comparisons, no doubt about that.",i won't need to go above 60fps on the tv i am using (fresh is 60hz) so i figure so long as it works at 30 to 60fps on anything i toss at it i would be happy for now.,"getting a better cpu would be next on my list when i can though i totally agree, hell... if even to get pcie 4.0 vs the 3.0 i am stuck with atm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"why would windows and gpu-z show it, and why would my motherboard (an x570) allow it to be enabled if my processor doesn't support it.",i have found upon further research that other people in other posts show improvements on frame rates with processors that supposedly are not supported.,they showed screen shots.,it seems like the processors were only software locked.,"i am open to the idea that even with it enabled (and everything in my system settings and gpu properties showing its on) that the processor will still handle the job too slowly to function properly, but by all reports it seems to be on according to windows and bios.",they just added the 3000 series of processors after a driver update so i would think its entirely possible that its functioning.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is kind of my all in one machine.,i do use it for office stuff when i am actively running my (sorta) business.,"mostly sales on social media, printing, shipping, payments, etc.","but it lives in my bedroom and i use it for all my entertainment as well like movies, music, gaming, graphic design (which is business as well as pleasure).",i would also use it for any work from home jobs that might come my way as well.,"the only other computer i have is a shitty half working dell laptop from 13 to 15 years ago, so i tend to want this pc to work and work well for all my needs for a few years at a time.",i used my last setup for about 8 and a half years before i built this one 3 years ago.,i love getting mileage from decent budget builds :) i am super impressed at how good the rx980 gpu i had was and how long it has lasted me.,i was only just starting to hit acceptable to me limitations but thought i had at least a few more years to squeeze out of it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there have been issues with arc control showing rebar as being disabled even though gpu-z, aida64, windows device manager and other software list it as enabled.",it seems to just be a cosmetic problem that needs to be fixed.,https://www.reddit.com/r/intelarc/comments/zsepcv/rebar_issue_gpuz_vs_intel_arc_software/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's not right.,having it enabled doesn't mean anything if the software won't take advantage of it (for many reasons).,"for example, you can enable rebar and get all the indicators that it's enabled on amd rx 5000 gpus yet gain no performance since the driver doesn't support it.","refer to the [official intel statement](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000091128/graphics.html), not your intuition or random people on reddit.","if it worked, they would probably list it there.","if you want to verify it yourself, use your current rig to run a game that has measurable (>10% fps) gains from sam - eg.",forza horizon 4/5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"while you may have it enabled in your bios, that doesn't mean you have it.",your processor doesn't support it.,"therefore, you don't have it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"let me guess, broke/fell out of the pcie slot?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2700x are bidding above 100 on ebay.,a 5600 is $130.,you got 30 bucks laying around?,the difference is huge at 4k and 1440p.,"ignore avg fps charts and look at frame time graphs, stutter, 1% lows.","i game at 4k60 and saw a huge, huge improvement in smoothness going from a 3800x to a 5600x.","even in cases where fps is locked at 60, frame pacing issues were fixed.",">  i have no money

if true you shouldn't even be here.","sell what you have, focus on survival, and buy back in when you have spare cash to pull trigger on hardware buys.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the lookout!,i could see that throwing me for a major loop.,i will have to run some benchmarks and see how well its running compared to others with slightly newer processors.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i have a 6500xt atm i could probably do a test on something like forza like you mention.,that and/or maybe some kind of benchmark utility.,"i can also try tossing in a ryzen 5 5600x, that i have very temporary access to, and see if there is some night and day change at 1440p/4k with the arc card vs my 2700x.",if rebar isn't actually functioning/providing any benefit with my 2700x cpu it should hopefully be clear by the vast difference in fps since there seems to be little to no difference in fps improvements at these higher resolutions based on the cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
people are reporting it as working for them in getting higher frame rates even with processors such as mine (i have found upon further research).,it seems like it is indeed functioning.,"while i can't be certain the older processors are actually efficient in doing it, or it technically works but with little to no improvements due to some form of slow emulation is another story.",i have a 5600x on very temporary loan that i may try after running some benchmarks with the 2700x and see if they don't seem to meet what others are experiencing.,at least with 2k to 4k resolutions where the processor power matters less and its all about the gpu.,"or as another user suggested, to turn it on and off with my current card to see if it changes anything for the better as is.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hehe worse on some level!,"it looks totally fine... but trying out a new power supply, processor, ram, and even a new video card on the board wasn't working.",could get no post screen at all.,"and when i put a new video card in the old board, it acted like it wasn't even plugged in (beep error codes).",tried everything 5 times.,"i finally bought and tried a new board, and it shot to life, but my original video card was throwing scrambling purple and green lines down the screen like an old dirty nintendo (even in post/bios screens).",new temp card worked flawlessly.,"i tried cleaning its contacts properly in case it was somehow dirty and such, but no dice.","the reason i say ""almost worst"" is because of how frustrating it was to trouble shoot everything else but the main board, the waiting and wondering aspect.",if it had just broke/fell at least i could have taken care of everything much faster.,i now know to take my shit apart and wrap it up individually if i am going to ship something like that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my pc was damaged in shipping from a cross country move.,my main board and the gpu both.,"so here i am... i spent $200 something already on the board, and don't want to waste more than half the cost of a decent gpu that can carry me into the future with a crappy card.",my computer is an essential item to have running at least semi decently (even if gaming technically isn't).,"i just wasn't expecting to have to replace a mb and a gpu randomly but they needed it or else, no computer...

i am not disagreeing with you that stutters and performance will improve with a better cpu, just that i don't really have more money or time to sell mine and not have a functioning machine while i wait for the other.",but if i can sell my 2700x on ebay for $100 that will make holding onto a 5600x a lot easier.,though on amazon i see them for more like $165 after tax.,!,[gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grin),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

although undervolting is generally a good practice you might not need to do it if you have a good cooler.,"try running benchmark app like cinebench r23, and monitor your temperatures.","if your cpu does not get throttled you will be fine, if your temps goes above 90c during cinebench you might wanna consider undervolting to keep it down.","but if you mainly use the pc for gaming then you have nothing to worry about, since gaming put much less stress on your cpu than cinebench.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1.4v is normal for stock voltage.,they're all set that way because of the disparity in the quality of cpu's.,"some are good and don't need that much voltage, some aren't and need that much voltage.",that's the silicon lottery.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1.3-1.4 is normal for gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a x73 kraken which i assume is a good cooler.,"and yeah i only really game, browse reddit, watch youtube etc... the most stress ill put on my pc will come from gaming",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so its nothing to be bothered by if the intended use is to just play games?,i really dont want to ruint the cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"let me just give you an example on how undervolting help on lower-end coolers:

this screenshot shows my 13600k at default bios settings with just xmp enabled, running cinebench r23 for 37secs:

[https://imgur.com/a/bhm3zo0](https://imgur.com/a/bhm3zo0)  


this screenshot shows cinebench r23 running for 5mins + with just bios tweaks and slight overclock, which wouldn't be possible with my cooler without undervolting.","[https://imgur.com/a/7wqbot1](https://imgur.com/a/7wqbot1)

&#x200b;

imo, it is beneficial even if you have a high-end cooler, it helps keeping your cpu cooler and cost nothing.",a cooler cpu also means a lower fan noise.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no it won't damage it at stock settings as long as your cooling solution is sufficient.,if you start seeing high temperatures you might want to read up on undervolting and setting a power limit.,"it's intimidating for first timers, but really isn't difficult to do.","gaming is only gonna use a fraction of the cpu's capabilities anyway, so if that's all you're doing you probably won't see high temps anyway.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks for your help, do you know if there is an easy way to undervolt?",as far as i know it takes quite some time and a lot of experimenting to get it right in terms of stability and what not?,i have an msi mobo.,when i monitor the core voltage on cpu-z it sits between 1.38-to 1.398 when im gaming and the temps are at 57-60c.. unless its harmful i think im just gonna keep things as is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i decided to try the limit modes in bios.,mode 5 dropped my core voltage from 1.395 ish to 1.330 ish and it ran just as good as on stock settings in game (world of warcraft) so i think ill stick with that for the time being!,"temperature wise i also dropped 1-3 degrees, im guessing 57- 62 celsius while gaming is fine",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you have an msi motherboard, the easiest way to undervolt is to change your cpu lite load (under the bios, oc, advance cpu configuration).",just changing from auto to mode 5 will produce very good results.,"you can go lower but may not be stable because each silicon is different and your mileage may vary, if you want some guidelines on cpu lite load modes for 13700k, watch this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_oz4is-nti4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oz4is-nti4)

generally speaking, your motherboard will automatically throttle your cpu before any harm can be done so technically you will be fine with or without these tweaks.","but like i said, run cinebench r23 and monitor your thermals, if it gets to 100c then by all means, tweak your bios.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes it's perfectly fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks once again for helping me out!,i have been tweaking with it for while now and found that mode 5 seems to run well for me!,and the core voltage sits at about 1.334 (in game) which feels like a pretty significant improvement,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes that cpu cooler will be fine.,don't go any lower imo unless you plan on setting power limits.,the 13900k is a beast and is very difficult to keep cool.,just make sure you have good case ventilation and you should be g2g.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have the icue 150i elite capellix with my 13900k.,the cooler works great.,however i will say i needed to get a contact frame since it wasnt making good contact with the cpu.,but after getting the contact frame it works just fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"why here you go my good man

https://youtu.be/8dqbg7qhqmk


also yes.",that capellix is amazing with the 13900k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i cool my 13900k with a noctua d15 air cooler.,"gaming temps around 60-70degrees and idle 35-40.

i have mce turned off and power limit 2 set to 253w

i also undervolted 0.06 to get better performance and lower temps.",default settings in bios will cause 13900k to draw up to 300w with default overclock settings and high default voltage and no cooler can deal with that heat.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so 150 is just fine?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends what mother board you have thon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have the same h150i elite capellix, i installed the contact frame for 13900k and had zero benefits of it.","reinstalled it few times, changed paste and didnt get any thermal improvements.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sweet, thank you",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no it doesnâ€™t.,the ilm comes standard on all motherboards except maybe evga,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i personally had a 5-10c improvement on intel stock limits.,whatever your issue was then it wasnâ€™t a contact one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it doesnâ€™t come with a bracket in the cooler box?,if not then do you have a recommendation of the bracket i need to mount the aio to the cpu on the motherboard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"with stock settings, 253 watts, 400amps plus undervolting, i still reach 95c in cinebench 23 and gaming 60c.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s not the cooler thatâ€™s the issue itâ€™s the ilm ( internal locking mechanism for the cpu) that causes the issue.,it causes bending on the cpu causing the cooler to not make good contact.,hence why you should look into getting the contact frame,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well thats normal... have you made sure your pump is on extreme profile and maybe tune your fans a little more aggressive?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the only catch is older 600 series boards require a bios and me update to even boot 13th gen. and most b660 boards in particular lack bios flashback (all msi, most asus) and would require the installation of a 12th gen cpu to flash.",a 700 series board would not have that concern.,otherwise thereâ€™s no generational feature difference between chipsets.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i commend your ability to hold off on hardware upgrades but i couldnâ€™t wait that long.,iâ€™m sure it works fine but even a budget cpu like the i3-12100 would run circles around it.,move up to the next level i5-12400 or 12600 and youâ€™ll really be in for a treat.,an amd 5600 is also a great budget choice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"so i got about a year ago optiplex 7020 sff with i5 4690 for about  $200 just for home use....not even gaming... just browsing....i had another pc that died, and i had from that an nvidia t400 video card (that card was used for monitors because i7 in that pc did not have built in graphics)... i plopped that in and i could easily have 2 monitos and don't worry about anything since t400 is overkill..... the system had ssd and all was good.","boot times literally 5 seconds... watching 4k youtube no problem... more then enough for me.... recently i was like... maybe i should try csgo....ok got it playing....everything ok not stellar frame rates, but enjoyable.....also decided to play gta5 in story mode again...and also tomb raider trilogy..... ok cs go runs fine.... maybe gta 5 will be ok?",tried gta 5...runs ok but wanted highter settings on 1080.... i see nvidia t600 for 200 bucks on sale....... it is 4 gb vram and its ddr6 and the only gpu i can plop inside the small chassie..... wow gta 5 runs very well on very high settings in story mode.... first 2 tomb raider also run nice and very playble... shadow of the tomb rader i did not measure but visually on high preset about 40 fps... playable....wow!,"then after all of this tinkering, i started to think.. what more i can do for it..... ok i have 16 gb ram.....bought for 20 buck 16 more... now i have 32 gb...... idk did not feel that much difference, but it is nice to have i guess... now i see 50 buck and i can get used i7.... why not?","i think.... maybe i will have more frames in csgo it could be nice.... also some other aspects might run better...

now i am mostly just trying to squeez as much possble from this small and old pc...which is very interesting for me.","also relatively cheap

i'm curious why the t600 was the only option for you.,"do you have a limitation like a lack of pci 6 or 8 pin power, did you need quadro enhancements,  or did you just need a half height card?",i also think you could get much more performance at half height with an rx 6400 at the size.,are you buying parts outside the us?,"i believe the price you provided for the 4790 is great, but you may also need to beef up your cooling.",i'm interested to hear back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
unfortunately the pci port location on 7020 ssf is right next to the power supply and the only card that fits is single slot card.,"i know that there are more single slot optionts and potentially better but t600 was readily available from the shelf of a near by computer store, and other options were hard to get or wait very long time.",so it was sort of no brainer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if there's any problem with your gpu then it's a huge pain in the ass to troubleshoot without integrated graphics on your cpu unless you happen to be one of the people who have spare gpu's sitting around.,i really dislike it when people recommend new builders cpu's without integrated graphics.,it can be the difference between them continuing with the hobby or saying screw it and buying prebuilt in the future.,"regardless, either way i prefer to have a cpu with integrated graphics.",it doesn't cost that much more (if anything) and if nothing else it lets you use your computer if your gpu dies and you don't have a spare.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no before i had a i5-8400 and yes i could buy a 12/13400f but some of my friends said that i should buy some with an graphic unit, if the gpu has a problem i can run it in the cpu and the motherboards for an lga1700 are much expensive as one for an lga1200.","i could bought an 11400 but i wanted to have a bit more power, and i have to buy a new motherboard, not only for the chip if i upgrade again, because i have ddr4 ram and if i buy a new gen chip, i will be ddr5 ram",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12400f and 11600k are so close to each other it is about whose benchmark results you are watching.,"20% ""ipc"" mainly shows in cinebench, but not as much in gaming.","12400f has crippled clockspeed, but nice amount of cache (50% more l3 ?","), that is why it sometimes wins and sometimes loses in gaming benchmarks depending mainly on game used and testers ram choice.","many reviewers went with ddr5, most users with ddr4.",5600x isn't much of a different story either... there is no x destroys y here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this was poorly informed and you should do your own research not just listen to mates,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel chips all still supports ddr4, it's not necessary to use ddr5 and you only lose some few percent of performance by not using ddr5.",it's 14th gen chips that will be ddr5 only.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your friends gave you poor advices here.,the benefits of having the gpu in the cpu is absolutely negated and destroyed by the performance difference you gave up.,besides you can get a 20$ gpu if and when you need.,which in my experience is extremely rare for 99% of people.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not disabling the e-cores makes ac odyssey stutter very badly.,the two vulkan games that i tested do use all the p-cores and e-cores available.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most games donâ€™t make use of tons of cores so youâ€™re often going to see low utilization on e cores and the p coresâ€™ extra thread.,"in your image in every odd even pairing of p cores one of the 2 is being used much more heavily than the other, thatâ€™s showing that hyperthreading isnâ€™t helping you very much.",itâ€™s very common for games to cpu bottleneck without even one core showing 100% usage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

first thing you should understand is there is no guaranteed sweet spot for any cpu.,"for chiplet based ryzen you need to find where the infinity fabric clock (fclk) maxes out, and that varies chip to chip because of silicon lottery and different ram setups such as, 4 sticks, single/dual/quad rank, more capacity, type of ic, motherboard topology, bios' ram support.","some ryzen 5000 cpus' can do 3733mhz, some can do 3800 or 3900 or even 4000mhz in 1:1:1 (mclk:uclk:fclk) mode.","monolithic ryzen, like the 5600**g** and 5700**g**, can clock much higher since it's a unified die, i've seen plenty of overclockers get over 4500mhz.","on intel, since 11th gen, there are gear modes which is similar to ryzen's fclk.","gear 1 means the memory controller is running 1:1 with the ram frequency; gear 2 means the memory controller is running at half the speed of the ram, and ruins latency.","the faster the memory controller is running, the quicker the cpu cores are being fed data.","on the 3200mhz rated ddr4 controllers on 11th, 12th, 13th gen you can usually expect between 3900-4200mhz to be the max range in gear 1. again depends on silicon lottery and the ram setup because you can have a heavier load on the memory controller with more ranks, sticks etc.","non k versions of 12th and 13th gen cpus have system agent voltage locked which means getting over 3600mhz in gear 1 is very unlikely, even 3600 is unlikely.","if you switch to gear 2 you can get over 4000mhz easily on the k variants, but you'd be sacrificing latency for bandwidth

it's not always more mhz = more performance.",timings are very important.,"you can have over 70,000mb/s bandwidth but if the timings suck then the latency is going to kill the gaming performing

his video is almost completely wrong.,"higher speeds do scale, but the problem with their test methodology is that they didn't set the subtimings and tertiary timings.",as the ram speed gets higher the auto timings (which aren't set be xmp or expo) get looser in tandem.,in effect all that changes is the latency from the memory controller in practice.,"basically higher speeds do matter, but you need to tighten your sub and tertiary timings to get any actual meaningful difference.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

7700 holds up pretty alright.,turn down a few cpu intensive settings in todays games and youâ€™re good.,i had the non k version before i upgraded.,"and although some games did stutter like battlefield 2042, turning the settings down got rid of them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
youâ€™ve misheard me - overheating isnâ€™t the issue.,"itâ€™s that an old cpu with a new gpu frequently results in heavy cpu bottlenecks (where the gpu is capable of *drawing* more frames than the cpu can *calculate*), heavily limiting performance.","in addition, nvidiaâ€™s gpu drivers are too bloated (â€œoverheadâ€) for modern games, and it makes this problem worse: https://youtu.be/jleijhunaw8

(for your case, iâ€™d be interested in the i3-10100 data - itâ€™s basically an i7-7700k in most respects.","notably, the rtx 3070 is supposed to be 35% faster than the rx 5700 xt, but in most cases comes out the same or even slower with this cpu.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh, forgive me!","yes, i've misread that!",i appreciate the info!,will do some research about that!,a platform upgrade is not possible atm.,"i'd need to make do with what i have + a few upgrades on ram, gpu and ssd.","if i'd go with a platform upgrade, then there's no video editing, because i couldn't afford video equipment --> gettting a new camera with 4k 10 bit 4:2:2 that eats most of my spare money.",i would be ok with some bottlenecking.,"if i cannot run a 3070 ti at it's full potential, it's still an upgrade from a 1070 ti as i understand it.","i can edit 4k material, which is not possible with my current setup.",how much worse would the decrease in performance be?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"at 1440p itâ€™s manageable, but using an rtx 3070 you can still expect to lose ~3-15% gaming performance with a 7700k/10100 compared to a ryzen 5 5600x, depending on the game and settings.","there isnâ€™t much test data out there for specific configs, sadly.",hereâ€™s a funny idea - playing at 4k is probably comparatively the best option.,"you should still get ~50-60 fps at ultra settings in modern games with a 3070, and itâ€™ll shrink the impact of the cpu bottleneck, as well as allowing you to see the content youâ€™re editing at its native resolution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3-15% would be ok for me.,"here's a complete overview what i run (for the sake of completion:

*msi z270 gaming m3*  
*intel i7 7700k (no oc)*  
*msi geforce 1070ti (1440p monitor)*  
*2x8gb ddr4 ram 3000 corsair vengeance dimm lpx cl15 288pin (no oc --> 2133mhz)*  
*ssd + hdd*  
*win 10 home*

my 1070ti is quite slow when it comes to it's decoding capabilities.","i have worked a lot with 4k30/60 cellphone footage, and because of its h.264 codec, this is not editable (without proxies, etc..).",and proxies i'd need to render.,and also convert the resolution.,with the new camera --> in h.265 this might get worse.,might take longer to transcode.there's my motivation for a stronger gpu.and the ram will help with effects --> 32gb is a minimum recommendation.,for that --> davinci resolve is a gpu heavy programm.,a 3060 with 12gb vram works great in higher resolutions.,"but i have no idea if the 3070ti could compensate with it's speed...that's where i'm at...

i have an aoc something... monitor with a native 2k 1440p resolution.","in some games i've seen the uhd resolution.when i'd choose that, will the game be calculated in 4k, but only shown in my native reso?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s correct.,"upsampling beyond native is never worth it, imo - you just donâ€™t get enough of a benefit to image quality to justify the massive loss of frames.","also, enable xmp, my guy.",itâ€™s an overclock in name only - any ram that comes out of the factory rated for a certain speed is *designed* to run at it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i hesitated to run my ram with xmp, since i read somewhere the lifespan gets diminished...might be mumbojumbo...

my mobo should support up to 3600 (oc) like stated on msi's hp.",would you say i could run two 32gb dimms in my system?,it is a dual channel board.,"and the comment from that other guy, could make sense --> the qvl doesn't state that support because 32gb bars weren't a thing back then.","still the comments on the compatibility of kabylake and 32gb bars goes into both directions...  
some say it's impossible.",others state it should work without any problems.,and a third party says it's a hit and miss...and when i inquire about more infos i only get silence.,what's your opinion?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i donâ€™t see any reason why it shouldnâ€™t, but iâ€™m not sure.",the comments about diminished lifespan are just wrong - that only happens with *unsafe* overclocks.,xmp is essentially just stock operation - all ram modules are extensively tested for it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
reasons could be that the memory controllers were only designed for 16gb each.,"or that the newer 32gb bars have some protocol communication issues...chipset differences...

....yeah, i don't know either ;)!",but thanks for the input!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ha.,"i also had some arctic silver 5 from an i7-920 build i did in 2009. 

ended up using it with the new 13700k and temps are great",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s the lowest temp iâ€™ve heard someone say from running cinebench,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you using a contact frame or just the normal mounting system?,what motherboard are you using?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
go on amazon and search thermalright or thermal grizzly contact plate and then get some decent thermal paste to go with it (not the stuff that comes with the contact plate).,the thermalright one i believe is cheaper and better.,"it will say 12th gen but it's the same socket so works fine with 13th gen.

i recommend artic mx-6 paste.",my max temps dropped roughly 10c idle and underload.,you'll want to watch the gamers nexus video on how to properly install the contact plate.,"it's extremely easy, but there's a specific technique for tightening the screws which you need to follow.",https://youtu.be/iyu1oskby-q,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hard to tell yet but i keep my temps reasonably fine.,in games i got up to 70 c mostly hoovering around 60-65.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
noctua nh-d15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is this with oc?,my build is around 60c to 64c with enabled aioc boosting to 5.6ghz to 5.8ghz (idle),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have 37 idle with an arctic liquid freezer ii 360mm aio which is confusing me because i would think it would be cooler.,"corsair 5000d airflow case with rad in front with pull through intake and one exhaust on the back (top exhaust fan doa), but 37c in the bios menu and the case totally open with radiator running is confusing the hell out of me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"depending on game, spikes of high 70's, but averaging in 60's.",other games 40-50's,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"agree, had a shit case before.",changed to h7 flow from nzxt since and it only hit 91c for a second in cinebench.,i have cheap 140mm fans though.,will have to try prime 95.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"same temp spikes, it'll be fine idle or doing something, then it will spike and go back to what it was fairly frequently...i even took off the puml and re pasted to see if it was a contact or paste problem and it looked fine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm not sure.,seeing this kind of spike occasionally on my end as well.,average temps are the most important.,are you running any background programs?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am using a ml 360 r that is 2 1/2 years old and had to buy the lga 1700 bracket for it.,gaming temps are around 55 to 70ish with spikes into the high 70s at times.,the 13700k definitely runs alot hotter than my 9700k.,i will look for a new aio in january most likely,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"undervolting can, while simultaneously (and ironically) increasing cinebench scores due to not hitting the thermal throttler.",try it.,"for reference:

used throttlestop due to evga bios bug preventing adaptive vcore adjustment

adaptive cpu core & cpu cache: -125mv

idle: 25â° (15â° today though - it's freezing)

cinebench r23: 85â° @ ~30700 points

with air cooling (thermalright pa120)

stock everything else",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, are we talking i cinebench r23?",because in multicore i get almost instant 100â°c (stock) with a dark rock pro 4. and also thermal throttling.,my score is a bit lower than what i've read so far (around 29000).,"already tried repasting, same results.","i've read that this is ""normal"", just not sure how well i'm off here.",coming from amd 3700x these temps are a bit scary.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"keep in mind it's a single run, im sure 10 minute run i'd reach 90+c, i dialed down the voltage which helps reduce temps as well",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with the rock pro 4?,"then i must have botched the thermal paste, cause under load (in modern warfare 2 (also a bit oc)), i spike into the 90's.","but i am usually around 75-80  


after and hour idle, core temperatures is averate 40c",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank god.,i haven't received my 13700 yet but i'm building a new pc and managed to get a d15 for nearly half-off.,i've been using a 212-evo on an 8700k forever so it's a relief that the 13700 can be reasonably air-cooled.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you think a contact frame would make any difference in temperatures?,"i have 30â° in idle and about 45â° in normal gaming, but heard that those frames can make a big difference.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just a small oc to 5.4ghz on p cores and 4.4ghz on e cores.,the idle temp you have is just a bit too high even with an overclock should be no more than 40 degrees at worst.,"double check you cooler, is it an aio liquid cooler?","also, in bios i would not use ai overclocking as that tends to push way to much on the vcore voltage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i get the same temps.,and i also have 60 idle with a custom water loop,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"lmao, make improvements to not throttle, find software to attempt throttle",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
interesting.,it seems the 13th gen intel runs hotter.,"no background apps, and avg temp 60-65 c in mw2.",my vertical gpu mount for 4080 and o11d mini case could be contributing too to the heat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have the h170i and it keeps it at 90c during a cinebench 30 min run, only prime95 can make it hit 100c after 5 min   


55x p-cores, 42x e-cores",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i might look into that.,but now i just power limited it to 125w.,lost like 3000 points in cinebench and it sips half the power.,worth it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea itâ€™s unfortunate cpus are taking on more power.,"but competition is hot now & i donâ€™t see cpu companies using less power, only power efficient with newer models",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yea r23, and r20",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just so you know, i also have the 13700k at stock speed with the dark rock pro 4, and i'm also getting instant 100â°c, and i'm also getting just above 29000 in r23.","i came here searching for confirmation that this is normal, and the more i look, the more that looks correct.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i recently upgraded to an i7 13700k and i am in the same boat as you.,i am using a corsair 280mm aio in the nzxt h510 flow and the second i load up cinebench r23 (multicore) the chip skyrockets to 100c.,the intel xtu software says its immediately thermal throttling.,i have tried repasting and reseating the cooler to be sure but i still get the same results.,have you done any more experimenting?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that makes a lot more sense now ;)

i now undervolted as well, -130mv and now i achieve temps in the 90s w/o throttling (10min run).",single run maxes out at 84â°,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just put in a dark rock pro on mine and i didn't care for it at all - my last cooler was a noctua and theirs has much better (and easier) mounting system.,"i'm at 41 basically at idle (this web browser, steam, and music bee)

one thing i noticed with the dark rock was that even once i screwed it all the way in, the fan was still sliding around a bit, it's mechanism is absolutely garbage.","i dread taking this thing apart again, but i think i might order a black noctua and return the dark rock before the return period is up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
noctua nd h15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just make sure you screw the heatsink all the way in.,at first i was too gentle and had high temps.,then i screwd it all the way in and temps were fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean with those temps it's imho pointless ... at best you will see 1-2 c difference.,your temps are great and it means the cpu got good contact,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13th gen indeed runs hotter.,tried a few different coolers so far my deepcool ak620 is the best.,spikes to 88 at the worst,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i ended up downvolting by -0,13v and now it stays in the 90s w/o thermal throttling, i can live with that (better score and less power consumption).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yep, i undervolted by -0,13v and now it stays in the 90s w/o throttling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think with spring you always screw until contact( end ) without applying torque on it since spring wont unscrew by it self.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
one time i screwed my cpu cooler too tight & it affected the ram,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is the ak620 noisy?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
does your cinebench score improve or decrease?,i have heard different things about undervolting and the effects it has on performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you undervolt through the bios or xtu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can you explain how it affected your ram?,i think i have some kind of ram issue... from time to time i can't boot my pc and need to touch gently ram (like trying to push it in) and then my pc boots alright.,can it be because i screwd heatsink to tight?,i don't think heatsink touches the ram tho...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"under heavy loads, the fans do get a bit noisy.",if you play with headphones though i doubt you'll notice it.,"if you do pick one up, make sure you take extreme care when mounting.",if anything is crooked even slightly it won't cool very well.,if everything is lined up though it does a fantastic job.,i never break 80 celsius.,mostly stay between 40 and 70 while gaming.,with jumps into the upper 70s.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also just to add.,"under normal gaming session, as long as you aren't pushing your pc to it's limits, the cooler is very quiet.",it only gets loud if you are doing something extremely intense like a benchmark or some seriously demanding games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it increased since there was no more thermal throttling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bios since i have dual os on my machine and wanted it for both,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for me my system was able to boot, but the ram wasnâ€™t able to do dual channel mode.",searched the internet for answers & concluded it was because cpu cooler was strewed too tight,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">noctua nh-d15

that's great.",what are your idle and ambient temps?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok iâ€™ll have a look!,thanks for that!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ambient is usually 70 degrees fahrenheit/ 21 degree celsius.,idle temps usually float around 35 to 40 celsius.,with jumps occasionally in the 50s.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice temps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>why would the bios use more voltage than during a stress test?,because of vdroop,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
completely normal vcore.... the only time i would worry is if it was over 1.35,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"set it manual to 1,17 will be more than enough for default clocks, llc on 4 or 5",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to add to this answer vdroop needs to be designed in as sudden changes in load can cause voltage spikes or dips.,with vdroop when set correctly the voltage does not drop significantly lower than what is stable under heavy load changes.,nor does it suddenly go overly high with sudden drop in load.,you want the voltage not to drop below steady state voltage when sudden load is added.,without vdroop the voltage can spike downward below what is stable for cpu.,vdroop is controlled by loadline setting in bios on motherboards that support user voltage settings.,on asus motherboards a setting of 4 is recommended for overclocking but can range from 2-4 depending on other settings.,i have mine set to 2 & i am mildly overclocking.,it is stable there however.,if i wanted to overclock some more i would raise it to 3. i would not go over 4 on loadline settings as power usage becomes excessive & changing other settings to bring it back down will cause stability problems even if you manage to get same voltage under steady state load as voltage will temporarily drop below what is stable.,this can happen especially if you move the mouse when under heavy load.,it doesn't take long to freeze or crash a computer under these conditions.,on asus motherboards lower loadline settings result in greater vdroop.,"lower loadline settings will result in greater difference between idle & full load voltages, this is desirable within reason which is why i don't recommend settings outside of those in the 2-4 range.",ideally you want voltage to drop to steady state load voltage under load without going under steady state voltage & when load is removed it goes up to steady state idle voltage without going over.,loadline settings in this range can accomplish that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can b660 boards set a manual vcore?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">asus rog b660i

it should, look for voltage settings in the bios.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i am confused what they mean anymore when they say you need a z-series motherboard to overclock when you can set the most important settings on b660... not complaining, other than it is confusing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
undervolting is not overclocking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"windows 10 pro
i installed latest killer performance suite.",driver version dates to 23-nov-22 version 22.190.0.4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"awww :(

in my past experience with killer, the driver often came bundled with software that touted itself as ""game boosting"" or ""lag reducing,"" and that was nothing more than a fancy way of saying qos or quality of service.","the killer networks control panel would have settings to play with, and disable, to fix the lower than expected speeds.","in the past i also remember software like amd quick stream getting installed onto pcs at the factory, and that was prone to slowing down the network for that pc, too.",but that is for some really old amd processors.,not likely that you have this installed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80mbps is suspiciously like 2.4ghz wi-fi performance.,open command prompt and type \`netsh wlan show interfaces\` and see what wi-fi band your laptop is joining.,"if it's 2.4ghz, go to your device manager, and change the killer network adapter to prefer 5ghz or 6ghz.","that is usually present on many dual band cards, especially ones from intel.",the same command will also allow you to see the real time link speeds for the card if you're curious.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

great.,what does your pc report as the tx and rx link speed when you run that command while downloading something?,the rx rate should be at least double of what you're trying to accomplish.,what's the model of your pc?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">â£400 for a z690i gaming wi-fi itx motherboard and it becomes inoperable due to outdated me firmware

you probably bought a really old z690 with old firmware.",from my understanding the latest models of the same motherboard get newer firmware from the factory itself right?.,(or should atleast),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sorry, iâ€™m not familiar with msi boards.",but people have responded in this thread that msi doesnâ€™t have the same intel management engine out of date drivers that asus boards have.,create a post in the intel reddit thread requesting assistance; iâ€™m sure youâ€™re not the only one w/this issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i've had this happen on new in box dell laptops.,"smart on the ssd wasn't reporting any problems, but intel optane would throw that warning.",you might want to try checking for chipset / intel rst / intel optane driver updates for your machine.,that's how i got the message to stop appearing on those dells.,"if it matters any, i'm pretty sure the ""buggy"" driver came from windows update.",getting the latest from dell stopped the messages.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i do that, and when i navigate to the intel optane memory tab, it says ""there are no valid disk pairs in your system.""","i am inclined to believe this is some sort of bug, where the software is telling me there is an error with my optane storage, when in reality i do not even have optane storage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no - from a former intel engineer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on the code stamped on the chip.,if you have access to the internal database ;-) you might be able to find out more about the spec of the processor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i suppose the m2 adapter would work if youâ€™re trying to use the cpu ssd lanes (those still work?,"), but on most boards you could also just use another pcie slot and get 4.0 x4 connected to chipset.","crappy speed, yeah, but thatâ€™s gonna be a given anyways.","still, because of this and other differences there is zero reason to want to buy a 12th gen es.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
reason?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
es has bugs left in the design that do funky things.they go out to help oem vendors qualify stuff.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they may be buggy and often features are intentionally disabled by intel on these chips.,it is just not a good idea.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the qs ones ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i actually think this is a modern take of es cpus.,with 12th gen intel intentionally broke them by disabling the x16 slot.,"back in the day though, es chips weren't that bad.","you had early versions with real flaws, then the later revisions were actually pretty usable.",qs chips are what are sent to reviewers and the like so they are the final retail chips just not meant for sale.,those are legitimately good to buy if you see them for sale.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

e cores are lower clocked and take the entire average down,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
use hwinfo for example.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"task manager takes an average from all your cores, including e-cores.","e-cores run at a much lower speed, so they bring down the reported speed in task manager.","if you want to see what your cpu is actually running at, grab a tool like hwinfo64 and look at your p-core frequencies alone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what benchmark/programm are u using?,maby avx is the reason?,if a programm is using avx the boost is lower.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
use hwinfo64 to check; task manager is notoriously inaccurate and may simply be averaging your -p and -e core frequencies under a full load like this.,"if your cooling is adequate and you're not being power limited, you may see a more reasonable \~4.5ghz for the -p cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dont trust task manager.,hwinfo will do better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yo howd you get the windows 11 task manager?,"it doesnt seem to update for me...

oh and use hwinfo (idk the proper capitalization), bcuz its more accurate and sometimes task manager just adds up the loads of other frequency to show a >90% load...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"actual all p core turbo boost for the 12700f is actually 4.5 ghz according to some googling, so it's going down to 4.27 ghz either due to:-

1. power limit throttling - it's respecting the pl1/pl2 short and long term power limits.",2. thermal throttling - the cpu is not being cooled well enough.,"either way, task manager is a poor way to see hybrid architecture core clocks, it will show the average of p+e core clocks.",gotta use hwinfo for a more accurate picture.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this.,"also, your cpu will boost when you need it.",most likely you won't notice it when at idle just checking task manager.,my cpu is overclocked to 5.1ghz but usually reads high 4.9s or 5 in task manager.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was just installing a game,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"screenshot shows 100% utilization,  so op should be running at full speed.",it's the e-cores dragging down average speed most likely.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
check the boost speed with p95 (prime95) or cinebench.,"if the boost speed is normal in these tests, then it was due to avx, for example, although i can only think of a handful of games that use avx!",^^,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ahhh you are correct.,i didn't notice.,"question for ya then, how come my cpu runs up to 5.1ghz when the e cores are only set to 3.9ghz and p cores are the only ones set to 5.1?",wouldn't my e cores drag my system down too?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why did you upgrade from 5700x?,to a 13400f?,that is a side-grade lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe do some research before buying stuff?,it's not hard.,like at all.,just watch some youtube reviews and benchmarks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i thought that any 13th gen intel processor would be better than a am4 processor, but the benchmarks seem to show the 13400f is about the same as the 5700x.","i did hear the 13400f is better for workstation tasks and i do plan on streaming, doing video editing, recording videos, and maybe making games.",playing games is my main reason to use my pc though as well as browsing.,is the improvement in these tasks worth it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, i definitely shouldâ€™ve.","i looked this up on google, and i just saw people claiming the 13400f is better just because itâ€™s 13th gen and newer than the 5700x.",i also saw the specs which seemed better but i see now theyâ€™re not.,"and i saw itâ€™s pretty much a rebranded 12th gen processor, but i saw people saying 12th gen is also better which seems to be falseâ€¦ thatâ€™s about all i found about it.",i see now that i should look it up on youtube too to check the benchmarks.,"some of them at least werenâ€™t up at the time i bought my 13400f like the hardware unboxed benchmark and associated reddit thread as well as the pcgamer review though there were a few that were up at the time that i missed, so i guess thatâ€™s the price you pay for buying into a brand new part.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12600k is better than 13400f or 13500. why not buy 12600k for the oc capabilities?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™ll give that a try then since itâ€™s only $40 more.,having oc capabilities would be nice too.,thanks!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how does the 7600 compare to the 12600k and the 13400f?,i might just switch to am5 at this point if i have to spend $40 more on a 12600k anyway.,"i can get an am5 motherboard for $10 more and a 7600 for $30 more, and i already have ddr5 ram.","the motherboard will be a low-end b650 while my current one is a higher-end z690-a, but i guess the higher end mobo doesnâ€™t even matter for a 13400f since i canâ€™t overclock it.",it would matter for the 12600k though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
only the 13600k and up are â€œtrueâ€ 13th gen with the new architecture.,chips below that are just rebranded 12th gen chips with the old architecture.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"12600k and 13400 are almost the exact same chip, the only real difference is the slightly lower clocks on the 13400. overclocking is never guaranteed, you might get a bad chip that canâ€™t overclock by much.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if youâ€™re planning on gaming a lot then i suggest you wait for the x3d version of the 7600 which rips both the 12600k and 13400f in gaming performance.,"for productivity tasks, i would say otherwise.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i see, so iâ€™m not really getting a 13th gen chip.",maybe iâ€™ll go all the way to a 13600k but probably not.,i might switch to am5 and get a 7600 at this point if iâ€™ll need to spend $120 more to get an actual 13th gen processor.,how does the 7600 compare to the 13600k and the 13400f?,"iâ€™d imagine the 13600k is better since thatâ€™s a high-end processor, but i heard the 7600 is a bit better than the 13400 at gaming.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes if you don't care about overclocking its right up there with strix imo.,very stable.,prime probably doesn't have bluetooth and a few other usb options that strix does but if none of that extra crap is needed prime is great it would have the same chipset and that's the important thing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the board is decent.,"not great, but decent.",power delivery is a little on the weak side,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not too bad for a bargain bin combo, imo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i forget about this board because the rest of the prime boards are low end.,whats odd is that asus nomenclature goes prime (low end) > tuf (decent mid range) > back to prime for this high end board.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not the board iâ€™d want to pair with a 13900k.,vrm may not be able to get it to its potential.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah but i wouldnâ€™t choose a low end z series board with a top of the line chip.,i doubt itâ€™s vrm will get it where it can be.,this board is probably fine if youâ€™re putting an i5 in it.,the 13900k deserves a much higher quality board.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"fuck, i bought a asus rog crosshair viii dark hero a recently",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

can confirm... my z790 tuf rarely ever applies my ring oc despite me not changing anything between boots.,i also have suspicions that it's messing with pcie power as my gpu has weird issues on boot until it i reboot.,i bought it having had a good experience with a maximus hero on my 9900k but doesn't seem like it was a good choice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had a gigabyte master z390 as my last board and it was a nightmare for software reasons.,what other boards are considered top tier nowadays?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they've always sucked with not only the bios setup itself but also keeping their boards updated.,always feel like they're the last to put out updates and the first to ditch older boards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i strongly agree to the point that iâ€™ve just cut them out now.,"if your gonna sell a â£400 (z690 gaming wi-fi itx) and it canâ€™t even run ddr5 xmp speeds or a 13900k to run at stock speeds (only booted in safe mode with the cpu clocked down to 5.5ghz) then what are you paying for lol, the name?","asus is shit now, better alternatives this gen are msi and gigabyte.","nonetheless, i scrapped my itx build and bought an msi meg ace and itâ€™s solid, no ddr5 timing issues, solid overclocker and has some nice features too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
prime should be entry level.,"isn't the mid tier, tuf?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 'a' means nothing.,it's just a model designator.,there's no commonality between asus and msi's use of it (other than they happen to have called their entry level boards 'a's for some reason).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what is final voltage and frequency outcome ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it won't.,poor joke.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all the new asus boards that have wifi use the intel chipset that includes bluetooth on the same antenna.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it has bluetooth and all the usb options that the strix has.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i usually watercool my components and wouldn't mind the extra headroom for oc.,does this not push a 13900k at all or is the 13900k itself not beneficial to push beyond stock?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i normally just use the ai overclocking on the mobo so whatever that gives i'm okay with it.,"as far as i can tell, there's no real-world performance gains especially in gaming oc'ing a 13900k?",what ram did you pair yours up with?,"i""m still trying to find some good ddr5 sticks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what are the top tier ones?,and things that would matter more for gaming performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ethernet problems like that are rma'able imo.,unacceptable.,i've returned a z490 board for the faulty intel iv225 nic.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are all of those drivers actually needed?,some are just software no?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

maximum is on the other end of the premium spectrum to this board though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

actually did a quick search on the 13600 and those wattages are higher than norma so that does tell me that there might be some sort of overclocking active but also there is still something fishy about the temps because your aio should be able to handle the heat produced from 200 watts.,you might have 2 issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

saying the 13600k shouldnâ€™t go past 181w hahahaha obviously no research was done.",itâ€™s like saying the 13900k should be capped at 253w yet most motherboards will let the 13900k go in excess of 300w straight out of the box.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

did you undervolt or something?,your clock speed vary greatly and also your tdp dropped 10 watts.,its usually the other way around if you are cooling better the chip should be drawing more energy because its not getting throttled.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice.,"which motherboard, if you don't mind?",maybe others with this same board should use a contact frame.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i see your cpu is drawing close to 200w.,you can lower the temp further by setting the pl1 & pl2 lower (from bios or using intel xtu).,your cpu will use less wattage and performs the same.,i got the same cinebench results with a 125w pl.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that 9900k is still pretty awesome.,i say start saving now for a new gpu.,in a year or less the rtx 5xxx will be out.,you can sell your 3080 and use what money you have saved to upgrade or start a new build completely,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

a new cpu will only show improvement if you are cpu bound right now.,"with gaming in 4k i doubt the cpu is what will hold you back, at that kind of resolution the gpu will always be the bottleneck.","the 3080 is capable at 4k gaming, but depending on you want in terms of fps upgrading to the 4070 or 4080 series from nvidia or the equivalent amd gpu might be a better move.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so, the 9900k still has legs and probably shouldn't bottleneck the 3080. especially if you have it overclocked at all.",but if you are looking to upgrade then i'd suggest a 13600k and a z690 board.,it'll run you about $400 if you reuse your ddr4 ram (providing its a decent set) and you'll have all the power you'll realistically need for at least another 5 years.,plus as an added bonus you'll have pcie 4.0/5.0 depending on the board.,or you can spend another $90'ish bucks and get the 13700k.,"that was my choice and my way of ""future proofing"".",you could also wait for meteor lake.,"though there's some confusion on whether or not there will be desktop cpu's for the next gen. last investor presentation i saw showed that there would be, but who knows.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

me too buddy.,in the exact same boat.,honestly i have a 5800x3d but that single core score off the 13 series is pretty interesting stuff.,i don't play mmos so single core matters.,also fml why did the 3080ti only have 12gb of vram.,it's like so good in certain games but i do get frame time spikes and shader stutter at 4k ultra settings (even though i don't hit 12gb the 1percent lows just kill) so i'm thinking i'll wait 1 more gen on cpu and gpu then upgrade and give my gf the rig,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3200 is decent as long as the timings aren't terrible.,are you bottlenecking while gaming?,what's your cpu and gpu utilization at?,you can check that in task manager.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my monitor is 3840 x 1600, so i'm in the middle of 1440 and 4k.","my partner gets all my hand-me-downs, so unfortunately no resale value in anything i upgrade, which is why i was leaning towards the cheaper cpu upgrade, versus the more expensive gpu route.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'm not sure.,"another commenter said to use hwinfo while i'm gaming, so i'm gonna check that out, as i haven't heard of it before.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"its a hit and miss, because most games today are gpu optimized, there are ofc exceptions like escape from tarkov.",if you have ddr4 with reasonable speeds (+3000mhz) and cl and you have 32gb memory i dont think you will see alot of better performance switching to a 13700k/13900k.,you will acording to me se a much more performance increase if you change your 3080 to a 4070ti.,look around on youtube plenty of benchmarks with different gpu and cpus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes definitely download that.,"run it in the background while you game, then take a screenshot of the sensor readings and post it here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, i already have ddr4 32 gb 3,200 mhz ram.","i know the jump to 4000 series would also get me dlss 3 frame generation, which is an extra boost as well, it's just hard accepting that gpus are $2,000+ cad lol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah but its the only way you will get a reasonable boost in fps.,a z790 and a 13700/13900k is like 1200$ cad ?,for a little increase in performance.,a 4070ti should cost you 1200-1300$ cad aswell.,im not 100% sure on the prices im from europe.,"but in eu a 4070ti here is 1000â‚¬

13900k 700â‚¬ and z790 midrange 400â‚¬",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"4070 ti here is like 830â‚¬, 13900k \~600â‚¬",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, close enough.","4070 ti is like $1,300 for the cheapest model, and 13700k + mobo is like $900.","my idea of a new gpu being $2,000+ was more based on a 4080 or 4090, to get a bigger jump in performance, rather than incremental from 3080 to 4070 ti.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"depends on what you are looking for if you want to game on 4k ultra you will get 60fps with 4070ti, if you wanna manage 4k ultra with good fps you're gonna have to go for 4090",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"but that wasn't the question, was it?",hugsnotdrugs wanted to know if the a770 was still plagued by higher idle power draw and the answer is yes.,"what you said was that it wasn't because it was idling at 40 watts, that is an insanely higher power draw for idling.",it is just factually wrong to say the a770 isn't still being plagued by a higher idle power draw.,it may not impact your thermals and you may not care but clearly hugsnotdrugs cares and it could in his case actually impact the thermals.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

but it is only the 3dm ts score that is affected.,other benchmarks are not.,even results in cinebench is unaffected and it is probably considered as a more reliable cpu testing tool.,by using some old windows build and disabling updates you might be in danger of not having security patches etc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah it still doesn't work for me either.,but my other results from the benchmarks are all ok. i get about 30500 in cinebench.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if tour not looking to overclock there's no need to get a super expensive overclocking board.,go with one that fits your hardware.,does it have enough usb?,pci 4?,does it handle the ram speeds you have.,i personally am in the same boat as you.,i ended up going with the rog strix-f.   to answer your question save the money and go with the carbon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i went with the gigabyte aorus master just because it was between that and a few asus options at my mc yesterday (for ddr5 at least).,i had a major problem with asus' rma department this year and vowed to never buy their products again.,the build quality on this motherboard is 5x that of my old asus dark hero at the same price point.,the ez-latch m.2 and gpu system are clever and welcome.,tons of usb.,3 usb-c. 4 m.2 slots.,the board overall just feels like better build quality.,it's stout and heavy.,the heatsinks for the m.2 drives also feel like they are better quality.,overall very happy with my purchase so far.,"in my opinion, the gunmetal blue aesthetic also looks nice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

itâ€™s been done before if you check out the overclocking threads.,"however, a lot will have to do with your cpu silicon quality, and whatever msi has done with the bios lately (bios memory compatibility seems to be the biggest factor).",where z790 might do better will be on overclocking boards where there have been generational design tweaks from what they learned on z690 versions.,"for daily driver boards, however, i doubt thereâ€™s any differences even there.",i would suggest researching the specific board(s) youâ€™re looking at to see whatâ€™s the best option for what youâ€™re looking to do.,but the chipset itself does not guarantee higher speeds on one and worse speeds on the other.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i think der8auer has mentioned that unless you get an extremely viscous thermal paste, most of them will start pumping out at temps above 80c.",this means they need regular reapplication unless you are able to keep temps low.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"first off, your contact is terrible, you've overtorqued in the left upper corner (or undertorqued in right bottom).","also, it appears that you have gotten a flat ihs, which will not fare well with a convex coolers foot, which will create an illusion of pump out when you remove the cooler.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i switched from noctua to gelid extreme.,it doesn't pump out at all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for context, i have been using noctua nt-h1 for a few years, and my tube is like 4 years old at this point.","i got the new 13700k build during black friday, and after a month, i noticed the pump-out effect happened due to abnormally high underload temperature even with only a 150w power limit (e.g., r23, p95).",idle and daily task temperatures are fine though.,"re-paste it, and now it's dried again.","considering the breakpoint of nt-h1 is 110*c as per noctua specification, and with the supposed degradation of my old tube, i think it is not able to handle 13700k heat.","this time, i decide to use the thermalright tf7 thermal paste that comes with my thermalright fc140 cooler.","looking at my second picture, i use both nt-h1 and tf7 on the cpu, we can see the nt-h1 is somewhat watery, while the tf7 is vicious.","i did this intentionally, don't mix thermal paste unless you understand the implication.","after the repaste, the cpu now sits around 90-ish celsius even with a 260w power limit (can spike up to more than 280w).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i use ic diamond or microsi for long term high heat applications.,"microsi breaks down after a while at 100c+, though, but slowly.",ic diamond just gets better when subjected to that heat.,"microsi is what dell uses, it basically turns to concrete after a while, but it does offer long term consistent performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
technically speaking you want as little thermal paste as possible since it's only there to fill in the micro imperfections in the metal surfaces.,another thing to note is that the ihs and the cold plate are not perfectly flat unless you have lapped both to be perfectly flat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"looking at the first picture, i'm wondering if you're actually better served by not using the stock ilm.",the contact patch between the cooler and ihs seems very small,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i find nt-h1 to be way too thin and pump out on a lot of use cases.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this has been known; the thicker the paste is the better  the longevity.,additional factors is the breakdown temperature of the paste.,the nth1 has a low breakdown temperature so hotspots on dice will accelerate its degradation.,tfx and coolermaster master gel maker have the consistency of clay and they have the best longevity of pastes ive personally used.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s not how you apply your thermal paste is it?,"if so itâ€™s a terrible job, and isnâ€™t surprising you have gaps in its coverage",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
try different pastes.,iirc e.g.,hydronaut was specifically designed for long term applications.,personally i havenâ€™t had an issue with 13700k and kryonaut either though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
could try corsair xtm70.,a bit pricey at $25 ish for 3g.,"but itâ€™s pretty dang thick and one of, if not the best performing pastes out there.",kind of surprising coming from corsair.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've lapped my 9-ish year old nh d14 with a medium size bathroom mirror and got a 2-3c drop on all cores.,i would try another paste and rule out every other possibility then lap just the cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i will say this as many times as it takes for people to understand.,i have purchased 3 nt-h1 and 2 nt-h2 tubes in the past.,100% of them have some crappy water build up in the tube somewhere.,just went arctic mx-6 and i will never look back.,edit: noctua pastes are watery by default and will eventually spread out to the ring on every die like you see here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thermal expansion/contraction cycles are a pain.,"before notebookreview site was wiped, ic diamond had a laptop thermal paste reliability survey.",there was one user's laptop where the pressure paper showed extremely uneven pressure where maybe 20% of the cpu and gpu die surface area was actually in contact with the heatsink.,"the ic diamond paste, and other pastes (e.g.","arctic silver), all had pump out failure within 6 months.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"there are multiple vides on youtube showing the too-much myth to be just that - there is, however, not using enough.","""as little as possible"" is actually bad advise.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have always applied thermal paste the same way (second picture).,"with this amount of paste (still nowhere near the ""legendary"" verge level, it doesn't really matter whether you thoroughly spread them out before installing the cooler or not.","afaik the core of the 13th-gen series resides near the center, that's where i have the cross shape.",the extra paste around are for further coverage (might not be necessary since nothing is under the ihs).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

everything below 100c is low (this comment was made by the intel 13th gen gang),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"certainly, degradation happens, but this is the first time i notice it goes this bad.","i agree it is not suitable for high-temp applications anymore (13700k), but low-power cpu like my laptop (r7 5800u), it is still usable.","here is also a quote from the noctua website regarding the lifetime of opened and used nt-h1:

noctua nt-h1 and nt-h2 thermal pastes have a specified usage time (on the cpu) of up to 5 years.","however, you will most likely see excellent results for much longer than that, so we simply recommend checking the temperatures occasionally after passing the 5-year mark.","unless you see a clear increase in delta temperatures (difference between cpu temperature and ambient temperature, compared at 100% cpu load) there is no need to replace the paste.",many customers have been using nt-h1 for 10 years or more with excellent results.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'm waiting for the day when 105c is the normal operating temperature so that people who aren't chasing high overclocks can instead use a passive boiling water loop and passive radiator to cool the cpu.,users who prefer quiet operations would love that (as long as the water loop is designed to mask the boiling noises).,maybe even make coffee or tea with the boiling water while gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think there's a difference when it's spread out qnd clamped between the ihs and the cooler vs sitting in the tube.,my arctic silver mx4 was cooling my 9900k perfectly fine.,"i pulled it out, paste was dry on the cooler and ihs.",i swapped to a ryzen 7900x and i got my 3 year old tube out.,it was basically just water coming out of the end of it.,i bought a new tube and it was a much more normal viscosity.,i'm not a chemistry expert by any means but my uneducated opinion is that when it's in the tube there's enough room for the compounds to separate but between the ihs and cooler theres very little space.,and the constant heating and cooling means the paste is probably self-mixing a bit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

your friend will be fine.,just don't tell intel you undervolted if for whatever reason you need to send it in for warranty.,plus undervolting doesn't damage the  cpu.,using xmp (for example) will void the warranty though ( all you have to do is clear the cmos before giving intel information about your system) undervolting is perfectly fine.,also if you truly want to undervolt it and make it stay consistent do it from the bios.,i thought xtu was the way to go for my 13900k but when i tried to undervolt it wouldn't do it.,even after turning off multi core enhancement and making sure undervolt protection was off.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&#x200b;

imo, it is beneficial even if you have a high-end cooler, it helps keeping your cpu cooler and cost nothing.",a cooler cpu also means a lower fan noise.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no it won't damage it at stock settings as long as your cooling solution is sufficient.,if you start seeing high temperatures you might want to read up on undervolting and setting a power limit.,"it's intimidating for first timers, but really isn't difficult to do.","gaming is only gonna use a fraction of the cpu's capabilities anyway, so if that's all you're doing you probably won't see high temps anyway.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks for your help, do you know if there is an easy way to undervolt?",as far as i know it takes quite some time and a lot of experimenting to get it right in terms of stability and what not?,i have an msi mobo.,when i monitor the core voltage on cpu-z it sits between 1.38-to 1.398 when im gaming and the temps are at 57-60c.. unless its harmful i think im just gonna keep things as is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i decided to try the limit modes in bios.,mode 5 dropped my core voltage from 1.395 ish to 1.330 ish and it ran just as good as on stock settings in game (world of warcraft) so i think ill stick with that for the time being!,"temperature wise i also dropped 1-3 degrees, im guessing 57- 62 celsius while gaming is fine",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you have an msi motherboard, the easiest way to undervolt is to change your cpu lite load (under the bios, oc, advance cpu configuration).",just changing from auto to mode 5 will produce very good results.,"you can go lower but may not be stable because each silicon is different and your mileage may vary, if you want some guidelines on cpu lite load modes for 13700k, watch this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_oz4is-nti4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oz4is-nti4)

generally speaking, your motherboard will automatically throttle your cpu before any harm can be done so technically you will be fine with or without these tweaks.","but like i said, run cinebench r23 and monitor your thermals, if it gets to 100c then by all means, tweak your bios.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

because of how the cpu works.,a thread is how much it can do.,"e.g minecraft, like most games, likes only one thread.","this is because a thread is a section of a core, which makes it so you can use more cpu out of your cpu.","so it would cost a lot to make a core bigger, and since they didn't do it, probably not much better than two.",sorry for the long answer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

but they're slower.,"they're not even more efficient, they're just smaller and slower.",someone (don't remember who) tested it and found that it takes 2.7 efficiency cores to roughly equal the performance of one zen 3 core.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's not the point.,the point is that it suggests you're buying a 24 core cpu.,"but you're not exactly getting the performance you would be getting with a real 24 core cpu, you're getting something more in line with a 16 core.",the 10980xe is 4 years old.,not sure why skylake is suddenly the benchmark we should measure modern cpus against.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's wrong.,the reason for not having more than 2 thread per core is because having that one extra thread (i.e.,hyperthreading) already gives diminishing returns.,one core with two threads is nowhere near twice as fast as one core with one thread.,it has nothing to do with the size of the core.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
both amd and intel are working on 3 and 4 way multithreading (smt) though.,"i wouldn't expect to see it until zen 5 at the earliest, probably not until zen 6 or 7 though.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if youâ€™re not educated enough to know that, you wouldnâ€™t care about it anyway even if you did know what it is.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it doesn't change the fact that those e cores are still physical cores and having e cores is better than smt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are misunderstanding what â€œefficiencyâ€ means in this context.,intelâ€™s efficiency cores are â€œspace efficientâ€ so they take up less space/surface area on the die for the same amount of performance.,i think it was something like 4 e cores for the space of 1 p core.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't know where you got that number from.,for pure number crunching tasks the e cores are tested to be roughly equal to a skylake core at the same frequency.,"even accounting the difference in frequency and thread count, i don't know any zen 3 that has 270% the performance of a skylake.","170%, maybe.",but 270% is bonkers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

but not as good as more performance cores with hyperthreading.,you only get 8 of those.,latest rumours are saying that meteor lake will only get 6 p cores max.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no i'm not misunderstanding that.,"we've always said that in this sub, that they're not ""performance per watt"" efficient, but space efficient.","but you missed my point, my point was that the average joe out there doesn't know this.",he think he's getting a 24 core cpu while the equivalent amd cpu in  the same laptop only has 16 cores.,"yet he'll get a slower machine with the intel ""24 core"" than the amd laptop with a 7945 that has higher multicore performance (if the latest leaks are accurate).","i'm asking if we're doing him a disservice by going along with intels misleading ""24 core"" marketing, when in reality the performance is more like ""8 full-speed cores and 16 half-speed cores"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it could have been 2.5 e-cores to 1 zen 3 core.,but it's in that range.,"remember, skylake is ancient, and while the ipc of the e-cores might be similar, they're clocked lower than skylake typically was and they also don't get hyperthreading.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"smt scaling is typically 20-30%, depending on workload.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're only going to find rumors as nothing is confirmed about it at this point.,"there was a rumor that amd would implement it in zen 3 and milan, that obviously didn't happen, and zen 4 is not a total redesign of the architecture, but zen 5 is more of a redesign than zen 4 was, so there's hope it makes it into zen 5. personally i wouldn't bet on it, maybe zen 6 or 7, probably in epyc first, then trickle down to desktops?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

intel specs say 13600k has maximum turbo power 181 w

the setting ""turbo enhanced"" will let the cpu go past this, and this is where problems happend because most cpu coolers are not capable of handling it.",every cooler has a tdp limit if you look your cooler up you can see what max tdp it can handle.,so since intel recommends 181w you should disable turbo enhanced if you dont want to overclock your cpu.,and you can set pl2 in bios to 181w (powerlimit 2),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it will help, but even more importantly it is set up to use an unlimited amount of power out of the box.",if you change the pl1(power limit 1) and pl2 down to whatever your cooling solution can remove for heat.,so if your cooling can handle 125 watts then make pl1 that and then pl2 is a short burst so it can go a tad higher like say 150 watts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

damn okay.,thanks!,"this shouldnâ€™t effect performance too much, no?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's a dynamic overclocking feature that only activates when the cpu is below 90â°c.,if he has cooling problems then it won't activate.,there's no harm in leaving it on.,what is really going to make a difference in temps is lowering the voltage and setting pl2 to a lower value.,"but, honestly, the 13600k isn't that hard to keep cool anyway.",if you are having cooling problems on this chip then you should have bought a better cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"most likely not, you can try yourself to run cinebench after you disabled it and see the temps and results yourself

i dont undervolt personally i limit the wattage so i dont go all the way to up to 300+ watts  or if your bios has it drop one mode down in light load cpu setting these setting are in my advanced section in cpu settings in bios .. that drops my temps by 15 to 20 c.. the 13th gen k chips are unlocked every were so they will pull almost as much wattage the board can give its crazy.,i dont know why they even give a chip wattage on the box ..you will lose a lil performance (negligible)this way but it stays super stable.,undervolting keeps all performance pretty much but a tad to much stabilty goes out the window .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what are the temps in r23?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thats nice.,u can undervolt your cpu.,than u have max 80 degrees with 250w at 100% usage in cinebench without drop performance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"then hitting temperatures of 114 and 120 - as you say - either indicates that the monitoring software youâ€™re using is not working correctly, or you have a severe cooling issue that is very dangerous for your cpu.",you should never see temperatures above 100 or maybe 102 very briefly before it throttles and maintains 100 as an absolute maximum.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is really good if you're running the 13900k.,also pretty decent for a 13700k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
asus bios was so confusing i didn't go for any sort of fiddling yet.,i just loaded optimized defaults and that's about it.,i'll have to look into undervolting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"a blue screen is a kernel panic, something went so terribly wrong the os had no chance to recover and threw a fault.","kernel panics can be caused by faulty hardware (bad ram, dying ssd etc.)",or faulty kernel level drivers.,the first step to finding the cause is to determine what caused the blue screen to happen.,"windows makes a memory dump when this happens and with tools like ""who crashed"" and ""bluescreenview"" it is possible to read these memory dumps.",once you have the error and possibly the process that triggered it you can work towards a solution.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what changed before your pc started blue screening?,"when you say your fans didn't feel hot, did you use a software to track the temperatures?",try hwinfo and see what your cpu temperatures look like.,it could be time to dust and clean your pc.,you could use the same opportunity to re-seat the ram.,it may also be worth doing a clean re-install of windows.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the last time i remembered in the stop code it says system_service_exception and the other one it was something about the memory(?).,didn't say any kernel in the stopcode.,how should i troubleshoot that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the blue screen itself is formally known as a kernel panic.,the term kernel panic isn't mentioned ever on the blue screen itself.,the way you troubleshoot this is by downloading either tool i mentioned earlier and use that to look at the memory dump.,"you could also look in the event viewer and look for a bugcheck code, that should contain some information as well.","the `system_service_exception` stop code could indicate a faulty or misbehaving driver, but the memory dump will tell you for sure.",if the stop code is more randomized that could indicate faulty memory.,memory can be tested with something like memtest86.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what do you do with the your current setup?,if you don't need all those pcie lanes then some of the current 13th gen raptor lake k-skus have more threads than your 7820x and have better performance overall.,"if you do need the extra memory bandwidth and pcie then the w2400 and w3400 sapphire rapids announced today are intel's official hedt offerings moving forward, but it's not clear when they'll be available on the market.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ah interesting coincidence.,too bad they are on another platform.,i guess i can officially put my x299 motherboard to rest then.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
currently just gaming and vr (flight sim).,i am also currently trying to learn unity for some rudimentary vr/mr development.,i may also try some crude 3d modelling for use as vrchat avatars.,i think i can agree i don't need a lot of pcie lanes.,the only reason i am on hedt is because i got a motherboard for free.,i guess it is time to let it go.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why would you expect intel to continue using a nearly 6 year old platform thatâ€™s horribly out of date?,"anything released in todays market is going to need pcie 5.0, 4.0, ddr5â€¦ and x299 doesnâ€™t have any of that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what gpu do you have?,i'd say that as long as you pair a reasonably mid to high-end gpu like a 4080 or 7900xtx with something like an i7 13700k and sufficient amounts of ram that may just be enough.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am still on 1080ti.,several months ago i asked on /r/buildapc if 7820x will bottleneck 4080 cards and most suggest to me it is probably ok but adviced me to wait another generation as the 1080ti is still very capable (which i kind of agree).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what resolution monitor do you have?,i got a free 1080ti from a friend and threw it into my 7980xe x299 rig and itâ€™s horribly slow even overclocked with extremely fast ram (52ns in aida64).,it uses 700+ watts in prime95 with no gpu load.,you can upgrade your gpu but my first question would be if you have a quality power supply.,raptor lake is much much much faster and probably uses 50% of the power.,i have a friend with a 10900k and a 1080ti but he is only at 1440p and he plays old games.,iâ€™m sure if he upgraded to a 2080ti or 3080ti he would have much better scores in most modern games.,my friends 13900k/7900xtx rig gets more fps in escape from tarkov in 4k than i do (x299/1080ti) at 1080p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have three monitors
one 4k, one uw-fhd, one fhd.","i personally think i am running most of my games fine, but then again i do not tune up graphics to max all the time so i really don't know.","but i am pretty if we use cyberpunk 2077 as benchmark, at 4k+max settings i cannot run at at least stable 30fps.",psu is a thermaltake 850w,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7820x will definitely bottleneck newer cards.,"superficially it looks like it's a 9900k but it has lower clocks, and a much worse (for gaming purposes) interconnect between the cores giving you overall much lower fps.",it's way behind it as a result.,iirc it's about the same as zen+.,edit: i'd actually say your 1080ti is bottlenecked too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
x299 highly depends on clocks and ram.,i donâ€™t really think is a problem if he is gaming at 4k.,both my 1950x threadripper and 7980xe can beat my 7950x am5 system because of a high resolution and ram speedâ€¦ even with the exact same gpu.,"a 10900k,12900k, or 13900k would 100% be better though.",my am5 system only uses 45 watts in games thoughâ€¦ 13900k same thing plus or minus.,"even if you can get by on a low-tier x299 chip today, its doubtful that it wont bottleneck you in the future.",a 12900k/13900k could last you 6 more years.,if you are on a budget you can even use a 360$ ddr4 from asus/msi or use the 399$ evga z690 dark.,don't feel bad about upgrading your cpu first because the 4090 doesn't even have the new display port or hdmi outputs like the 7900xtx does.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>x299 highly depends on clocks and ram.,i assumed op runs it at stock.,otherwise he wouldn't ask such questions.,"i could be wrong, ofc.","oced to the wall, it still won't reach even 9900k in gaming.",>i donâ€™t really think is a problem if he is gaming at 4k.,both my 1950x threadripper and 7980xe can beat my 7950x am5 system because of a high resolution and ram speedâ€¦ even with the exact same gpu.,"i find it unbelievable & impossible, to be honest.",i'm pretty sure even in modern games at 4k it will cause bottlenecks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it uses too much die space for a desktop part that is really meant to pair with a gpu card.,"if you want a mini-pc without gpu card, there are lots of nuc style mini-pcs that use the laptop part with bigger gpu.",also amd stopped releasing ryzen g for desktop at the 5000 series.,"amd desktop have either no gpu at all, or very weak one in the new 7000 series.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">also amd stopped releasing ryzen g for desktop

amd desktop apus always launch later than their cpu counterparts, confirmed by amd's leaked desktop roadmaps showing the sucessor to the 5000g series as launching later this year: [https://twitter.com/sebuahsarang/status/1575738480063549440](https://twitter.com/sebuahsarang/status/1575738480063549440)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
imo the apus just seem to be in an awkward space where they're more than most people (that aren't playing games on pcs) need and not enough for actually demanding gaming.,"like sure the amd one is twice as fast as intel's current, so you get 30fps instead of 15. and you spend a lot of die area to get there.",that's cool for the steam deck but otherwise seems not worth it in most cases.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not holding my breath on that one.,we have only had 5000 series apu since 2021 and that was kind of compromised as a cpu with it's low cache.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have the same setup with the contact frame installed.,"i can't tell you whether it works or not because i did not do a before and after but what i can say is, the moment you try clamping down the ilm, you will understand why you would need a mod like this.","it is a cheap mod, it is easier to install when you are building the pc from scratch.","on a side note, you might not want this if you have a convex heatsink, so do check that before you install it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for me it didn't really made a difference.,"i was struggling with 13600k temperatures, it would max out at 92c on cinebench r23.","installed the bracket, it went down to 90-91c.",so 1-2c difference max.,"but since its new pc, i guess cpu needs time to get bent, maybe thats why such small difference.","in the end i just undervolted, now getting 68c max with same performance lol.",instead of 180w cpu uses 130w.,undervolting will give 10x bigger impact than anti bend bracket,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think the 700 series motherboard + 13th gen has mostly fixed this issue.,thermal paste pattern looked pretty centre squished on the default ilm.,had no difference in temps after installation.,"though the default one was very tight, could be something that happens over time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i went from immediately hitting 100c in cinebench r23 multi to 90c for the full 10 minutes by just installing the contact frame.,i had wild temp variance on my p cores and now they are very similar.,its a no brainer if you will attempt to overclock.,i expected no results at all but im blown away at the difference,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm going to use the deepcool lt720.,i can't find anything on the cooler faceplate being convex.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'll have to look into the under volting.,have never messed with that before.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"after checking some pictures, it looks like the lt720 has a flat base and technically should pair well with the contact frame:

"since we have the same setup (same motherboard and cpu) i can give you some baselines:

1) make sure you update your bios to the latest version as this fixes some issues with undervolting.","2) when you first boot into bios, choose ""water cooling"" as it should be the first screen that shows up after that enable xmp as usual.","3) in the bios, under oc -> advanced cpu configuration, change cpu lite load o mode 1. while you are here you might wanna adjust your pl1 and pl2(power limits) to intel specs 181w(default should be 4096w), although having this unchanged(basically uncapped) may give you a slight performance boost, but more heat, it depends on your cooler's capability.",4) run stress tests like cinebench  r23 and make sure your lite load is stable.,"if everything is fine, go back into bios, under oc, enable expert mode, and play around with cpu core voltage.","5) personally, i left cpu core/gt voltage mode as \[auto\] and only changed the cpu core voltage.","but of course, you can choose among the different modes but make sure you look up their definitions and know what they are.","6) i have cpu core voltage at 1.15v with a slight overclock, you may get away with 1.14v(or lower) if you are running stock clocks, steps up slightly if you have stability issues.",these are just some baselines to help you get started but each silicon is different so your mileage may vary.,"personally, i have been daily driving cpu lite load mode 1, 1.15v cpu core voltage, at 52x pcores and 40x ecores.",haven't had any issues for 2 weeks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"finally, intel 0th gen",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would suggest getting an i5-13600k.,"you'll of course have to buy a new motherboard and ram, but it'll be a massive upgrade over your 6th gen i5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if your mobo is compatibility, you can do bios mod with coffe time, this allow you can use 8th/9th gen coffe lake processors  since is same socket lga 1151 ( only you need do pin mod work in the procesor ), if the mobo have tmp 2 you can update to win 11/ oficial support ( in youtube already video show i9 9900k in kaby lake mobo ) 

works with coffe lake xeons and mutans cpus too ( is a lie xeons need special chipset for work,) since uses same microcodes ( you add them with coffe time program ), the only donwside is you need disables intel magnament engine ( or downgrade ) and maybe cant update to win 11/oficial support 

you need use socks chip programer ( like c4h programer from aliexpress) 

is easy to do , you need see videos when flasin bios with bios mod but is worth if you mind second wind in kaby/sky lake gen",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on what your budget is.,if its only 200 dollars maybe look for a rx6600 and keep the system for now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just overclocked my gtx 970 btw.,"went from score 1243 in msk kombustor to 1505, over 20% improvement.",pretty decent i think,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i5 12400f,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
those commenting telling you to invest in a new mobo need to remember budget exists.,"op, the i7-7700k should work in your system, if you update the bios.","if no compatible bios exists, get the i7-6700k.","either chip would be substantially better, both adding hyperthreading.","no, it won't be on par with modern hardware, but it'll be a noticable improvement for you, and it sells for around 130 bucks, you can find the non k version for a little cheaper.","for gpu, it really depends on budget.",do you have very little to spare?,"grab the gtx 1070, or rtx 2060 - 2070 series.",a little bit more?,look into the rtx 3060/ti.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"cheapest good upgrade would be amd b550 + ryzen 5700x + 32gb ddr4

it does exist.,i5-660,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my mobo is asus z170 pro gaming.,i will look it up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
upgrading to a 7700k would be expensive and mean marginal performance improvement.,it would be properly pointless.,a cheap more modern system (12th gen intel or am4) would be vastly vastly more bang for buck and potentially quite reasonably priced.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i disagree.,7000 series is more future proof,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
even buying a high end 7th gen isnâ€™t going to be much of an uplift.,itâ€™s not worth doing.,just save up for a new cpu + mb + ram.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"why would you upgrade to some cpu whose performance can be ousted by some cpu that is 100 usd, if not lesser?",use your common sense and google before asking a question.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
really?,show me a motherboard and cpu combo for 12th gen intel that costs 100 dollars!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe.. but about 50% more expensive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"best price i can find on a used 7700k is $160, and thatâ€™s used rather than new equipment.",a cheapish b560 mobo and a 12100k will be $40 more and in warranty.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm going off the price of the i7-6700k.,i'm finding ebay listings for it that cost 80-90 dollars infact!,"clearly the i7-7700k isn't a good deal, but the 6700k sure is!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it might be a good deal on paper but the performance gain from a 6600 is just not going to be worth the expense.,think of it as (i havenâ€™t checked actual benchmarksâ€¦) $100 for 10% more performance or $200 for 75% more.,obviously the best option is to save a bit longer!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hyperthreading being added, and much higher clocks, are not a 10% more performance improvement.","geekbench multicore goes from 3376 to 4991, a 47% improvement across the board.",(not 10% as you said! ),"while yes, a new mobo would provide better performance combined with a newer platform, op has stated they do not have the budget to facilitate this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
multicore is all well and good but itâ€™s not going to make the most difference in most scenarios.,though iâ€™ll concede 4c4t is limiting in some.,itâ€™s still a waste of money.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in this case, the answer is easy.",there are a lot of newer cpus that bottleneck the 4090 *in 4k*.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, current cores - raptor cove and zen 4 - are 40% higher ipc than skylake-x, which was weak to begin with because of the terrible l3$.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bottleneck is usually a relative term.,will you be bottlenecked if you play at 1080p and you aim for 240hz?,"yes, the 10980xe will be a huge bottleneck.",do you plan on playing 4k at 60fps?,you won't have any issues.,"the lower the resolution, the more fps your card can spit out, so the higher the cpu load is.",nobody can give you a 100% accurate answer without knowing which games you plan to play and at which resolution and target fps.,"but generally speaking 10th gen cpu's are still ok, i don't expect you to have any major problems.",you might lose a few fps but it's not the end of the world.,"one more thing, rt is putting additional strain on the cpu, if you plan to play the more rt heavy games, the 10980xe might struggle a bit more giving high fps.","frame generation, if available, is a good way to take away some load from the cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i am pretty sure based on a video from the last half of last year by df (yes, i know) - that you have to go back a few more generations before you would bottleneck that card (or a card in the general neighborhood).","i don't remember which video, but probably one that was using crysis 3 (which wont narrow it down), but it was a witchard video, so that does narrow it down to some degree.",perhaps they know better in the df/eg forums/sub-reddit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you would get a noticeable performance difference at 1080p going to something modern like a 13600k but at 1440p the difference is negligible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, everywhere and it will be even more noticeable with rt enabled and dlss",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3440x1440p 100hz and sometimes surround 10320x1440p.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wrong.,"with 4090 op will have a bottleneck on every resolution less than 8k, especially with the dlss option enabled.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"im thinking to wait for intel 14th gen because z790 is ""dead"" platfrom.",it wont get any new cpus.,or buy z790 and 13900k im not sure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my 9940x and 7980xe beat my 7950x in the world of tanks encore rt benchmark at 3440x1440.,"this was on a shunt modded, water cooled, titan rtx.",(2080ti basically).,a 4090 is much faster and probably will see a bigger difference in favor of newer stuff.,the 10900k/13900k are both huge upgrades over x299 but i donâ€™t think you will have problems at 3440x1440 100hz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
100hz should be doable as long as the games are reasonably optimized.,10th gen is still somewhat relevant.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you won't get much benefit from that.,trust me.,if your cpu is overheating then buy a cheap coolmaster 212r worked perfectly fine with my i7 4790k.,as thermal paste use arctic mx6 or better.,if you can get a cheap used 4970k would be an upgrade for you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

first thing you should understand is there is no guaranteed sweet spot for any cpu.,"for chiplet based ryzen you need to find where the infinity fabric clock (fclk) maxes out, and that varies chip to chip because of silicon lottery and different ram setups such as, 4 sticks, single/dual/quad rank, more capacity, type of ic, motherboard topology, bios' ram support.","some ryzen 5000 cpus' can do 3733mhz, some can do 3800 or 3900 or even 4000mhz in 1:1:1 (mclk:uclk:fclk) mode.","monolithic ryzen, like the 5600**g** and 5700**g**, can clock much higher since it's a unified die, i've seen plenty of overclockers get over 4500mhz.","on intel, since 11th gen, there are gear modes which is similar to ryzen's fclk.","gear 1 means the memory controller is running 1:1 with the ram frequency; gear 2 means the memory controller is running at half the speed of the ram, and ruins latency.","the faster the memory controller is running, the quicker the cpu cores are being fed data.","on the 3200mhz rated ddr4 controllers on 11th, 12th, 13th gen you can usually expect between 3900-4200mhz to be the max range in gear 1. again depends on silicon lottery and the ram setup because you can have a heavier load on the memory controller with more ranks, sticks etc.","non k versions of 12th and 13th gen cpus have system agent voltage locked which means getting over 3600mhz in gear 1 is very unlikely, even 3600 is unlikely.","if you switch to gear 2 you can get over 4000mhz easily on the k variants, but you'd be sacrificing latency for bandwidth

it's not always more mhz = more performance.",timings are very important.,"you can have over 70,000mb/s bandwidth but if the timings suck then the latency is going to kill the gaming performing

if you'd like to see some benchmarks check out these sources 

it's ddr5 but still gets point across https://youtu.be/qljas_zol7g you can see here intel cpus don't gain as much performance as ryzen does with faster, lower latency ram but there is still improvement to be had.","https://youtu.be/moatiquqo3s

his video is almost completely wrong.,"higher speeds do scale, but the problem with their test methodology is that they didn't set the subtimings and tertiary timings.",as the ram speed gets higher the auto timings (which aren't set be xmp or expo) get looser in tandem.,in effect all that changes is the latency from the memory controller in practice.,"basically higher speeds do matter, but you need to tighten your sub and tertiary timings to get any actual meaningful difference.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah the 13400 is basically just a locked down 12600k.,"if you can find the 13400f for around $200 or less then its a decent value upgrade from a 12100 if you need more cores/cache

"13600k also has the improved raptor cove p cores which clock decently high, ring can clock higher and more l2 cache per core.",thats why its so much better than the 13500 and 13400 based on last gen alder lake.,if you can afford it then go for it.,"but if not, you're not sacrificing too much by getting the 13400 considering its like $100 cheaper",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you only have a 3060, it will be fine to use a 13600k with your 550w psu.",gaming uses very little power compared to things like benchmarks/rendering so if youâ€™re really worried then you can always set a power limit so you wouldnâ€™t use much power when doing things that need more power than gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yo i found the reason it's asus armoury crate causing it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6-8% average load is very high.,you see the cpu has 24 cores and 32 threads.,this means 2 to 3 cores are constantly under close to 100% load.,check if windows is processing updates or if a virus scanner is running a routine scan.,bloatware is software that usually gets installed alongside other tools you install without you noticing.,or rgb control software also can cause high cpu usage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'd actually imagine any workload on the cpu would be crippled by that single stick of ram.,"increased memory latency versus two sticks in every scenario, even if bandwidth isn't necessarily a problem.",the cpu will end up in a wait state far more often than doing something useful.,it's actually part of the reason why the amd ryzen processors with 3d cache had such an uplift in memory-intensive operations (games).,"that cache, compared to accessing the dram, gives the processor less latency for tasks being worked on at that very moment, so more time is spent doing something useful rather than burning electricity and waiting for the dram.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

good luck undervolting any significant amount without getting a massive loss in performance.,intel introduced undervolt protection in a new microcode and you canâ€™t turn it off on cheaper boards like b760.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
undervolt protection is disabled by default though and i can definitely undervolt on this board.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"undervolt protection doesn't stop you from undervolting, it just reduces the performance when there isn't enough voltage.",have you checked with benchmarks like cinebench to make sure you aren't losing performance?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

dh15 has tdp rating of 205w.",ak620 = 260w.,"if you are going to use it +170w anyhow, get 360 aio.",they can support up to 350w.,"it will also run  lot quieter compared to those air coolers, i mean you ll be basically pushing air coolers to maximum limit.",arctic has good budget aios.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

in reality the 12500t is quite hard to find in my area.,however i wanted to discuss/understand the principle behind it disregarding any price point.,"benchmarks and logic dictate that the 12500 is obviously a more performing cpu than the 12500t, but is that still the case if tdp is capped at 65w?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"generally you can set any cpu to have any power limit, so there is no reason to prefer either.",you'd buy whichever is cheaper and set the power limits to whatever made sense for the application.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
both can have their tdps elevated (assuming not locked down by the board).,"so itâ€™s basically a moot point, unless youâ€™re forced to follow the stock tdps.","the next question you need to ask is why is the board 65w limited, and whatâ€™s going to happen if you try to run at the maximum all the time?",is the system going to overheat?,are the vrms / power supply really crappy?,and something to remember: itâ€™s the same cpu!,with just some different multiplier upper limits and stock tdp limits.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

just updated my xps 9520 bios to 1.10.0 and immediately lost undervolting and 18% performance as indicated by a quick cinebench run.,"this is insane, i've invested hard earned money on a core i9-12900hk just to benefit from that undervolting and performance and 6 months after dell takes everything back, silently with no warnings.","this is even more frustrating as it was widely accepted that the hk version was the only one supporting ""officially"" undervolting.",we should start an collective action towards dell and make noise to ask for the right to downgrade back to 1.6.0 !,what would be the best way you think?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wait so this post is just about laptops specifically dell laptops?,"it is know since years, dell does this.",a normal 13600k desktop cpu still works fine to undervolt?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you should absolutely update bios especially on a new platform like z790 or if you have a 13th gen on a z690.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's because not all customers use sgx (it is disabled by default).,"xmg [described it here](https://www.reddit.com/r/xmg_gg/comments/h0wuoh/cpu_undervolting_in_bios_setup_for_xmg_and/):

>unfortunately, our quest to bring easy-to-use undervolting to the masses has hit a new roadblock.","in late 2019, a security research team found out that agressive undervolting (-250mv and further down, which is way beyond our limit) does not only cause bluescreens - the resulting calculation errors can also cause malicious code to read memory addresses from the secured enclave of a little-known intel system called sgx: intel software guard extensions._x000d_  
_x000d_

"you can set the power limits (pl1, pl2, etc) as well.",it works even on laptops.,undervolting allows you to get higher frequencies on the same power limit or get the same performance on lower power.,"in my case, i got this lock after the bios update patching both the main and ec firmware.",me firmware was the same.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"no, it is not a bug.",intel plans to disable undervolting on 12th and 13th gen cpus.,that's why they implemented changes to the recent xtu version.,today i have spent some time to disassemble a few bios updates with and without undervolting support.,"i've found, that the only notable difference was the microcode version: 0x41b -> 0x423.","later i've found, that intel suggests [using at least 0x41c](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/topic-technology/software-security-guidance/processors-affected-consolidated-product-cpu-model.html).",that's why dell and other vendor will include it.,"i think, in the case of the desktop k skus the undervolting will be locked since 0x1e.","but that's only my guesses, i don't have all the information.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel has confirmed results of my research.,they have introduced this feature allowing motherboard vendors to disable undervolting.,"also, according to the ""recommended bios settings"" it should be enabled by default.",a motherboard vendor needs to make an extra step to disable it and add an option to change it in the bios.,i've updated the post.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i see.,this is all new information to me thanks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, correct.","3 years ago the undervolting feature was disabled by default in bios on many laptops because of plundervolt, but there was an option to turn it on.","then a year ago with the windows 11 release microsoft decided to activate memory integrity (vbs), which also disable undervolting.",but it's also can be disabled.,"now intel has released a microcode update, which disables it completely.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its also locked on 8th gen i try latest version of xtu and its all greyd out but if u use that version u can undervolt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks.,i may do that.,"(i could always try downgrading to f20 as a test, first, so that at least i will know it is possible to revert back from f22 if i needed to).","for now, i think i'll just leave things as they are, as it is running just fine.","but as for decompressing and messing with the contents of a bios, that's a bit beyond me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sure does if you disable it in the bios.,i couldn't undervolt until i turned that to disabled.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yes, msi does a good job in this regard.","also, there are vendors like xmg providing more bios options for undervolting.","as for other vendors, it depends on the particular model and firmware.","usually, it is something you need to unlock with some tweaks.","in the case of lenogo legion, for example, you need to press a special keyboard combination to enter the enhanced bios.","in the case of other laptops, you need to extract the bios, find the efi offsets, and apply them manually using a special tool.","that's not that complicated, but it requires some knowledge (and luck).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is mad to me.,"i cool my 10700k with a nh d15 no problem, and reading this really drives home how much further off the deep end intel has gone in terms of thermals with their newer gen stuff.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"maybe that topic name ""intel blocks undervolting on alder and raptor lake"" is clickbait and factually incorrect, because, in fact, you still can undervolt both alder and raptor lake and if intel was blocking it you couldnt?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

with desktop alder/raptor lake you want to both change base voltage and ac loadline as it can skyrocket your voltage in idle too on stock settings.,"to be honest, you want to balance both for any cpu that supports adaptive voltage mode.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

all the vendors sooner or later will have to apply the recent intel microcode update in their bios.,recently intel made a decision to completely disable the undervolting.,that's why it has removed an option to specify negative voltage offsets in the recent intel xtu version.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it affects all the intel alder and raptor lake skus using motherboards with the latest microcode update.,"this microcode 
is developed by intel and is the same for different vendors.",a vendor decides whether to integrate it into its products' bios.,the fact that someone has to stay on the old version of bios because intel and other vendors decided to disable undervolting is definitely not ok.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what are you even talking about?,all what he wrote is right as i see it.,how does it just effect some cpus?,it will effect all.,microcode will eventually also come through windows update and will be loaded during windows boot.,"also every board vendor will include it, so if you need an important uefi update because of other problems, you have no chance to update.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this sounds like vendor specific.,i think you are receiving downvotes as your title suggests all raptor/alderlake chips.,which is misinformation a bit.,you should update the post to say mobile chips and to specify which brands are limiting this.,else this is misinformation and can lead all users to think their raptor/alderlake chips are being effected.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i hear you, desktop usually have better safeguards, like jumpers, to recover from such situation.",less likely to be the case for integrated boards like xps.,"yes i'm going to open a case with support, even if i fear their negative answer as u/toniyevych mentioned.",it's crazy how i can't get out of my head that immediate 20% performance loss on my daily driver ... i feel betrayed and ripped off!,"it's the kind of behavior that keeps you away from a brand for life, and yet i love so much the ergonomy of the xps.",they just bricked it for me.,arghhhhh ...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, correct.","dell and other vendors like hp disable undervolting by default since 2020, but there was an option to enable it using efi variables (cfg lock and overclocking lock, to be more precise).",it works similarly on most desktops and mobile systems because they comply with intel cpu specs.,"if you disable those two options, you can access msr and adjust voltage offsets on unlocked cpus (k, hk, and hx).","but last autumn, intel released an updated microcode completely blocking undervolting on 12th and 13th gen cpus.",registers defining voltage offsets (0x150 msr) are completely ignored by cpu during voltage calculation.,so pc and motherboard vendors started including it in the new bios updates.,the deployment takes some time and may take a year or so.,msi released a bunch of updates a few weeks ago.,dell started releasing them in december for xps and alienware systems.,"as for gigabyte and asus, i'm not sure about their schedule.",many z790 motherboards will ship with the new microcode update.,"most importantly, each vendor will eventually include this update from intel because it patches many security vulnerabilities.","usually, security has a higher priority than features like undervolting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"> this last ditch effort 

there are a lot more things that can be tried in cooling, however the issue is a mix of ip, price, and maintenance.","nasa has some solutions for sustainably cooling chips above 8ghz but it requires large milled plates, moving parts, and probably some special fluids.",consumer aios are also relatively cheap with quite a few inefficiencies.,until recently companies were barely putting effort into optimizing their fan choice.,i'm guessing we eventually see everything re-designed from plates to fin stacks.,"there just has to be consumer demand, which is just starting to trend up for 360mm rads and above.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as for sa, i did some additional testing and found that an 80mv undervolt decreases the total package power by 0.6-1w under light loads.",it adds some additional battery life (nearly 20-30 minutes).,"at the same time, the sa becomes less stable if i decide to apply the higher voltage offsets.","i had a few xps 17, and none worked smoothly with sa offset larger than 100mv.","as for the llc undervolting, it is a good idea.",xmg [researched](https://www.reddit.com/r/xmg_gg/comments/10cimqk/launch_undervolting_via_load_line_calibration_llc/) that.,"in their case, they stopped on 120 for both ac and dc.",it gave them nearly a peak 6-7% boost in cb r23.,the -0.15v undervolt boosts the performance by 12-15% in my case.,i'm not saying that llc is bad and offsets are good.,i want both options to work smoothly and combine them for better results.,that's the whole point.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, that's true.",are there any ways to adjust ac load line in the runtime as the throttlestop does with offsets?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, there's [a great guide](https://www.overclock.net/threads/asus-maximus-z790-extreme-and-intel-i9-13900k-a-tuning-guide-for-beginners.1801569/) on that, but there's a note:

the voltage offsets may not work with the recent microcode updates from intel even on z boards.,that's the problem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are simply staying a workaround...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
on 12700k i save 15w in idle and ~30w on low load like browsing and such.,12900k i tested yesterday saved over 20w in idle just by undervolt alone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lowering the boost?,"maybe it works differently on locked parts, but on k chips it doesnâ€™t lower boost for me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

your cooling solution is really not optimal for something using 180w lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
except it is completely true.,the fact that you can edit the bios yourself or hope your mobo manufacturer releases an update to enable it doesn't change that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"with the new intel microcode update, you can't overwrite it.","you can specify any voltage offsets in bios in any way, but those settings will be ignored by the system.",the only way to have the undervolting working is to avoid bios updates... or try to change intel's policy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
things are more complicated.,the voltage offsets are defined by a special register called msr 0x150.,cpu reads that data and applies the voltage offsets.,"the voltage offsets can be defined in two ways:

1. by firmware during the initialization.","when you turn on the device, the system reads the offsets you specified in bios from efi and puts appropriate values to msr.",that's why it works well with all operating systems.,2. using software like intel xtu or throttlestop.,they do mostly the same thing but require write access to msr.,"features like core isolation or hyper-v may lock it on windows load, so it's impossible to change the voltage offsets using those tools.","fun fact: windows 11 has core isolation enabled by default, so we saw a lot of posts saying that windows 11 killed undervolting :)

things slightly changed with the plundervolt vulnerability discovered in 2019. intel introduced a new setting called undervolting protection (cfg lock).","if it was enabled, the microcode blocked any msr changes.","as a result, it was impossible to undervolt a device through xtu or throttlestop.",this decision allowed vendors like hp or dell to disable the undervolting by default on their laptops and prebuilt pcs and hide this setting in the bios.,"motherboard vendors, like asus, gigabyte, etc., enable this option by default.","as a result, only a small number of people knew about the undervolting protection.",the laptop users do not see it in the bios and think that the undervolting is locked by default.,"the pc enthusiasts may simply missed this setting, because it won't cause any issues.",things have changed with the new intel microcode update.,now the cpu ignores the old undervolting protection setting and blocks negative voltage offsets.,that's the problem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"like i said: please contact linus tech tips and gamers nexus and so on about this, instead of complaining on reddit, which will reach no one.",i agree this looks dramatically.,"intel is lying about the ""unlocked"" processors and you might even have a chance to sue them for this.","please make a post on linus tech tips forum and gamers nexus about this, and ask for them make a video about it and reach out to intel.","i was thinking about buying a 13600k as my new pc, undervolt was the most important thing to me.","i also wanted to use a b660 board, but it seems they also dont suppert undervolt, or actually not anymore.",maybe it is the microcode causing this that some people claim their b660 works and others not.,why is your post marked as incorrect btw?,"edit: i just read though this post and i am shocked, how stupid people seem to be, and also that your correct post was flagged as incorrect by mods on this subreddit.",form what i see all you said is correct.,"also people are just saying ""this was already a thing 3 years ago"", right it was, but that was a different issue and different microcode change.","from all i see youre 100% correct on everything, and this will come to all desktop boards too eventually.",also windows update will implement this too and load the microcode during windows boot.,you can work around this by deleting the microcode dll but it will be replaced again and again by windows update.,"please reach out to linus tech tips and gamers nexus, they need to adress this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i don't fight the idea of using an offset, i try to inform that nowadays you want to utilize both as they are complementary.","voltage locking is absolute trash behaviour and there's absolutely no reason to do that, other than a scummy upsell practice, but locking an existing feature is a new low blow.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"~~it's because the guide doesn't understand what is going on~~tl;dr. on adaptive voltage, **you cannot go below built in vid for a given ratio**, so if you aim for x50 ratio and your cpu has vid of 1.26v for this ratio, setting manual voltage to 1.0v, 1.2v even, will result in setting being ignored and 1.26v will be used instead (see [skatterbencher guide on alder lake, section adaptive voltage mode](https://skatterbencher.com/2021/11/04/alder-lake-overclocking-whats-new/)), so using offset (apart from override, which is very bad for idle state power efficiency) is the only way to have lower voltage.",but.,"using just offset results in getting limited by voltage requirements for either low load or high load, so you effectively still lose quite a lot of possible power efficiency gains.","this is why ac loadline exists, so you can have both of the worlds without any actual drawback.",it will preserve your lowest low load voltage (very minor voltage boost in load amperage scenarios) and will help you maintain your lowest necessary voltage for high load.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

how do you even save power on idle that much?,are you running a fixed voltage instead of + offset so it never goes to idle voltage which seems to be like somewhere around 1.00v?,"like sure i only have a 12400f that isn't clocked to the absolute maximum, but i find it hard to believe some extra cores is going to jump the idle power consumption so much from [9-13w](https://i.imgur.com/n58tiov.png) with some spikes that i have.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah, i think iâ€™ll power limit it to like 150w",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ahh okay, grizzly is a good brand.","i have 13600k, which is oc to 5.5ghz and i don't go beyond 65c for gaming.","usually my avg is about 55 to 58c, and i have a 280mm aio push and pull setup.","ofcourse 13900k is more power hungry, and powerful so it will generate more heat.","but, even at idel temps you should be no more than 35c.","the method i used to apply my paste was, somewhat of a heavy pea drop in the middle of the cpu's ihs, and very small dots around it.","[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhrhinfdxjk&t=189s&ab\_channel=pch%2fwandtechunboxings%f0%9f%94%a5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhrhinfdxjk&t=189s&ab_channel=pch%2fwandtechunboxings%f0%9f%94%a5)

8:33 mark.",thats exactly how i did it.,but a bit heavier of a pea drop in the middle.,but shouldn't matter that much.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what did you do to get low idle temps?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, at windows",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(as in just did, after i posted the initial post and it did help with under load temps quite a lot, by 10c or so and not much of a performance drop) but do let me know if 0.1 is too much please",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if it doesn't crash you're fine, if it crashes, lower your offset 

the worst that'll happen is it crashes your windows and your undervolt will reset when you restart, don't think undervolting can do any serious damage",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it will stop it from reaching that speed but if you are only gaming it doesnâ€™t make much of a difference in fps.,"i also downclock my p cores to 5.1ghz and e cores to 3.9ghz and i still get 175fps in bf2042, 220fps in cod:mw2, 200fps in warzone and over 250fps in destiny 2. thatâ€™s with a stock 3080 10gb.",debauer did a really good video on achieving efficiency with the 13900k at lower voltages etc thatâ€™s worth checking out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am not using one yet but i have seen people recommending me one so i might invest!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"will try that today, thank u so much for the help and info!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well i did get another 3 case fans and changed the airflow a bit by putting the aio as intake instead of exhaust and i underclocked as much as i could without ruining stability.,i was also using an ultimate performance power plan when i made this post and changing to a normal balanced power plan also helped,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
im using bitsum highest performance mode,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

have you ran cinebeanch r23.,i was thinking about doing intake for the aio just don't feel like it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"then chill, those temps at idle are normal for that mode",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no worries, i think there's so much wiggle room because its based around the worst possible version of that chip so a better quality chip can use less voltage to achieve the same results",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pleasure dude!,that debauer video helped me a lot.,the 13900k is a flamethrower but can be made to run in a highly efficient manner with minimal loss of performance.,depends on your individual needs though i guess.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah no worries.,i have 32gb g.skill trident ddr5 6000mhz.,i actually have capped the frames down lower now as my monitor only has a max refresh rate of 165hz.,"if i leave it uncapped, it peaks at over 500fps in orbit and around 300fps in the wild.",that's in pve and pvp.,it will drop a little when there is a high particle density activity on screen but it still stays high.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, i ran r23 for my tests",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thank god, it stays around 45c in idle and 60-75 under load when gaming and i see those gaming temps as normal, you saved a lot of stress ngl thank you",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"got it,thx man",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if those temps in idle stressing you - change to a balanced power plan.,it will allow the cpu to lower its clocks and temps,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"problem is i just started cinebench to test and it got to 100c almost instantly, that kinda sounds problematic right?",but other than that nothing stresses the cpu enough to go over 80 in the games i play,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a mag z790 tomahawk and ive checked online and it could be because some motherboards overclock the cpu as default?,should i try going in the bios first and checking voltage and stuff?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you do not have to use r23.,cpu under full load with an allowance of the motherboard will push itself as max as possible till it reaches thermal or voltage limits.,you may lower power limits so that r23 won't reach 100c which you run only a few times and then forget about it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to adjust voltages and especially detect what you have to change - it requires more experience than you have, sorry.",try that windows power plan at least,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"awww :(

in my past experience with killer, the driver often came bundled with software that touted itself as ""game boosting"" or ""lag reducing,"" and that was nothing more than a fancy way of saying qos or quality of service.","the killer networks control panel would have settings to play with, and disable, to fix the lower than expected speeds.","in the past i also remember software like amd quick stream getting installed onto pcs at the factory, and that was prone to slowing down the network for that pc, too.",but that is for some really old amd processors.,not likely that you have this installed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80mbps is suspiciously like 2.4ghz wi-fi performance.,open command prompt and type \`netsh wlan show interfaces\` and see what wi-fi band your laptop is joining.,"if it's 2.4ghz, go to your device manager, and change the killer network adapter to prefer 5ghz or 6ghz.","that is usually present on many dual band cards, especially ones from intel.",the same command will also allow you to see the real time link speeds for the card if you're curious.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if there's any problem with your gpu then it's a huge pain in the ass to troubleshoot without integrated graphics on your cpu unless you happen to be one of the people who have spare gpu's sitting around.,i really dislike it when people recommend new builders cpu's without integrated graphics.,it can be the difference between them continuing with the hobby or saying screw it and buying prebuilt in the future.,"regardless, either way i prefer to have a cpu with integrated graphics.",it doesn't cost that much more (if anything) and if nothing else it lets you use your computer if your gpu dies and you don't have a spare.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no before i had a i5-8400 and yes i could buy a 12/13400f but some of my friends said that i should buy some with an graphic unit, if the gpu has a problem i can run it in the cpu and the motherboards for an lga1700 are much expensive as one for an lga1200.","i could bought an 11400 but i wanted to have a bit more power, and i have to buy a new motherboard, not only for the chip if i upgrade again, because i have ddr4 ram and if i buy a new gen chip, i will be ddr5 ram",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

your friends gave you poor advices here.,the benefits of having the gpu in the cpu is absolutely negated and destroyed by the performance difference you gave up.,besides you can get a 20$ gpu if and when you need.,which in my experience is extremely rare for 99% of people.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

after many uninstalls and different versions i put your settings and so far so good man.",not sure how i got it to work first time around (it was on autonegotiation before this format)  but i will not touch as i have torrents downloading and testing my games and no packet loss.,but wow i'm still thinking about returning the whole package and getting the 7950x3ds if they get rave reviews.,i want things to be plug and play not risk having the internet not working properly because of subpar equipment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i honestly don't know.,i always thought the same think.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did it fix the issue?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">(however it did say i had no connection upon installing windows 11--i was assuming it was a slight bug, but not this scale)

that's because the i226-v driver is not included with the windows installation package.",there's a link to load a driver when it asks what drive you want to install on.,"back in the day when raid drivers were first arriving on the scene, you couldn't even see any drives, until you loaded the drivers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nope.,it's been a week and i haven't had any problems yet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what driver version did you end up with?,im on the same mobo myself and nothing seems to be working,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"out of curiosity, what switch?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what switch?,itâ€™s entirely possible the switch is the issue.,"at least with the i225-v, many of its communications issues (if not due to a marginal cable, also known to be a big problem even if the cable works fine with other nics) are hardware-based and relate to it â€œnot likingâ€ to communicate with certain other device, whatever that device may be.","so if youâ€™re connected to a router, adding a switch can help.","if connected to a switch, a different switch might help.",not saying this is ideal or even vaguely acceptable.,just trying to offer possible workarounds.,however if the i226 has entirely new hardware issues that donâ€™t have the same solutions (or any solution) then thatâ€™s pretty bad.,or perhaps all this is just sucky drivers and the hardwareâ€™s actually fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is the switch?,has it been there all the time?,it may very well be the issue.,"the point is just that the intel nic doesnâ€™t like whatever is at the other end, and sometimes changing this solves the issue (more specifically with low speeds and disconnects / a network cable is unplugged errors than the other i225-v issues).","problem is you can change to something new that it still doesnâ€™t like, since there seems to be a fair amount it doesnâ€™t like.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

glad itâ€™s working!,"i donâ€™t think anyoneâ€™s specifically nailed down what the i225/i226 doesnâ€™t like, but i suspect some of it may be due to aggressive eco-mode on some switches/routers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah, at that point itâ€™s really the intel nic not liking whatever the other nic is doing.",i know â€œnon standards complianceâ€ has been blamed.,"butâ€¦ while the intel chip does work very well when itâ€™s working, why the heck is it so incredibly fault intolerant?",shouldnâ€™t a really good design be able to cope smartly with pretty much anything thrown at it?,but i digressâ€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i know that using out of support software ain't gonna make things easy of course.,"concerning the drivers, i have them, it's just that the scs package isn't included with them (nor any me driver for that matter if i recall correctly) and to clarify amt does work fine, it's just that i cant configure it how i want to because the bios eoes not have the options i need (wireless access and acm), i can access it no problem with meshcommander when it's connected to the lan because i could configure that in the bios.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s about 8-10â€™c cooler now vs. the stock mobo contact frame.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looks neater vs the ilm too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i saw a 0.4c difference when i did mine on an asus z790 strix mb.,it was negligible.,glad you had better results though!,kind of jealous,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i tried letting the ""ai"" do the oc on my brand new i5-13600k.",oh boy.. first cinebench at 100c.,never again letting ai doing overclocking :d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm glad to hear this.,"i installed mine from day one on an asus maximus z790 extreme and didn't have anything to reference it to, except the ltt video i watched.",so thanks for sharing mate!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the contact frame, do you have to get the the underside of the motherboard to install it?","wondering if i should get it, but with my case i would have to completely disconnect my motherboard and remove it from the case to get to the underside of it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which cpu cooler do you use?,"ðÿ¤”
because i use an nh-u12a and read that the heat connection plate is a bit convex bent already so that a contact frame does not help a lot here.",i already have about 28-30â°c in idle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
installed mine for a whopping 1-3 degree difference lol.,"oh well, piece of mind that the ihs won't warp over time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i just changed mine too using the thermalright frame aswell, i am not sure if i installed it correctly but i did not see any difference in temp on my 13700k paired with noctua d15h with custom 140mm 3000rpm fan(s) full speed.",i am not sure whether i got a fake kryonaut thermalpaste as thats a common thing now or i did a horrible job mounting the contact frame.,undervolted to -0.085 at full load i was at 90c with or without the thermalright contact frame,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you think it can have some pretty awesome temperature drops on the i7 13700k as well?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you use liquid metal?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
will this work for a i9 13900k?,my pc usually idles between 37-41 degrees but dosent seem to go higher than 88 degrees under full load.,gaming it never reaches 60,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
was the installation process ok ?,i've read multiple people losing memory channels due to either overtightening or under tightening.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i used one on my 13600k, 7 degress lower was a massive difference, i was able to push the p cores to 5.7 ghz",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had very minimal improvement on mine something like 2-3c and zero change on the core to core variance.,i'm very jealous of your results!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just put mine in on a asus hero z690 with the 12900k.,"depending on the room temps, iâ€™m noticing roughly a 6 degree drop!",iâ€™m impressed as well (i did the thermal grizzly frame),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
glad you posted this and more are getting around to doing this.,helps quite a bit for temps.,did this for 12th gen and my 13th gen builds and it came out great for both and piece of mind of no bending of the cpu over time :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the ""stock mobo contact frame"" is called the ilm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just got this a few weeks ago havent changed mine yet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is that during heavy duty like benchmarking?,"because for mine, after switching, the idle temperature didnâ€™t change (well, considering i had 34c, it was already decent iâ€™d say?)",but it went down probably 7-8c at peak temperature during fpu stress,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what temps are we talking about now?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"same here, i have the same board.",i see no difference using the contact frame but since i already installed it i kept it anyway.,"still the same 85-88c max running r23 at 5.5ghz/4.3ghz with the frame, ambient is 25/27c.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think the flatness of your coldplate/heatsink could have something to do with it.,"many are not flat but convex, which may work with a standard ilm, but the contact plate changes the flatness of the cpu, making it flatter, so them convex coldplates now have poor contact.",i checked my new corsairs h170i's coldplate and could see daylight when i laid a razors edge on it.,definitely not flat and perhaps the cause of the problem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"me too, but given what happens to jay2cents chip over a few months or whatever, its just peace of mind (his temps got worse over time after being fine at first).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that thing is â€œaiâ€ in name only.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no you wonâ€™t need the underside at all.,you unscrew the ilm from the top side and then screw in the contact frame.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have corsairâ€™s h150i elite 360mm rad, and my cpu temps were slightly higher.",i guess this simple solution somehow solved the thermal issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> does not help a lot here.,how much did it help?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yup,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"why not, as 13700k runs very hot, too especially if you decide to oc it.","i have even seen people complaining about i5 13600kâ€™s temps, that on stock configuration (5.1ghz), it runs very hot.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
absolutely.,"i have the thermal-grizzly contact frame with arctic mx6 paste with pl1 set to 288w, no oc, on my 13700k.","lowest average core temps were 23c, highest 73c, averaging 32c.","cpu package 29c, 72c, 38c respectively.",these were taken from hwinfo thatâ€™s been running 32hrs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sure thing.,it even lowered my puny i5-12600 non-k by 5 to 6c.,now i wonder if i can delid this thing and apply liquid metal between the core and ihs for even lower temps.,"not that i need it, but tinkering with pc and its components is a hobby of mine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" no, i have applied the thermal grizzly kryonaut thermal paste, as i had that available.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the installation process is relatively straightforward.,just make sure to follow the proper installation process for optimum results.,[you can watch this video tutorial (14:52) for that.,"](https://youtu.be/iyu1oskby-q)

all the best!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cheers!,"yeah, i did for my peace of mind, too, as i was a bit annoyed with those high cpu temps and to get the most out of the i9.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah definitely, but no risk of voiding the warranty.","plus, it was as simple as unscrewing and screwing back four screws ðÿ˜‚

have you delidded yours?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"change it asap, i had mine for weeks and was too lazy.",but finally get my lazy ass to install it.,"didnâ€™t even need to drain my custom loop, i just pop off the ilm and mounted it with my case upright lol.","temp drop by 9 degree in prime, same thermal paste.",honestly donâ€™t know how they f up the design so badly on this ilm.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, 34â€™c idle temp is great already.","i have a similar drop (7-8â€™c) in benchmarking, but in games, the drop is slightly higher.",i think it also depends on what thermal paste you are using.,"i have applied thermal grizzly kryonaut as it is the most efficient one, imo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i had the same tbh, ambient is around 20-22c and idle mine runs at ~31c, under load (cinebench) my avg is 67c which i think was 1c less than changing the bracket.","but iâ€™d still recommend it since it holds the cpu straighter, no uneven pressure",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"cool, thank you!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"havent tried it yet but i read on the internet that it would not help here more than 1-3â°c, because the cooler plate is already a bit convex.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i've got 73c max on my cpu by undervolting it -0.150mv
would it really make a difference to add the thermal grizzly contact frame?",i mean 70c is already pretty cool for a cpu under heavy load,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it will be harder to sell your cpu if you delid, consider this in case you wanted to upgrade after selling parts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

do you think this is worth it for my 13600k?,"when oc at 5.6ghz on all pcores, my avg is usually 58c, my max is 64c.",idle temps are around 28 to 30c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you are right.,my previous delidded cpu was i7-6700k and i gave it to a friend in need of a semi-decent cpu.,it's still happily running basic stuff the last time i heard.,i'm always thinking about upgrading.,"but since i'm using lg 42"" oled tv (4k120hz, g-sync compatible), i'm afraid the performance boost would be quite small.",maybe i will get a new cpu when most new games need 8 real cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

es has bugs left in the design that do funky things.they go out to help oem vendors qualify stuff.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

from what i understand 13th gen processors run pretty warm compared to previous.,"my 13700k idles at 35, 38-40 for light internet browsing or youtube",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that idle is fine - usually my 13900k idles around 40c.,"the sudden spikes are normal, as usually light loads will boost up to 5.8 ghz and vcore will be around 1.4v or higher depending on your sp number.",this will cause it to heat up quickly while it boosts.,you can see this if you use hwinfo and change the polling speed to 500ms.,sometimes the default 2000ms won't pick up the boosts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

watch a youtube channel called techyescity and there is a russian called miyconst they have good content on v3 cpus.,"i personally use a 2678v3 - in gaming it comes close to a 7th or 8th gen i7 or a zen+ ryzen 5. if not for gaming you can run a hackintosh, setup a homelab with proxmox or run storage with true nas, ad blocker, next cloud, gateway etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"miyconst on youtube has a lot of content about theese xeons, check [this](https://youtu.be/prwqxnyxxa4) for example.","overall they are still pretty decent even for gaming, comparable to something like an i5 10400 or a ryzen 5 3600. 

with bios mods you can allow the cpu to boost to its maximum turbo on all cores and even enable resize bar.","but even without the turbo unlock the frequency it actually reaches will be much higher than the base 2.3ghz, closer to 3/3.5ghz.",which is still a low frequency but the big cache and quad-channel memory helps in games.,"basically if you don't pair them with something more powerful than a 3060 or 6600 you shouldn't have any bottleneck at 1080p, but of course it heavily depends on the specific game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a used 2667 v3 if you have turbo unlock or 2667 v4 if not is the best all purpose cpu for that platform.,"remember that even if you have turbo unlock, you will hit the tdp wall so...i would stongly recommend e5 2667 v4.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1. replace the cpu clip with a contact frame.",2. use good quality tim.,"i really like noctua nt-h2
3. undervolt your cpu as much as you can

at maximum fan rpm, the drp4 is still really quiet.","so quiet in fact that if you want to squeeze some extra cooling performance out of it, and you're handy with electronics, you can use a boost converter on the fan power supply to raise the fan voltage to 15-16 volts, which will increase the rpm and static pressure of the fans while only increasing the noise marginally.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

every motherboard is overvolting these chips at stock bios!,"every motherboard is setting ac_ll and dc_ll too high, the only difference with msi is it is easier to reduce these using their lite load setting.",people who manually tuned their 13900ks also get stock speeds at under 1.3v and no longer hit 100c sustained in cinebench.,"if you bothered to contact asus support and asked the same thing, they would tell you the same thing - stock ll values are for worst case scenario, reduce / increase them on a chip by chip basis to what works.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mine doesnt behave as badly as ops tho but still,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did they really suggest a â€œpremiumâ€ thermal paste lol?,all pastes are within 2-3c of each other unless they are using some no name stuff from ali express.,iâ€™m betting a contact frame would bring your cpu temps down but i doubt they would offer that.,"it would have to be something you did on your own and if you bought a pre built, itâ€™s not something youâ€™d be willing to do nor how to do it.",did you tell them your idle temps are now higher?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"original temps seem normal, and new radiator location explains the increased temps.",instead of outside air intake with exhaust into case you now have case air intake with exhaust outside of case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have the same cpu and had the same problem with heating.,"your cpu dosnt have power limit in the bios settings (currently set to unlimited) 

you can set pl1 o 125watt and pl2 to 253watt

also you can undervolt your cpu

you can increase pl2 to higher value if the temperature stays below 100c under stress test",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

cpu lite mode 9 (auto) is the default for the 13900k.,you changed it to mode 10 which increases the voltage above stock default values.,you've made the chip hotter by doing this.,you want to go down in mode.,typically you'll be able to run mode 7 stable.,you can even run mode 6 on a board with a good vrm.,it may crash though on that board.,don't play with bios until you learn what these things do or you could cause yourself more problems.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

my whole thought process going into this was getting basically the best... 360mm right now  is non negotiable for me lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
one thing to keep in mind is what is the ambient temperature in the room when you are looking at temps.,it can impact the idle and load temps a lot.,you should try to compare a change at the same ambient temp.,itâ€™s also going to go up the longer you game since itâ€™s dumping heat in the room.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"bin is simply how good a chip is compared to others, 'golden bin' usually refers to the top 1-5%, bottom bin meaning weakest.","normally this is based on how well they overclock, higher clock at lower voltage = good, low clocks / requires a lot of voltage to pc = bad / bottom bin.",based on 'binning' which is when chip manufactures test and handpick chips for different speeds / core counts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

artist need fast single threaded performance and these workstation chips are much slower than the 13900k at single core performance.,yes we need fast multithreaded performance as well but most of the things we do interactively on our pcs arenâ€™t heavily multithreaded.,for example character animators in maya need high single core frequency to improve the performance of character rigs because most of mayas functions arenâ€™t heavily multithreaded.,at best maybe theyâ€™ll use a couple threads so your rigs functions need to process as fast as possible to animate.,these xeons are slower than a 13900k in this situation.,the same can be said in zbrush where your sculpting performance depends on one core.,the rest of the cores render the geometry in real-time but the faster a single core is determines how smooth your sculpting functions are.,rendering is of course multithreaded but thatâ€™s not an interactive process usually.,so as a threadripper user that bought a 13900k for the better single threaded performanceâ€¦ i donâ€™t see these workstation chips being the solution for most creative tasks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"hi there,

this need for single threaded performance (as well as good multi-threaded performanc) during the whole content creation workflow is actually why we have our intel turbo boost max tech 3.0 frequencies, to help with the system responsiveness.","(check the processor pages on ark.intel.com for each frequency)

we also understand that when it comes to workstations, it comes down to the ""right tool for the right job"".",our intel core processors are great for some tasks and our intel xeon w processors are great for other.,this topic actually gets me thinking about a video idea to talk about.,iamintel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'd guess that cooling those monsters is quiet easy.,power consumption is pretty low for its size,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's 1600 mm^2 of silicon.,"that's over twice the size of a 4090.  it's a lot of heat, but it's not particularly dense.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"it's possible but even on my 3970x (threadripper 32 cores) the max frequency on a single core is 4.5.

it will depend on the chip and what intel lets us do.","i mean if it's like the 13900k where we can define how many cores boost to 6ghz then sure, it might be ok.

the problem though with these massive core counts is it becomes much harder to run all the cores at higher frequencies, and the reason you buy these chips is for the massive core counts is the incredible multi threaded performance across all the cores.",but it usually sacrifices the single core performance.,but you're right.,we'll see what intel lets us do in terms of settings.,i know with threadripper you couldn't really boost a core past 4.5 at all.,the chip liked keeping all the cores in sync speed wise.,intel however with 13900k does let us configure the individual core performance a bit more.,it will be interesting to see but i would still expect single core performance to be lower due to the fact that intel isn't at all promising anything higher than 4.8 when we know the 13900k cores can go up to 5.5ghz easily.,we'll see.,gpu rendering has become so fast on the 4090 that i am very happy on a 13900k with a 4090. the 13900k itself renders just slightly slower than my threadripper but it has significantly better single threaded performance when working.,it really is a big difference.,i can live with slightly less render performance.,cinebench r23 multi on threadripper is 45k where as 13900k is 40k.,i can live with it because gpu rendering is so fast.,"my threadripper doesn't stand a chance against the 4090 :) so these high core count xeons, while great... are going to be paired with gpu rendering, and thanks to more pcie lanes, more gpus.. and perhaps thats the real benefit of these chips.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the spec sheet for the w9-3495x says it can draw 420w.,no consumer cpu has ever drawn that much before.,even my threadripper pro at 280w overwhelms a standard aio.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's not the density i worry about, it's the tdp.",up to 420 watts!,"obviously tdp from generation to generation doesn't mean the same thing because it's basically a made-up metric, but still, the days of cooling your hedt cpu with a 240mm rad are probably over with numbers like that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"even if there were 400w aios, there's nothing with a block that will fit one of these.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
air cooling will work well.,420w isn't that much when you consider the die size.,gpus can also be easily cooled without water at 450w+,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
air coolers definitely can.,420w is quite a lot for cpus but compared to gpus it's not that high.,even 3090ti can draw significantly more power and stays relatively cool.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 7980xe and it's refreshes could draw 500w+ while overclocked and that was a much smaller cpu which was sort of coolable with watercooling.,also there was that overclockable 28 core xeon that pulled more and is still smaller than these new ones will be.,will be interesting to see just how much power that 56 core will pull when overclocked if the base power draw is already so high.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"that is true, though gpus are direct die and have custom coolers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's a great point but look at the size of those gpu coolers.,something will need to be purpose designed to do that for a cpu and still allow ram and gpu clearance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gpu coolers aren't that much bigger though.,being a pcie card limits the dimensions of the cooler itself.,"a 3090ti (asus tuf gaming) is only like 1,6kg including fans and gpu.",so it's probably like 1.2kg max for the cooler.,that's close to the weight of a noctua nh d15 and even by volume it's pretty similar.,a cube like form is way more space efficient than anything that has to go inside a pcie slot.,nh d15 sized air coolers should easily be able to cool this cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for comparison: a 3090ti fe is 33.6cm ã—6.1cm ã— 14cm = 2,869cm^2

"as it has been said, the 3ghz is the base frequency when the cpu is idle/under light load.",when you put it under load it can boost up to 5.70ghz if it is supplied enough power or has enough temperature headroom to keep it from being throttled.,put your cpu under stress (actual stress test like cinebench/occt/prime95/kombuster cpu burner/etc and not just gaming. ),"if you can't get it to reach at least 5.7ghz, there could be a few reasons:

1. cpu is  power is limited, the first time you go into the msi bios it should ask you to choose your cooler type, that change your power limit, if you pick ""water cooling"" it will technically have your power limited uncapped, if you choose box cooler pl is limited to 181w(this will limit your 13900k's performance) and tower cooler will cap your power draw to 288(iirc).","2. you have avx offset enabled and the stress test is using avx instruction, this lower your frequency when avx is detected to keep your cpu from reaching the max temperature and getting throttled.",3. your cpu has reached the max temperature and is being throttled.,"gaming can boost your cpu to the maximum clock speed but it will not put your cpu under full load, giving you the wrong idea that there is more temperature headroom than you have.","ps: if the only thing you have changed in bios is the boot order, make sure you go back in and enabled xmp or your ddr5 rams will not run at advertised speed.","when you are in the bios, look for cpu cooler tuning, this is the cooler selection mentioned in 1), make sure water cooling is selected.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the thing about the default fan curve is the fans should only go on full blast when high temperature is detected, which makes your 43c under load temperature kind of unbelievable because, at that temp, the fans should only be spinning at about 50%, it shouldn't be that loud but i digress, maybe you have some really good cooling system or cool ambient.","i don't have the 13900k but i can tell how hot it is gonna be just by reading the specs, at 253w power draw it is gonna produce immense heat.","i own the 13600k, slightly overclocked but undervolted, with air cooler, +-85c during cinebench.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"all i can say is, try running cinebench again and then monitor it with proper software, not cpu block nor msi but proper software like hwinfo, since your original question is about overclocking, check the temperature of cpu package, max boost frequency, loads %, power usage, check during the tests and not after.","if what you say is true and your temperature is indeed 42c under full load then you have lots of headroom for oc, time to play with the numbers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is a good review  no bs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seeing this and his 4090 video about power consumption really drills in how full throttle these companies are pushing their silicon.,i wish these companies would push a more consumer friendly way to tweak the power settings.,"like a power saver/balanced/performance toggle because the efficiency is there, it's just hidden behind bios tweaks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how does he measure actual powerdraw?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is that how you power limit your cpu?,just set those three values from bios?,never done that before.,and is there other ways to do that (like from windows)?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if it's from a good brand and can handle well power transients, sure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
problem is gpu power limits are only enforced when you load in nvapi hooked by afterburner or other tool.,this essentially means if gpu decides to load 500w before afterburner is loaded for like 1 second you are potentially screwed.,with cpu it is better as power limits you can enforce in bios on booting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"meh itâ€™s mostly about stock performance, people usually buy the new shiny parts and just plug and play so most day one reviews are like that.",most people never dive deeper into these types of subjects except for tech enthusiasts like most people here are.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yah it seems like that might be the way of the future honestly if you don't care about bragging rights for cinebench scores.,"i already set a 150w limit on my 9900k, i saw no reason to let it run upwards of \~190-200w.",i haven't decided if i'll make the jump to 13th gen or wait it out for 14th gen.   but i bet i'll use a power limit on those as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cpu ang gpus comes basically overclocked by the manufacturer to run near max by tossing away efficiency.,it makes me miss the days where it wasnâ€™t the case.,or just have everything run at eco mode at default and let people who want an easy juice run full throttle i guess.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you really want a 13900k when you don't know how to use it?,a ferrarri is not suitable for any inexperienced driver.,get a 13600k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why/how would the gpu do 500w before afterburner is loaded as windows startup program?,"the most i can see it doing is random max clock spikes with max memory speed, which idk know how much power that would be wth 24gb of gdd6x, probably less than 150w, based on the fact that 3080 random short spikes with maxed memory and clock speed, are like ~100w.",let's throw some transient spike in mix as well so let's say 200-250w max,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"doesn't have to be mutually exclusive unless you're trying to win benchmarks, which not all people buying expensive parts care about.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"of course it's just my opinion, but i'm using it mostly for gaming where all 16 e cores do basically nothing but add heat.",i do some video decoding where i could take advantage of all the cores full blast.,in those 2 situations i could run the cpu with the e cores throttled and with the p cores capped at like 150w because i don't need 300fps in every game i play.,if there was a couple of easy toggles i'd probably run it capped most of the time so i'm not dumping as much heat in my room.,but since i'd like the headroom if i need it in the future i'd like to have a couple toggles outside of bios tweaking.,that's all i was saying.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it could be a silicon lottery loser chip chip and a motherboard that is more zealous on voltage.,that would not be all too surprising as each chip will use different voltages.,and it's not unheard of for a board day one to have some voltage issues and when you consider they probably tested with early bios it's possible.,but it's not impossible they upped stock voltage but i'd think one of the other two may be more likely,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

basically they're just tuned to match amd's infinity fabric.,intel is far less timing sensitive than amd so your performance gap is a lot smaller with worse tuned kits.,on intel a 6400 cl40 kit won't perform significantly worse than a 6400 cl36 kit.,while on amd a 6000 cl30 kit will decently outperform a 6000 cl36 kit (other sub timings are also important).,"no biggie, it's just advertised for amd because the subtimings are different.",still works 100% on intel with imperceptible performance differences.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah they are.,itâ€™s a bios glitch.,once you update bios you have to remove your cpu and put it back in and youâ€™ll get the real score.,mine was sp125 then i updated it and removed the cpu and reinstalled it and i got the real sp score of sp103.,on overclockers.,com one of the main ocâ€™ers has tested about 100 chips and the highest real sp he got was 118. he was the one that posted you need to update bios and then remove and reinstall to get actual number.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
flash the latest bios (2103 or 2201beta) and update me firmware.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hey bud ya he messaged me he was able to get the latency down to 60 ns from 70 .,think he's shooting for 50 ns.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how do you even cool a 13900k at 1.45v?,:o are you running direct-die cooling?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so i guess e core sp score does matter even if you disable the e-waste cores and use p cores only but want to overclock p cores as much as possible with lowest voltage and best thermals as possible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah it's probably a pressure issue... many asked if i had a 1700 frame installed and indeed i have one installed... i might give the stock ilm a try and test it out... i swapped my tuf to an apex board and i got 6600 c30 out of a 6000 c40 kit which was like exactly what the previous owner of the mobo/ram achieved with his 12900k...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

how would you lose any single core performance if e-cores are off.,and why would one e-core help.,"&#x200b;

with e-cores off the 13900k is a super 8 core 16 thread chip quite a bit better in fact than the 7700x as the p cores of intel are better than amd zen 4 at same clock speed and they clock higher too.","update:

well someone over at [overclock.net](https://overclock.net) did say that somehow thee-cores being off totally did hurt single thread performance due to some arch change or arch and having 1 e-core on gets rud of that.",i tested that on win10 and got same exact cpu-z and cinebench single core score so did not see this bug.,"&#x200b;

though here is the thing:

&#x200b;

apparently the thread director causes issues and starts doing everything wrong with e-cores disabled.","&#x200b;

unfortunately you cannot disabled the thread director.","however if you use win10, the thread director is effectively disabled as win10 cannot interact with it.",so this issue appears on 12th gen as well.,so with win10 it should not be a problem at all with all e-cores off on 12th or 13th gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

for me it didn't really made a difference.,"i was struggling with 13600k temperatures, it would max out at 92c on cinebench r23.","installed the bracket, it went down to 90-91c.",so 1-2c difference max.,"but since its new pc, i guess cpu needs time to get bent, maybe thats why such small difference.","in the end i just undervolted, now getting 68c max with same performance lol.",instead of 180w cpu uses 130w.,undervolting will give 10x bigger impact than anti bend bracket,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think the 700 series motherboard + 13th gen has mostly fixed this issue.,thermal paste pattern looked pretty centre squished on the default ilm.,had no difference in temps after installation.,"though the default one was very tight, could be something that happens over time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i went from immediately hitting 100c in cinebench r23 multi to 90c for the full 10 minutes by just installing the contact frame.,i had wild temp variance on my p cores and now they are very similar.,its a no brainer if you will attempt to overclock.,i expected no results at all but im blown away at the difference,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

watch a youtube channel called techyescity and there is a russian called miyconst they have good content on v3 cpus.,"i personally use a 2678v3 - in gaming it comes close to a 7th or 8th gen i7 or a zen+ ryzen 5. if not for gaming you can run a hackintosh, setup a homelab with proxmox or run storage with true nas, ad blocker, next cloud, gateway etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

with bios mods you can allow the cpu to boost to its maximum turbo on all cores and even enable resize bar.","but even without the turbo unlock the frequency it actually reaches will be much higher than the base 2.3ghz, closer to 3/3.5ghz.",which is still a low frequency but the big cache and quad-channel memory helps in games.,"basically if you don't pair them with something more powerful than a 3060 or 6600 you shouldn't have any bottleneck at 1080p, but of course it heavily depends on the specific game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a used 2667 v3 if you have turbo unlock or 2667 v4 if not is the best all purpose cpu for that platform.,"remember that even if you have turbo unlock, you will hit the tdp wall so...i would stongly recommend e5 2667 v4.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you will always be bottlenecked by something.,if you upgrade your cpu will you then go to nvidia subreddit and ask if you should buy a new gpu so you are not bottlenecked by your 3080?,that term is thrown around too much lately i feel.,"if you are getting fps that you are happy with there's no reason to upgrade anything just because of some ""bottleneck"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i would check temps under load and see if you may be thermal throttling the cpu at this point as itâ€™s been 4-5 years.,you may just need to re-paste the cpu and that may get rid of the stutters,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"itâ€™s not that iâ€™m not happy, i just seeing people with the same specs as me exocet with a better cpu, having a stutter free time.","iâ€™m not sure if mine is cpu related, or if it is another issue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you are exactly right haha, that game will the the death of me",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you think itâ€™ll be worth it plus the ddr5?,i feel like if i wait i might as well save up and get a 5xxx series card as well tbh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
occasional stutters are usually a sign of a badly optimized game rather than weak hardware.,"and to be fair, depending on the game and settings i'd guess that at 4k the 3080 is more likely to cause stutters and lower fps than anything else.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm convinced hl cares more about a fast cpu and ram than it does a beefy gpu.,i was on an overclocked 9900k up until recently and i'm glad i upgraded.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

rops are a useless metric for gaming.,donâ€™t even try to find logic here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there's not really a comparison here, because intel rops are different from amd rops.","in terms of implementation, how they execute graphics instructions, microcode, and more.","similar to how, back in the day, you couldn't compare one core of amd bulldozer to one core of intel sandybridge based on the number of cores and clock speed alone.","in my experience, amd's onboard gpus are generally quicker in raster and compute than the comparable intel onboard gpu.",intel will be better for media workloads.,given the same memory configuration.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that sound strange to me.,"vega8 is rated at 9 gpixel/s, while xe is rated at 30 gpixel/s.","rastering is a very simple solution that affect both resolution and aa performance, given the memory bandwidth, and amd usually has very high rops configurations, except with notebooks, where it is usually very low.",because the operations it does are very simple i think those numbers means actually something and would like to know more.,"i have no doubt that rastering with intel will be faster, i would like to know all the possible situations and scenarios where it gives a clear advantage given the memory bandwidth constraints.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the vega 8 is also pretty old compared to xe, so the best situation here is to try to find some real benchmarks and see how the two compete out.","part of the problem with intel performance may also be their drivers, and if arc is of any indication, there are a lot of bugs with frame times to work out that might not have been so prominent with the igpus.","amd has more experience in the field with ""game ready"" gpus so that ends up carrying over.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, let's say hypothetically, mine is a technical curiosity.","vega7/8 is really strange technology, even very old nvidia mobile (tablet!)",technology push more pixels (16 rops).,"looks like vega7/8 are more optimized for very old notebook screens with 1366x768 pixel resolution, like if 1080p or gaming do not exist in the mobile segment (still, below 1080p it does well).",it's a pain to find benchmarks with exact specs (both with ddr4 3200 at 1080p).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

neither z790 gaming edge wifi is more than enough if you dont mind silver color if do then carbon is a way better board than a strix f but its an overkill so i would look into tomahawk or something cheaper but to be honest if you dont mind the money then the carbon is a way to go.,just to let you know carbon is compared to a strix e version and the strix f version rival is the edge one so.,between these two the carbon is better in every single way and its not even close its a mind-high end board while the strix f is a clear mid range one.,ps: edge is even better than a strix cause it has 5x m.2 slots compared to 4x on a strix f and also the edge only use usb 3.1 4x and 3.2 besides the strix still use usb 2.0 so but it has start button on board (i am not sure if enyone realy needs it so).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

absolutely, its so funny that the strix e gaming version costs the same amount as the master lol.",paying 500 dollars for a mid-range board doesnt look very fair to me.,around 500 dollars the aorus master is a way to go its a perfectly fine high end board with crazy amount of features.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

also, that bit about the mc update is interesting, i have a post-update bios on my z690 aorus ultra and have not had problems with negative offsets and going well below defaults (well, i had to set ac/dc to ""power saving"" or it bottomed out too high and with too high temp - but the particulars of what is happening behind the scenes on giga boards can scramble your brains).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that you cannot go back and install older bios after you flash this one.,probably gonna disable undervolting lol.,if you dont have issues dont update,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

they didn't really change the architecture itself very much from zen3 to zen4.,the branch predictor has larger buffers but otherwise the frontend is basically the same.,"the backend is practically the same, with some increase in reordering capacity.",l2 cache is bigger.,that's pretty much it.,basically the execution capacity is the same but the buffer sizes have increased.,they have at most small single digit gains from zen3.,apart from avx-512 of course.,what they achieved is way higher clocks at reasonable power.,"this would have been big in later half of ""intel being on top"" when intel had to release the same architecture multiple times and had no ipc improvement.",but this isn't big compared to skylake to sunny cove or sunny cove to golden cove.,it's probably somewhat similar to intel's improvement from broadwell to skylake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah the 13400 is basically just a locked down 12600k.,"if you can find the 13400f for around $200 or less then its a decent value upgrade from a 12100 if you need more cores/cache

"intel publishes ""base clock"" speeds, which as far as i can tell are a pretty useless metric for judging performance.",there's two different metrics you'll care about here - singlethreaded and multithreaded performance.,"singlethreaded performance is determined by how high of a clockspeed an individual core can boost to, and how many instructions it can execute per clock cycle.",the 1235u can boost higher and execute more instructions per cycle than the 1135g7.,"multithreaded performance is more complicated, but in general more cores and a higher power budget leads to more multithreaded performance.","the 1235u has more cores, but is only ""intended"" to use 15 watts, while the 1135g7 is ""intended"" to use 28 watts.","the 1235u at 15 watts gets about the same multithreaded performance as the 1135g7 at 28 watts, but most importantly:

do keep in mind that it's not as simple as comparing cores and frequencies since they are different generations of cpus.,"two examples:

1. one of the biggest differences between intel 11th and 12th gen parts are the move from only ""big"" cores to a mix of ""big"" and ""little"" cores

2. there is usually an ipc increase every new generation, which translates to more work being done for the same frequency (which is one of the reasons for not strait comparing frequencies cross generation)

glad it helped :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have no idea how its doing what its doing and maybe its even just asrock naming the menu wrong.,here's how it looks.,https://imgur.com/a/2wckr34,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah.,as i wrote i also had weird problems applying changes.,hwmonitor did show offsets but the behavior could just go back to stock when i did changes.,then needed a new reboot and the settings were actually taking effect in practice.,but now they just work like this even if i reboot etc.,its just when making changes that it was unreliable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh man i've pretty much gave up my build because of these issues.,it's throwing 1.5v at my 13700k and i can't do anything to settle it down.,i'll have to give xtu a try tomorrow.,do the xtu settings become permanent or do you have to anyways run it at boot?,i also can't get turbo and idle clocks to work.,it just runs at the lowest turbo multiplier 24/7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what is your pl?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hey!,i havent really touched the pl settings at all just voltage.,i would assume that the time setting doesnt matter at that point.,for a simple undervolt i would just suggest applying -100 in the core offset in the fivr menu but that still just makes the wattage a stable 230 at 100% all core workload.,havent actually checked the gaming wattage much.,on wattage limit settings i have no info yet as i havent tried them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hey!,cant remember sorry :(.,i distinctly remember seeing something resemblibg turbo enhancement or something like it but cant remember where.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the exact difference?,no.,all i can tell you is to just play with a negative core voltage offset in fivr menu and see what happens.,for me it never broke anything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah it seems because of the plundervolt vulnerability xtu probably wont get fixed.,i think throttlestop is the only option to do this properly in windows.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think it's a legacy naming then, asrock didn't bother to change it correctly.","also as i mentioned previously, no point in touching l2 voltage (e-cores vcore) and ring voltage, as you'll have same voltage applied to each three of them anyway, value of the highest among these three.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ok heh.,well this has been a confusing couple of days.,thanks for the info :).,i agree that the e-core offset doesnt really do anything as i was just testing there.,setting a separate ring offset did effect voltages tho.,i could not get the voltages to budge under 1.27 with just the core offset.,"ring offset finally got them to 1.245.

but i havent tested ring invidually without any core offset so i will do that tonight to see if thats the only thing i really need to adjust.",edit: not saying youre wrong in general but this is the behavior i observed so something wonky going on there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm running z690 wifi & i've hit all the same bugs op has.,right now i can't get into windows.,"windows was a few days old install & i thought i finally found stability & an ""acceptable"" (bcus i had enough, i was done screwing around) but suboptimal config.",so decided to wipe everything & do a fresh install again bcus figured the number of bluescreens i had while testing might have consequences down the road.,now the windows installer can't detect the nvme drive.,apparently updating the bios without first updating the intel me firmware can cause this.,my workaround was using ntlite to embed all the latest updates and drivers into the windows image.,"now it detects the drive, copies all the setup files, does the first reboot, then just continues bootlooping forever.","so i gave up until i have time to screw around with it again, i've lost all motivation to mess with it for the time being &  do not look forward to spending many more hours troubleshooting it.",the supposed solution for the nvme thing is putting the drive in another slot.,"but it's under the heatsink & i have the liquid metal set just right and no more left.i'll probably just stick in an old sata ssd, install windows to it, update the me, then reflash the bios once again because apparently the order matters,  then  install to the nvme.","----------

edit: 
**apparently you flash the me using the same file you flash the bios with**.",*a note somewhere saying they came in the same rom would have been nice.,"*

i thought it came from the windows me driver installer.","but couldn't find it by 7-zip extracting the executable contents (thought it would be embedded), so i then resorted to installing windows to the sata ssd, but it too would just bootloop (`vmd=enabled` was culprit).",next i spent like an hour trying to find an me firmware bin or rom.,"i got desperate enough that i was gonna flash an me meant for asus, but it wouldn't let me flash it (wouldn't appear in the available files to flash list).","but i noticed the bios file was listed so figured, what the heck, might as well see what happens ( *^hadn't ^discovered ^the ^`vmd` ^issue ^yet ^so ^imo ^shit ^was ^already ^fubar ^& ^couldn't ^get ^worse* ).",to my surprise it then proceeded to do an entirely different from bios flash procedure and was successful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the issue preventing boot was that i apparently toggled on ""vmd"".","regarding voltages, it took a ridiculous amount of tinkering in fivr with both core v/f offsets & ring offsets.","the big ones that actually result in changes are:

* core v/f offset 1 through 5 then 10 & sometimes 11 if the rest become to distant from 11.","* ring v/f offsets 1 through 5 then 10 & sometimes 11. 

basically all the offsets are tied together & you can't have one too distant from its neighbors or the ring offset.",you _must_ use `adaptive selection` for both core & vf offsets.,"examples:

* if you change core offset 6, 7, 8, or 9 and there's no observed change, then change 4, 5 or 10.","* if there's still no change, then change the equivalent ring offsets, particularly 4, 5 or 10.","* if there's still no change after ring offsets, then change offset 11 or 1. 

basically there's an invisible boundary that depends on the other values.","in order to achieve roughly 1.3v in windows, i'm using the values pictured.","some of the values like #7, #9, & #10 are out of range and are having no effect, in this config they're being limited by their neighbors #6, #8, & #11. https://i.imgur.com/zzrtpol.jpg.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yep, with much few execution units to save expensive die space.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why iris xe when thereâ€™s arc though?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it uses too much die space for a desktop part that is really meant to pair with a gpu card.,"if you want a mini-pc without gpu card, there are lots of nuc style mini-pcs that use the laptop part with bigger gpu.",also amd stopped releasing ryzen g for desktop at the 5000 series.,"amd desktop have either no gpu at all, or very weak one in the new 7000 series.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">also amd stopped releasing ryzen g for desktop

amd desktop apus always launch later than their cpu counterparts, confirmed by amd's leaked desktop roadmaps showing the sucessor to the 5000g series as launching later this year: [https://twitter.com/sebuahsarang/status/1575738480063549440](https://twitter.com/sebuahsarang/status/1575738480063549440)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
imo the apus just seem to be in an awkward space where they're more than most people (that aren't playing games on pcs) need and not enough for actually demanding gaming.,"like sure the amd one is twice as fast as intel's current, so you get 30fps instead of 15. and you spend a lot of die area to get there.",that's cool for the steam deck but otherwise seems not worth it in most cases.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not holding my breath on that one.,we have only had 5000 series apu since 2021 and that was kind of compromised as a cpu with it's low cache.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no.,it's an over-priced bespoke small form factor pc.,if you want a small pc just build an itx pc using one of the dozens of great small form factor pc cases.,"will be cheaper, perform the same or better, and use standard parts.",and the arc 770 gpu is weak with buggy drivers.,terrible buy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you looked at the nuc 13 extreme i7 model?,much more powerful system.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm in the same boat.,can't decide whether to build an itx or go for intel nuc.,"the arc 770m on the serpent canyon on paper is on par with a desktop 3060. but as an engineering student i need to use engineering softwares like solidwork, cad and matlab in the uni and there're people saying intel gpu drivers aren't yet optimised so i don't know if it can run without issue",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"to maximize your chances of never throttling,

1. buy a contact frame for your cpu to maximize contact area with your cooler.",2. have good thermal paste contact between cpu and cooler.,3. have a case with good airflow.,4. undervolt your cpu to minimize power dissipation while maximizing performance.,i use intels xtu and cinebench r23.,"start at -0.05,v.",my score went from 37k @ 330w(stock) to 39k @270w at -0.055v.,p cores run at 5500mhz.,e cores run at 4400mhz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ok...will try to look for something similar in my asus tuf gaming mobo, if it exists.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whats the pricing for each in your area,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well the t models have lower all core turbo boost.,i didn't find out until i got my i5-12600t installed as it hard to find the info on the internet.,the single core on it can hit 4.6ghz.,my 12600t hits 45w full load @3.7ghz.,the full core boost is about the same for the 12500t and the 12600t in multiscore.,you definitely want to get the non-t variant as it can hit the higher all core frequency without pulling that much more power.,"i only for this processor to overclock on certain boards, which is hard to find cheaply.","the 12600t works for me, alot faster than the skylake i came from.","this processor isn't for gaming, unless it's a mid to low end graphics card.","the price for a used 12600k isn't much more, you can always power limit or undervolt it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in reality the 12500t is quite hard to find in my area.,however i wanted to discuss/understand the principle behind it disregarding any price point.,"benchmarks and logic dictate that the 12500 is obviously a more performing cpu than the 12500t, but is that still the case if tdp is capped at 65w?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"generally you can set any cpu to have any power limit, so there is no reason to prefer either.",you'd buy whichever is cheaper and set the power limits to whatever made sense for the application.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
both can have their tdps elevated (assuming not locked down by the board).,"so itâ€™s basically a moot point, unless youâ€™re forced to follow the stock tdps.","the next question you need to ask is why is the board 65w limited, and whatâ€™s going to happen if you try to run at the maximum all the time?",is the system going to overheat?,are the vrms / power supply really crappy?,and something to remember: itâ€™s the same cpu!,with just some different multiplier upper limits and stock tdp limits.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if your bsod then your likely on the very edge of your undervolt being stable.,honestly id do more stability tests just to make sure that its stable in all loads but other than that i would leave it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you get bsod at idle it's from very low voltage at idle.,you can get around this to some degree by upping idle speed or minimum speed in windows power plan.,this may allow you to push for a lower offset and have even lower voltage at heavier loads.,your idle voltage will stay similar but clocks will go up.,but there are definitely diminishing returns past -0.125v offset.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
anyone used one on a z790 board with success?,saw a forum thread on toms where some guy said the ilm screws were too short on a z790 tuf which didnâ€™t make sense to me.,i have a z790 hero coming in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i didn't use a contact frame for my 13600k in my z690 motherboard and it's nice and cool at 35 c at idle.,"i did put extra thermal paste on, specifically with the intention of ensuring that any gaps would be filled, including from poor contact with the air cooler.","i would try that first, and then invest in a contact frame if you're not satisfied with you're idle temps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"a bit late to this post, but i have a 13900k with z790 mobo, was running 31-35 idle for a month.",bought a contact frame and now i'm at 27-29 idle for a month.,total time tested is about 2 months.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i used it just fine with my z790 board.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i used the thermaltake frame on the z790 hero so youâ€™re definitely good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've installed mine on z790 that was before on my b660 and the pc has not booted ðÿ¤·â€â™‚ï¸,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
donâ€™t need thermal grizzly ones.,many cheaper ones on amazon that donâ€™t need to fiddle with tension settings.,i personally think the thermal grizzly ones are the worst choice for average users.,maybe extreme overclocked may be able to benefit to find an optimal tension for maximum overclocks.,but many other providers that you just tighten it down a bit and you are good to go.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they're cheap and idk why you're mentioning idle temps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh my god i didn't know that was a thing.,"appreciate it, would have been pissed if i missed out on that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh, i bought mine from amazon, does that disqualify me?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
supposedly the 13th gen wasn't going to have the issue but it appears that isn't completely true.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ok thanks good to hear, maybe itâ€™s just an issue with that specific board or he made a mistake",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as far as i'm aware it's recommended only a quarter turn.,i like the thermal grizzly ones because they already have position markings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because idle temps being off can help identify when your cpu doesn't have good contact with the cooler.,"and yes, the contact frame is cheap, but people with parts in hand usually don't want to wait for another part, if it's not necessary.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"amazon is in the list under the link i shared above, so just check and confirm with them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you ever figure out how to get mwii?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that guy responded back to that post saying that he had the screws for a z690 board and not the z790 board screws.,they explained to him the proper screw sizes that he needed and all was fine.,"""hello there,

i have to apologize to you, the frame is released for the 13th gen and the z790 chipset.","you would then need unc 6/32 screws that are longer than 7mm""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you end up doing it?,i'm using a 13900k and the thermal grizzly contact frame but i'm worried the screws were too short and my temps constantly hit 95 while gaming for a second and then back down and they stay mid 80s while playing modern warfare 2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"agreed, this is the one time where looking at idle temps make sense.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes i used the thermalright contact frame though and the screw length was fine.,according to the guy above the person with the issue was using the wrong screws.,iâ€™m using the arctic liquid freezer ii 360 and pl1 and pl2 set to 270w.,i never see 90 degrees unless iâ€™m benchmarking.,gaming itâ€™s usually in the 60s maybe 70. what cooler are you using?,are you running no power limit?,i know with the thermal grizzly there is more room for error because you have to get the tension right.,did you follow the gamers nexus instructions?,"also i would try repasting/remounting the cooler, the first time i mounted mine i messed up where it got at a weird angle and wasnâ€™t making good contact.",it was bound up on the bracket and not fully down on there.,i also found i got better temps with the spread method vs pea size.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so it must be the thermal grizzly contact frame, i'll just get the thermal right because i don't think the screws are long enough

 i use the exact same cooler, fml.",i wonder what screws to get for my z790 for the thermal right to work or the thermalgrizzly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hmm well the good news is the thermalright is only 12 bucks.,it should work fine with the stock screws for the ilm because it sits flush with the board and screws in to the stock backplate.,as long as they screw in you should be good.,just making sure but your cooler standoffs are screwing in flush with the board right?,i think itâ€™s possible to have the cooler backplate upside down and i think the cooler wonâ€™t mount correctly if thatâ€™s the case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i triples checked the backplate before insatall it's flush with the board.....man this is gonna be annoying af to take apart and redo the motherboard attachments lol.,"the grizzly is screwed in but it was very difficult, the only difficult part.",it just felt like it might've been putting too much pressure to screw all 4 sides in.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
time to make sure my thermalright screws in correctly oh boi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"geez, 12th gen is an old platform now?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
$40 less than the 12900ks.,personally iâ€™m a bit more interested in next fallâ€™s raptor lake refresh.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so what is intel planning to do for the **2023 q3 raptor lake refresh**?,i doubt if intel can boost to higher than 6ghz in such a short period.,maybe more cache l2+l3?,a strategy to compete with amd 7000x3d?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
300w on boost lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wondering how well it undervolts considering itâ€™s a golden sku,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i genuinely donâ€™t understand why they released this?,itâ€™s barely 2% faster than a 13900k.,"mine will do 6ghz all day, with better efficiency than this.",i also got it for $569 at microcenter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
got one!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
next fall?,you still living in 2022?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeet the cache, somehow thin the ihs and die, then also yeet the power target, boom ðÿ¤¯ new i9 dropped",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's for enthusiasts and productivity hypebeasts.,at 125w pl1 you'll retain 90% of total multi-core performance while retaining 100% of the 6ghz single-core boost gimmick.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, technically it will be the â€œnextâ€ fall that happens.",the â€œthisâ€ fall that happens sounds bad grammatically.,";-)

hey, iâ€™m lucky if i donâ€™t write 2022 still.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ugh it would still be considered next fall.,what a mo mo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"because it should be at the pinnacle of raptor lake silicon production improvements, and i would expect 13900ks  level quality/performance at 13900k prices.",and everything in the lineup should get a speed boost at no extra cost.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

its successor was announced today.,:-) [https://www.anandtech.com/show/18741/intel-launches-xeon-w-3400-and-w-2400-processors-for-workstations-up-to-56-cores-and-112-pcie-5-0-lanes](https://www.anandtech.com/show/18741/intel-launches-xeon-w-3400-and-w-2400-processors-for-workstations-up-to-56-cores-and-112-pcie-5-0-lanes) and it requires a new platform.,i wouldn't invest in x299 cpu upgrade unless you really need those pci-e lanes or get a cpu used on the cheap.,something modern like intel raptor lake or amd raphael would be much faster.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what do you do with the your current setup?,if you don't need all those pcie lanes then some of the current 13th gen raptor lake k-skus have more threads than your 7820x and have better performance overall.,"if you do need the extra memory bandwidth and pcie then the w2400 and w3400 sapphire rapids announced today are intel's official hedt offerings moving forward, but it's not clear when they'll be available on the market.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ah interesting coincidence.,too bad they are on another platform.,i guess i can officially put my x299 motherboard to rest then.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
currently just gaming and vr (flight sim).,i am also currently trying to learn unity for some rudimentary vr/mr development.,i may also try some crude 3d modelling for use as vrchat avatars.,i think i can agree i don't need a lot of pcie lanes.,the only reason i am on hedt is because i got a motherboard for free.,i guess it is time to let it go.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why would you expect intel to continue using a nearly 6 year old platform thatâ€™s horribly out of date?,"anything released in todays market is going to need pcie 5.0, 4.0, ddr5â€¦ and x299 doesnâ€™t have any of that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what gpu do you have?,i'd say that as long as you pair a reasonably mid to high-end gpu like a 4080 or 7900xtx with something like an i7 13700k and sufficient amounts of ram that may just be enough.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am still on 1080ti.,several months ago i asked on /r/buildapc if 7820x will bottleneck 4080 cards and most suggest to me it is probably ok but adviced me to wait another generation as the 1080ti is still very capable (which i kind of agree).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what resolution monitor do you have?,i got a free 1080ti from a friend and threw it into my 7980xe x299 rig and itâ€™s horribly slow even overclocked with extremely fast ram (52ns in aida64).,it uses 700+ watts in prime95 with no gpu load.,you can upgrade your gpu but my first question would be if you have a quality power supply.,raptor lake is much much much faster and probably uses 50% of the power.,i have a friend with a 10900k and a 1080ti but he is only at 1440p and he plays old games.,iâ€™m sure if he upgraded to a 2080ti or 3080ti he would have much better scores in most modern games.,my friends 13900k/7900xtx rig gets more fps in escape from tarkov in 4k than i do (x299/1080ti) at 1080p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have three monitors
one 4k, one uw-fhd, one fhd.","i personally think i am running most of my games fine, but then again i do not tune up graphics to max all the time so i really don't know.","but i am pretty if we use cyberpunk 2077 as benchmark, at 4k+max settings i cannot run at at least stable 30fps.",psu is a thermaltake 850w,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7820x will definitely bottleneck newer cards.,"superficially it looks like it's a 9900k but it has lower clocks, and a much worse (for gaming purposes) interconnect between the cores giving you overall much lower fps.",it's way behind it as a result.,iirc it's about the same as zen+.,edit: i'd actually say your 1080ti is bottlenecked too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
x299 highly depends on clocks and ram.,i donâ€™t really think is a problem if he is gaming at 4k.,both my 1950x threadripper and 7980xe can beat my 7950x am5 system because of a high resolution and ram speedâ€¦ even with the exact same gpu.,"a 10900k,12900k, or 13900k would 100% be better though.",my am5 system only uses 45 watts in games thoughâ€¦ 13900k same thing plus or minus.,"even if you can get by on a low-tier x299 chip today, its doubtful that it wont bottleneck you in the future.",a 12900k/13900k could last you 6 more years.,if you are on a budget you can even use a 360$ ddr4 from asus/msi or use the 399$ evga z690 dark.,don't feel bad about upgrading your cpu first because the 4090 doesn't even have the new display port or hdmi outputs like the 7900xtx does.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>x299 highly depends on clocks and ram.,i assumed op runs it at stock.,otherwise he wouldn't ask such questions.,"i could be wrong, ofc.","oced to the wall, it still won't reach even 9900k in gaming.",>i donâ€™t really think is a problem if he is gaming at 4k.,both my 1950x threadripper and 7980xe can beat my 7950x am5 system because of a high resolution and ram speedâ€¦ even with the exact same gpu.,"i find it unbelievable & impossible, to be honest.",i'm pretty sure even in modern games at 4k it will cause bottlenecks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my 7950x couldn't even post at ddr5 6000 on a 6400 m die kit.,jayztwocents channel did a 12th gen ddr4 build today with 3200 cas 16 ram.,its not difficult to see that many people with tuned ddr4 platforms are running sub 50ns in aida and 120+gb/sec bandwith on quad channel platforms.,"my 1950x has lower aida latency than my 7950x, but its possible my am5 cpu memory controller is the worst ever.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

which motherboard?,i can only get 7600 stable on my unify-x.,i was thinking about getting an apex or kingpin z790.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how much tweaking do you do?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you need an asus apex for 8000+.,"its only doable on 2 slot boards, plenty of people already running 8000+ on those.",you also need a gold imc on the cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i tried tweaking most of the major voltages and 7600 is about as far as it will go.,either the unify-x or the 13900k is holding me back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you were right.,i got the apex and bin a couple 13900ks and found one that can handle 8000 xmp and can boot at 8600. iâ€™m going to leave it at xmp because iâ€™m not a memory oc expert.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that is because the a770 is not exactly the best graphics card for use with davinci resolve.,take a look at [these benchmarks](https://www.pugetsystems.com/solutions/video-editing-workstations/davinci-resolve/hardware-recommendations/#gpu) from puget systems.,nvidia cards leads the pack and intel comes in dead last.,even your 3060 ti posts almost double the score that the a770 does.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the intel uhd 770 has twice the quicksync engines compared to the uhd 730 i think.,"(this should also be true compared to the uhd 750)

but i haven't seen any tests that compare it to the dedicated a770",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"50% top video decode, vram constant around 70% - with igpu turned off.",igpu turned on then arc would idle and not decode at all (likely resolve's fault not knowing to give arc work).,i'm also running 11th gen so no deep link maybe they just forgot about us.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ironically resolve is one of the poster application when they highlight deep link.,and when apple silicon was first introduced hw encode decode was supported from day 1 blackmagic even released parallel m1 version softwares for quite some time until they merged.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i saw the pudget article and still pulled the trigger because their score is the aggregate of many different codecs (264/265/raw) resolve is extremely cuda friendly overall for sure.,but nv 20/30/40 also doesnâ€™t have hevc 10bit 422 hw decode at all - so i was hoping a770 would be the magical pill for my particular use case.,maybe it isnâ€™t.,it does feel like a missed opportunity for arc - most pro cameras can shoot hevc now and it will take years for sony and canon to adopt av1.,apple silicon does remarkably well up to 10bit 420 but 422 its media decoder starts to fall apart too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™ve seen that comment before (double the quick sync performance) any chance you know the source of it?,couldnâ€™t find anything on intel website or places like pudget,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"intel is the only player (other than apple) that has hardware acceleration for hevc 10bit 4:2:2. it is just going to take time for better support, both on intel's drivers side and adobe/blackmagic to better support arc.",list [here](https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/articles/what-h-264-and-h-265-hardware-decoding-is-supported-in-davinci-resolve-studio-2122/),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"intel quicksync is indeed quite capable, perhaps this could be a driver issue preventing intel from doing better.",the trouble is if you are willing to wait and take a chance on this.,there is no telling when intel will sort the part of their driver that performs so poorly here.,"the other options is to see if you can either return the a770 and get your money back, or barring that at least exchange it for a more upmarket nvidia card.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the arc pages of cpus with the uhd 770 have multi-format-codec-engines listed as 2

but it isn't listed at all for the uhd 750 so no idea there",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
av1 does indeed work well so no question about anything said in there - my question is more about the quicksync and hevc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with av1 being the poster child and most hevc shooters used to proxy workflows anyway i'm not holding my breath for the amazing arc driver updates to prioritize  hevc tbh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and yea i was editing 420 8k on 4k timeline for more than a year with my base model m1 air - until sony a1 released the 422 update then m1a choked.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's exactly where my question is going with - are all quicksync equal?,igpu alone can decode however it stutters for playback.,would upgrading to 13th gen help?,is there a way to benchmark quicksync performance?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nv 30/40 all have the same decoder (or the lack of, for hevc) so i'm not going to bother with a nv gpu upgrade since i'm not bottlenecked by vram anyway.",if i'm running atx i would definitely keep the a770 - but my build is itx upgrading the mb just for the encoder feels silly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

cinebench can be pretty hard to cool.,"idk if it helps, but i've tested the 360 version with the 13900k - but at ""stock"" settings.",https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/arctic-liquid-freezer-ii-360-argb-review/2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
reset bios because you disabled hyperthreading and probably a lot of other things,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you've clearly screwed with more settings in the bios because you've so how disabled hyperthreading.,"i would suggest you reset to defaults, enable xmp, and check that things are behaving correctly.",also use hwinfo to check per core speeds more reliably.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you have enforced intel limits on your bios not all of the 13900k chips can go beyond 5.2ghz due to hitting a power limit.,mine for example if i disable mce (enforce intel limits) and all of the other settings are 100% optimized defaults including xmp.,i can only get 5.2ghz in r23.,with intel limits removed i get 5.5ghz on r23.,but with hyperthreading off you should have more power headroom.,what are you using to load up the cores?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just a quick tip, for best performance (at least in my case) enable hyperthreading and xmp, increase the ram voltage by 0.1 for better stability and then limited the tdp to 240w to keep the thermals under control, i sit at 5.6-5.7ghz at 70-75â°c stable with 100% utilization",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you disabled ht thereâ€™s no telling what else you screwed up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just to give some more info.,asus 690 otherbaord with upgraded bios and intel me.,gpu- 3080ti.,32 gb ram at 4600 mhz.,xmp 1 on.,kraken liquid cooling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what are you doing to try and get it to boost?,"undo whatever settings you've changed, run hwinfo64 and then run cinebench r23 *single core*.","peak boost on your best cores should hit 5.7-5.8ghz, it shuffled the workload around normally between your two strongest cores.",all core will be 5.4-5.5 on p-cores so long as you're not power or thermal constrained.,however peak ghz is just an indicator that there are no constraints on boost.,be guided by actual benchmark results not simply clockspeed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
download couid and check there.,also you can right colicky on your cou screen and select view per core i believe.,this will allow you to see what all of your cores are doing and not just an overall usage.,you won't always see a boost cpu wide but you will see a few cores boosting higher than the rest when you set it to view all cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hey commercialcut3523, it looks like you are having a cooling problem.",first - dont be afraid of 100c.,its normal for laptops.,"if youre running a high tdp load with a desktop i9 cpu, this is inevitable.",if youre hitting 100c in things like gaming and lighter tasks - then we have a problem.,"if thats the case, the first thing you want to do is to repaste the cooler.",taking it apart and putting it back together will solve the problem more often than you might believe.,"double check and make sure youre using the proper mounting equipment - using lga1200 mounts on a lga 1700 system might work, but performance wont be ideal.",make sure to test the cooler under power limited conditions before assuming its not working right.,"most non-sff coolers can handle loads of 200w, so test with a 200w power limit.","if youre still experiencing hot temperatures after checking all of the above, then its time to return the cooler or file a rma for repair.","*i am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.",please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/intel) if you have any questions or concerns.,*,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ht for gaming is not really relevant.,don't listen to people saying you need it on for games.,ht is only beneficial for heavy multithreaded applications like benching programs or work programs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah just hyper threading.,its better for gaming is why i took it off,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your not getting the 5.5ghz because when mce is off that also turns off intel adaptive boost technology.,just set that to enabled in bios an dyou will get 5.5 again.,as long as you are under 100c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i turned off the enforce intel limits.,and i was using intel extreme utility tuner./ i put my p-cores to 5.8 it did a very good job at perforance but cores were hot.,i just thought getting an i9 13900k i would have seen it hit 5.8. or does it only go to 5.8 is needed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you should be able to run cinebench multi on 5.5 p cores and 4.3 e cores.,even up to 5.6 p cores and 4.3 e cores.,thatâ€™s all core full load.,temps will get up to 90c to 100c.,youâ€™re at 64c in that screenshot.,this suggests youâ€™re running pl1 and pl2 at stock values 125 and 253. pl1 at 125 and pl2 at 253 will change the boost curve so that you donâ€™t boost to 5.5 on all cores for very long.,maybe about 56 seconds.,itâ€™s hard to explain but if you set your pl1 and pl2 to 300w or even 4096 you should see 5.5 on all p cores more often and it will boost 2 cores to 5.8 briefly but really thatâ€™s a useless boost.,5.5ghz or 5.6 is what you can expect on all p cores.,just set your pl1 and pl2 to 300w or unlimited.,you see this will tell the cpu how good of a cooling solution you have and the cpu will adjust its boost curve to boost more often to the highest speeds.,"if you have a 320mm or 420 aio you can let the cpu boost more, not higher but more and for longer duration.",thatâ€™s what pl1 and pl2 controls.,at stock it thinks it needs to stay under 70c.,"with higher pl1 and pl2 wattage you can cool it and run the cpu closer to 90c which will boost more often and longer at 5.5

you can configure these chips to do a lot including running 2 p cores at 6ghz and 3 at 5.7, and 4 at 5.6, and 8 at 5.5. this means if youâ€™re only using two cores it will run at 6. if youâ€™re using 4 cores it will run at 5.6 and if all 8 p cores are engaged they will run at 5.5. these chips are pretty configurable.",it depends on cooling mostly and silicon lottery second.,but generally you can expect to see 5.5gz on all p cores and 4.3 on all e cores under full load and temps of 90 to 100c.,cool these chips the best you can and set the pl1 and pl2 to get the performance out of the chip.,read more about pl2 and pl1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4600mhz would imply that youâ€™re running ddr4?,and that speed would almost certainly imply that youâ€™re not in gear 1 mode?,which would mean youâ€™re probably getting worse performance than having it at 4000 or so in g1 mode.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you took it off because you have no idea what your doing!!,!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have the same cpu.,it's so powerful that i don't think ht  on or off would made any difference in games.,"as others have said, reset the bios to the defaults and come again.",have a lot of fun with it o/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's not 2012 anymore champ.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sure in some games ht really does better in almost every aspect, but in general you just might get more frames (if youre cpu bottlenecked) in trade of worse % lows.","better keep it on, it wil be much better overall.",if know game performs better with ht off you can disable the threads in task manager,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the amount of people that just say hyper threading is better with no reasoning how (most likely because they just go off what they heard) is absurd, how are people telling someone to change a setting that depends on the user preference?",i'm not going to suffer latency hits because ht can give some small boost in frame rate as if going from 700 average fps in valorant to 720 average or 175 average to 185 average in call of duty or some shit has to mean something to me because people like to know that their frame rate is as high as it physically can be for massive repercussions on their overall performance regarding hitching etc.,"i'd much rather disable ht to disable idle states running at 40 c and getting more fps than i would with ht on, the amount of people that don't know what they're talking about is absurd.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this completely depends on the game and even if the game likes it off, there's usually very little gains.",then there's a lot games that benefit a lot from keeping it on.,just keep it on imo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hyperthreading has been faster for gaming for years now.,this isn't a pentium 4 where it actually slowed things down for games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it literally shows 5.2ghz.,how is it not boosting high?,temperature and power delivery are key factors,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5.8ghz is only when 2 cores are loaded.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i like how you're drip feeding bits of info on what changes you made in the bios, while implying those are the only changes you made.","you've asked a question, people have answered.","just reset the bios, for the love of god, and leave it alone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh really?,thought you would always want ram at the max speed available when buying and yes ddr4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"removing ht will greatly lower temperature, allowing higher all core oc and imc speed.",some games will benefit from that lower latency and tarkov is one of them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
look up on gear 1 and gear 2 on intel systems.,for ddr4 the sweet spot is more around 4000mhz in gear 1 (higher can be achieved if you tweak).,"but in gear 1 the memory controller runs at the same speed as the memory (4000mhz is double data rate, so memory is natively 2000mhz and so is memory controller).",2000mhz is about the max speed for the memory controller without luck/tweaking.,"at 4600mhz in gear 2, the memory controller runs at half speed.",so memory would be 2300mhz and memory controller at 1300mhz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nope.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
damn i have never heard of this i always thought maxing ram speed was a must with higher speed rams.,the more you know.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
question.,1. do you keep hyperthreading on for gaming or general use?,"2. do you use mce, multicore enhancement
3. do you use intel adaptive boost?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
leave hyperthreading on.,"mce on 12th/13th gen only removes pl1/pl2 power limits, which you can also do yourself.","it does not do anything more to multipliers / voltages like it used to do on prior generations, as itâ€™s unneeded.",leave all boost/turbo settings at bios default.,"honestly, nothing needs to be changed.",the only thing you might do is enable tvb / thermal velocity boost if itâ€™s available on your cpu to add a +1 or +2 to all multipliers so long as the cpu is below a certain temperature (i think itâ€™s 65?,).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the g.skill flare x expo kits that mcenter has promoted with am5 work fine et full speeds on all the asus b660 and z690 boards i've tested.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
basically they're just tuned to match amd's infinity fabric.,intel is far less timing sensitive than amd so your performance gap is a lot smaller with worse tuned kits.,on intel a 6400 cl40 kit won't perform significantly worse than a 6400 cl36 kit.,while on amd a 6000 cl30 kit will decently outperform a 6000 cl36 kit (other sub timings are also important).,"no biggie, it's just advertised for amd because the subtimings are different.",still works 100% on intel with imperceptible performance differences.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

iâ€™m sure they make a ddr5 version.,companies did the same thing with z690.,they made a ddr4 version and a 5 version.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so... there are z690 motherboards that support ddr5 or ddr4 (cant support both) as well as z790 motherboards that work the same way?,"from my limited research, the only realy difference between the z690 and z790 is pcie lanes in situations where you have high bandwidth cards that \*might\* need that?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you perfectly summed it up.,"the z790 chipset is like the z690, compatible with ddr4 and ddr5.",just be sure if you take a z690 motherboard that the bios is up to date or that you can update it without a cpu since it was release before the 13th gen launch.,and yes the difference between the two chipset is not that big.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"technically the difference in chipsets is just that 4x pcie 3.0 lanes are changed to 4.0. and the most readily visible place this is seen, is on boards with 5 m.2 slots, instead of it being 4 x 4.0 and 1 x 3.0, itâ€™s now 5 x 4.0. and thatâ€™s where all the difference goesâ€¦",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"you don't need to, however, you might want to consider if your temp is crazy high in stress testing.",i bought one anyways.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i ordered one for this build.,"an 8 to 10c difference was seen from so many different reviews, why not spend $10 and give it a shot?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just dont use it..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
guys below don't know what they are talking about.,the lg 1700 socket has issues with the top of the heatsink being uneven when mounting it in the socket.,"this can cause varying degree of temp issues that have been identified by several tech reviewers, even gamers nexus.",obviously not everyone who buys a 12/13 gen cpu is going to have this problem but the cpu contact frame is a good purchase because it solves them mounting pressure point issues that can cause this.,buying the thermalright contact frame for $17 is in my opinion a reasonable purchase because it can help improve temps by up to 10c which can mean the difference between thermal throttling and not (this has been verified and proven via testing).,i bought the thermal grizzly one just because i like their products and support der8auer.,i like the fact that you purchased it and think you should stick with it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and you pushed the clock speed ?,if you did  how hot did it run it sid it not?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"have one on 13600kf, some reports of cpu bending affecting motherboards, bought thermalright for 6-7 usd on ali",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so i got a question.,after placing the cpu in the socket and locking it down with the default mechanism on the motherboard you might get some uneven socket pressure they're saying.,but when i install my monoblock from ekwb and torque it down even further how is there uneven socket pressure and how will a contact frame even matter in this situation.,if i were to take the contact frame off and the locking them off i could simply use the monoblock to keep the cpu in the socket and nothing else.,has anyone tested including gamers nexus while the cpu cooler was installed?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
didn't benefit from  it using 12th gen or 13th gen cpu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how would you know if you have issues?,"sorry if thatâ€™s a dumb question, just not sure what test to run to see if i actually would benefit from it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this just seems like a money grab to me the physics behind the whole thing don't make any sense.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12th and 13th gen sockets are exactly the same even if the pcb is thicker you will still be tightening down the socket frame until it hits the pcb.,but based on the individual's installation of the frame could improve or even make performance worse if not done right huge risk.,i would argue and say a good cpu cooler or monoblock should even out the pressure in the socket regardless of a frame or anything else.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,leave cpu in box,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would you know if the z790 boards fixed the problem by chance?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i did buy one of these also but i would like to argue the fact.,how would my ek monoblock not solve this problem.,the monoblock is torch down to apply even pressure on the cpu and the socket even without a contact frame or a locking mechanism this alone should ensure the cpu is in the socket evenly did gamers nexus in any of these other reviewers test this with a good cpu cooler i watched the videos and i did not see them mention this they simply used contact sensors purchased from their patrons and using some kind of special paper.,with that being said i've seen what the reviews also say and people are seeing a difference so i will purchase and try for myself but i am extremely skeptical.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"12th, it's just snake oil unless you have a very specific problem with your system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"z790 boards don't solve the problem, they use the same default mounting mechanism as seen on the z690's.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well you may have nit properly set  your cpu in the socket bc a a 10 mire ir less decrease in temps is definitely with using 12th gen should ve required to it idk what you were doing once it was set proper snd used a frame that should have veen stock on these mb niw anyway seeing 5.4 all core idle in the liw 20s and cinabench hight 50s low 60 yeah you right stay away it does nothing lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[how can you make that assertion without an ability to see the die?,like gn has.,](https://i.imgur.com/gp5e0hw.png),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i actually agree with this sentiment.,you're telling me when i install the monoblock from ekwb i'm not pushing that cpu evenly into the socket regardless if you're using a contact frame or the default locking mechanism.,there's absolutely no way but yet i watch reviews and people who've installed one and they're seeing 6 to 10â° difference so i'm still very skeptical and i even purchased one and i'm going to install.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i got a 0 degree difference, tested with 3 different coolers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"it's because the vccsa is locked, without being able to increase this voltage, past ~3200 mhz becomes questionable for ddr4 without dropping to gear 2, same thing happened last year with the locked 12th gen cpus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
even on alder lake c0/h0 there were some locked cpus that could do 3600mhz in gear 1 and others couldnt.,it's just silicon lottery,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i can verify now only recent pc number two and i will do it today.,i don't have pc number one already and i can't check it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was given answer from producer of ram (goodram company technical support department) that changing only gear from default 2 to 1 should not request changing/increasing ram voltage.,its not needed - which is logic because you change only processor's controller frequency.,voltage can be a factor if we want change ram frequency or timings and sometimes we have to adjust processor voltage for ram.... but gears have nothing to do with voltage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how to be sure - how to check it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you've answered your own question.,"changing gear changes the memory controller frequency, and the memory controller may not be able to run at a higher frequency without increased voltage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"your dc loadline is absolutely off the chart, hence why vid is shown so extremely high.","and don't use override, unless you're trying to find a lowest possible stable voltage, there's only headache and very high power draw when opting to not go for adaptive.","fivr only creates system agent and vddq, so fivr vcore does nothing.","truth be told, you've purchased a garbage motherboard with a useless gimmick of a monoblock and now you see the consequences.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a bug?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
core voltage in bios is set to fixed at 1.30 volt load line calibration 1 using asrock z690 aqua oc.,the fivr core voltage is set to adaptive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you have to measure real voltage from the vrm anyways.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah under load vehicle goes down to the voltage i set which is 1.3 volt.,i just don't understand why there's two voltage settings for the cpu v core in the bios.,one is the fivr which you can set to override or adaptive and the other one is the standard vcore voltage in the vrm settings.,so the voltage regulator module has its own folder of power settings and then there's another folder that's fivr for adaptive voltage curves and i really don't want that to run.,so i can set adaptive in the fivr setting to override and then set the voltage to 1.3 and maybe try setting the vcore in the vrm setting to auto and maybe the fivr will be like the master voltage setting.,all i know is this motherboard blurs the lines between intel stock power limits and what the board does .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and with that being said when both of the vcore voltages settings are set to auto and adaptive my idol vcore voltages will hit 1.6 without even touching it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"on b660 boards, specifically asus, disabling mce leads to higher idle and load voltage lmao.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah this is the first asrock board i've ever purchased and largely because of the monoblock.,but i'm not happy with the things that this board does right out of the box with no explanation.,every time i change the voltage the board sets both load line calibrations to one.,coming from an asus motherboard one was the lowest setting were eight being the highest it's completely opposite with the asrock boards.,with that being said i manually switched the low line calibrations to level four and the cpu is still asking for that higher voltage so i just reset everything to until stock power limits..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how do i find your ac/dc load line calibration guide.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no i was looking at the vid which is a voltage reading that shows what the cpu was asking for.,the actual vcore was reading what it was supposed to.,amongst all the confusion with these motherboards and blurring the lines between the intel stock power limits and whatever they set them to i tend to forget these things.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is that the most aggressive llc?,yah don't use that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is hwinfo64..  lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i measured the voltage on the motherboard i was looking at the wrong voltage still the vcore is what i should have been looking at and that was reading correctly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah these 12th and 13th gen cpus have endless motherboard settings that can be tweaked.,"the old standard method of static overclocks is still possible but its largely considered obsolete now since the adaptive boosting method is more efficient but also creates thermal headroom space for higher boosts in short workloads, etc, etc.",there are reams of text in overclocker.net forums or skatterbench on different techniques that can be used to undervolt/overclock the cpus.,"iâ€™m on an asus board and even though its one of the better bioss for overclocking out there, it does take a long time to find and understand all the different settings one needsâ€¦ endless menu diving.","good luck, and enjoy.","itâ€™s a great cpu, very powerful.",will stress just about any cooler if you let it go wild.,i keep mine power and temperature limited for [minimal performance loss](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/10bna5r/13900k_power_scaling_analysis/).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes in asrock motherboards it is the most aggressive i believe except for off.,the thing is when you go to set a static voltage in the motherboard it automatically puts load line calibration to one if i change it to four and change the static vcore again it changes it back to one so i just went ahead and went with it.,but with that being said i measured the vcore at the board and it was reading 1.29 volts it was reading 1.29 volts in cpu-z but 1.7 volts in info hardware and 1.7 volts and intel xtu tuning software.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i guess its important to measure vcore now, while it shows 1.7v in software.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
svid isnâ€™t the same as voltage.,the svid value is basically what the cpu is requesting from the vrm.,the vcore voltage should be listed somewhere else in hwinfo.,but still itâ€™s odd itâ€™s showing soo high svid.,you can probably ignore that with static voltage.,but itâ€™s still strange that itâ€™s showing such high svids.,probably some weird going on with your motherboard settings.,the thing is llc that is very aggressive is getting tons of undershoot.,"when you get interrupts, even at 100% cpu load.",all these tools wonâ€™t show that as itâ€™s happening in the scale of a few microseconds.,watch this video for a good explanation using an oscilloscope.,https://youtu.be/-l3mnj9kvxk,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah and i can't figure out why it's asking for so much voltage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

bit hard to explain, but let's say pbo pushes a 5600x to 4.8ghz in a game, with 1.5v and that yields 70w power draw, setting a ""traditional"" overclock of say 4.6ghz with 1.3v would keep it at 1.3v in the game, in turn giving a lower power draw.","again i might be completely wrong here, just speculating.","(also not saying you should run a static overclock instead of pbo, i have no idea)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

pat's not hitting his targets this year lol.,if he did he would be one of the highest paid ceos and at a company that isn't anywhere near the largest or most valuable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
before i left they spent the entire year talking about how they were below market for pay and how they were going to increase the pay.,to cut it so much so soon after that is pretty cringe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i worked for intel for a very long time.,this has been coming for years.,14nm was the last successful start up.,that was 2013.... 10 years ago!!,10nm was a disaster.,if the ireland bluejay project fails they are dead as a company.,in ireland the bonuses and reward system loss will hurt every one.,l7 is not particularly senior.,lower management and senior engineers would be at that level.,5% wipes out the last 2 - 3 pay reviews and this one is gone.,i'd be fuming,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you think he's only paid 1 million a year?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my thoughts right now is that they are going the employee layoff/benefit cut off due to the job market cooling down and also having massive layoffs all over tech.,they are taking advantage of the timing where human capital/talent isnâ€™t in high demand elsewhere.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

a dividend isn't a cost.,it's a return on capital distributed to the owners of the company.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is a pretty terrible take.,"public exchange listing has trade-offs, as everything in life.","strategically i think it would make more sense to cut the dividend more, yes, but they can just leverage the fact that the job market is cooling down.",i feel it myself.,"a while ago i would get a dozen ppl reaching out on linkedin per month, like pretty much any tech guy.",has decreased by a lot!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
stock based compensation seems like it would be smart and really incentivize people to stick it out through the tough times without touching the dividend.,"but they're not being strategic here, the board and shareholders just want their payout in the short term and they can't see the reality of how a business can't see their revenue get cut in half and keep paying out dividend like nothing happened.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

iâ€™m approaching my 2 year anniversary as a tech at intel and feel like iâ€™ve just lost all incentive to do anything but the bare minimum to not get fired.,"no opportunity for raises, and significant cut backs to benefits and bonuses.",really feels like they just wanted to do mass layoffs and instead chose to give all their employees their employees the finger instead and hope they get the same results from attrition.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the retirement cut is what gets me.,i got in at intel when they had a pension.,then 2 years in they do away with for 401k cause it has the benefit of more money.,now you just cut that out.,sure it's only hopefully one year but that's 2.5% that would compound for the next 20ys,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you considered the many employees hired during the good times in the last two years that werenâ€™t eligible for good bonuses last year?,those that are now having their pay and benefits reduced?,"some of us joined too late for the boom, but in time for the bust.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would much rather get rid of 10% of my team and do more work than take a paycut.,they now need to increase headcount because no one is going to be working.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

* ceo by 25%
* elt by 15%
* g12+ by 10%
* g7-11 by 5%

just utterly insane if you want to retain and motivate people to turn things around.",i'm sure everyone is very excited to work harder for less now!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if intel is gonna get out of this theyâ€™ll need to retain a good chunk of their people, not fire them, then in a year and a half from now try to hire them all back when they need to ramp gnr/sierra forest/lunar lake.","i can understand the move, but to do all of this just so they can not touch the dividendâ€¦.",i donâ€™t get it.,hurt operations just so the stock is a bit more appealing to some boomers looking for cashflow??,lmao.,"you want yield buy treasuries, buy a reit, or best yet buy a rental property.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's way more than a 5% minimum.,the bonuses are easily 10% of t.comp plus 5+% in pay for salaried folks plus 2.5% match on the 401k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ceo made 178 million last year.,the c suits makes most of their money outside of salary anyway so a 25% salary cut isnâ€™t as bad as it sounds.,in comparison lisa siu made 29.5 million.,standard employees lose qpb worth an additional 5% of their pay and 2.5% on 401k matching.,to me it seems like rather than cutting the fat or dropping the dividend they took the cash from employees.,hurt the everyday man but save the stock and avoid bad press of layoffs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think this has the biggest impact in reducing cost.,"intel has very large manpower resource 131,900 employees.","in terms of revenue per capita (employee), amd is usd1.5 million/employee while intel is only usd 0.5 million per employee.","also, intel is too burdened with interest payments on big debts/loans and depreciation costs on too much assets that impact profitability.","when the market has low demand on products and hence low revenues, profit is impacted as you cannot just magically reduce fixed costs of the company.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"mi guessing management is trying to keep stock price up, via the dividend and just waiting it out for a 2024 resurgence when granite, and sierra forest launch, maybe they think cutting the dividend or massive layoffs will tank the stock.",they may feel that the damage to the stock might be irreversible.,"shitty situation all around as employes are the scape goat, i think pat might be genuine in trying to make things right, but i don't know if the board and shareholders will allow him to.",situation is just fucked all around.,id rather just pause and resume the dividend after some time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

but i don't want to work on glued together chips...lol...jk.,that whole back and forth on that is hilarious inter-corporate politics :p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sounds like layoffs are happening in addition to the pay cuts.,i donâ€™t know of anyone in my former team  (salaried) who didnâ€™t work insane hours.,meetings with employees in one country at 7 am.,meetings with employees in another country at 7 pm was a norm for many.,one of my former coworkers was laid off and said my former team was decimated.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"honestly, as much as i don't want it, they should just pause dividends for the next year for two, that would literally put them above water until they get their stuff together",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
after what?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my friend, bk is the reason intel is in this mess.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's because intel is cutting pay and laying off people.,https://www.kcra.com/article/intel-warns-officials-it-plans-343-layoffs-at-its-folsom-campus/42713826,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's also because they are still paying out to shareholders.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
everything those companies are doing + network + leftovers of ssd/optane stuff?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
exactly this.,for them to finally realize that they aren't retaining people due to compensation and attempt to make it right by substantial raises across the board to only take it away a year later.... wtf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i don't think he got that 178 mil those were merit-based, which i'm sure he didn't meet.",they should cut dividends for 2 years..... thats an instant 12 billion for the books,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that includes the one time $110m hiring package, which will pay out in 3-5 years if the company hits its targets.","currently $80m of that is trending to zero, and is practically impossible for him to get unless some absolute miracle happens to the share price.","also $10m of it was a match for a $10m intel share purchase that he made with his own money, which has now lost 50% of its value.","his actual yearly compensation for 2023 is about $26m, 90% of it shares.","obviously not bad, but he is also not making hundreds of millions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the vast majority of that compensation is incentive pay he did not obtain.,"media trying to make it out like he received 9 figures in 2022, when he only received 7. that's a big difference.","in 2023, i imagine that will fall to 6 figures unless the market cap doubles or triples.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in salary, yes.","it's 1.1m/year, the rest is in stock, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well thatâ€™s why all these tech companies are timing their layoffs and sharing notes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that would require a level of both cunning and competency which i doubt exists.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

and the eu too (billions) :d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah but it comes from cash flow which is also an indicator of how healthy a company is.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i donâ€™t disagree with the reality of it and that itâ€™s part of current life.,"in fact, thatâ€™s the actual point.",you are just looking at it from the perspective of the group trying to take advantage of the workers.,iâ€™m looking at it from the worker perspective and wall street forcing corporations to take advantage of the workers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
better they have a good way of locating high performers and provide better deals for them otherwise those high performers will leave for the competition and they will be left with useless people.,i think it is normal for companies to have good and bad years but it can just makes things go south very quickly.,i would definitely prefer layoffs or shutting down branches that doesn't make them money but this.. i am not so sure of... at least the bags i am holding probably not as heavy as many other people.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you're right, it has destroyed motivation.",senior high performers are already looking around.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
welp.,i don't think compensation is great at amd but at least they're not doing layoffs and pay cuts yet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for entry to mid level engineers it is significantly lower than the competition.,when i started at intel as an entry level engineer 4 years ago my salary was the same as the starting salary in 2008. other semiconductor companies in phoenix are offering at least 30% more than what iâ€™m making now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"itâ€™s not bad for engineers (but is much behind for software, compared to big tech at least).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they are spending 20 billion on ramping up the new manufacturing with euv lithography.,amd already paid those costs so itâ€™s not going to be a fair comparison between the two for at least a few years.,but unfortunately that nuance is lost on wall street.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
recognition at least for my team is huge.,i probably got 4k+ from recognitions last year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what are benefits of rule of 75 other than rsu vesting?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don't forget they paid $1.5 billion in dividends *just last quarter*.,nearly $6 billion throughout the whole year.,paying that amount in a single quarter while heavily reducing pay of basically everyone is a slap in the face to all employees.,edit: they announced a $1.5 billion dividend payout 6 days ago.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> ridiculous lack of foresight from upper-levels imo.,upper management is probably afraid of pissing off investors.,it's gonna take a while to get the company running on all cylinders again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"believe me, the pay is nowhere close to enough given how many hours you might end up working as a process engineer.","after spending 50% of your day in meetings and the other 50% preparing to report out in meetings, plus constant firefighting of issues and getting stuck with 24/7 on call every few weeks and being unlucky enough to be in a level 2 or even level 1 task force (weekend meetings), you definitely rack up 50+ hours a week and it can become 60+ in some weeks.",and i know people doing this all on a grade 5 or 6 salary while being gaslit by their managers that they should be grateful that they're getting all these useful learning opportunities.,like the only thing you learn is that this is a toxic industry that wouldn't survive without companies using the h1b to chain people to their jobs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you think cutting pay is better than layoffs?,"i think pay cuts might be better than mass layoffs (with the biggest cuts coming to the ceo/evp's) but have to be justified,and with intel still paying the dividend i don't think its justified.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
any existing employee that falls in those categories are going to get a pay cut starting march 1st.,"the new hires... i doubt they'll see the same treatment,  but who knows.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"theyâ€™re doing paycuts to virtue signal to investors that they are serious about their stock price and cutting back in the face of economic headwinds, without laying off 10% of their workforce.","on the face of this, this looks like a much worse story then google and microsoft and meta cutting headcount, but if you really think about it, intel is actually being more pragmatic and trying to save more peopleâ€™s overall livelihoods then any of these other companies doing layoffs.","ultimately this is still about intel making the most money it possibly can for shareholders, but its just doing it differently then a blanket 7-10% employee layoff across the company.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"lol what do people have to gain by lying about this , such weird behavior by people that think there is some grand conspiracy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the apb formula and basis aren't changing.,grants will still happen with the delayed rewards cycle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>you won't get rsus either.,"they didn't explicitly say it, but they said there's no annual rewards; rewards is when you get your performance rating and rsu grants.",i think that's kinda what they want you leave on your own no severance....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

three months ago we were getting all we could eat free food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"definitely regret at least not entertaining the severance package during ""volunteer layoffs"".",could have taken that and went to work somewhere else and that would have been better than a year of no raise and no bonuses.,as an hourly employee this is probably a  close to 7k loss.,although... if the company was going to continue to be in the shitter our bonuses would have been shit anyways,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think this makes a lot of sense on the intel side.,in past downturns intel offered people voluntary separation or early retirement.,this helped intel reduce headcount and money for pay.,but it was always bad publicity.,now intel just cuts off bonus and other spending programs and cuts higher up pay.,now if people want to leave they will in theory quit.,now intel saves that money from them quiting.,they don't have to pay out that sum of money that people got with early retirement or separation.,plus if the quit and not get terminated.,intel doesn't have to pay out the unemployment money either,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

they did not anticipate the slump during the time of massive investments (double whammy for them - increased interest payments on loans and depreciation) and recruitment years ago.,it was a gamble.,"if the market continued upwards, their profits will be enormous.",unfortunately it went south and now they are burdened with increased fixed cost while the revenue continues downhill.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think there will still be series of lay-offs in companies specially those that deal with technology specially in the micro-chip related businesses.,the ones that could possibly remain steady are those that deal with food and agricultural products - basic consumption requirement for people.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it really depends on specialization.,senior graphics/gamdev people are not having a hard time right now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
unbelievable they cut 401k match but no cuts to the dividend.,401k should be the last thing that gets cut.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"fair, but imagine 10% of the company being laid off, there's no way my org could support the debug work across all the existing products in flight and coming if that happened.","and those layoffs would likely be worse than act, which was far more demoralizing than a pay cut for many reasons...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"that 5% number is pretty misleading since the qpb/apb aren't ""bonuses"" they are planned for and factored into your total compensation.",so by cutting those programs most >grade 7s are looking at a 15-20% pay cut.,it'll be more like 30-40% if they also cut the annual stock grant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"lol, news flash.",you work for the shareholders and it's not an attractive stock right now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wasn't aware of that.,i was under the impression that only less than 300 people were given pink slips.,i am sorry to hear that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't think things are that simple though as doing dividend freezes will immediately tank the stock.,and since most employees especially the big named critical ones are always paid at least partially in stock.,i wonder how possible it would be to retain that talent.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they don't even need to pause dividends, just decreasing them by 10c would make up for the pay cuts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"arguably, but still better than pat geslinger.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cutting dividends is a great way to tank your stock price.,that's probably worse for the employees.,many intel employees are heavily invested (and have been partially compensated) in stock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"you are right, but the fixed employment already hedges a lot of risks that one would incur working e.g.",as a permanent freelancer.,as freelancer i would earn better than at my current corpo job.,but i would also be among the first ones to get cut.,"i agree those things can always tip over to exploitation - i cannot assess it well enough in the intel case, not sure if their pay is good or shit by respective standards.",but to speak of exploitation would really mean bringing them down into a poverty standard of living - is that really the case?,last comment: actually remarkable to see a case of breaking the downward wage rigidity.,rarely ever happens.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that is why we are keeping stock compensation(rsus) this year as that has been, in general, more stock \~= intel believes in your future.","also heard there might still be a limited budget for grade level promotions, but without pay.",we'll learn more next week!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so why are you at a job for four years when you could have a 30% pay raise?,there must be other factors here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't think the nuance is lost at all.,capex spending is not great but hardly the biggest problem.,there are many other much bigger problems.,"being behind and still on 10nm process is one, keep slipping and not delivering products on time to compete with what's being offered by the competition is another.","79 billions revenue in 2021 down to 63 billions in 2022, then q1 2023 guide down to 11 billions vs 13+ from q1 2022, i think those numbers have sunk in for a lot of investors and for sure 2023 is going to be much tougher than 2022.

same here.,"the recognition system was a huge plus in our module and a great motivation tool, especially for us night shift trolls lol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i did not make the $4k you did but it was always nice to see a kudos come along.,even the $25 ones meant someone thought you did a good job and wanted to say thanks.,a nice gesture.,i just cannot believe that we save much from cutting this.,i guess we are down to the old adage of the beatings will continue until morale improves.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"at least you still got recognition, at intel site where i work, recognition system was prohibited to use save for management, 5 years ago.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think you count as a retiree for things like epp and stuff.,maybe medical plan?,"dunno, i'm not in us...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i can imagine a lot of people checking out at work until they land a new job.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm kinda worried that this might go down as pat's worst decision while intel ceo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hopefully they don't start financing everything with debt just so they can refuse to cut the dividend otherwise they are gonna just turn into at&t.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> don't forget they paid $1.5 billion in dividends just last quarter.,nearly $6 billion throughout the whole year.,paying that amount in a single quarter while heavily reducing pay of basically everyone is a slap in the face to all employees.,"tbf reducing the dividend would be slap to every shareholder (i'm not one of them), and so given the two i think they'd rather reduce employee wages or lay of staff.",ultimately i think wage reduction for everyone makes more sense than lay off.,i would scrap that dividend too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the oncall is such unbelievable horseshit.,the ltd/ltd-m split cut my team from 14 to 5. as a result we go on call *every three weeks*.,"i've never been so tired in my whole life, and the pay is just utter dogshit for the hours.","i'm the only citizen on my team, and the only one with more than a year here is the gl.",now i understand why.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

except all the tech giants are having layoffs.,"so, where do they all go?","there is a surpluse of 40,000 tech employees who have thus far been laid off.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe they increased dividend payouts to bolster the stock price with all the bad news going on.,"if the stock starts free falling, it'll hurt employees too and the company as a whole.","but it does seem simpler that executives just want to protect the stock, which holds a majority of their capital, at the cost of employee compensation.",it's hard for me to say at least.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm not in any way defending this - cutting base pay is a sin in my book - but let's look at the singular fact here:

the ceo has a fiduciary responsibility to the shareholders.","with that in mind, the board issued the dividend and the company cut payroll costs.","at the end of the day, that improved intel's (immediate) financial position.",that's not saying anything on the long-term effects of such a decision.,"however, in the short term, shareholders are probably happy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why does keeping stock holders happy at the expense of the employees a better way to go?,stock price and stock holders will have nothing to do to help the company turnaround but the employees definitely will.,"who cares about the stock price in the short term, get the business and the company back on track and everything else will take care of itself.",back of envelope calculations say that this may save the company a billion a year while they are paying out 6 billions a year in dividend.,maybe start a new generous stock plan vested in future years to give the employees some incentive and have the skin in the game instead of just stay and do the same work for less compensation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm not saying it is right or wrong, but keep in mind that raising cash may be needed.",that is intel may have to issue stocks to bring in cash to fuel their operations.,"personally, i think bonuses/difference in wages could have been given as stock options with a vesting period.",aligns the employees with the shareholders.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> not really.,"dividends fluctuate based on how the company is doing, and investors expect that.","this past year, every dividend amount was the highest in intel's history.",because of the poor outlook.,"they are trying to save the stock price and i think they were likely hoping that they wouldn't be hit so hard

"they laid off 10% of their work force back in september to november, mostly non engineering roles but still a number in line with the other tech companies.","more people have been getting laid off around the beginning of this month too, i've seen to many software engineers laid off from intel on linkedin.","500 people must have been one time in one place or something, that's a ludicrously small number.","this is pay cuts on top of layoffs that already happened, and i've heard some managers are even saying more layoffs are to come next quarter.",the exec pay and bonuses are majority stock grants which they are still getting.,"people on blind have been calculating that the ceo is getting less than 1% tc decrease, exec team less than 5%.","meanwhile grade 7 which is the entry level for phd is getting tc decrease of 15% or more due to no more bonuses, much greater than 5% base salary decrease.",our rsus are only 10-20k vesting over 4 years and it's not likely we're even getting that much (they delayed until july to award them this year).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

someone's daughter never used a pc until covid now she has two laptops.,trust me bro,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
disagree.,most analysts believed the covid upgrade cycle was specifically businesses upgrading earlier to provide for work from home.,intel was the only company expecting that to become the new normal at 350m units a year.,amd forecasted \~300m at the time.,"then intel lowered to 300-325 while the rest of the industry was at 270-295. last year came in at 270.

now for this year they are forecasting 300m units while the industry is forecasting 250m units.",they are setting themselves up for huge misses because one executive thinks that his daughter buying 2 laptops for school is the new normal.,"&#x200b;

i'm saying that on day shift i would have 3-4 hours of break time during a 12 hour day.,"i'm also saying that it has been widely known among technicians that because 95% of engineers aren't putting in plans to run during the nights, that they spend a substantial amount more time on break.",i've heard stories from peers that they come to work and sometimes never set foot in the fab at all instead staying in the shared computer space or the cafe and just hang out.,sometimes in extreme cases they get paid to sit at home and wait for a call or text before even heading to work.,"that's obviously an extreme example and is 100% time theft, but i do know that it happens.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i added a /s for sarcasm to be more clearâ€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the way it's been explained to me is that intel is trying to prevent a mass stock sell-off.,"they're afraid that if they cut or eliminate the dividend, the stock price will tank, allowing a hostile takeover by activist investors who will split the company up and sell off the assets for profit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

are you kidding me?,"just because one executive's daughter is buying two laptops, then that will be true for all consumers?",that is stretching too much.,listen to what intel and amd official statements on sales forecasts for 2023. it is not rosy due to the economic slump.,the work from home could have upticked the demand in 2021 but will they replace the ones they bought last 2021?,i do not think so..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think i know why intel engineering is suffering so much...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i spoke to an intel technician recently who often literally sleeps, at home, in his bed, during night shifts, and only makes the 20 minute drive in to the fab if his phone rings, because he says he can reasonably claim he was in the gym in the other end of the campus and it took him 20 minutes to get showered, changed, and walk over.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"or don't eliminate the whole dividend, reduce 1/6 would get them a billion a year.",that's the amount that they raised last year.,the dividend would still be in 3-4% range which is crazy high for a tech company.,why did they raise the dividend last year in the first place?,i thought that was too much in light of the amount of investment they were doing and planning on doing at the time?,another example of trying to please wall street instead of being in tune and in sync with the direction of your own business.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there's a chance of that happening if they eliminate dividend, but right now they are 100% losing talent, do they not understand that brain drain is what brought them to their current state",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's not that hard, unless you're bent on 100% of your skills being convertible.",i do have another job lined up now.,key was leveraging my experience with ultra high vacuum systems.,my job before intel had nothing to do with what i did at intel save for some minor similarities in some aspects of the process.,my job after intel?,same deal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's exactly my point.,at intel's last conference the presenter told a story about his daughter wanting 2 laptops to justify the 300m numbers instead of data.,assuming other consumers will approach this way which sounds unreasonable.,"intel's official number is 270-295m units, and optimistic of 300m from pat's own words on the call in q&a.",amd's official number currently is 10% below last year.,"last year was 250-270m units, so roughly 225-250m units (depending on if you use idc or other).","december's sell-through was equivalent to a 200m unit year, which could be gigantic miss if purchases don't pick up.","and i agree, that people and businesses who upgraded earlier during covid because of work-from-home and other factors of lockdowns won't be purchasing again anytime soon, so being optimistic of a return to 300m units is naive if you ask me.","there aren't even many/any programs that need extra horsepower these days unless your doing rendering or other heavy workloads, and those aren't the majority of notebook purchases.","so i think intel is going to over-estimate again with their 270-295, and 300 is just outrageous.","q1 may suggest otherwise but consensus is roughly 250m units this year currently, 270 best case.","at this point, q1 is trending roughly equal to q4, and q2 not much better.",but there is hope of a big resurgence in 2h which i don't see happening.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"eh, the problem is they don't give technicians enough responsibility or ownership.",my module is split between development and ramp and the development side of things has the most work and unfortunately the overwhelming majority of tasks are engineer owned because they are creating the experiments for us to run.,now let's think about the hours engineers work.,8-5 with on call after 5. typically most of the work orders are wrapped up before 10pm because they stop putting them in when they go home and the night shift is only there to make sure the place doesn't burn down.,the other problem is at least in the 4 years ive worked there ive noticed that intel hasn't really fostered an environment that encourages going above and beyond to learn and excel in your technician role.,when one of your most knowledgeable technicians who's also on the safety committee and covering for the shift group leader when they are off is still making less than people that get hired on now... it's demoralizing.,why would or should that technician care about the efficiency of an organization that doesn't care about their efforts?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm in operations so there's always something for us to look at, but a tech on the pm side just flat out might not be assigned to something for the day.","if there's no tools that need work, then they likely are just going to sit in cafe or in your case... sit at home and wait for them to trigger a pm.",again... night shift is interesting because if engineers aren't actively triggering things on night shift then all they have to do is continue working on a pm day shift didn't finish or just stay on standby.,i haven't worked nights long enough to fully understand how it all looks yet though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"whats interesting in this article to me is the suggestion that i9, and perhaps even i7 are cut from the mtl-s release.","while this seems a little silly, if your big push is efficiency on this generation, then the market segment that is most interested in efficiency and lower heat is going to be the more midrange.",lower volume cpus might also be worth cutting with intel's current struggles.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

probably it performs so well that they outperformed 8p16e raptor lake even with less number of cores?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think releasing meteor lake as mobile only would be better followed by arrow lake in desktop,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel's fortunes needs more than this unfortunately.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't quite understand the concern over tile development.,the point of tiles is that they can change the cores and graphics while keeping the io and memory interfaces the same which reduces the development workload quite a bit.,they are not designing special tiles for every soc and the development issues with e.g.,the cpu tile should be less than with monolithic dies as it is considerably smaller.,also for the love of god please stop talking about 10nm and 7nm.,you are just confusing people.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

or mtl-s won't come out if it can't get out this year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there's a different rumor that mtl will have only single digit ipc increase and about the same clocks as raptor lake-p on mobile.,so if it were to launch on desktop the only advantage it'd offer is much better efficiency at lower performance.,"so it's probably not gonna launch for desktop, being mobile only like tiger lake",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i'd be shocked if they can't ship anything this year given they're pushing stuff for lga 1851. especially since intel 4 is apparently up and running and they said in the q4 stuff that mtl was on track

my big expectation would be that if they do release, its only i7 and i5 as those are the biggest sellers.","also i'm pretty sure their website leaked 2 different sets fairly recently, which would be 6p 16e and 6p 8e which seem like they would be i7 and i5 respectively",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"more like ice lake i bet, with no h series chip either.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably clock speed increases by alot since now on intel 4?,iâ€™m not sure if it even comes out for desktop though as i heard it is not for deaktop.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">also intel should've stuck with the old nm spec, their rename seems to have had the opposite effect.","everyone still uses 'nm' for nodes, and the renaming only caused some to believe that intel is trying to mislead others.",i don't think there are more than a couple of journalists who still insist on the nanometers.,almost everybody uses intel7 and intel4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but are we sure those are not mobile chips?,"mtl seems to be aimed at mobile, and a desktop launch might have been a possibility long ago.",things might not have gone too well and intel might have canned it; there's no reason to downgrade the die as mtl uses foveros & intel 4 has crazy improvements over intel 7 in density.,"if anything, there would be room for a core increase, area wise.","redwood cove also doesn't widen the core further as adl already does that, so there really doesn't seem to have much of a limitation here.","gotta also remember that they need some space in the package for the tgpu which had to be downgraded to n5 for whatever reason, and how increasing p-cores on the mobile side does not equal to a upgrade efficiency wise.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they have said pretty much all the time with all leakers pretty much also saying this.,there will not be any meteor lake for desktop.,that's pretty much the consensus anyways.,i'd love meteor lake since i am a sucker for more power efficiency and lower heat.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rumours say 6p+16e project was canned now.,i think mtl-s has been iced at this point.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all leaks seem to indicate that clocks have actually regressed slightly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if yields are a concern when ramping up a new node, then you can't make a large die.","meteor lake is meant to separate out the io and graphics from the compute tile, so if they can't make a 6+16 tile that's mostly just compute, that's worrying, especially for granite rapids and sierra forest that will be massive tiles on intel 3.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6p 16e and 6p 8e were leaked as mtl-s which is the desktop code.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think you're correct.,intel won't release meteor lake low-end i3s and mid-range i5s for the desktop while those wanting an i7 or i9 will have to settle for raptor lake refresh with a previous generation motherboard and lga 1700 socket.,it would be a bad marketing strategy.,the change on the desktop from raptor lake and lga 1700 to a new architecture and socket won't happen until arrow lake-s that's expected to have as many as 8-p cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for me it's not even the cpu so much as just having more pcie 5 lanes.,"at least, i'm hoping next-gen motherboards have a huge push toward gen5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"then probably the ipc, i donâ€™t see how they release something worst than previous gen although itâ€™s not unthinkable after the 11th gen. but still i believe they have something up their sleeve that we donâ€™t know yet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sure, but we're talking about 2x density gains on intel 4 vs 7. if they can't make a 6+16 die under those conditions, intel 4 is a total failure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with rumored single digit ipc increase and lower max clocks vs. raptor lake-s(up to 6ghz) there's no point in launching mtl-s 6+16 since it'd be slower at basically everything and probably costing more to make.,on mobile mtl can bring massive efficiency increase due to power constraints but i doubt that'd be relevant for k series cpus.,yield is not the only limiting factor.,"also intel 3(gnr, srf) ramp is in mid to late 2024 so there's plenty of time to improve yield.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably the lineup just tops out at the i5-14600k.,thatâ€™d be fine with me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if the marketing goes all in on improvements in efficiency instead of performance they could get away with it.,something like 90% of the performance of a 45w 13700 laptop cpu while using half the amount of power.,since meteor lake is mainly for laptops the improvements in battery life and reduced heat output/ less fan noise could be a huge win.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel claimed that its 10 nm node was 2.7x denser than 14 nm, and yet its first real generation (ice lake) only had 4 cores, compared to 10 cores for the contemporary comet lake desktop parts.","denser nodes typically mean more transistors per core, so the change in die size isn't as drastic as well.","i do agree that if intel is constrained by yield to not make 6+16 compute tiles, that's a problem.",i'm also saying that intel has been in that situation before.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

artist need fast single threaded performance and these workstation chips are much slower than the 13900k at single core performance.,yes we need fast multithreaded performance as well but most of the things we do interactively on our pcs arenâ€™t heavily multithreaded.,for example character animators in maya need high single core frequency to improve the performance of character rigs because most of mayas functions arenâ€™t heavily multithreaded.,at best maybe theyâ€™ll use a couple threads so your rigs functions need to process as fast as possible to animate.,these xeons are slower than a 13900k in this situation.,the same can be said in zbrush where your sculpting performance depends on one core.,the rest of the cores render the geometry in real-time but the faster a single core is determines how smooth your sculpting functions are.,rendering is of course multithreaded but thatâ€™s not an interactive process usually.,so as a threadripper user that bought a 13900k for the better single threaded performanceâ€¦ i donâ€™t see these workstation chips being the solution for most creative tasks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
threadripper 5995wx is $6644 on amazon as a comparison,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the question i have is how are we supposed to cool these?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i expect you could tune them (oc skus) for a great one thread boost,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hi there,

this need for single threaded performance (as well as good multi-threaded performanc) during the whole content creation workflow is actually why we have our intel turbo boost max tech 3.0 frequencies, to help with the system responsiveness.","(check the processor pages on ark.intel.com for each frequency)

we also understand that when it comes to workstations, it comes down to the ""right tool for the right job"".",our intel core processors are great for some tasks and our intel xeon w processors are great for other.,this topic actually gets me thinking about a video idea to talk about.,iamintel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's right.,but there is also w680 which has lower core counts and higher clockspeeds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, good point.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'd guess that cooling those monsters is quiet easy.,power consumption is pretty low for its size,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's 1600 mm^2 of silicon.,"that's over twice the size of a 4090.  it's a lot of heat, but it's not particularly dense.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, i think air is right out.","that leaves one hell of a custom water cooling setup as the only option, as i don't know if there are 400+ watt capable aio's (but please correct me if i'm wrong).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's possible but even on my 3970x (threadripper 32 cores) the max frequency on a single core is 4.5.

it will depend on the chip and what intel lets us do.","i mean if it's like the 13900k where we can define how many cores boost to 6ghz then sure, it might be ok.

the problem though with these massive core counts is it becomes much harder to run all the cores at higher frequencies, and the reason you buy these chips is for the massive core counts is the incredible multi threaded performance across all the cores.",but it usually sacrifices the single core performance.,but you're right.,we'll see what intel lets us do in terms of settings.,i know with threadripper you couldn't really boost a core past 4.5 at all.,the chip liked keeping all the cores in sync speed wise.,intel however with 13900k does let us configure the individual core performance a bit more.,it will be interesting to see but i would still expect single core performance to be lower due to the fact that intel isn't at all promising anything higher than 4.8 when we know the 13900k cores can go up to 5.5ghz easily.,we'll see.,gpu rendering has become so fast on the 4090 that i am very happy on a 13900k with a 4090. the 13900k itself renders just slightly slower than my threadripper but it has significantly better single threaded performance when working.,it really is a big difference.,i can live with slightly less render performance.,cinebench r23 multi on threadripper is 45k where as 13900k is 40k.,i can live with it because gpu rendering is so fast.,"my threadripper doesn't stand a chance against the 4090 :) so these high core count xeons, while great... are going to be paired with gpu rendering, and thanks to more pcie lanes, more gpus.. and perhaps thats the real benefit of these chips.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the spec sheet for the w9-3495x says it can draw 420w.,no consumer cpu has ever drawn that much before.,even my threadripper pro at 280w overwhelms a standard aio.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's not the density i worry about, it's the tdp.",up to 420 watts!,"obviously tdp from generation to generation doesn't mean the same thing because it's basically a made-up metric, but still, the days of cooling your hedt cpu with a 240mm rad are probably over with numbers like that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"even if there were 400w aios, there's nothing with a block that will fit one of these.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
air cooling will work well.,420w isn't that much when you consider the die size.,gpus can also be easily cooled without water at 450w+,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
air coolers definitely can.,420w is quite a lot for cpus but compared to gpus it's not that high.,even 3090ti can draw significantly more power and stays relatively cool.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 7980xe and it's refreshes could draw 500w+ while overclocked and that was a much smaller cpu which was sort of coolable with watercooling.,also there was that overclockable 28 core xeon that pulled more and is still smaller than these new ones will be.,will be interesting to see just how much power that 56 core will pull when overclocked if the base power draw is already so high.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"alphacool makes a few ~$150 blocks for them, but not an aio, of course.",https://www.aquatuning.us/water-cooling/cpu-water-blocks/cpu-water-blocks/lga-3647-4891-4677/30073/alphacool-es-jet-lga-4677-2u,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that is true, though gpus are direct die and have custom coolers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's a great point but look at the size of those gpu coolers.,something will need to be purpose designed to do that for a cpu and still allow ram and gpu clearance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gpu coolers aren't that much bigger though.,being a pcie card limits the dimensions of the cooler itself.,"a 3090ti (asus tuf gaming) is only like 1,6kg including fans and gpu.",so it's probably like 1.2kg max for the cooler.,that's close to the weight of a noctua nh d15 and even by volume it's pretty similar.,a cube like form is way more space efficient than anything that has to go inside a pcie slot.,nh d15 sized air coolers should easily be able to cool this cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for comparison: a 3090ti fe is 33.6cm ã—6.1cm ã— 14cm = 2,869cm^2 
nh-d15: about 15cm ã— 15cm ã— 15cm = 3,375cm^2
3090ti weights 1.677kg
nh-d15 weights 1.320kg.",nh-d15 is already bigger by volume and probably similar weight too.,with 420w instead of 450w this should be enough.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
welp.,i don't think my 9900k has ever felt so embarrassed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"slow down pal, upgrading a build costs a lot, my motherboard is based on lga 1151 and barely supports anything higher than a pentium g4620, which means i would have to upgrade the whole pc and not just simply the cpu or gpu,
also the highest end 1060(which i have, evga ssc gaming oc) that's well binned and with memory and frequency oc and if it's the 9gbps variant is plenty superior to a standard gtx 1650 and gtx 1650s, which is what the average gamer has, so game developers will still have to keep in consideration my gpu when developing and optimizing games, it's far from being out of games yet, i can still play 2k and 4k nintendo switch games on ryujinx with it in games where the cpu is not the limiting factor, just beacuse some modern games don't run well on it doesn't mean it's the gpu's fault lol, some games run all the same on 1650, 1060 and 1650s even though some max out the 4gb of vram on the 1650 and 1650s and not the 6(7-8 gigs with oc) on the 1060, optimization is a factor too.","also i have checked some benchmarks for the laptop gpus and even the laptop 4090 is far from the desktop 4090 levels of performance, and since the 13980hx is only slightly inferior to the 13900k in terms of raw power, it will bottleneck it severely in real life performance, alongside having barely less than half a hour screen-time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not everyone gives a shit about the latest components lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your friend will be fine.,just don't tell intel you undervolted if for whatever reason you need to send it in for warranty.,plus undervolting doesn't damage the  cpu.,using xmp (for example) will void the warranty though ( all you have to do is clear the cmos before giving intel information about your system) undervolting is perfectly fine.,also if you truly want to undervolt it and make it stay consistent do it from the bios.,i thought xtu was the way to go for my 13900k but when i tried to undervolt it wouldn't do it.,even after turning off multi core enhancement and making sure undervolt protection was off.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

okay i think iâ€™ll do that!,how did you undervolt using xtu tho?,i thought it required undervolting to be offâ€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the laptop caps it at 200w,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i undervolt using the bios.,i have a asus mobo.,i found out there was a setting in my bios that was not allowing xtu to undervolt.,"but before i figured it out, i found out how to undervolt from the bios and stayed with that.",undervolting from the bios is better overall and makes sure you stay consistent with your settings.,once you find that sweet spot undervolt in the bios it stays there.,when you undervolt in the bios and then boot up xtu..if you see your core voltage offset in the negative with whatever offset number you personally set i'm the bios  that's how you know for sure you undervolted.,whatever number you set in the bios...xtu will reflect that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

pretty much any upgrade from an 11th gen or before going into 12th or above gives a significant improvement on single thread performance.,12th gen alone is a really big jump.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

absolutely.,but if your budget can be stretched a bit the i5-13600k or i5-13600kf would be better choices.,"you will need to upgrade your mb either way because 13.gen intel uses a different socket on the mb than 9.th gen (the one you have), and with a 1660s you will likely not be able to fully utilise any of these 3 cpus (assuming itâ€™s for gaming purposes).","so in short, yes it will be a good upgrade, cpu wise, but it might not be the best upgrade (cost vs performance).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i didnt say it does, but thats not strictly true you have to setup the fan curve in the bios properly, oh wait nobody know's how to do that these days and uses an external box thats software controled

and i didnt say its coolable at 454w i said thats the limit of my cooling 
i wouldnt like to keep it bouncing 2 cores off tj max at 454w for more than a few mins

i was infact talking about setting up the cpu properly or close to to intel spec
and not just whacking in random voltages and load line values (llc) and expecting to not have bad transients and such but yes in general cooling 454w isnt much to do with the bios


good job",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

for maximum cooling capacity that really isnâ€™t relevant as outside some special cases you would be running the fans at maximum.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"no shit sherlock
thats half of the problem though

alot of people here have no idea and have a corsair control box and such running the fans / aio at 600rpm and wonder why they can only cool 200w

my fans run at 100% when the thermistor under the cpu hits 45â°c
which is about 55â°c die temp this allows plenty of time for ramp delays

and also results in a silent pc for daily use

try bios 9.03. the second round of 13th-gen-compatible bios for at least some asrock z690 boards tends to overvolt a lot.,mine was pushing past 1.5v and after the bios was rolled back it stayed at 1.3v or less.,also you should manually set the tjmax.,default is 115c and intel specs 100c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the only things configured are those that are pictured.,"and as far as -250 being insane, i thought the same when i saw 1.58v going through my brand new processor.","i only can seem to find llc offset settings in bios and all of them are set to auto

wow!,undercoating might be a good idea then.,that's crazy!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i found that using the cpu vcore compensation setting on level 1(out of 5) and removing all of my previous fivr configurations has dropped the voltage to ~1.27v on idle and 1.3v max.,the stress test on cpu-z actually drops the voltage down to 1.23ish instead of before where it would spike to 1.48. also no more temps over 87c on stress test whereas before it would hit 105+,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"also, where did you set your undervolt offset?",in fivr config or in voltage config?,"i posted what i have as far as fivr configuration options but in voltage configuration, i have the option to set cpu core/cache into offset mode, this only allows for a maximum of -100mv.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ok so no final update, but for now - this problem is solved (mostly) but just setting my avx offset to 0, however, that still permits a clock drop of 100mhz (as if i was still using avx offset-1) no matter what i change (not downclocking, no increased power limit, nada).","i read that, but dont know for sure that, intel in mc or some driver/etc within windows can force a -100mhz whenever avx is stressed, no matter what your settings are.","until someone can give me some solid path around this, i will just assume that for certain workloads my clock is a who-cares-it's-only-100mhz lower and doubt test when it comes to prime 95 small fft.","its not much work, and i want to get this this to its 24/7 sooner rather than later (investigating avx bs is not fun - finding the limits of your silicon is !","[gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|yummy) )

this was my big question when i was debating on my current build.,"most people only focus on max numbers, essentially benchmarks, then think it'll always use that much power.",it doesn't.,i found a couple youtube videos that did a side by side comparison.,"yes, amd is more efficient because it's on a smaller process, but the difference is really only a few percent.","in my mind it was negligible, so i went with the better chip, which to me was the 13700k.","raptor lake can be a power hog, but that's also why it's so much faster in multicore performance.",gaming will only use ~15% processing power because most of the work is on the gpu side so it's a walk in the park for this cpu.,i'd suggest looking at those videos yourself and determining which way is best for you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

bit hard to explain, but let's say pbo pushes a 5600x to 4.8ghz in a game, with 1.5v and that yields 70w power draw, setting a ""traditional"" overclock of say 4.6ghz with 1.3v would keep it at 1.3v in the game, in turn giving a lower power draw.","again i might be completely wrong here, just speculating.","(also not saying you should run a static overclock instead of pbo, i have no idea)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

igpu doesn't use lanes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the igpu is literally on the same piece of silicon as the cpu cores.,it doesn't need pcie lanes to link them.,it even uses system ram like the cpu instead of having its own separate vram.,"even if they weren't physically the same chip, like with amd's chiplets, they have special high speed, low latency interconnects between parts of the cpu package that are not pcie based.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's not a problem.,can use igpu and dgpu at the same time without having any sacrifice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how does it work?,it would use something likes qpi?,i heard the navi gpu in amd 7000 series is a part of its io die.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel uses its ring/mesh bus system for single die internal communication.,the exact implementation of this bus varies between processor architectures.,intel qpi (a successor to the front side bus) is obsolete for single socket cpus because the northbridge it was designed to connect to the cpu cores was directly integrated into the cpu die.,qpi was also superseded by [upi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intel_ultra_path_interconnect) for multi-socket systems to communicate between separate socket cpus.,the proprietary dmi link is what they use to communicate with the pch.,these lanes are exclusive for this purpose and do not get reallocated like the pcie lanes.,"intel's current implementation for communication between separate dies on the same package is called embedded multi-die interconnect bridge (emib), with a further development development into 3d die stacking called foveros.",more information on these technologies can be found [here](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16823/intel-accelerated-offensive-process-roadmap-updates-to-10nm-7nm-4nm-3nm-20a-18a-packaging-foundry-emib-foveros/4).,"emib has already been in use with some laptop chips that used a separate igpu die (which were amd gpus no less), and foveros will be prominently featured with meteor lake which will use several heterogeneous chiplets on the same package.",amd's inter-die interconnect technology is called [infinity fabric](https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/amd/infinity_fabric).,amd uses this to communicate between the multi-die chiplets.,"not only is the io and igpu on a separate die, but cpu cores can also be in clusters on separate dies (the 7950x for example has two dies of 8 cores each as well as the io/igpu die) necessitating if to communicate between them.","all of these are proprietary technologies not (directly) related to pcie, which is a standardized protocol used for communication with external devices.","neither intel nor amd use pcie to connect on-package igpus, and use of an igpu has no affect on processor pcie connectivity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1. threads are launched/created at runtime.,code will only contain logic if and when it will use multithreading.,2. the cpu has no knowledge how threads belonging to the same program relate to one another.,this logic is encapsulated within the program itself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
programs have to tell the operating system to create each new thread at run time.,"for example, on windows you can call createthread with a pointer to the code you want the thread to run.","windows then creates that thread, schedules it to run and loads up the code you passed to the function.",compilation just turns the programmers code into a binary file.,"so the call to createthread would be encoded in the binary, but nothing actually happens until you run the program.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you!,"regarding your second point, does that mean the reorder buffer also has no knowledge whether the operations it  tracks belongs to the same software program, and thus it just tracks /retires them per their order of being fetched/decoded?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"got it, thank you!","the multithreads are built into the source code, and the system simply creates and executes the multithreads per instructions of the source code.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the cpu just runs the instructions, it just does as the os tells it.",it is the os that keeps track of threads and two whom they belong.,"still, the os does not know what logic is behind any of the threads since only the application knows this.",the order of things returned by seperate threads has to be managed by the application that requested them in the first place.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"chips and cheese measured the p and e core consumption and efficiency:

https://chipsandcheese.com/2022/01/28/alder-lakes-power-efficiency-a-complicated-picture/

probably 2 more p cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"by area, 16 e cores occupy the same space as 4 p cores.",it's tricky to pin down just how much power e cores consume.,"it seems that with alder lake, 8 p cores in full multithread work load draw 240w.",adding in the e cores adds 20 watts.,raptor lake is more efficient though.,just for a rough ass approximation.,say 16 e cores consume 60w (some power is taken from the p cores).,p cores have a pretty linear +16-20w per core in nt work.,"so assuming the worst case, swapping e cores for p cores would net 2 p cores to fit in the same power envelope or 4 to stay in the same area.",intel's p cores are huge and power hungry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

isnâ€™t it 4 since e cores come in 4 core clusters?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
really?,that bad?,that is assuming they are running at 5.4 and 4.3 right?,"say we have all p cores but 8 running at 5.4 and the rest running at 4.3, how would they compare?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4 e cores are 1.33x the size of 1 p core.,"they aren't just a drop-in replacement, that's just the surface area they take up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not as much as i thought.,another commenter says 25w per 4 core cluster.,16 could use like 100w.,intel could probably make a 12 p core chip thatâ€™s the same area and power budget as 8+16,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

best you can put is 9900k.,"best what you can do within a budget is to sell cpu and motherboard and grab 12400/13600k and a b660 ddr4 board or z690-a pro ddr4, end spenditure should be similar (or even smaller), while you'll have more recent stuff, which is also faster than 9900k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what gpu do you have?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as it has been said, a 9900k is the best cpu you can get for the motherboard, but you will probably not see much of an improvement from your 9600k if your main purpose is gaming.","if you upgraded to a 13600k with a new motherboard, you will gain 1% low but your gpu may still hold you back.",the better route would be upgrading your gpu + psu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i decided to follow your advice and got an upgraded motherboard and a 12400!,thank you for your help!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
amd ryzen 5700xt!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ah interesting, yeah unfortunately financially i'm not in the right place to be making big upgrades like a gpu+psu but it's definitely the next item on the list.",thanks for the help!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think if your pc is mostly gaming your cpu should be ok. if you want an upgrade maybe see if there are good deals for a better gpu in your area.,an amd 6800xt or nvidia 3080 would give you a good boost imo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah only thing with getting a new gpu is i would need a stronger psu so i'm less inclined to make that big purchase lol but i'll look into it!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a nvidia 3080 uses **up to** 320 watts, your cpu probably uses around 100 watts.",we're only talking about 100 watts max more than you have to power already.,600 watt psu would be enough.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah my psu is a 550 ðÿ˜­ so i'd just miss out but that is for sure my next investment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

undervolting for 13th gen doesnâ€™t work properly on many b660 boards,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
msi z690-a pro ddr5.,pick the wifi option if you want it.,i run it with my 13600k and it's been solid.,it has usb bios flashing (which you'll need to boot a 13th-gen cpu).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
try to stick with z690 or z790 if you can squeeze it in.,"better vrms, way more lanes, better chance of pcie 5.0, double the bandwidth between chipset and cpu.",note that 700 series boards are a very minimal improvement over 600. all thatâ€™s changed is 4x pcie 3.0 chipset lanes have been changed to 4x 4.0 lanes.,nothing else of note.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"b660s are struggling with the correct voltage for 13th gens, people that have tried a b660 & 13600k combo are not posting positive results or comments.","they run 100c out of the box for everyone, and trying to undervolt on b660 causes them to lose performance.","i would also advise not to bother with b760 for the same reason, intel seem to have done something to make non z & k series work terribly to dissuade users from running that combo.","if you want to go the route of a b series board then pair it with a 13500, or 13600 non k when they release.",for a 13th gen k chip stick to a z series board.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to chime in on this, is sticking with ddr5 still worth it?",trying to decide between 64gb of ddr4 3200 or 32gb of ddr5 6400. could a z790 and i5-13600k even keep up with a potential ram replacement in the future or would the higher capacity be better for 4-5 years down the line?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so would you suggest a b760 in turn?,or move to the zx60s?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
second this.,msi z690-a pro ddr5 with a 13700k.,"works wonderfully, the most bang for the buck for ddr5 in my opinion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ddr5 speeds are also significantly better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">	they run 100c out of the box for everyone

not everyone, many people donâ€™t have this problem.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ddr5 is not worth it in my opinion/for gaming,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've just returned a b760 in exchange for a z790.,temps were crazy and undervolting options limited on the b series.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's the new intel policy: https://www.reddit.com/r/intel/comments/10dcjd9/intel_blocks_undervolting_on_alder_and_raptor_lake/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"one question, what do u mean exactly with timings are better on z790 ?","wanna build a new pc too and heared z690 just support lower timings, i want to go with ddr5 6400 kit u mean i need a z790 or is a z690 enough?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
where can i check which 660 are working?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are right - people with a high sp value on either or both the p or e cores get a chip that requests normal voltage.,people with average p and e core bins get a chip that requests 1.4v+.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for 6400mhz z690 should be enough.,"btw, it's a 12th gen or 13th gen cpu?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"anything thatâ€™s not msi will not have a problem, and even if you get an msi one with this problem then you can easily fix it by adjusting the lite load bios setting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, even low sp values will run ok if you have correct ac load line set in the bios.",afaik itâ€™s only the msi motherboards that sets their lite load much too high by default.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would go on the 13600k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes but higher sp chips run lower voltage at the same loadline.,"i've wasted weeks between msi and intel support only to find msi are following intel spec, albeit setting the maximum ll values specified of 110 each.","furthermore intel do not provide minimum or typical values, only maximum.","so now i no longer think its because of the ll settings - msi boards this gen have much stronger vrms than the other brands, 80a on pro-a, 90a on tomahawk, while typically asus are 60-70a.",the higher vrm amps at the same ll settings = higher volts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also you are aware you can only configure ac / dc ll on z series boards right?,hence why b660s are struggling.,"msi b660s support ll adjustment, but everyone that has tried it have also reported that it isn't working well.","maybe with the vrms are too weak, or the chipset itself is the issue.",if you get a chip that runs 100c as stock you can't do anything about it on a b series board.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it should be fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>	the higher vrm amps at the same ll settings = higher volts.,not true at all.,"the vrm â€œampsâ€ are only the maximum it is rated for, the cpu isnâ€™t going
to get more amps on a more powerful vrm just because it is rated for higher amps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ac and dc ll can be adjusted on most boards.,"even a h610 can do it, itâ€™s not limited to z series boards.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no thats exactly what happens, the watts you get is amps x volts.","higher amp vrms manage to run with lower volts, intel spec sheet says ll values have to be configured based on vrm power, someone dug them up and posted screenshots in the 13th gen ocnet thread.","intel however are doing a fine job keeping all the spec sheets fully hidden, i have no idea where they were found or where the screenshots came from, and intel support don't even know how to provide them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no they cant, those options are locked on non z boards, and only the msi b660 boards have it, and it is proven it still doesn't work by everyone thats tried it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my guy, i have an asus h610m-a motherboard and there are bios settings for both ac load line and dc load line.",they are not locked on non z boards.,"in fact, i have literally never encountered a modern motherboard with locked ac/dc load line settings.",please donâ€™t talk about things you have zero experience in.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think stick with a 13700k

if you cant fit a 280mm go for 240mm

not that much functional difference depending your work load and that

"sure but you're only getting 17fps so it's not really playable, if you look at it at 1080p with rt on you're getting barely playable framerates on the a770 but at that point you're getting a 23% increase with the 3090. strange how it doesn't scale down to playable framerates.","the 1% lows are really bad, looks like it's going to be a very jerky gaming experience :(",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

interested in how it turns out.,hopefully lots of investment in the driver/software stack.,they need to get it rocksolid by the time it is released or it wont end well.,better a delayed product than a rushed product that ends up tanking the lineup.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's true.,i guess i was just blown away by seeing arc perform anywhere near 3080 / 3090 in any scenario and i didn't look at the fine print.,"according to this [video](https://youtu.be/bet2ebxdppy), the xess implementation is doing a good job of boosting the raw performance too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

spotted the intel fan boy lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
howâ€¦?,drivers still need work and price:performance is still below radeon counterparts.,it outperforming gpus in a terribly optimized title that doesnâ€™t have game ready drivers yet means nothing.,only reason people buy arc is for media encoding or supporting another competitor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"no, itâ€™s consistent with other reviews iâ€™ve seen.",itâ€™s the benefit of having hardware accelerated ray tracing integrated into the architecture.,the arc gpus from a hardware level are basically attempting to be nvidia clones which is why it has the dedicated silicon for rt and their equivalent of tensor cores for xess.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yep, at launch i was laughing at the people buying arc cards.","now, they still all overpaid of course, but the a750 today at the new msrp of $250 isn't an awful option.","if you got the a750 for $250, meh.",it's not the greatest deal but it's acceptable and that's a pretty big step forward for intel so soon.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

on the high end the only important thing is raytracing.,"raster performance is more than powerful enough now, its the higher end features like raytracing that are much slower where i want my money to go towards.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
honestly i canâ€™t really complain about the state of the drivers right now personally.,they do everything i need them to with gaming/editing/normal usage without problems.,"granted itâ€™s still definitely a bad thing, and proves how underdeveloped radeons driver development team is.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the arc a770 generally has good rt performance.,it outperforms the rtx 3070 in metro exodus enhanced too.,i donâ€™t think itâ€™s a broken game setting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm not sure, but i think it has to do with building credibility.",let me jsut shoot my shot here.,"if intel had some in with a 600-700 dollar gpu that launched running as poorly as the a770 and a750 did, i think they would have been written off as a waste of money.","but with something as cheap, especially now, as an a750, i think it opens people up a lot to trying something different out, giving them a chance, and if it works really well, thats awesome, if its really bad, well its improving.","it appeals to a different market, but when they release an enthusiast series gpu with battlemage, its much better to have people go 'the alchemist gpus are actually pretty good, now its worth jumping in' for that bigger ticket item.","or maybe its a total cope and they just didn't yet have the experience to make an enthusiast gpu they were comfortable releasing, idk.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"theyre not ignoring the enthusiast market, that's what they're building battlemage for.","supposed to be a 4080 competitor that's both much cheaper and also comes with a full bus and vram offering, unlike the bs nvidia is peddling right now in the sub 4080 market.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i don't think they ignored the enthusiast market, this is their first card and expected to do better but at the end of development the best they had was a 3060 tier card.",their next gens should be doing some good catch-up to the higher end cards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
performance relative to voltage and overclocking isn't linear.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
enthusiast or prosumer tier products without a driver stack to back it up is dead in the water.,focusing on lower cost cards while they get their house in order on software is the right choice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
source?,"euro gamer has the 3070 beating the a770, and tpu has them both with very similar raster and hybrid performance.",what didnâ€™t happen was the a770 losing badly in raster and then come back surpassing the 3070 like it happened here in a half baked rt implementation.,so iâ€™m more than inclined to believe that there is a bug unless i see it fully working.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i thought they've publicly stated they're sticking at 200-250w for the next couple years?,"i understand that performance is not simply a byproduct of power budget, but that sounds to me like they're sticking at the current tier.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it was [tomâ€™s hardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/intel-arc-a770-limited-edition-review/5) it had a slight lead against rtx 3070 at 1440p.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that could just be for the mid range offering.,if they're going to put out a 4080 competitor it's gonna need more than 250w to do it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they didn't say they're sticking with it.,they said that was the sweet spot.,they already announced their enthusiast grade gpus are coming with battlemage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the margin is less than 2% in that title lol.,"if we look at more reviews, the 3070 is significantly ahead.","to me, hl is a big outlier that first needs investigation, before celebration.","if this is true, that's awesome to squeeze out raytracing for 25% performance cost instead of 50%+.","if you want to see how insane this is, compare that to the performance of the 2080 ti.","at 1440p, it takes on average an additional 24ms of rendering time per frame compared to 6.8ms for the a770 to render the ""same"" frames.",that means the a770 is 3.6x faster at raytracing than the 2080 ti which is slightly faster than the 3070 in this test.,tell me again how this passes the sniff test.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

these are good for price.,they are left over types i think.,perfectly fine for office use.,"that celeron g6900 is euqal/better in single core tasks with ryzen 3600.

they are low powered too.",i hope they won't stop producing these.,most of the time they are on discount.,pentiums are bit better.,amd has abandoned this price segment.,"if you want something with igpu around $50, can't beat this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i believe they are going to bundle both these products in to a new integrated banner at the same price points.,they are solid products for low power use.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
having only 2 cores isn't an issue for new intel-based laptops anymore since all of intel's current 12gen and 13th gen mobile chips have several e-cores to boost the thread count along with the large p-cores.,even current mobile alder lake pentiums and celerons have 4 e-cores along with 1 large p-core even though their desktop equivalents only have 2 large cores like previous generation chips.,intel's also going to release alder lake-n for cheap laptops that will only have 4 e-cores minimum with some chips having 8 e-cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah with e cores existing if there is enough defective chips it makes sense to replace them as celeron/pentiums,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you can always use a 12100 or a 13100 or an a380 though.,"driver issues aside, if you manage to get any of those working it might be okay.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"quicksync is intel's work-share between gpu and igpu to speed up encode/decode jobs, technology.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i don't think that's correct.,"the work-share is done by the os when detecting multiple gpus (be it dgpu or igpu), and it assigns simple jobs to the igpu to leave the dgpu for heavier tasks, though that is configurable on some os.","quicksync is a dedicated chip inside intel's igpu whose's sole purpose is to encode/decode video, speeding up the process and improving the quality.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"considering the overall power of the igpu of an intel 12th gen is not up to a 1050ti and the 1050ti can't do that, there's no hope of the igpu doing more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's not the gpu processing power that matters here, its the dedicated encoding/decoding chip's capabilities.","a quick search shows that, as other stated before, a 6th gen cpu can do the same as my 1050ti.","this dedicated chip is improved on each generation, and doesn't correspond to the cpu's raw performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ideally you aren't even using the gpu when hardware decoding, just the hardware decoder, so the gpu power is irrelevant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes the cpu is easily more powerful than the 1050ti...but the igpu is a seperate thing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hardware encoding implies hardware is used...which hardware would you be using then?,quicksync is useful because the igpu is literally doing nothing else and can focus on encode/decode in tandem with something else handling the computer actually being on and booted and displaying things.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hardware encoders are also a separate thing from a gpu's general processing rate.,quicksync is fine let it be.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hardware encoding is actually using separate fixed-function hardware to do the encoding.,"like how in intel's meteorlake the vpu is going to ""do"" ai-related stuff (whatever that ends up meaning) without using the cpu at all.","not all the work is being done on said hardware of course, but if you use game dvr and set task manager to show individual units' graphs on windows it shows that it's using a ""video processing"" part instead of the 3d part of the core",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>hardware encoding implies hardware is used...which hardware would you be using then?,the hardware decoder.,">quicksync is useful because the igpu is literally doing nothing else and can focus on encode/decode

you have no idea what you're talking about.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, the encoding hardware for an intel cpu is in the igpu part of the chip, and quicksync uses that in conjunction with something else doing all the computer stuff aside to encode/decode, or nvidia's nvenc/hvec stuff is in the gpu and in general using quicksync is done when you have a gpu doing the display/play stuff and the igpu doing the encode/decode bit.",nvidia's encode/decode is stronger than intels and amd's is generally ignored or considered bad.,"i'd consider a new jraphics card before buying an 11th gen, they really weren't that much of a step up from 10th, but upgrading to even a 3050 will make a huge difference in every possibly way including encode/decode because nvenc is the better system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i guess the important thing to note is that the video format the (fixed-function) hardware (en/de)coder supports generally isn't related to the actual power of the hardware but is more like an instruction set that it supports.,"like if you have an 11900k with avx 512 it might be faster in some tasks than a 12900k because it supports fixed function avx512 ""acceleration"" when the 12900k might need to do the calculations with avx 256 then.","similarly, intel's uhd 730 can hardware decode 4:4:4 hevc while the 1050ti can't (not even the 1080ti iirc) just because it doesn't support the format

i dunno this is definitely patronizing but i kind of feel bad if someone just talks to the person like ""you have no idea what you're talking about"", so that's all.",lol.,"it's just a misconception not a complete lack of understanding (ex: i do actually know that hardware encoding in the kaby lake igpus used some 3d processing power which is also used by games, but it also uses the actual encoder)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"whats interesting in this article to me is the suggestion that i9, and perhaps even i7 are cut from the mtl-s release.","while this seems a little silly, if your big push is efficiency on this generation, then the market segment that is most interested in efficiency and lower heat is going to be the more midrange.",lower volume cpus might also be worth cutting with intel's current struggles.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"alright, so itâ€™s about a 20-25% ipc increase across the board, so we have the equivalent of 7.2-7.5 raptor cove cores and 9.6-10 gracement cores.","i wouldnâ€™t be surprised to see this thing beat the 13700k by 5-10% in multicore, but donâ€™t expect more than that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

intel's fortunes needs more than this unfortunately.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't quite understand the concern over tile development.,the point of tiles is that they can change the cores and graphics while keeping the io and memory interfaces the same which reduces the development workload quite a bit.,they are not designing special tiles for every soc and the development issues with e.g.,the cpu tile should be less than with monolithic dies as it is considerably smaller.,also for the love of god please stop talking about 10nm and 7nm.,you are just confusing people.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there's a different rumor that mtl will have only single digit ipc increase and about the same clocks as raptor lake-p on mobile.,so if it were to launch on desktop the only advantage it'd offer is much better efficiency at lower performance.,"so it's probably not gonna launch for desktop, being mobile only like tiger lake",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i'd be shocked if they can't ship anything this year given they're pushing stuff for lga 1851. especially since intel 4 is apparently up and running and they said in the q4 stuff that mtl was on track

my big expectation would be that if they do release, its only i7 and i5 as those are the biggest sellers.","also i'm pretty sure their website leaked 2 different sets fairly recently, which would be 6p 16e and 6p 8e which seem like they would be i7 and i5 respectively",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

probably clock speed increases by alot since now on intel 4?,iâ€™m not sure if it even comes out for desktop though as i heard it is not for deaktop.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">also intel should've stuck with the old nm spec, their rename seems to have had the opposite effect.","everyone still uses 'nm' for nodes, and the renaming only caused some to believe that intel is trying to mislead others.",i don't think there are more than a couple of journalists who still insist on the nanometers.,almost everybody uses intel7 and intel4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but are we sure those are not mobile chips?,"mtl seems to be aimed at mobile, and a desktop launch might have been a possibility long ago.",things might not have gone too well and intel might have canned it; there's no reason to downgrade the die as mtl uses foveros & intel 4 has crazy improvements over intel 7 in density.,"if anything, there would be room for a core increase, area wise.","redwood cove also doesn't widen the core further as adl already does that, so there really doesn't seem to have much of a limitation here.","gotta also remember that they need some space in the package for the tgpu which had to be downgraded to n5 for whatever reason, and how increasing p-cores on the mobile side does not equal to a upgrade efficiency wise.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they have said pretty much all the time with all leakers pretty much also saying this.,there will not be any meteor lake for desktop.,that's pretty much the consensus anyways.,i'd love meteor lake since i am a sucker for more power efficiency and lower heat.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rumours say 6p+16e project was canned now.,i think mtl-s has been iced at this point.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all leaks seem to indicate that clocks have actually regressed slightly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if yields are a concern when ramping up a new node, then you can't make a large die.","meteor lake is meant to separate out the io and graphics from the compute tile, so if they can't make a 6+16 tile that's mostly just compute, that's worrying, especially for granite rapids and sierra forest that will be massive tiles on intel 3.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6p 16e and 6p 8e were leaked as mtl-s which is the desktop code.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think you're correct.,intel won't release meteor lake low-end i3s and mid-range i5s for the desktop while those wanting an i7 or i9 will have to settle for raptor lake refresh with a previous generation motherboard and lga 1700 socket.,it would be a bad marketing strategy.,the change on the desktop from raptor lake and lga 1700 to a new architecture and socket won't happen until arrow lake-s that's expected to have as many as 8-p cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for me it's not even the cpu so much as just having more pcie 5 lanes.,"at least, i'm hoping next-gen motherboards have a huge push toward gen5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"then probably the ipc, i donâ€™t see how they release something worst than previous gen although itâ€™s not unthinkable after the 11th gen. but still i believe they have something up their sleeve that we donâ€™t know yet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sure, but we're talking about 2x density gains on intel 4 vs 7. if they can't make a 6+16 die under those conditions, intel 4 is a total failure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with rumored single digit ipc increase and lower max clocks vs. raptor lake-s(up to 6ghz) there's no point in launching mtl-s 6+16 since it'd be slower at basically everything and probably costing more to make.,on mobile mtl can bring massive efficiency increase due to power constraints but i doubt that'd be relevant for k series cpus.,yield is not the only limiting factor.,"also intel 3(gnr, srf) ramp is in mid to late 2024 so there's plenty of time to improve yield.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably the lineup just tops out at the i5-14600k.,thatâ€™d be fine with me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if the marketing goes all in on improvements in efficiency instead of performance they could get away with it.,something like 90% of the performance of a 45w 13700 laptop cpu while using half the amount of power.,since meteor lake is mainly for laptops the improvements in battery life and reduced heat output/ less fan noise could be a huge win.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel claimed that its 10 nm node was 2.7x denser than 14 nm, and yet its first real generation (ice lake) only had 4 cores, compared to 10 cores for the contemporary comet lake desktop parts.","denser nodes typically mean more transistors per core, so the change in die size isn't as drastic as well.","i do agree that if intel is constrained by yield to not make 6+16 compute tiles, that's a problem.",i'm also saying that intel has been in that situation before.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

windows smartly manages which processes go to which cores depending on the specific workload.,"https://www.anandtech.com/show/16959/intel-innovation-alder-lake-november-4th/3

> what makes windows 11 better than windows 10 in this regard is that windows 10 focuses more on the power of certain cores, whereas windows 11 expands that to efficiency as well.","while windows 10 considers the e-cores as lower performance than p-cores, it doesnâ€™t know how well each core does at a given frequency with a workload, whereas windows 11 does.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i will have to move to win11 with my next build, so im curious about this one too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i believe e cores are less power efficient than p cores for the same amount of work, theyâ€™re just more efficient in terms of performance for their area of silicon.",iâ€™m surprised the performance was the same across the 2 oses.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
updates to win10 has made it possible to use e-cores like win11.,iâ€™ve never liked win11 and donâ€™t understand why anyone would.,itâ€™s always a mess to me.,"stutters in games, weirdness/clunk feeling sometimes, etc.",went back to win10 with all updates and it works better with my setup (in my user flair).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cannot say i ever looked to be honest.,"i built a new rig and installed win 11, why would it not function properly?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
similar experience here.,"windows 11 is very good at handing most processes to available p cores, making the e-cores a sort of ""back up"" for if the p-cores are loaded down with other tasks.",idle i still have some e-core activity (maybe 3 cores).,but most of the e-cores are completely empty.,"in games it's all on the p-cores, and the e-cores start showing more activity running other applications.","imo this makes complete sense, so long as p-cores are free, i would rather have tasks be handed to & completed using them versus e-cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel thread director is implemented with windows 11 which allows the scheduler to know not just the per-core utilization, but also the per-core performance.","as such, p-cores are prioritized when available.","windows 10 doesn't have any knowledge of performance differences between cores, so it just throws the load at whatever cores are available.","that often leads to issues with high-load, foreground tasks  which could cause them to not perform as well as they otherwise would.",i wouldn't be concerned unless you're noticing some real issues.,"if you're trying to save power, you could play around with the power profiles.",there's also socket power limiting you can enforce.,i have my 12900k set to 150w max power because it still retains 90+% of stock performance for my workloads.,"when gaming though, it never pulls above 70w.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™m pretty sure someone told me before that windows 10 2h22 and windows 11 used the same task manager, so windows 10 can use the e cores properly.","still, thatâ€™s weird",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
windows 10 does this now.,"i can wait for windows 12, every other gen baby",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that article did a great job explaining it!,"thanks, i think i have a much better understanding on it now.","windows 11 takes into account efficiency and sometimes a task, even background task, is more efficient on the p cores even though e cores may more efficient at other tasks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep.,great answer buddy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s not causing any problems but it just goes against what people said which is interesting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">i believe e cores are less power efficient than p cores for the same amount of work

that's definitely wrong outside of maybe extremely avx-heavy loads where the e cores struggle.","rather what you're thinking of is that if you compare the e cores running at max clock (way past it's peak efficiency) to the p cores running at their most efficient point, then the p can be more efficient.",that's an unrealistic (and kind of stupid) comparison though since you'd never have the e cores at max boost while the p cores were down clocked.,if you do a fair comparison with both at max efficiency or both at max clock then the e cores will use significantly less energy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if i recall an article i read on this correctly, e-cores are more power efficient than p-cores at the low to middle-high range of their frequency, but at very top end frequencies the p-cores are actually more efficient for a set workload.","basically itâ€™s just an example of intel pushing e-cores a little too high for performance purposes, at the expense of efficiency.","kind of the same as p-cores, really.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have any article that says that?,i thought the whole idea for them was that they are more power efficient at the expense of not being as powerful.,and why are you surprised performance was the same?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>updates to win10 has made it possible to use e-cores like win11.,did they?,when?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no stutters or clunk feeling for me.,windows 11 works exactly as it's supposed to for most people.,"no lag, no slowness, no problems.",windows 10 is not optimised for the use with e-cores as windows 11 is though.,"https://www.intel.co.uk/content/www/uk/en/support/articles/000091284/processors.html#:\~:text=intel's%20thread%20director%20is%20a,is%20not%20optimized%20for%20it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pc works just fine.,"just e core were used more in windows 10, for what seemed like background tasks, compared to them not being as used in windows 11.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and thatâ€™s the version of windows 10 i was running , bizarre.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you should also read the part about the power plan at the bottom.,any task not in focus is assigned to an e core automatically.,so if youâ€™re working on something that is going to take long and you do something else in the meanwhile then the original task will now move to an e core.,this behavior is apparently stopped when you set the power mode to high performance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"don't ""buddy"" me, buddy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
will the p cores running the background task count as active cores?,"because if so, then someone who uses active core based boost clocks (like me) will have lower clock speeds on the p cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i agree, i just think e cores shouldâ€™ve been branded differently because efficiency implies performance/power for most people.",i donâ€™t expect layman to consider die size when hearing the word efficiency.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"gotcha, i didnâ€™t realize they scaled up that poorly.",power efficiency is admittedly pretty low on the list of things iâ€™m looking when researching cpus.,worst case scenario for me in gaming is all my cores max out for a couple seconds when a game is preparing shaders or loading something so as long as it doesnâ€™t throttle i go for max clock speeds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, i mentioned theyâ€™re pushed past the point of efficiency in another comment.",p cores are probably designed to be pushed harder so they end up scaling better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1 cluster of 4 e cores takes about about the same amount of space on the die as 1 p core but have much better combined multi core performance and slightly higher power consumption.,"all of this was coming out about a year ago after alder lakeâ€™s release, i donâ€™t have a specific source (just google alder lake e core power efficiency or something) but i think the e cores were clicked past their efficiency point.",as far as the os is concerned the main selling point of windows 11 (aside from the ui which is a mixed bag) is a new thread scheduler that was supposedly designed with heterogeneous core architectures in mind.,again you can find a lot research on this from about a year ago when w11 and 12th gen both launched.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

strange.,iâ€™ve used win11 on a laptop with a 12900h/3080ti and it still wasnâ€™t a pleasant experience.,win11 still hasnâ€™t matured enough to be like win10 yet.,hopefully in another year itâ€™ll be better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the windows 11 animations and such are slower.,it just feels heavier over all.,"the os doesnâ€™t feel as lightweight as windows 10, which is why windows 10 feels so much snappier and more responsive.","and true, but in daily use you wonâ€™t notice much of a difference at all as iâ€™ve used both on their latest builds.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i would check temps under load and see if you may be thermal throttling the cpu at this point as itâ€™s been 4-5 years.,you may just need to re-paste the cpu and that may get rid of the stutters,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"itâ€™s not that iâ€™m not happy, i just seeing people with the same specs as me exocet with a better cpu, having a stutter free time.","iâ€™m not sure if mine is cpu related, or if it is another issue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you are exactly right haha, that game will the the death of me",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you think itâ€™ll be worth it plus the ddr5?,i feel like if i wait i might as well save up and get a 5xxx series card as well tbh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
occasional stutters are usually a sign of a badly optimized game rather than weak hardware.,"and to be fair, depending on the game and settings i'd guess that at 4k the 3080 is more likely to cause stutters and lower fps than anything else.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm convinced hl cares more about a fast cpu and ram than it does a beefy gpu.,i was on an overclocked 9900k up until recently and i'm glad i upgraded.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this game highly relates to everything, a lot of ram, fast cpu, fast gpu with 12+ vram.","tweak it, or buy a whole new pc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not really.,"gaming benefits of ddr5 are very small, if any.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i also have an 8700k and asrock z370 taichi 32g cl32 ddr4 and 3 nvme m2 drives.win 11. have my a770 installed about 2 weeks.,i only play medium to low level games but it's been pretty much flawless.,the only problem i had was when i screwed around with bios settings trying to reduce the 40w idle power consumption.,i crashed windows with a tdr video error.,once i put the bios settings back i have had no problems.,running with the feb intel drivers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you have resizeable bar enabled?,"if not, performance will suck bigtime!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is your rebar really on?,"when i first got my a770, i had my rebar turned on in the bios, but according to intel software, it wasn't.","turns out, i needed to switch from mbr to gpt for rebar to work properly.","if that isn't it, could be hardware incompatibility.","while it works, it isn't working to the best of its ability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you have rebar on, then it's probably either a cpu bottleneck (unlikely most of the time with an 8700k) or buggy drivers with the game you're trying to run (far more likely).","for example, i only get around 50% gpu utilization in f1 2020 and f1 2022 with my a370m.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ok, here we go down this road again.",op you're setting yourself up for a temporary ban if you keep this up.,here is a basic physics lesson: you can not get below ambient with an air or water cooler as they are unable to get below thermal equilibrium.,it is physically impossible as it breaks the second law of thermodynamics.,only way to do it is with a thermoelectric heat pump also known as a peltier cooler or run the ac in your house to provide cooler air.,i do not know where this unhealthy obsession with 25c came from.,"as others have mentioned, idle temps don't really matter and if they did yours are totally fine as is.",if you are still struggling with that then my suggestion is to seek professional mental health as no one here is qualified to provide as such.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

u got the second fastest cpu in the world even if u reached 90 degrees it's still ok,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why is your cpu not downclocking in idle?,check energy profile and any energy saving options in bios,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the truth is your plate is not contacted correctly.,you need a base plate and spread the paste thinly over the cpu.,the pate drops the temps 5 to 10dgrees do not over tighten or it will mess up the pcie lanes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well i don't want to be that guy.. but did you remove the plastic cover  from the cpu cooler?,if unsure please check the bottom of the cpu cooler.,30 c idle is not that bad .,unless you live in siberia.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you and me brotha, what good is a cpu if it cant be at 25c idle

throw it out the window and try again",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at this point i cannot return to amd because i need the igpu for work and projects that the intel 13900k has.,"but this is just ridiculous that when i go to the bathroom or i don't do anything on my pc my temps are running at an abysmal rate, meanwhile paid the same price as everyone else, this has to be a defect for sure, probably going to have to get the 13900ks to get a guaranteed better boned cpu for my build, like i don't get it what's so hard for it to stay below 24c?",someone else has 19c!!!!,how???,"i really don't want a mac, tho that m2 mac mini looks promising for the price point, i cant!",help !,:( maybe a 360mm radiator?,i have a 280mm radiator,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

because its not reported accurately.,"hwinfo also reports my 13600k as always running at 5.1ghz for p cores, but when you look at total cpu power usage at idle, its 3-5w.","of course its not using 5w while running 5.1ghz clocks, its just not accurate clock reporting",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"see at least you don't attack me, thank you ive noticed this aswell but no one has said anything about this, all they do is point fingers as if i want to be here looking like a sissy comparing instead i wanna enjoy my elite build with elite and envious temps, but honestly no one's got the answers besides ""your temps are ok stop worrying about it"" so still no explanation about the 19c guess his room gotta be 5c lmaoo it's just funny at this point.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thereâ€™s no point in worrying about idle temps.,if itâ€™s within 10-15* c of your ambient temperature itâ€™s fine.,youâ€™ve posted about this multiple times and everybody says the same thing.,take a chill pill.,"edit: in all seriousness, set your room temperature to like 16-17* c, run your aio pump at 100% and bump up your fan speeds.",thatâ€™s the only way itâ€™s going to happen.,"if your os has nothing running, your cpu is using less than ~25 watts.",those photos could have been taken when the pc was literally in sleep mode for all you know.,youâ€™re obsessing over nothing.,touch grass.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"changing to 13900ks won't make your idle temp any better, you'll just pay the premium for nothing at all.","don't be too obsessed about idle temp, my 13700k literally sits around  35c at idle and i wouldn't even bat an eye to that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
last time i checked cpu doesn't start throttling until like 85-90c?,why even care?,your cpu lifespan isn't going to be effected by running at this low of a temp.,"you'd have to push a constant of like 100c daily but i honestly doubt even that would do anything

you bought the hottest, most powerful cpu on the market and are complaining about it generating a very very little amount of heat at idle.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"look, first of all a 280mm aio isn't quite good enough for a chip as power hungry as the 13900k/13900ks.","second, depending on your ambient temperature, 30c is a very reasonable idle temperature.",my 13900ks is around 30-33c idle and can kit 40k in cinebench r23 (i run an x73 kraken).,expecting an idle temperature of 24c with your setup is insanity (unless perhaps your ambient temperature is stupidly low and you run your fans/aio full blast).,"edit: by the way, do you realize that the cpu temperature will always exceed your ambient temperature, and usually by a good \~5-10c or more?",the aio liquid temperature will never be lower than your ambient temperature.,this is just basic physics.,i mention this because you talked about a 19c temperature.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't see the problem here.,"30â° is not what i would call ""abysmal"", not that idle temps really matter anyways.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
live somewhere colder,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can get the desired temperatures if you go back to school and come back in a couple of years.,i think you need more books than a 4090.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cpu coolers donâ€™t â€œgenerate coldnessâ€.,itâ€™s taking the heat from the cpu and pushing it out via heat exchanger and radiator.,the fluid that flows through the radiator transfers the heat to your atmosphere in your house.,the house air temps are the temps itâ€™s going to try equalize with.,the only way to continue to bring down your cpu temperature is to lower your house temperature.,"that aside, i have a 13900k and your temps are all slightly lower than mine, and iâ€™m having zero issues.",i donâ€™t think there is any defect in your cpu.,"itâ€™s just a beast, takes a lot of electricity, and therefore generates a lot of heat.",i would not be worried if i was you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

edit - i have a reply to the person below but it gotten eaten and i see i cannot reply - that's weird.","the things anyone can claim some z790 boards do better, cost noticeably more (+$100 at least on what can easily be a $100-200 board loaded with high end features) and are not things 99.9% of even hardcore pc user are going to care, or notice anyway (6.xghz ram vs 7.x ghz, depending on board), certainly nothing that will hold back the processor or your pricey options for nvme (depending on board, of course, but thats true of all gens)

"well its way better than those destroyed, murdered, wiping floor titles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because it has 24 physical cores thatâ€™s not up for debate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
small cores are still cores.,itâ€™s been this way for a long time with mobile chips (big.little),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can sue them if you feel they aren't 24 cores.,"amd got sued for something similar, don't know what happened, old case.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is nothing fake about those smaller cores.,theyâ€™re just optimised for a different purpose.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 13900k, with its 8 ""real cores"" and 16 ""fake cores"" that don't even have ht, has 50% better multi-core performance than the 18 ""real core"" 10980xe (and double the single-core performance).",i have had both processors so i verified this myself in real world applications.,"for those that can't do the math, that means the 24-core, 32-thread raptor lake has equivalent multithreaded processing power as a theoretical all ""p-core"" 27-core, 54-thread hedt cascade lake/skylake processor.","i'd call that very ""real"" performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they are real coresâ€¦ they just have different levels of performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they bump performance a lot, they are cores optimized in.die area and performance to accelerate multithreaded workloads, but wont run things like games even if they perform as a 7400 for each group of 4",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because of how the cpu works.,a thread is how much it can do.,"e.g minecraft, like most games, likes only one thread.","this is because a thread is a section of a core, which makes it so you can use more cpu out of your cpu.","so it would cost a lot to make a core bigger, and since they didn't do it, probably not much better than two.",sorry for the long answer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it is said that the intel royal core project, with prime/a/b/c cores, 4 different types of cores will give the ""prime"" core 4 threads, not anything like 8 but 4 is still a lot",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"technically they are, but some consumers out there are not going to be educated enough to know they're not getting 24 real performance cores, but 8 performance cores and 16 slow cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that was a bit different, they were calling threads cores so a 4/8 they said it was 8/8",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i know that e cores taken from intel atom series , and p cores are better version of cores from intel core series, isn't it?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but they're slower.,"they're not even more efficient, they're just smaller and slower.",someone (don't remember who) tested it and found that it takes 2.7 efficiency cores to roughly equal the performance of one zen 3 core.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's not the point.,the point is that it suggests you're buying a 24 core cpu.,"but you're not exactly getting the performance you would be getting with a real 24 core cpu, you're getting something more in line with a 16 core.",the 10980xe is 4 years old.,not sure why skylake is suddenly the benchmark we should measure modern cpus against.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's wrong.,the reason for not having more than 2 thread per core is because having that one extra thread (i.e.,hyperthreading) already gives diminishing returns.,one core with two threads is nowhere near twice as fast as one core with one thread.,it has nothing to do with the size of the core.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
both amd and intel are working on 3 and 4 way multithreading (smt) though.,"i wouldn't expect to see it until zen 5 at the earliest, probably not until zen 6 or 7 though.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if youâ€™re not educated enough to know that, you wouldnâ€™t care about it anyway even if you did know what it is.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it doesn't change the fact that those e cores are still physical cores and having e cores is better than smt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are misunderstanding what â€œefficiencyâ€ means in this context.,intelâ€™s efficiency cores are â€œspace efficientâ€ so they take up less space/surface area on the die for the same amount of performance.,i think it was something like 4 e cores for the space of 1 p core.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't know where you got that number from.,for pure number crunching tasks the e cores are tested to be roughly equal to a skylake core at the same frequency.,"even accounting the difference in frequency and thread count, i don't know any zen 3 that has 270% the performance of a skylake.","170%, maybe.",but 270% is bonkers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"first, there are 24 physical cores in the chip no matter how you count them, therefore it is a 24-core processor.",less than 3 years separate raptor lake and cascade lake-x (2 years and 10 months to be exact).,"and if that's too old, the 13900k also has multithreaded performance on-par with the 11-month old (6 months older than raptor lake) threadripper 5965wx with 24 ""real"" zen 3 cores (~40k in cinebench r23).",a mainstream 24-core processor provides equal multithreaded (and greatly superior single threaded) performance to a current 24-core hedt/workstation at a fraction of the cost.,"also, 16 p-cores would almost certainly not perform better than 8 p-cores + 16 e-cores, because it would immediately run into power and heat limitations (not to mention requiring a larger, more expensive die), especially on a laptop chip like this.","you would have to severely downclock all the p-cores to keep the power in check, which loses a large part of their advantage: that they can clock so much higher.","e-cores are relatively low clock, low power already, so restricting the package power budget has proportionally less effect on their performance.",a ht logical processor is also not as capable as a physical e-core processor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

but not as good as more performance cores with hyperthreading.,you only get 8 of those.,latest rumours are saying that meteor lake will only get 6 p cores max.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no i'm not misunderstanding that.,"we've always said that in this sub, that they're not ""performance per watt"" efficient, but space efficient.","but you missed my point, my point was that the average joe out there doesn't know this.",he think he's getting a 24 core cpu while the equivalent amd cpu in  the same laptop only has 16 cores.,"yet he'll get a slower machine with the intel ""24 core"" than the amd laptop with a 7945 that has higher multicore performance (if the latest leaks are accurate).","i'm asking if we're doing him a disservice by going along with intels misleading ""24 core"" marketing, when in reality the performance is more like ""8 full-speed cores and 16 half-speed cores"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it could have been 2.5 e-cores to 1 zen 3 core.,but it's in that range.,"remember, skylake is ancient, and while the ipc of the e-cores might be similar, they're clocked lower than skylake typically was and they also don't get hyperthreading.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"smt scaling is typically 20-30%, depending on workload.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're only going to find rumors as nothing is confirmed about it at this point.,"there was a rumor that amd would implement it in zen 3 and milan, that obviously didn't happen, and zen 4 is not a total redesign of the architecture, but zen 5 is more of a redesign than zen 4 was, so there's hope it makes it into zen 5. personally i wouldn't bet on it, maybe zen 6 or 7, probably in epyc first, then trickle down to desktops?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"according to techpowerup, for cinebench r23,

also zen 3 is only one generation ahead of skylake.","comparing a 5600x(6 zen 3 core 4.6 - 4.8 ghz) to a 8400(6 skylake core 6 thread at 4.0 ghz, same as some e core's boost frequency), you don't see a 150% advantage, more like 50%-80%.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, i'm asking him because when i've raised the subject with cpu engineers they've said that it would be stupid for consumer workloads.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

intel is making great strides in improving their graphic cardsâ€™ drivers but they are still not where they need to be.,"since this is your first build, i would recommend that you stick with amd, unless you really wish to help intel establish themselves in the market and are okay to deal with weird driver issues.",have fun and welcome to the club!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i agree with the top comment, i have an a770 and as good as it is now, i often get disappointed sometimes because of its performance.",i originally wanted this because of its strong ray tracing performance and i believed intel will also bring rasterisation performance to the table slowly.,"but in reality, amd has really good rasterisation performance for the dollar and ray tracing in most titles is too heavy and difficult to run without upscaling.","xess is not universally supported and the few games it is supported, it is not as good.","if you are playing at 1080p and if you donâ€™t care about ray tracing, i think itâ€™s a no brainer",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and by the reviews , intel and itâ€™s graphic team are making giant strides and they need to be commended for this.","had the op not said he was doing his first build, i wouldâ€™ve put more emphasis on helping to get a viable third player on the market.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think they will be in a place many people are gonna have a hard time believing by battlemage.,"if they make progress the same way they have in the next 6 months they are gonna be in a pretty wild place, especially with amd and nvidias fuckery as they seemingly add on to the ampere and rdna2 lineup with their new stuff.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

depends if you're competing on single thread or multi thread.,"~~single thread performance of the 7700k should be slightly faster than the 3600.~~.. but you'll get your ass beat with multithread

edit: single thread is within margin of error, actually",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"considering the ryzen lineup was supposed to beat intel in multicore, in which the early gens did successfully considering intel's laziness in those gens, you have no hope, only single core you can beat him, not multicore.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if all you want is to go for speed then ovetclock the shit out of this 7700k, change the cpu governor to p-state performance and disable all cpu mitigations.","one of those performance-oriented kernels (liquorix, xanmod, etc) can also help depending on what you'll be running.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"what are you competing in, single core or multi core?","if your 7700k and motherboard supports overclocking, that is your only chance, you'll need it to come out significantly ahead on single core perf.","i guess it depends on how far you are willing to go through with this, if you want to go all the way, delid that sucker and replace intels shitty thermal interface below the ihs (i think it was 9th gen that moved to solder) with liquid metal like thermal grizzly conductonaut.","that will help out enormously with thermal headroom and might get you to 5ghz oc if you got decent silicon, or are willing to go ham on voltage, so that will put you ahead in single core and probably better overall fps in games.","if you all are competing in multi core performance/benchmarks, you might as well just surrender now oc won't help you enough here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"keep up in what respect, single threaded or multithreaded?",either way i wouldn't hold out any hope since this particular amd cpu could keep pace with intels 9th gen i7 back in the day in both single and multithreaded benchmarks.,"you'd have to put in a lot of effort to get close, it's probably not worth the effort.",might even be easier to look if you can get your hands on something more recent like the 9th or 10th gen from intel which did compete against that particular amd cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there's no chance of a 7700k overtaking a ryzen 3600.

the only quad cores i can think of that would rival a 3600 or even beat it in some benchmarks would be the 12th and 13th gen i3 12100 and 13100, though that would require an intel 600 or 700 series motherboard and neither of those i3s are overclockable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a well tweaked 3600 will murder a well tweaked 7700k.,even more in linux since it doesn't has a good cpu scheduler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have an i7-7700k, you will lose to your friend by almost 50% in multithread, while you may win in games benchmarks, it is not a realistic representation of those cpu's power",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"his only chance in single thread is to oc the 7700k, if you delid and replace the shitty tim with liquid metal coupled with a massive air cooler, might be able to get a 5ghz oc and that will put the 7700k ahead of 3600 in single core.","if it's multi core they are competiting in, op might as well just surrender now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 7700k does have better single threaded performance, particularly in games if thatâ€™s what op will use for benchmarking",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

did you actually verify that you have cpus with different steppings?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's because the vccsa is locked, without being able to increase this voltage, past ~3200 mhz becomes questionable for ddr4 without dropping to gear 2, same thing happened last year with the locked 12th gen cpus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
even on alder lake c0/h0 there were some locked cpus that could do 3600mhz in gear 1 and others couldnt.,it's just silicon lottery,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i can verify now only recent pc number two and i will do it today.,i don't have pc number one already and i can't check it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was given answer from producer of ram (goodram company technical support department) that changing only gear from default 2 to 1 should not request changing/increasing ram voltage.,its not needed - which is logic because you change only processor's controller frequency.,voltage can be a factor if we want change ram frequency or timings and sometimes we have to adjust processor voltage for ram.... but gears have nothing to do with voltage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how to be sure - how to check it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you've answered your own question.,"changing gear changes the memory controller frequency, and the memory controller may not be able to run at a higher frequency without increased voltage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"take note of vcore or cpu voltage (not ""vid"") in hwinfo.",it depends on your individual cpu but mine can go as low as 1.23v peak in cb r23 without crashing and still get stock performance (30k score).,"then in bios, look for these options:

* ac loadline: higher value = higher vcore.",i use 35.,* dc loadline: ~~higher value = lower vcore.,"i use 100.~~
    * edit: leave as default, or if you need accurate power reporting and to prevent cpu from falsely reaching pl1/2 and throttling (over-reported power) or passing it and exceeding power limits (under-reported power), adjust dc loadline until vid equals vcore.","dc loadline impedance needs to match cpu loadline calibration mode, but no mobo i know of actually tells you the impedance of each mode.",* cpu loadline calibration mode: try highest level/mode or powersaving mode.,"different bioses phrase it differently, but pick the one that sounds like least voltage would be added.","test ""auto"" too in case it actually gives least voltage.","* cpu core voltage (not vrm): if this can be changed, try a negative offset of 50mv for starter.",take note of vcore under load again after changing these.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you are in the return window then send it back and get the ls520.,this is the only 240mm aio that can handle this chip without power limits enforced.,i have it and can say it absolutely lives up to that hype.,my 13700kf never goes above 90 even when overclocked and no power limits.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"bios, advanced cpu voltage settings, find internal ac/dc loadline, vcore loadline calibration, and vcore current protection settings.",you can actually leave them at auto.,"under those settings, should be one called ""internal vr control"" you should enable ia vr control, and then you can change ac/dc values.","on the side, it should say what default values are.",you need to lower ac and dc values.,"in my case with 13600k, ac dc was 90/110.","i lowered mine to 45/65 and i have no performance loss, but like 20c less temperature.",ac is responsible for actual boost voltages.,dc is only responsible for  what is reported to system as voltages and power consumption.,"meaning with ac you actually regulate voltage, but dc doesnt impact it anyway.",you only need to find correct dc value so you have correct power measurements in the system.,"its kind hard to explain, but you should get the idea after playing with it.","second option, is to ignore everything i said, and go easy route.","just change internal ac/dc loadline to power saving, and that should already give you less temps without loosing performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
will try ac / dc loadline and cpu loadline calibration settings when i get back home but i remember the core voltage is hitting up to 1.4v under full load.,"cpu core voltage was changeable but it was only positive offset i believe it is related to undervolt protection, even though undervolt protection setting was disabled in mobo, i wasn't able to use it on xtu or throttlestop.",my main goal is disabling undervolt protection so i can find stable  voltages.,thanks for the response :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you are mainly right except for dc loadline, it doesnt impact actual voltage.",it only impacts what is being reported.,"you have to find dc loadline value, that gives same core and vid voltages under load, meaning its the correct value.","changing dc will not impact performance, voltage, or heat.",you only need to find correct value to make system report correct voltages and power use.,ac loadline does all the voltage regulation under load.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i've been researching how to undervolt my 13600k on my gigabyte b760 board and i'm running into some performance problems.,it seems like the score of my 13600k in cinebench scores proportionally to the ac value that i set in the bios so any amount of underclocking that i do lowers performance respectively.,"for example if i run 45/65 my scores drops from 22500 to 20100.

running the default power saving profile is even worse lowering scores to 17500.

any suggestions?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"agreed, higher dc ll would give lower vid which doesn't actually translate to lower vcore.","just curious, if left at auto, does your mobo automatically match dc ll to the cpu llc mode's impedance?","on mine, i had to bump it up to 100 from the default/auto of 80 to get vid=vcore.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

nothing really to suggest.,"use 50/65, your cpu/motherboard combo doesnt work at 100% with lesser value",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

oh shit that's totally new information for me... maybe after a year or so i can consider changing the mobo to z790 /w ddr5 configuration.,i wish i was aware of that while i was doing the purchase.,i believe it will still does the job for at least a year for me :d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"interesting, thanks for sharing!","i use an msi mobo which has those ""cpu lite load"" modes people have recommended to change.",they're also just ac/dc ll presets.,"out of box, stock bios would use the 110/110 preset which was yikes because i didn't expect high stock vcore.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so i want to summarize what i get from all of the convo please correct me if i am wrong ac is responsible for the boost voltages of the cpu, so if i reduce ac loadline it will reduce the voltage that is pumped to the cpu on the boost which is a different under volting method than setting offset but it does the work.","( i think it changes the resistance )

after getting satisfied with ac i should be finding the proper value for dc loadline for actual reported voltage and power consumption, the reason why we need to find proper dc loadline value is to prevent cpu hitting power or voltage limits on the boost even though it is not receiving that voltage.","finally, to be able to find the proper value for dc i need to do trial error and try to match vid = vcore.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"110/110 is max value recommended by intel, gigabyte uses this value on ""extreme"" preset.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, about right.",at start you can just leave dc alone.,"vid=vcore only on full load like cinebench r23, on idle vcore should always be dynamic and usually lower than vid.","as i said, on gigabyte you can just select preconfigured setting called ""power saving"", and then go to ia vr setting, and you can see what motherboard selected as ac/dc values.",that should be a good starting point.,"run cinebench r23, see if scores and temps are good.","if score is good, you can try lowering ac by 5 or so.",find lowest ac value which still gives full performance.,"we are doing this instead of usual negative offset vcore method, because on b660 and b760 boards usual undervolt doesnt really work well.",there is undervoltage (cep) protection that doesnt really allow cpu to run lower voltages.,"settings either get ignored, or, you get clock stretching and benchmark results tanking to 40-80%.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

well first ask yourself what are you using your pc for.,if your going to be rendering a lot and using all core workloads a lot then it is a little on the high side but should be fine.,these cpus can take a lot more voltage than what people are used to.,however its actually super weird that your crashing at higher llc.,if you are using this for strictly gaming then yes should be fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

intel uses its ring/mesh bus system for single die internal communication.,the exact implementation of this bus varies between processor architectures.,intel qpi (a successor to the front side bus) is obsolete for single socket cpus because the northbridge it was designed to connect to the cpu cores was directly integrated into the cpu die.,qpi was also superseded by [upi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intel_ultra_path_interconnect) for multi-socket systems to communicate between separate socket cpus.,the proprietary dmi link is what they use to communicate with the pch.,these lanes are exclusive for this purpose and do not get reallocated like the pcie lanes.,"intel's current implementation for communication between separate dies on the same package is called embedded multi-die interconnect bridge (emib), with a further development development into 3d die stacking called foveros.",more information on these technologies can be found [here](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16823/intel-accelerated-offensive-process-roadmap-updates-to-10nm-7nm-4nm-3nm-20a-18a-packaging-foundry-emib-foveros/4).,"emib has already been in use with some laptop chips that used a separate igpu die (which were amd gpus no less), and foveros will be prominently featured with meteor lake which will use several heterogeneous chiplets on the same package.",amd's inter-die interconnect technology is called [infinity fabric](https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/amd/infinity_fabric).,amd uses this to communicate between the multi-die chiplets.,"not only is the io and igpu on a separate die, but cpu cores can also be in clusters on separate dies (the 7950x for example has two dies of 8 cores each as well as the io/igpu die) necessitating if to communicate between them.","all of these are proprietary technologies not (directly) related to pcie, which is a standardized protocol used for communication with external devices.","neither intel nor amd use pcie to connect on-package igpus, and use of an igpu has no affect on processor pcie connectivity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had a similar issue and needed to rma my nuc to resolve it.,intel made the process very easy and it was as simple as swapping the ram and ssd to get the new machine online.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fixed it by connecting it to a 1 gigabit ethernet router and the attached cable was detected.,it did not like a 100 mbit connection.,first device in 6 years that had problems with this router/100mbit for me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very hard to see what it is exactly but i think it might be dust or something,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hard to tell from your pics it's a bit blurry...   could be dust or something else in the socket.,if it's one or more bent pins that can definitely cause a problem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if it's been since you bought it.,maybe consider contacting seller for replacement,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
certainly something there is missing or bent.,"i got a aorus pro z690 and post was irregular, bsods and such and some pins were missing.",exchanged it for a z790 aorus master and voila...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
were those pins bent when you got that motherboard ?,or did you bend them yourself by mistake ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'd try a different brand of motherboard.,it's a hassle but then you know if it's the chip or not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that's because all those horror stories are about the thermal grizzly frame.,"it doesn't make contact with the board, whereas thermalright does.","so once you mount it via the usual diagonal method, the screws will firmly hit resistance as you tighten them, and that's it.",this was my first cpu installation and it felt easy.,the fact that people still promote a 10x more expensive version that carries all this risk is genuinely perplexing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the thermal right one is very dummy proof.,"remove the existing retention bracket (four hex screws, use the allen key that comes with the contact frame), put the thermalright bracket one over the holes, put the screws back in and tighten in a cross pattern.","no risk of over tightening or unequal pressure with the thermalright one (well, there probably is, but it's obvious when you can stop tightening).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the issue is that these cpus have an elongated shape and the pressure applied right in the middle of the longer side causing bending, so no, it isn't mobo specific.","sure, many work without issues, but honestly the thermalright via aliexpress is so dirt cheap that it is a no brainer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ok, here we go down this road again.",op you're setting yourself up for a temporary ban if you keep this up.,here is a basic physics lesson: you can not get below ambient with an air or water cooler as they are unable to get below thermal equilibrium.,it is physically impossible as it breaks the second law of thermodynamics.,only way to do it is with a thermoelectric heat pump also known as a peltier cooler or run the ac in your house to provide cooler air.,i do not know where this unhealthy obsession with 25c came from.,"as others have mentioned, idle temps don't really matter and if they did yours are totally fine as is.",if you are still struggling with that then my suggestion is to seek professional mental health as no one here is qualified to provide as such.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thereâ€™s no point in worrying about idle temps.,if itâ€™s within 10-15* c of your ambient temperature itâ€™s fine.,youâ€™ve posted about this multiple times and everybody says the same thing.,take a chill pill.,"edit: in all seriousness, set your room temperature to like 16-17* c, run your aio pump at 100% and bump up your fan speeds.",thatâ€™s the only way itâ€™s going to happen.,"if your os has nothing running, your cpu is using less than ~25 watts.",those photos could have been taken when the pc was literally in sleep mode for all you know.,youâ€™re obsessing over nothing.,touch grass.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"changing to 13900ks won't make your idle temp any better, you'll just pay the premium for nothing at all.","don't be too obsessed about idle temp, my 13700k literally sits around  35c at idle and i wouldn't even bat an eye to that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
last time i checked cpu doesn't start throttling until like 85-90c?,why even care?,your cpu lifespan isn't going to be effected by running at this low of a temp.,"you'd have to push a constant of like 100c daily but i honestly doubt even that would do anything

"look, first of all a 280mm aio isn't quite good enough for a chip as power hungry as the 13900k/13900ks.","second, depending on your ambient temperature, 30c is a very reasonable idle temperature.",my 13900ks is around 30-33c idle and can kit 40k in cinebench r23 (i run an x73 kraken).,expecting an idle temperature of 24c with your setup is insanity (unless perhaps your ambient temperature is stupidly low and you run your fans/aio full blast).,"edit: by the way, do you realize that the cpu temperature will always exceed your ambient temperature, and usually by a good \~5-10c or more?",the aio liquid temperature will never be lower than your ambient temperature.,this is just basic physics.,i mention this because you talked about a 19c temperature.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

cpu coolers donâ€™t â€œgenerate coldnessâ€.,itâ€™s taking the heat from the cpu and pushing it out via heat exchanger and radiator.,the fluid that flows through the radiator transfers the heat to your atmosphere in your house.,the house air temps are the temps itâ€™s going to try equalize with.,the only way to continue to bring down your cpu temperature is to lower your house temperature.,"that aside, i have a 13900k and your temps are all slightly lower than mine, and iâ€™m having zero issues.",i donâ€™t think there is any defect in your cpu.,"itâ€™s just a beast, takes a lot of electricity, and therefore generates a lot of heat.",i would not be worried if i was you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

having only 2 cores isn't an issue for new intel-based laptops anymore since all of intel's current 12gen and 13th gen mobile chips have several e-cores to boost the thread count along with the large p-cores.,even current mobile alder lake pentiums and celerons have 4 e-cores along with 1 large p-core even though their desktop equivalents only have 2 large cores like previous generation chips.,intel's also going to release alder lake-n for cheap laptops that will only have 4 e-cores minimum with some chips having 8 e-cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah with e cores existing if there is enough defective chips it makes sense to replace them as celeron/pentiums,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hi there.,sorry for the late reply.,so when it comes to trying to get 13900k temps under control i find that it the little changes done that add to a big drop in temps rather than one setting that will drop it a lot.,so with this in mind let's get started.,so these tips are based on an asus motherboard as that's all i use.,i am not familiar with other board manufacturers on what they call it settings so you will have to cross reference it with on the internet to make sure you get the right bios setting.,so i use a contact frame.,the temps drop is minimal but in the large scheme of things it will add up.,i am not saying you need it far from it but it varies from user to user or more specifically motherboard to motherboard.,it only costs like $10 from amazon and i got the thermal right version.,so if you boot into bios you want to disable mce or multi core enhancement.,then you want to enforce all motherboard limits.,you can set the power limits for pl1 and pl2 whihc i do believe is 253w.,so you could have pl1 at 90w or 120w and pl2 at 253w this is down to your usecase.,then locate voltage control and use an offset.,so the idea here is that you start at relatively low figure test for stability and then increasing it as far as the chip will allow.,this varies from chip to chip.,so you start off at -0.050v run cb23 or whatever and see if it stable then increase to -0.055v and so on.,there will be a point where  your cpu will not like it so you back it up one or two steps.,"next we need to locate load line calibration on asus boards it will be defaulted to llc 3 we need to set this to llc 4.

then if we go into internal power management and locate two settings.",one is called ia ac loadline and the other is called ia dc loadline.,set ac loadline to 0.20v and the dc laodline to 0.80v.,now these figures again can be tweaked but it case of you lowering the settings and see when the cpu spits it out.,this takes time and ngl downright pure pita.,now locate the system agent voltage setting.,because most manufacturer motherboards put excessive voltage though every setting we can work on this as well.,what you are looking for is a base voltage of 1.25v so if it higher then set it accordingly or use a negative offset to get it down to that.,that your is starting baseline.,i think i now run mine on 1.2v but you would have to test on yours.,also make sure you have the 2xeps 12v plugged in if your mb supports it.,this works on 12th gen and 13th gen. i would also suggest doing each of the steps one by one rather than in one large go as it if it trips it up you won;t know whihc setting caused it.,hopefully the end result will be a lower temp when under load.,now you cb23 scores are gonna take a hit but you should have better temps at idle and load and very little drop in overall performance unless you were benchmarking where a score was returned.,in gaming or productivity you not gonna lose much if at all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
asus rog ryuo iii 360,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
will do.,just using the asus and nzxt software to measure the package temps.,armoury crate does show individual p and e core temps.,iâ€™ll check that out next time and report back,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"p core 2 is a bit hotter than the rest, average is 40c and max was 52c while gaming for an hour and a half.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"worst case scenario (which isn't even that rare lol) is cpu overheating and constantly throttling under mediocre load on a capable, big cooler.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hoooly.,thank you for the detailed response.,i'm reading up on what you said bit by bit and so far the biggest offender might be multicore enhancement which is called msi enhanced turbo for msi boards.,"i'll definitely make sure to turn that off if it's enabled, which i think it might be because i let the board do auto oc or whatever it's called.",what type of instability should i look for when testing the different voltages?,like screen flicker or something like that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's more like it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s usually a problem with motherboard defaults setting the voltage way too high.,youâ€™d need to fix that by adjusting the load line calibration.,"if you get constant throttling and overheating from a mediocre load, the contact frame probably isnâ€™t going to save you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so basically you know when the voltage is not liked when it will just crah and stopped working.,if it really hates the voltage your whole pc will freeze.,ngl i did build a 12600k setup for a friend with a msi board z690.,other than that there is only one ever time i can recall using a msi board and that was back in the 6700k days.,so i am not that familar with them.,i have used quite a few giga boards but predominanlt since the very beginning it has been mostly asus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea this right here.,an aftermarket frame is the least of your problems if you're getting throttling on a mediocre load.,man tech subs are filled with some garbo advice & takes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i ended up just doing three things in the end, but it made a pretty drastic difference.","i disabled multicore enhancement, changed the cooling method in bios from water cooler to air cooler (water cooler was pl1 same as the air cooler, but for whatever reason it said something like 4000w or some crazy shit might be a typo idk), and i also set the voltage to 1.35 from the default of 1.45.

my temps are running at a cool \~50-60c under load where before i was hitting high 80s and sometimes 90+.","[https://i.imgur.com/og4ar7l.png](https://i.imgur.com/og4ar7l.png)

i would thoroughly appreciate it if you were to try the contact frame and post results here!!!!!!!!!!!,"genuinely i'm still yet to order parts because i am a bit skeptical that i haven't seen anyone with a nhd-15 chromax black cooler and post their results yet, if i do pull the trigger on it i will most likely try both the contact frame and without and update my original post with the findings as i am a very skeptical person but here i sit with money able to pull the trigger just not having the will power to do so at this time and a gf waiting on my current build just as a getting started pc... i was going to upgrade both my 1070 and my i5-4440 cpu because weeellll.... it's needed!!!!!!!!!!","i bought elden ring day 1 because i was excited for it and assumed that at worst it would run about like dark souls 2 did before i got my 1070 when i had a 760, but no it's far worse... i walk out of the starting area and i have below 1\`0 fps and with a 1070 at the clocks that i have it as i should minimum be getting 30\~ish fps.... feels bad man... and i'm fairly big into diablo(hate me for it elsewhere) and when i was in the private beta for diablo iv the options menu had rt features that weren't enabled at that point so i would very much like to be able to make d4 playable with rt settings turned on, meanwhile as of right now i was running the beta at sub 45 fps at all low settings, so for me at the very least i would say my component choices that i made all that time ago + a gpu upgrade have given me more than enough playtime out of them and it's time for a new start to playing things\`!!!",also forspoken!!!,it just looks extraordinary in my opinion!!!,"so being able to play these games would be very very very nice it's going to be nice to have a decent pc again, that modern games do not cripple more than i already am #wheelchairs aren't comfortable!!!!",i'm actually disabled buuut who cares about the difference.,they see the wheelchair and say i'm a cripple :\\ oh well!!!,also than you very much u/goredwings4lyf3 for your own input on the matter!!!!,i will take that knowledge into consideration in terms of under-volting for better performance especially if i am seeing higher temperatures than i am personally comfortable with!!,!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hi there,

first off i have done 12th gen and 13th builds using aio's and air coolers and used contact frames in all the builds regardless as for $10/â£10 whether it dropped it 1c or 5c it more for the peace of mind and i had one 12th gen build that couldn;t see more than one stick of ram and would not boot with more than one.",using the contact frame well here i am typing my reply out to you as the motherboard retention bent the cpu so the pins weren;t making good contact with the cpu so it only saw one ram stick.,so lets get down to it.,i currently have 2x12th gen setups and 1x13th gen setup.,all 3 have contact frames.,so if i start at the 13th gen setup as that produces the most amount of heat.,so when i first got it like a lot of people found that it was hitting 100c very fast.,i didn;t know how to control it.,so i came to reddit and cross reference with other articles on the matter.,there was a whole host of tips and tricks to bring the temps more manageable.,one of the methods describes was a contact frame.,so i ordered one off amazon and i was sceptical.,i use a 13900k so when i first stuck the contact frame it only dropped the temps ever so slighly.,like 1-2c idle and around 3-5 c on full load.,ngl i was kinda disappointed i had built up some fantasy sceanario where it was gonna drop temps by like 15c but in reality for me it was only very very slight.,but i do also know it varies from cpu to cpu and more specifically the mother retention system.,now some people claim way higher temps drops while others claim made no difference so it difficult to guage what is right and what is hearsay.,bit for the sake of $10 i didn;t really care.,there does seem to be a temp drop but it's all the other tweaks and stuff which drops the temps from 100c to like more manageable 80's not ideal for me but it a starting point.,"so my 13900k is like 83c full load in cb23, 12900k is 81c and the 12700k (thermal right air cooler) is something silly like 76-78c.",so by itself the contact frame plays a small part in a larger picture in controlling temps,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the main thing i don't want is to be one of the unlucky very few that without said contact frame the cooler isn't even making contact... thats what i'm afraid of, booting into windows loading cpu-z and seeing like 104 or something insane it's just a stupid baked in fear that i need to get over and go ahead and build it... i was going to get a thermal grizzly!",because last time i heard you could only get thermal rights on alibaba or some other chinese website,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
okay let me answer a few things to address your concerns.,of all the people i have conversed with who had a contact frame (which is quite a lot) there was only one other person besides myself that had bad contact issue.,most of them had high temps due to bad contact with the cooler.,i had the issue where the pins werenâ€™t making proper contact with the cpu.,so rest assured it is only in extreme cases and a very very small percentile.,i got a thermal right from amazon.,if go onto amazing and type in thermal right contact frame it will show.,get that one and not the thermal grizzly.,they both do the same job one is $10 and one is $50-60.,like i said before how much a contact frame will help or not help varies.,"and letâ€™s just say whether you are gonna drop 1k or 5k on a new setup, is $10 contact frame gonna hurt the setup?",not in the slightest.,even if it doesnâ€™t help with temps you can rest assured your cooler will be making good contact.,i leave this up to you.,"your money, your choice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"for clarity: i was under the impression that even people who are interested in the category, view the 1370p as unimpressive.","&nbsp;

for example, the lg gram- which went:
8565u > 1065g7 > 1165g7 > 1260p > 1370p
(so, i am trying to form the question with just this context in mind, and ignore comparisons outside of that line.","but i guess it may not be apples-to-apples with the u/p changes)

&nbsp;

i'm not really an expert on the history of ultrabooks.","but my understanding, was that these listed cpus were just about all a consumer had to choose from (if they wanted thin+light+<$1,500).","so, i'd assume that something like a core increase, and benchmark improvement, would be applauded.","i'm trying to understand why the paper specs may not translate to the real world (or maybe they do, and my premise is wrong).",i'm also uninformed about how/why the change in ram to lpddr5x (or w/e) effects irl performance.,i know almost nothing about apple products.,"i see they have 1 16"" laptop at $2,600.","i know (some) of the grams have 80wh batteries, which afaik is about as big as it gets in laptops(?).","i don't really understand laptop market share (i guess it goes: hp, dell, apple, acer, lenovo, samsung.",i have no idea if/how many of those are chromebooks).,"apple's m2 cpu gets @ 22,000-26,500 on cpubenchmark, which is on par with the 1370p.","(again, maybe benchmarks don't translate to real world, or whatever, idk.","i assumed ""normal"" adults who wanted a fairly nice (fullsize) laptop, would buy something thin+light + affordable (like a u, g7, or p processor).","i thought the other option was like hx models, for gaming laptops.","or, whatever ""junk"" gets put into chromebooks.","i'm not familiar with the market- it just seems like an lg gram is a good standard of price:power:portability (still a bit pricey for what it is, but maybe more tolerable when on sale)

i thought that ""budget"" $5-700 laptops, may still not be enough for everyday use?","i'm pretty sure i've seen reviews saying they had problems with zoom/video calls, on a 1260p.",(and apparently the xe is a decent upgrade from the older uhd/allows for very basic modern gaming).,"maybe that comes from the overheating/throttling problem- that seems like a big issue with ms surface products, and other tablet/hybrid stuff

the i7-1255u, 1265u, 1250u, 1260u, get @13-14,000 on cpubenchmark.","i'm not sure if the gap to the 1260p (at 17,000) is significant.","it seems like 20-25% is a definite jump, to me, on paper.","(and the u's are apparently 2 performace cores, with 8 efficient).","unfortunately it's hard for me to understand what makes a difference irl, other than believing these numbers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"intel publishes ""base clock"" speeds, which as far as i can tell are a pretty useless metric for judging performance.",there's two different metrics you'll care about here - singlethreaded and multithreaded performance.,"singlethreaded performance is determined by how high of a clockspeed an individual core can boost to, and how many instructions it can execute per clock cycle.",the 1235u can boost higher and execute more instructions per cycle than the 1135g7.,"multithreaded performance is more complicated, but in general more cores and a higher power budget leads to more multithreaded performance.","the 1235u has more cores, but is only ""intended"" to use 15 watts, while the 1135g7 is ""intended"" to use 28 watts.","the 1235u at 15 watts gets about the same multithreaded performance as the 1135g7 at 28 watts, but most importantly:

the amount of power available to a laptop cpu depends on the actual laptop.",just because intel says a processor is meant to have 28 watts available to it doesn't mean it will - it could be higher or lower.,check reviews for the specific laptops you're interested in if multithreaded performance is important to you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

do keep in mind that it's not as simple as comparing cores and frequencies since they are different generations of cpus.,"two examples:

1. one of the biggest differences between intel 11th and 12th gen parts are the move from only ""big"" cores to a mix of ""big"" and ""little"" cores

2. there is usually an ipc increase every new generation, which translates to more work being done for the same frequency (which is one of the reasons for not strait comparing frequencies cross generation)

looking at benchmarks for the work you want to do on both cpus is the best way to compare.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thatâ€™s exactly what he said, the 11th gen will get better performance from the integrated graphics.",one is capped at a lower tdp while the other at a higher.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'm running 4x16gb (2 identical kits of 2x16gb) of corsair dominator rgb ddr5-6200c36 (using hynix chips) on a rog maximus z790 hero motherboard.,my 4 sticks are running at xmp (6200mt/s at 1.3v) with both 0703 launch bios and the latest 0813 bios without any issue.,the raptor lake imc seems to handle 4 sticks at that speed and memory size pretty easily.,i haven't manually overclocked my ram beyond 6200mt/s yet.,i have no experience with 2x32gb kits.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what motherboard do you have?,check their qvl for what 2x32 ram sticks are compatible.,"the fastest 2x32 kit that is available right now that i am aware of is from gskill:  [https://www.gskill.com/product/165/374/1665644504/f5-6400j3239g32gx2-tz5rk](https://www.gskill.com/product/165/374/1665644504/f5-6400j3239g32gx2-tz5rk)

one final thing.",it appears that ram speed doesn't seem to have a major impact on overall frame rates.,this youtube video shows the difference between 8000 and 6000 ram.,"looks like, on average, 5 to maybe 10 fps.",and that is running on a 4090 at 4k and a 13900k.,[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq0-d4oudg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq0-d4oudg),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2 sticks (2x32) much easier on memory controller for overclocking,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the short explanation is:

1. changing the memory speed will impact the fps.","by a bit for each 100mhz which5os explained here https://youtu.be/rq1hiowenim

2. enabling xmp on 4 slots is hell.",i have 128gb divided into 4x 32gb.,i mention that in the channel but xmp runs perfect with 2x.,3. the list of confirmed ddr5 for xmp only guarantees that those memories tested will work with xmp but does not say anything about others not yet tested.,"my trident z5 does not show on the list but i can get it to 6000mhz if i use 2 rams instead of 4. if i use 4 rams, the  point between stability and performance is between 400mhz to 600mhz less of what is advertised.","4. to answer your question, get the 2 sticks of ram, not the 4 ones.",i have been testing the z790 hero with a 4090 and 13900k for 3 months and wayyy too many tests and benchmarks.,watch the channel for other tips and if you have any questions let me know.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would really get the asus apex.,it will give you the best shot of getting 2x32 working at a high speed.,"however, if you want 128 gb total, you will need a 4 slot board like the hero.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i can only go by past experience with ddr4.,generally if you can get 4 sticks to run at same speed as 2 sticke there is an increase in performance due to the ability to have more pages of memory open.,this usually yields one memory speed grade faster at same actual clock speed.,often however getting 4 sticks to run at high speeds is more difficult as the memory controller loading can become overwhelming & indeed there is maximum speeds for a given number of memory sticks & even number of ranks per stick of memory at super high speeds.,also 4 sticks of ram are harder to cool as they tend to be very close to each other.,6000 ddr5 i think would be doable though.,"there are many things about ddr5 that are supposed to make them more stable than previous ddr versions so i think 4 sticks would be ok.

i am currently running 64gb ddr4 2400hz ram at 2400 on a z590 chipset motherboard.",due to market segmentation this ram will not run on gear 1 100:100 ratio at any setting other than auto which puts it at 2400mhz but does allow me to push very low latency & as a result performs very well with a few minor tweaks.,i think only core i9 11900k is only one that allows using gear 1 100:100 ratio at speeds other than auto at least on this motherboard.,alder lake & rapter lake doesn't seem to have such limitation on memory.,not even on the b760 motherboards.,it runs fine at gear1 100:100 ratio at speed settings other than auto.,i will be replacing my z590 board with a z790 board & an intel core i5 13600k replacing my core i7 11700k processor.,will report back on reddit once i get these parts in mail.,the cpu is coming from china.,not sure where motherboard is coming from.,darn newegg doesn't tell you before hand.,i should be able to run ddr4 3000 gear 1 100:100 ratio on the new z790 motherboard with the i5 13600k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ok, that makes more sense.","that ""cover"" is part of the retention mechanism.","yeah, the motherboard pins act as tiny springs, which is how they manage to maintain contact with the cpu pads, and will pop the cpu out of the socket if you release the retention mechanism too quickly.","but they wont damage the cpu, and the cpu will not damage the socket pins since it is so light, even if it falls back down onto the pins.",they are under much more force from the retention springs than what could be exerted from the cpu fallind onto them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"... so.. let me get this straight (and im not saying that im ok with them locking down undervolting or anything, this isnt about that)...

there are b660 boards out there that have features you need...

but no z series boards that have those same features?",... whut?,"for the undervolting thing...

if all you're trying to prevent is high temps, you can achieve the same results simply altering the pl1 and pl2 limits.",cut mine all the way down to 140w for both and lost a ***truly staggering*** 400 points on cinebench r23.,"down to 22,900 from 23,400 or so.","and it never even broke 90c (hottest core 88c, most at 84-85) during that test on an nzxt kraken rgb 120mm aio - not exactly a beast of a cooler - in a constrained itx case (phanteks evolv shift).",im sure i could have played with it and gotten it to no performance loss of any kind at 150-155w and still not had it throttle.,"which, considering the tiny cooler, would be a complete win.",real world performance loss was exactly zero.,cpu never breaks 70c even during heavy gaming.,"again, on a 120mm aio in a constrained itx case.","if there is some other special mojo that only undervolting can get you, dunno what to tell you man.",but i find it extremely hard to believe that there is some mystical b660 board that has all these features that you cant find on a z690/790 board.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why are people fixated on undervolting when setting power limits manually is arguably the better alternative?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what about the z6 or z7 doesn't meet your needs?,you can get great z6 boards rather affordably right now so they should be a default consideration if going 12 or 13 gen intel.,"&#x200b;

anyway, there are other people reporting undervolt issues on that b chipset that just use a bios that is from right before the mc update and that seems to have worked for them, if you really are in need of something under/before x690.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"under volting is there to get less power use, not just less maximum heat dissipation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
could you explain why is it better?,"because i dont see a single reason why that would be better, apart from being much easier to apply.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and works just as well (see my other comment).,im more puzzled at the ... intimation that there is some super awesome b660 board that he wants that has features that just cannot be found on a z series board.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

intel isn't amd.,intel configured tdp very closely matches package power draw.,within 1-2 watts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because it allows you to run the cpu with the exact thermal dissipation that you're willing to accept?,"if you have a 13900k, why not set pl1=pl2=253 w and get rid of the motherboard shenanigans while losing no performance and having temperatures under control?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah it's totally not better at all.,they are just protecting daddy intel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm assuming by now you've read the reply.... it's the lack of extra features and the resulting energy savings which makes the b660m-a an attractive board.,"and no, don't try to argue that it's not significant.",a little wattage makes things a lot less comfortable in my living space.,and why are you arguing against your own best interests?,(do you like having fewer features and paying more money?),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,the *maximum* dissipation.,not the average or idle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well thats exactly the point, you do loose performance with simple power limit.","if you are not undervolting, you are running cpu at same v/f curve, which, with lesser power limits, results in lower clocks.","by undervolting, you are actually running same clocks on lower voltages, thus, increasing efficiency.","with simple power limit of 130w for 13600k, i do loose quite some performance.","with undervolt, i actually increase my performance while using 130w instead of 180w default, because cpu runs over 20c cooler.",so it is better.,"you are using less power with same performance, as with power limit, you are using less power with less performance.",im not saying power limit is not useful.,in some cases it is very good.,but undervolt is just better for efficiency.,"if i target same performance as 130w power limit gives, i can actually achieve it with something like 110w or even less using undervolt.","so again, its better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
undervolting is not a given - the offsets you use may not be stable for some other person or work with all kinds of load.,it's essentially a silicon lottery.,"power limits do not have that problem, and provided you are not deviating too far from spec, lowering power limits delivers only marginally worse performance unless your default power limits are too low to begin with.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

- cpu cooler tuning: boxed cooler
- cpu lite mode: mode 2 (default is 9/12)
- enhanced turbo: disabled

i'm looking to get a 13600k.,i currently have a xeon e5-2697v3 which at full load is around 70c.,heat is really a concern especially for summer months where my a/c can run constantly (other issues there but won't address them now).,from the video if i set to mode 5 that should keep me around where i want to be.,do you think my setup will be stable on an air cooled heatsink say the deepcool ak620?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why mode 2 and not mode 1?,was it unstable?,"i disabled half the e-cores, hyperthreading, & enhanced turbo.",cpu lite mode 1 seems to be working for me with prime95.,highest temps i can get are low 80s when stressing only the p-cores (if i stress all cores the temps are lower).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
doesn't disabling enhanced turbo drop the max frequency from 5.1 to 3.5ghz?,seems like a big performance hit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"exact same motherboard and cpu, i fixed my temps by reducing the lite load from (12 default) to 5, its like a -20, -25c difference, i was hitting 99c as soon as i was pressing start on cinebench, crazy stuff, now im sitting at 75-78 with mode 5 with no performance or instability issues, mode 1 indeed is too low",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what stress test are u using,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"open the case,turn on the pc,watch the fans spinning up.",they should be spinning relativelylow and even speed without serious load on the cpu.,then after a few minutes start a benchmark or game or whatever what will load your cpu to 100 celsius degrees.,the fans should not keep the same speed under heavy load like they do in idle state.,"if they do,than something is wrong with the speed control of the fans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i ended up using override mode on the cpu core voltage, and setting that to 1.050 / 1.000v and my temps dropped a lot.","but this does kill some performance, but personally it's still good performance for what i need and i'm happier not dealing with the 80c and above temps",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have a 12th gen so i know these cpu operate and there are plenty of power reviews on the internet for a 13600k.,obviously you have something else wrong in your system as well.,did you update the me firmware for the 13th gen cpu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's for all-core loads.,gaming wattage is around 80w with a 3090ti,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what game?,it can also be affected if your cases air flow is not great.,games like cyber punk or other huge open world games can hit the cpu harder.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'm almost certain the b660-a's vrms/vrm cooling aren't good enough to handle the 13900k with sustained or prolonged all-core workloads using 32 threads.,"hub made a video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3o1ebk_jca&t=918s) comparing b660 mobos showing that even though maximum performance could be attained when using a 12900k with no power limits (it reached 27k in cinebench r23 multicore), the b660-a pro's vrm temperatures exceeded 100c, so with an even more power hungry cpu like the 13900k, vrm throttling causing a reduction in cpu performance is almost a certainty.","https://imgur.com/a/jq2ips3

i think you'll have to move up to a z690 board at the minimum to have good enough vrms that can handle a 13900k.",something like a msi z690-a pro is reasonably priced and can tackle it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 13900k will pull more than 253 watts all by itself.,but on b660 boards they inforce a 253 watt limit.,it is throttling but not that much my guy.,this is normal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
does your board have a setting for the cpu cooling type?,"air, water cooling, etc...  i know that sets the power limits on my z690 edge.",setting it to water cooling maxes out the limits.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it does thermal throttle after each render in cinebench does in the beginning part of the render.,but im 100% sure its not losing performance in various other tests its due to the power issue from what i've gathered mostly and ofcourse due to high temps at a few given times.,but it throttles regardless of temps most of the time :s,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i too upgraded from the 6700k to a 12700k a year ago and at the time had a 3070. i didnâ€˜t do much game testing except for hunt:showdown which seems to be very cpu heavy because i saw a bump from around 75-85fps to 110-125 with the same settings at 3840x1620,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the flagship of the generation preceding alder lake was basically in a statistical dead heat with a 9900ks, which has the same ipc as the 6700k outside of cache size differences.",those last 5 gens were basically perf/watt stagnation with gains coming from core count increases and higher clockspeeds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if my experience with cinebench is anything to go by then this is completely normal, if you want to make sure then use  other benchmark software and in game benchmark, if it gets high temperatures then you might have a problem, also it is important to take note of your idle temps and gaming temps, these are the ones that count, my cpu instantly hits 100c in cinebench but never goes above 80c in any task, thats what counts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how fast it hits 100c that's actually nothing surprising i wonder why no one has mentioned it yet.,you need to watch reviews etc.,all processors this gen boost to insanely high power limits until they hit the temperature amd/intel designed it to be the safe limit.,"for example for amd u probably heard amd cpus reaching and staying at 95c it's an intended behaviour this gen. 

what u should check is how is ur gaming temps.",if they are fine all u need to do is undervolt ur cpu and it will bring temps down by atleast 10c.,my 13700k was hitting 92c after undervolt its reaching at 80c (360mm aio) and i actually gained cinebench scores from undervolting.,what is surprising to me is that ur temps are reaching a little higher for a 13600k.,partially because u don't have an aio so the motherboard has probably configured it to run a little more hot to gain extra performance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had similar problem with my 13600k.,asus prime z790 mb + 13600k + corsair h100i aio and temps were around 95-100 degrees in cinebench r23.,probably would have been more but i stopped benchmark after 2 minutes when it reached 100 degrees.,"i disabled mce, set core voltage to 1,26 in bios and re-applied thermal paste(arctic mx-4) 3 times... now max temp i get is 79ish degrees in cinebench.",i feel quite good now about it.,":)

is there anything else i should change or do differently?",or i just bought not good enough combo?,seems odd that i need to do stuff like that out of the box.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this happened to me.,drop the core voltage to 1.10v.,cinebench at 70c now.,boosts to advertised speeds fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you need to play around the bios a bit.,"do like a -.115 offset, leave mce on (i think its a good gauge of your oc and heat), get that thermalright cpu plate (itll help with -5c).",theres a bunch of different things you can do to get the temps down.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you have an msi mobo by default the [cpu cooler tuning](https://www.msi.com/blog/cpu-cooler-tuning-optimized-power-limit-based-on-cpu-coolers) is probably set to water cooler which enables the cpu to draw a lot more watts (4096w) than it requires and can significantly increase temps because the cpu boosts to whatever thermal limit it can from my understanding, which is around the 100 degrees you're seeing.",changing this to boxed cooler (181w) or tower air cooler (288w) will limit the cpu max pl1/pl2 watt draw and lower temps.,"you can also combine this with the msi cpu lite load (default/auto is 12, intel recommends 9, i'm currently running on 1) to undervolt the cpu which will help lower temps further.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is all you need to do.,leave mce on and limit this to 8/9.,"cheers for that mate, worked a treat.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

im not understanding by it isnt a stressful test.... its literally a stress test designed to stress the cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my case definitely has sufficient air flow.,wait really?,cinebench puts my cpu at 100% usage so i figured that's as much stress as it's gonna get.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wouldn't turning off mce drop my frequency down to the non-boost speed of 3.5ghz?,"maybe i'm mistaken about what mce does, but i thought that was what boosted it beyond to the max 5.1ghz.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah i've heard that.,my main concern really is how fast it spikes up.,like it hits 100c within a few seconds.,has me thinking that i might have installed my cooler poorly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
temps seem to be fine while gaming which was why i wasn't sure if it was even an issue.,"i tried using intel xtu to undervolt, but undervolting has always been extremely confusing to me.",i tried a -100ma undervolt and didn't really see any change in temps or cinebench score.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"well i can't chime in as i installed mine outright with the contact frame, but not once i read from anyone claiming no improvement.","watch the gn video, especially about the superior thermalright one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
try one out.,they are cheap and might have a big impact on your temps.,mine are about 6 degrees lower overall which is significant.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nice, glad i could help!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's normal for this particular cooler when running cinebench and paired with a i5-13600k with power limits removed.,one of us has actually tested this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's a benchmark.,occt or prime 95 are thorough stress tests.,"you want to test for stability and cooler performance, those are the two to use.",cinebench is a very easy test to pass.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"cinebench is a very easy test for the system, very easy to pass.","as i mentioned, if you want to test your systems stability and cooler performance, use occt or prime95.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, turning off mce just ensured the default power limits are in place.",your clock might drop a bit to 4.9 ghz or so during all core loads like benchmarks but in the real world there should be pretty much no impact.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that could have something to do with your fan curve, fans stay at low rpm at the beginning so it gets hot instantly and doesn't crash because fans are now either working effectively or hitting max rpm, maybe try setting them to max rpm before starting the benchmark, see if it still hits 100c instantly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its because there is no power limit on your 13600k so it will use as much watt as possible until it hits tjmax (100 c).,"for my 12700k thats around 220 w. look in hwinfo64 how much your 13600k uses during the stress benchmark, i think it will be similar.",you can alter the pl1 and pl2 power limits with throttlestop to e.g.,"125 w and you will go down from 100 c in cinebench to 70 c but your cores wont run at full clock speed but around 0.5-0.6 ghz lower than max

my 12700k runs cinebench with the aforementioned pl1/pl2 limits enabled at average 3.74 ghz (p: 4.0 ghz, e: 3.2 ghz) instead of the normal average 4.3 ghz (p: 4.7 ghz, e: 3.6 ghz)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">mce

i also have 13600k with a ml360 cooler and am getting similar temps in an a/c room.","as far as gaming though anywhere between 50-70 degrees, cinebench just rapes the cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its a bench mark but also a stress test....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
please do not listen to this guy.,he's chatting nonsense.,"how are you going to call a program that puts the cpu under stress not a stress test, just because you can upload scores for benchmarking purposes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hm that's weird.,"i have an msi motherboard and i disabled ""enhanced turbo"" which people claim is msi's version of mce and it dropped my max frequency to 3.5",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you might want to double check that since base (p-core) frequency should be 3.5, max is 5.1, as per [intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/230493/intel-core-i513600k-processor-24m-cache-up-to-5-10-ghz/specifications.html).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh shit i figured it out, i disabled the wrong thing.",now my frequency is around 4.9 and my score improved but i'm still hitting 100c.,i think i probably just installed my cooler poorly.,first time manually applying thermal paste.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the fact that you get decent temps in gaming but only get terrible temps in cinebench leads me to believe the installation is fine, but the heatsink is getting fully saturated.",how quickly does it reach 100c?,how's your airflow?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"corsair 4000d with plenty of fans, i'd say airflow is excellent.",it does hit 100c very quickly.,literally a few seconds in cinebench.,"temps also spike up really quickly in gaming before the fans even have time to spin up, then they come back down.",that's why i thought maybe a bad installation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so, any update?",seeing the same problem here as described by you.,"edit: for all reading it later like me: had the same problem as described, what helped was selecting a lower cpu lite mode in the bios and checking my cpu cooler setup again, in my case i mounted the middle fan of my darkrock pro facing the wrong direction.",went from 100 c instantly in cinebench to 85 c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

my clock speeds are 5.5ghz p cores and 4.3 e cores.,i undervolted -0.1v offset.,it doesnâ€™t make sense that it would drop performance so bad.,since my clock speeds fully unlocked are the same 5.5 and 4.3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ia cep is enabled.,you need to disable it to avoid clock stretching when undervolting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thank you so much!,this was it!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i can it is working as intended now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have played with gigabyte motherboards a lot.,"for gigabyte, there is no special ""automatic"" undervolting features, and before starting, i have to mention that 12th / 13th gen intel cpus has a feature called cep or undervoltage protection or something like that in the bios.",it can hurt your cpu performance a lot (something like phantom throttling or clock stretching) if you try to undervolting the cpu with these settings on.,"many b660 motherboards do not allow you to turn off cep, though, so your undervolting potential can be limited.",z690 motherboards usually allows you to config that.,"i would suggest you starting with adjusting ac/dc loadline, which is usually located in the vrm settings in the cpu page.",gigabyte motherboard comes with a couple of defaults.,"for z690, the default settings are 110/90, 90/90, 70/90, 50/90 (unit in mohm, the default can vary based on your bios version), but i would suggest you manually feed the numbers into the vrm settings, with ac loadline ""as low as possible"" and dc loadline matching with your load line calibration settings.","it is also possible to use adaptive cpu voltage, but it is not very effective on gigabyte motherboards.","many gigabyte mbs does not offer uncore (ring) voltage offset, so if you are giving a large cpu voltage offset, the core vid will be very low, but the core vid is going to be overridden by the ring vid.","you can see this effect when undervolting with xtu (and it is a good reason of using xtu to try your undervolting profiles, but i doubt if you can lower the ring voltage by a lot.","my 139k can only do -30mv on ring voltage offset, with 1/55 ac/dc loadline, llc at high).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mainboard probably has an online manual on the manufacturers website.,might even have a bios manual.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sure you can.,i can undervolt no problem on my z690 w/ a 12900k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you wont be able to undervolt on b660 board.,"as of now it doesnt work correctly on b660 boards, you loose performance or undervolt doesnt work.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it doesn't work, i tried to find the way out but failed",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
much thanks for the detailed response!,so basically theres no way to undervolt on a b660 motherboard - especially with a 13600kf?,"ive seen a msi z690 motherboard have an option called lite load with different modes, and turning them down reduces the wattage output by a lot, from 250w to 150w while also reducing the temperature (from around 100âº to 70âº).",and all that while not tinkering with the processors frequence.,"but thats all from a youtube video i saw, i cant confirm if thats real or not, but then in that case, would picking an msi z690 board help with that?",all that i want is to get a smaller wattage output and get better cooling on it.,gonna do the same with the gpu aswell.,im pretty sure it should make my electricity bill reduce by a bit.,"heres the yt video i saw, for reference - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mkavitzoly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mkavitzoly)

edit again, after looking at specifically the motherboard they used, that z690 tomahawk is extremely overpriced, or it should be good for what it is in itself, but i dont really think my budget extends that far to double the cost for the motherboard.","i would even try xtu, but i dont know if its good.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so on a b660 there's no way to lower idle wattage/power consumption?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it has both a manual and a bios manual.,none of them include undervolting or any settings about the cpus voltage.,i even saw a video with the bios online.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ill have to get a z690 board then =),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you have a gigabyte z690 board?,"if so, could you please tell me what you used?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh ok, thank",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh no.. on a gigabyte z690?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would say it's some kind of automatically setting the loadline and voltage offset.,"(the default 1.4v voltage is pretty close to the default settings on my motherboard, 90/90 (or probably 110/110) ac/dc loadline.","just change that to 1/50 and llc=high lowers the vcore to 1.23v under maximum load) you can do that manually on a gigabyte board, but it requires some custom settings.","z690 motherboards usually allow you to disable cep, and probably the ""lite load"" setting option is already doing that for you, so you won't lose any performance with a lower voltage.",in contrast you may want to look into the cpu settings in you bios to see if you have that option to disable cep and undervoltage protection.,"i would suggest you playing a 13th gen cpu with a z690 board or z790 board since it allows you to feed a much lower voltage into that, but if you have a b660 board already, it may not worth replacing it.","you can always try lowering the voltage on your motherboard first, and see if it triggers the cep (r23 score will suffer in that case) or cause instability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you can do a small voltage reduction, it won't hurt.","but if the motherboard locks you from turning off cep, then your room is very limited.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, on b660",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i dont have the pc yet myself, im gonna build it next years summer.",ive seen a video of the b660 gaming x bios and it doesnt have lite load sadly.,"also, sorry but i dont understand what you mean by llc and the ac/dc loadline, never really tinkered with such stuff... sorry.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh alr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if possible could you please take a look through this video about the motherboards bios, and see if any undervolting is possible?",thanks again.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfc8bxt9jq&t=268s,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
llc = load line calibration.,"ac / dc loadline are two settings that is usually located in the vrm settings (probably there is an ""advanced settings"" option in that), and is called ac loadline / dc loadline.",they are not very convenient to adjust and may require some background knowledge on how they work.,"if you do not have the motherboard purchased already, i would suggest you to go for a z690 motherboard.","msi z690 motherboards are pretty decent, but you can also play with your cpu voltage on a gigabyte / asus motherboard (but they may require complicated settings).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ill see if my budget will allow it and figure it out.,thanks again.,"i should probably not go into those ac/dc settings youve been saying, as i dont have much knowledge on them, but i will look into it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
should i get a gigabyte z690 gaming x board or an msi pro z690-a board?,the msi board is super basic and doesnt have as much features as the gigabyte but it (hopefully) has the lite load option which should allow me to undervolt...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pro a would be better for you.,"z690 gaming x also does not have the ""auto"" undervolt feature (and gaming x is the one i am using), but it has slightly better vrm and better sound card.",both should be sufficient to power on a lightly overclocked 13600kf though so vrm is not a huge issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i really couldn't care about any auto undervolt feature, some way or another i am going to find out the perfect undervolt for it, but i'm looking into the gaming x as it has more fan ports, way more features, is better looking and so on, that's why i'm trying to go into gigabyte boards.","btw, since you have same board, could you confirm that it has undervolting stuff in the bios?",thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, if you can do it manually.","it offers adjustments to ac/dc loadline and loadline calibration, as i have said before.","it also have core voltage offset, but does not have cache voltage offset (you can do that in xtu, but you won't have much headroom to lower that voltage).","i can bring my 13900k down to about 1.2v under full load on that motherboard, while not losing any performance and cause any unstability.","if you can deal with that bios, z690 gaming x a perfectly good motherboard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if it gets same results as undervolting on every other bios then i think it should be ok for me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"since b760 was released so recently, i believe even the oldest available bios will have new intel microcode.",i dont think you gonna be able to undervolt apart from adjusting ac/dc loadline.,"but cant be 100% sure, its only my speculation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can still underclock if you're worried about peak power consumption.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"late reply and likely still not suitable for the same microcode reasons, but gigabyte's [b760m-ds3h ax ddr4](https://www.newegg.com/p/n82e16813145425?item=n82e16813145425) also has dual displayport outputs, as does asus' delightfully barebone [b760m-ct-csm](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1742990-reg/asus_pro_b760m_ct_csm_lga_1700.html) (corporate stable model).","the latter is ddr5, but with prices [having come down](https://sp-siliconpower.com/collections/for-desktop-1/products/silicon-power-zenith-gaming-ddr5-5600mhz-pc5-44800-32gb16gbx2-dual-pack-1-25v-desktop-unbuffered-dimm) significantly (and ddr5 running at a lower 1.1v), it may still be appropriate.",vrm stages for both boards are fairly weak.,you'd want to limit your cpu to \~125w or use a lower core count sku.,"i can't personally vouch for either of these boards, but figured they were worth mentioning due to your specific dual displayport requirement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i want low idle.,i shouldn't have to pay extra.,i'm running on 12 years with my 4670k.,"they can say ""undervolt protection"" aka ""ia cep"" is to prevent some vulnerability - we all know that's bullshit and they just want to push us to buy overpriced z series boards.",fucking ridiculous that i can't run a low heat/power system without paying extra (they clock everything way too damn high by default!),", but as of yet i haven't found any good z series matx boards that meet my needs either.",i wish gn would to a piece on this issue.,there should actually be some kind of laws preventing this kind of software lock on hardware that we buy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

wouldnt matter if it was air or not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean youâ€™re more likely to see temp spikes while air cooling.,water cooling not as much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
except you arent.,the spikes like this are immediate spikes due to activity.,absolutely nothing about liquid cooling would alter it.,"in both cases, it happens so fast that the coldplate simply cannot carry the heat away that fast, be it liquid cooling or not.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it is not true.,"it will work with windows 10 as good as it does with windows 11. this cpu was even released before windows 11, so it is more plausible to say that it was built for windows 10, but this kind of statement makes no sense, unless you talk about 12th and 13th gen cpus.","in that case they have and hybrid architecture, and the windows 11 scheduler is, for now, the better one at handling them",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no.,that is fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
highest temp i ever had with mine while gaming was 62c.,usually it stays around 53-58c depending on the game.,(i'm playing on 3440x1440p) using a 360mm aio kraken z73.,undervolted the cpu.,make sure to disable multicore enhancement in bios (might be named a bit different in your bios),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no.,that is fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not really.,"the throttle when benchmarking this cpu comes from it getting unlimited power from the mainboard, 330w+, no aio can handle that much.","by disabling multicore enhancement and undervolting it alone i'm sitting at 53-62c while gaming with mine, also using a 360mm aio.",further capping pl1 & pl2 to a value your cooling solution can handle also prevents it from throttling while benchmarking.,i have mine capped at 253w and still getting 40k in c23 for example.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nope.,not true at all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that is far from fine.,"his gaming temps should sit between 45-65c depending on the game, especially @1.27v.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have 13900k and its not normal, do you have one that does 80c while gaming?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ok, maybe i am just exasperated on all of these ""is it wrong"" posts when computers are working on normal temps.",we do not know what game is playing there and it could be heavily multithreading so the temps can rise high.,"if that screenshot describes what it seems to describe, then also on right top we see that he seems to have an ai overclock profile on, which are very poor in optimizations normally so some higher temps can easily happen.","we also do not know from that pic, what gpu he is using, if he has 4090 and the correct game, then he could easily be putting far more load on cpu than with lesser gpu.","but no, you are correct in that normally on most games my computer does not go to 80+ either.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"... so.. let me get this straight (and im not saying that im ok with them locking down undervolting or anything, this isnt about that)...

there are b660 boards out there that have features you need...

why are people fixated on undervolting when setting power limits manually is arguably the better alternative?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what about the z6 or z7 doesn't meet your needs?,you can get great z6 boards rather affordably right now so they should be a default consideration if going 12 or 13 gen intel.,"&#x200b;

anyway, there are other people reporting undervolt issues on that b chipset that just use a bios that is from right before the mc update and that seems to have worked for them, if you really are in need of something under/before x690.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"under volting is there to get less power use, not just less maximum heat dissipation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
could you explain why is it better?,"because i dont see a single reason why that would be better, apart from being much easier to apply.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and works just as well (see my other comment).,im more puzzled at the ... intimation that there is some super awesome b660 board that he wants that has features that just cannot be found on a z series board.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ignoring the fact that stock chips are very poorly tuned to waste power and get less performance than with undervolting.... ok, how much can i lower idle by doing that?",or is there another way to lower idle?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
limiting pl1 and pl2 .. reduces power consumption.,w = vxa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel isn't amd.,intel configured tdp very closely matches package power draw.,within 1-2 watts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because it allows you to run the cpu with the exact thermal dissipation that you're willing to accept?,"if you have a 13900k, why not set pl1=pl2=253 w and get rid of the motherboard shenanigans while losing no performance and having temperatures under control?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah it's totally not better at all.,they are just protecting daddy intel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm assuming by now you've read the reply.... it's the lack of extra features and the resulting energy savings which makes the b660m-a an attractive board.,"and no, don't try to argue that it's not significant.",a little wattage makes things a lot less comfortable in my living space.,and why are you arguing against your own best interests?,(do you like having fewer features and paying more money?),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,the *maximum* dissipation.,not the average or idle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well thats exactly the point, you do loose performance with simple power limit.","if you are not undervolting, you are running cpu at same v/f curve, which, with lesser power limits, results in lower clocks.","by undervolting, you are actually running same clocks on lower voltages, thus, increasing efficiency.","with simple power limit of 130w for 13600k, i do loose quite some performance.","with undervolt, i actually increase my performance while using 130w instead of 180w default, because cpu runs over 20c cooler.",so it is better.,"you are using less power with same performance, as with power limit, you are using less power with less performance.",im not saying power limit is not useful.,in some cases it is very good.,but undervolt is just better for efficiency.,"if i target same performance as 130w power limit gives, i can actually achieve it with something like 110w or even less using undervolt.","so again, its better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
undervolting is not a given - the offsets you use may not be stable for some other person or work with all kinds of load.,it's essentially a silicon lottery.,"power limits do not have that problem, and provided you are not deviating too far from spec, lowering power limits delivers only marginally worse performance unless your default power limits are too low to begin with.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

have you looked at the thermal paste?,prebuilt so you never know if itâ€™s good or bad until you check,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've been seeing where people have been undervolting the 13700k's and 13900k's to help reduce the heat/cooling issue these have.,some people are saying that undervolting by .5 or even .05 has made a difference.,"like someone else here already said, since its a prebuilt it may be worth checking out the thermal paste/aio.",but there is also things like the [thermalright anti-bending buckle](https://www.amazon.com/thermalright-generation-anti-bending-correction-installation/dp/b0b5q34sz1) and the [thermal grizzly contact plate](https://www.amazon.com/thermal-grizzly-intel-contact-frame/dp/b09yyqbxqy) that people have been installing to help bring temps down as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i haven't, mostly because i'm based in europe so i'd rather not mess with the computer too much and just send it back within 14 days.","it was expensive enough that i don't really want to burn money on ""lol, i guess cooling might not work"" 

it feels like if it was a problem with the thermal paste, i wouldn't see a drop from 95â°c to 45â°c instantly after cutting the load though?",in the video i posted the temps literally go from 90â°c to 40â°c in less than a second.,"i was hoping someone here would come out with ""oh yeah it's a bug with firmware x on this"" because it feels like a software issue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so what exactly is the problem you're having?,"what you're describing sounds completely normal, that is how it works.",as soon as the load stops it will instantly cool down.,the thermal probes inside the cpu are very small so once the cpu stops generating a ton of heat it will transfer away very quickly and show the temperature dropping.,also cpu coolers are very good at cooling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whatever your cooler can handle.,any voltage is safe as long as you are not running 300w daily.,"if you are not on custom loop - probably you wanna stay in 1.3-1.4v range, max.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iirc, adaptive voltage doesn't let you exceed 1.52v (even with ac loadline boost) and intel's maximum operating voltage is 1.72v for the entirety of s-lineup at steady state (so idling), which is kinda nuts to try running anyway.","it's still intel's guidance, so according to them, you can go wild.",there's also maximum current of 245/307a for 125w or 320/400a for an unexplained extreme config.,"[https://edc.intel.com/content/www/us/en/design/products/platforms/details/raptor-lake-s/13th-generation-core-processors-datasheet-volume-1-of-2/005/vcccore-dc-specifications/](https://edc.intel.com/content/www/us/en/design/products/platforms/details/raptor-lake-s/13th-generation-core-processors-datasheet-volume-1-of-2/005/vcccore-dc-specifications/)

you use 1.4v and above for highest low load/active core count overclock, so if you don't overclock, you can absolutely undervolt it to heavens above.","there's no real ""this voltage is safe and that isn't"", especially nowadays, when you're going to overheat way before you'll start hitting community accepted ""dangerous"" voltages.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1.3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't think you can reach a dangerous voltage because the cpu will overheat and throttle before that.,anyway if you run prime95 small ffts at stock with removed power limits and check the voltage it should be close enough to what's safe under very heavy loads.,"due to load line calibration what you set in the bios will be higher, depending on how aggressive the llc itself is.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'm almost certain the b660-a's vrms/vrm cooling aren't good enough to handle the 13900k with sustained or prolonged all-core workloads using 32 threads.,"hub made a video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3o1ebk_jca&t=918s) comparing b660 mobos showing that even though maximum performance could be attained when using a 12900k with no power limits (it reached 27k in cinebench r23 multicore), the b660-a pro's vrm temperatures exceeded 100c, so with an even more power hungry cpu like the 13900k, vrm throttling causing a reduction in cpu performance is almost a certainty.","https://imgur.com/a/jq2ips3

i think you'll have to move up to a z690 board at the minimum to have good enough vrms that can handle a 13900k.",something like a msi z690-a pro is reasonably priced and can tackle it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 13900k will pull more than 253 watts all by itself.,but on b660 boards they inforce a 253 watt limit.,it is throttling but not that much my guy.,this is normal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you set pl1/pl2 to 4096?,i think hwinfo shows what those are actually set to also (i'm not in front of my computer right now to verify).,might check that to see if the mobo is actually setting them correctly.,they show up in xtu also.,xtu might be worth trying.,you can set the limits in windows with it.,just as a test.,"fyi, xtu by default will override the bios when windows loads though.",so don't let that screw you up.,there's an option to turn that off.,and the cpu temps stay below 100c during the cinebench run?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it does thermal throttle after each render in cinebench does in the beginning part of the render.,but im 100% sure its not losing performance in various other tests its due to the power issue from what i've gathered mostly and ofcourse due to high temps at a few given times.,but it throttles regardless of temps most of the time :s,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[gamersnexus has a review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbftsej-yis) that's a year old with alder lake comparing win11 vs win10 there was pretty much no difference in gaming but intel recently released thread director 2 exclusively for windows 11 they recommend win11 for raptor lake but there hasn't been a recent review comparing win11 and win10 on raptor lake if it makes a any difference in gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"right now, i still use windows 10 with a 13700k, i had originally bought the cpu so i had an excuse to upgrade to windows 11 and take advantage of the e-cores properly, but it seems like windows 10 can handle them pretty well, i can even set a hotkey in the bios to toggle the e-cores on or off and just use p-cores if needed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
win 10 can differentiate between high power and lower power cores.,any task in focus will always be assigned to p-cores.,other tasks will be assigned to e-cores if all p-cores are busy.,"process priority will override the above, any task set at 'high' will always be assigned to p-cores, any task set below 'normal' will always be e-cores.",tasks set at normal priority usually run on p-cores if available.,"this behavior is good enough for most users, when you game it will be using p-cores first unless the priority is set below normal for whatever reason.","windows 11's thread director goes a bit further, supposedly it can analyse the workload type and assign the appropriate core while keeping power usage to the minimum.",this would be better for laptop users as the thread director will not use p-cores if e-cores are judged sufficient for the task.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just dont understand why people refuse to go to windows 11. it is literally just windows 10 with more optimizations and a reskin.,"you have an alder lake cpu, which will be more optimized for windows 11. i personally havent had any issues with w\indows 11 except for right at the beginning but they fixed it already.",also you get better fps in windows 11 (not much but can be 5% more in some cases),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you like windows 10 stay on windows 10. i donâ€™t think youâ€™ll notice a difference in performance with modern parts tbh.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i personally use  win11 with ""this is windows 11"" (github free download) program and then you don't have to worry about it.",the concerns about 11 are really much ado about nothing when doing the above imo.,"perfect no, but none of it is yet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the latest build is definitely better than before.,i am not much of a multitasker but ecores are definitely being utilized correctly unlike before.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"simply saying, no.","windows 10 has a strange tendency to throw all threads for a certain program onto e-cores for some applications, no matter how much thread you generate.","it does not matter how much p cores or e cores you have available, and it also does not matter how idle the p-cores are.","i have found this phenomena on both 21h2 and 22h2, using windows 10 enterprise.","it's still there a week ago, and i highly doubt if microsoft will fix that.",the lucky thing is this is fairly rare and i only found them on some work-related applications (like mathematica or matlab) or benchmarks (like y-cruncher).,most games run on p-cores normally.,"a good workaround is using softwares like process lasso to manually assign a program to p-cores only (but if you assign it to both p and e cores, they sometimes still run on e cores only, so you may lose a little bit of performance there).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i was in a similar situation and i ended up upgrading to w11 as i was seeing stuttering due to processes being put on the efficiency cores.,i use explorer patcher which is free so i can use the w10 taskbar.,to look at my desktop you wouldn't know that i was running w11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just my 2 cents i have a 12400f on windows 10 it wouldn't turbo past 3.9ghxz but with windows 11 it turbos properly to 4.4 whe using 1 or 2 cores and 4.2 when it's using 3 to 5 cores so it's finally working how it should.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no it did not for me, i was troubleshooting for a whole week because my 13700k refused to switch into lower c-states and other anomalies.",always kept some cores on.,forced everything and tried everything in bios.,"sometimes it would work after boot, then randomly again not anymore.","when it would work properly, after benchmarking it or testing some games, it got ""stuck"" and refused to idle again.",clean windows 10.,"(gigabyte z790 aorus elite ax)

i just got a 13700kf and when i do x264 encoding with either staxrip or handbrake it only uses the e cores.,does anyone have a solution for this?,is this a win10 issue?,cinebench works fine with all cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"windows 11 is a lot more locked down and targeted towards ""dumb"" users.","it begins with the cut down right click menu, and ends somewhere at the inavailability of the legacy menus.","it's more and more locked down, similar to macos, just worse, because it's still only windows.",if you are used to pro-user/pro-sumer workflows it's just annoying,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"> i just dont understand why people refuse to go to windows 11

windows 10 performs better on my hardware.",it has fewer processes in task manager and runs faster due to not having transparency on every window and menu.,edit: i am being downvoted for stating facts lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
simple reason - taskbar restrictions on multi-monitor systems.,try having 4 screens and  all you want is the taskbar dragged to a secondary panel and put on the left hand side.,it's a total deal breaker for me and until that is possible i will sadly never use windows 11 on my main rig despite really wanting to make the move.,"it needs to be dragged away from the primary panel because that's the screen that games default to, and some games it's a pain in the ass to change screen number.","i don't want a taskbar on all screens, it's such a simple requirement that windows 10 does perfectly annd windows 11 utterly fails at.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe i just don't like the new skin.,"but also because they removed some basic features, like drag and drop wasn't working for a long time, and hovering over open items on the task bar no longer shows previews of the open window.","there are lots of small quality of life things that have been inexplicably removed or disabled on windows 11. i might just see if i can hold out until windows 12, or at least wait until they bring back some basic qol features.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

delusional at best.,a770 will be obsolete long before intel catches amd.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh ok.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel is making a all new driver for something like 12 gen and arc and newer it should be in a up coming kernel this year for testing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"amd have had their gpu division for the last decade yet the drivers are still awful, intel has had less than 2 years in the dedicated gaming market yet are improving massively, give it time and they'll surpass the radeon team.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"watched them get their asses kicked for over a decade, more or less.","they used to at least be significantly cheaper, but for three generations now theyâ€™ve just slotted into nvidiaâ€™s lineup.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gaining ground where?,even 3080s sold more than the cheaper 6000 series cards,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> the 6700xt is definitely better than the 3070 as of today, the opposite was true in 2020. the 3080 10gb is starting to look really crippled, so the 6800xt is making ground on that too.",please tell me that you are not drawing these conclusions based on how that broken mess of hogwarts legacy is performing right now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">if you keep them +5 years amd is the way to go

no, you canâ€™t trust amd to support their gpus that long anymore.",they dropped support for the r9 390 and fury x after only ~5 years.,"to add insult to injury, they also ended it during the height of the pandemic and gpu shortages.","both of those gpus still had excellent performance too, in the gtx 1650 super to gtx 1660 super range.","if you want something to last over 5+ years, itâ€™s nvidia or nothing until intel proves themselves and amd regains that trust.","rdna2 hasnâ€™t had a driver update in like three months now, so ðÿ¤·.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
amd is even further behind nvidia than what is commonly believed.,itâ€™s not even a comparable product.,itâ€™s baffling considering the success of ryzen.,"from an architectural standpoint, arc is more advanced than radeon.",amd gpus still have no hardware accelerated ray tracing and still have no tensor core equivalent.,"from a hardware standpoint, it hasnâ€™t changed much in 10 years.",a radeon gpu is essentially just good for one thingâ€¦ raster performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">it depends how long you keep your gpus really, if you keep them 5+ years amd is the way to go

>it's been such a consistent pattern, we are even seeing it with the rx 6000 series already gaining ground on the rtx 3000 series.",that didn't work out for me at all with the last [radeons i purchased](https://i.imgur.com/2h3whnq.jpg).,the $50 less expensive gtx 980's would have served me way better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
radeon drivers have been fine for the 6000-series.,intel looks good because they started so far back that itâ€™s easy to improve things.,theyâ€™re still far behind amd and nvidia in terms of drivers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> yet the drivers are still awful

other than the rdna3 launch pains, what issues are there?",i haven't noticed any major issues with the most recent drivers on rdna2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in my limited ezperience, for the pas several years, since as early as about rx 470, amd has been the choice for gamers, since you were getting same power for less money.","meanwhile nvidia offered features amd didn't, but gamers generally don't need.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean it's not just one game.,uncharted had the same issues.,it's been slowly getting more consistent across multiple newer games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> 5 years


the 390 which was a refresh of the 290 which came out in 2013 so it lasted around 8 years before the drivers were dropped

nvidia is doing the same thing with the 600 and 700 series why is this an issue with just amd?",pretty sure you can get open source community made drivers for amd cards as well unlike nvidia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to be fair the 390 still beats the 980 it was competing against though.,"so, there is that.",i have to admit i was disappointed with that though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5 years is about what i'd expect in terms of support for a gpu.,"if you can get couple more, it's definitely nice but not really anything i care about.","at that point, you'll be wanting a new one anyway.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">amd gpus still have no hardware accelerated ray tracing

why tell such an obvious lie?",you are really gonna tell everyone with a straight face 7900xt achieved [over 90% rt performance ](https://freeimage.host/i/heuzmwn) of 4070 ti with zero hardware acceleration.,"so by your logic nvidia's 3rd generation ""accelerated"" rt on 4070 ti is so bad it's only less than 24% (normalised for non-rt performance) better than 7900 xt with no hw acceleration.",nice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"of course they have hardware accelerated ray tracing, it's just done differently to nvidia.",depending on how optimized the game is for them they run rt just fine.,"and they have very good raster performance, which is still the most important thing for a gpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"from my personal experience from a hd 7850 (2012) to a r9 290 (2016) the drivers were awful compared to when i upgraded to a 1070 with nvidia drivers, since then i've only bought nvidia cards because the software and features are simply better.","reading about issues with blackscreens on the 6800xt and high rma numbers on the rx 7000 mba hotspots/vapor chamber issue has certainly kept me away again, intel might be slightly behind amd but i'd trust intel with the improvements they're making to be well worth a look at in another year, radeon needs a complete rebrand and an investment in the software teams around it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"offering less features and lower quality features was fine, when they were selling rx 480 8gb for $229 vs nvidiaâ€™s gtx 1060 6gb for $299.",that was ~30% price difference.,"now that theyâ€™re basically trying to price match nvidia, that crap doesnâ€™t fly anymore.",at least not with me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, it's simply bad pc implementations and drm",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
uncharted is an amd sponsored title and it heavily favours team red.,a 6800xt is faster than a 3090 at 4k in this game...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"gtx 700 came in in 2013, driver support ended in the middle of 2021. thatâ€™s 8 years of support.",(honestly this is the bare minimum.,"i think nvidia shouldâ€™ve extended it 6-12 months because of the pandemic and shortages, but it is what it is.)","r9 300 came out in the middle of 2015, support ended in middle of 2021. thatâ€™s 6 years of support.","(fury x got even less driver support, but iâ€™ll just focus on r9 390 for now.)","amd couldâ€™ve named it something like â€œr9 291â€ instead of â€œr9 390â€ to give customers a heads up, but they didnâ€™t so itâ€™s on them to support their rebranded crap.","r9 390s were being sold brand new well into 2016 ffs, so thereâ€™s brand new r9 390 buyers that got much less than 6 years of drivers.","itâ€™s great that open source and hacked drivers exist, but thatâ€™s not something a paying customer of relatively new, relatively well performing, hardware should have to rely on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> 390 still beats the 980 it was competing against though.,i am still looking for a compelling reason to upgrade.,with support being dropped it certainly makes sense - but otherwise performance and shit is spot on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i personally recommended the r9 390 to someone back in the day too lol, never again amd.","now nvidia is worth 30% more to me simply on driver support alone, not even talking about everything else you get with nvidia.","i ride my hardware till it dies or literally canâ€™t do what i want it to anymore, so gamers that upgrade every 2-4 years probably donâ€™t care.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nah, r9 390 and fury x performed well enough that people didnâ€™t really need an upgrade.","people seem to forget that the vast majority of pc gamers are playing on weak crap like intel hd graphics, 1050ti, 1060, 1650, etc.",the r9 390 and fury x perform in the 1650 super to 1660 super range.,thatâ€™s more than good enough for the majority of pc gamers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"itâ€™s not a lie, they donâ€™t have any dedicated rt silicon.",they just reuse the cus from traditional rendering.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> ~~depending on how optimized the game is for them~~

depending on how little rt amd forced on the devs to save face with their inferior rt capabilities, is what you're actually looking for.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you seriously comparing ancient drivers to the modern one?,"modern gpu driver support is perfectly fine
also a lot of problems come from people downloading optional/testing drivers and then ending up with issues.","i have seen more driver issues with nvidia recently than amd in the past year or so, and this is from discord servers and such so it's not biased by reddit questions which are only asked when someone ends up with a problem.","i've had tons of ""nvidia only for gaming and productivity"" users vouch for amd drivers being perfectly fine",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah rdna 3 is a big disappointment.,the 7900 xtx isn't even that much better than the 4080. and for ray tracing the 4080 is better.,price wise they're way overpriced.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"except the fact, that rx 480 had more features than 1060.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't disagree there.,"i've been looking to upgrade from 5700 xt and i was hoping amd, but i don't see any options on the market that interest me atm from any of the brands...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"

> rehashed crap

didn't nvidia rehash the 400 500 & 600 series 

take it you've forgotten about the gtx 970, gt 1030 or the 1060 6/3gb or the 4080 12gb fiascos as well 

stop acting like nvidia is that much better they're just as bad if not worse


> relatively new

a gpu from 2013 and re-released in 2015 isn't really that new though",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i also find this funny because oddly enough earlier this week i picked up a r9 390x for $40 on facebook marketplace to go with a dell t3600 with 32gb of ram and a xeon e5 1650 i got off ebay for $120.,i've been having issues passing up some of the deals lately on pc hardware lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're exaggerating.,"amd is about [one generation behind](https://www.guru3d.com/articles-pages/amd-radeon-rx-7900-xtx-review,18.html) in rt speed.",together with fsr2 it's usable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well nvidia back in 2016 have come a long way, dlss and ray tracing are all better on the green side, plus i love g-sync ultimate, samsung ""g-sync compatible"" had shit tons of stuttering i returned for the aw2721d.","amd is the budget brand, there is a reason nvidia is more popular.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"agreed, the whole point of going with chiplets is to reduce cost.","instead of using that to gain market share, they just pocketed the extra margin lol.",7900xtx shouldâ€™ve been $899 and the 7900xt shouldâ€™ve been $699.,that wouldâ€™ve demolished nvidiaâ€™s entire lineup and gave people an actual reason to buy radeon outside of being a fanboy.,i think amd is content with their measly 10% market share and just wants to milk their fanboys at this point lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i donâ€™t care about the underlying architectures.,"i compared r9 300 to gtx 700, not kepler to gcn.","if you release a product, even a rebranded product, i expect a minimum amount of support for it to make it worth the money.","if amd named it â€œr9 291â€ instead of â€œr9 390â€ iâ€™d cut them some slack, but they didnâ€™t so ðÿ¤·.",i personally got burned by this because i recommended the r9 390 to someone back in the day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
one generation behind seems pretty inferior to me.,i have reason to suspect the gap will not improve as games make heavier use of rt effects either.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
out of all the reasons drivers are absolutely not one why someone would ditch amd.,"it's people who spread misinformation with the ""oh amd drivers suck"" online who create a false image of nvidia being plain better.",what is nvidia good for really?,ray tracing?,amd can do it fine for the price but even then barely anyone uses it.,dlss?,"fsr allows you to do the same thing on literally any card, guess which is a better approach?",hardware specific or one based on software that gets 90% close most of the time without adding extra cost?,only real field where nvidia still wins in equal gpus is productivity and that too specifically cuda biased softwares.,otherwise i'd take a 6900/6800 any day over the nvidia equivalent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
problem is that amd and nvidia also had lot of old stock to liquidate.,"so every incentive is in keeping prices as high as possible, so people give up and buy older models off from retailers first.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you are looking at the i9 12900k perhaps you should also look at the i7 13700k.,it has the same core count as the 12th gen i9 and offer 95% of the performance of the 13th gen i9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"price wise, you should be comparing the 12900k to the 13700k, as the 13700k is literally a better, faster version of the 12900k.","so, if the 12900k costs more than the 13700k, then do not get the 12900k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
$399 for an 13700k seems better than all of the above,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have a 13700kf and thinking about selling it and getting a 13900kf.,the 13700 is too weak.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"agree 13700k/kf is probably the best bet .. but comparing it to a 13900k:

around 95% perf in 1-2 core/games
around 75% in multicore, due to 13900k having 8 extra e-cores (also makes it hotter & hungrier)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i am used to have an intel cpu, as i use its virtualization technologies etc, and i donâ€²t really like amd from the past.","i read that 13700k is a huge jump from 10700k, so iâ€²m going to stick with intel.",thanks anyway:),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3. set *turbo boost short power max* the same value as *turbo boost power max* at the advanced tuning tab
4. set windows power plan to *balanced*.",5. re-run tests and watch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i knew they were hot.,i was just stupid af and the pump block wasn't seated properly...now it running fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"with properly set dc loadline to match llc impedance, vid is equal to vcore under full load, doing so will also result in correct power draw reading.",his issue is terrible contact between ihs and cooler's coldplate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hey i have the asus rog strix gaming e board as well and my vcore is well over 1.4... i try setting a 1.35v and it load windows but when i run cinebench i get errors or the pc crashes.,do i have a bad board or bad cpu?,please help so i know what to send back.. thank you in advance!,!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
idk what you mean.,like 1.4 during an all core workload or when gaming?,because thatâ€™s normal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if i set my own core voltage with say 55p and 53e and i set core voltage to 1.35v.. i can load up fine but when i run cinebench it crashes or gives me errors immediately.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or even if i try doing a negative offset of 0.05 it does the same thing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"but if i leave it auto and run cinebench, the voltage is 1.25-1.3 max just like yours.. so why if i try to set a voltage higher than that like 1.35 does it not work?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you mean 4.3 e core?,why are you setting a static voltage anyway?,just let it do itâ€™s thing and dont worry about it unless your trying to overclock,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was trying to oc.,but i started by setting 55p and 43e and set my voltage to 1.35v and it gives me errors everytime on cinebench within seconds of attempting the test.,yet when i dont set the voltage and run the test its at 1.28-1.3v.,so why can't i set my own voltage?,something has to be wrong..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what are your specs?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"13900k, asus rog strix z790-e, g.skill trident z5 ddr5-7800, rtx strix 3080, corsair 850w",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well.,5.5p core and 4.3e core is the default boost.,your not even overclocking at that point.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's my point.,i should be able to set a core voltage of 1.35v and get through cinebench..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"there is a pretty big cache difference under the 13600k, also if you can find a good deal on a z series mobo i would recomend considering overclocking because the 13600k can handle small overclocks with and undervolt to improve both temps and performance and has good headroom even with no changes to core voltage ( see my most recent post for specific clocks)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
t model cpus are set with a 35w tdp.,no letter cpus are 65w.,k cpus are 125w.,but ignore all that.,thereâ€™s no reason to run at pl1 power levels.,"if you want a relative idea of what power the cpu may consume stock, look to the pl2 (bigger) number.","finally, know that the 13600k is true 13th gen raptor lake silicon with improved imc, more cache, etc, while the 13600 is alder lake (12th gen) silicon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"non-k bclk overclocking was killed, non-k i5 and i3 13th gen is still alder lake which it's crappy memory controller and 13600k has also much more cache, which makes it tons better cpu.","this is intel's new scummy upselling, as you need to know raptor lake tables about this and there's little voice about system agent (memory controller) voltage lock on locked cpus, which basically renders you unable to go higher than 3600mhz ddr4 (most of the time even that doesn't work) in gear 1 or above 6200mhz on ddr5 in gear 2.

power draw you can easily set to your own desire (but make sure to [read my guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/intel/comments/107eu0q/power_draw_reading_in_relation_to_dc_loadline/) about precise power draw limiting).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was debating between i5-13500 and i5-13600kf.,with just 40â‚¬ price difference i went for the i5-13600kf.,it's slightly faster and will probably last longer even with higher end gpus.,"for example, cinebench r23 multiscore for the i5-13500 is 20300 and my i5-13600kf scored 24000 stock and 25000 when undervolted and tweaked.","according to one comparison i found, the stock i5-13600k was around 10-15% faster in games than the i5-13500.",bigger cache and higher clock speeds help.,"however, the i5-13600k(f) runs hot and mine was constantly hitting 100 degrees with 1.35v stock voltage.","so even if you don't want to overclock, you might have to tweak voltages or at least set power limits.",i managed to lower core voltage to 1.18v and increase clock speeds so i gained some performance and reduced temps a lot.,i still might upgrade my cpu cooler before summer.,both i5-13500 and i5-13600 non-k will run much cooler out of the box.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">13600k any better to me than a 13600

theoretically the 13600k is slightly faster

practically you won't notice a difference",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pay the extra to get the k model.,"in the past it didn't matter if you weren't overclocking, but it does now.",all 13th gen i3/ i5 non k cpu uses alder lake p cores.,"only real difference between last gen and the 13100, 13400, 13500 and 13600 (non k) is the amount of e cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks, will get a k for the cache even if not doing oc",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wait...they actually are not of the same gen of silicon?,"ok i will look into it, thanks a lot!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
non k is locked at 4800mhz k can hit 5600. not a huge difference,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
