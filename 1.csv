yeah.,as i wrote i also had weird problems applying changes.,hwmonitor did show offsets but the behavior could just go back to stock when i did changes.,then needed a new reboot and the settings were actually taking effect in practice.,but now they just work like this even if i reboot etc.,its just when making changes that it was unreliable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
glad it helped :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hey!,i havent really touched the pl settings at all just voltage.,i would assume that the time setting doesnt matter at that point.,for a simple undervolt i would just suggest applying -100 in the core offset in the fivr menu but that still just makes the wattage a stable 230 at 100% all core workload.,havent actually checked the gaming wattage much.,on wattage limit settings i have no info yet as i havent tried them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hey!,cant remember sorry :(.,i distinctly remember seeing something resemblibg turbo enhancement or something like it but cant remember where.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the exact difference?,no.,all i can tell you is to just play with a negative core voltage offset in fivr menu and see what happens.,for me it never broke anything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah it seems because of the plundervolt vulnerability xtu probably wont get fixed.,i think throttlestop is the only option to do this properly in windows.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think it's a legacy naming then, asrock didn't bother to change it correctly.","also as i mentioned previously, no point in touching l2 voltage (e-cores vcore) and ring voltage, as you'll have same voltage applied to each three of them anyway, value of the highest among these three.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i noticed my friend's 13600k does not downclock much during idle, maybe one or two cores will downclock to 800mhz but the rest stays at turbo clock rate while idle, is this normal behavior for these newer cpus?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i heard, that going down more than -100mv will affect performance much more.",do you think this is true?,do you also know what the undervolt on the ring-bus is  affecting?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok heh.,well this has been a confusing couple of days.,thanks for the info :).,i agree that the e-core offset doesnt really do anything as i was just testing there.,setting a separate ring offset did effect voltages tho.,i could not get the voltages to budge under 1.27 with just the core offset.,"ring offset finally got them to 1.245.

but i havent tested ring invidually without any core offset so i will do that tonight to see if thats the only thing i really need to adjust.",edit: not saying youre wrong in general but this is the behavior i observed so something wonky going on there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

nothing.,the cpu will boost as long as temps and power allows.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i should also add.,"in addition to temps and power, it's up to your operating system and bios to make the decision as well.",the bios should default to having turbo boost enabled.,"windows will, too, but if you are using a ""power saving"" power plan, turbo is likely being switched off.",balanced is the best plan to use on modern processors.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if my experience with cinebench is anything to go by then this is completely normal, if you want to make sure then use  other benchmark software and in game benchmark, if it gets high temperatures then you might have a problem, also it is important to take note of your idle temps and gaming temps, these are the ones that count, my cpu instantly hits 100c in cinebench but never goes above 80c in any task, thats what counts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how fast it hits 100c that's actually nothing surprising i wonder why no one has mentioned it yet.,you need to watch reviews etc.,all processors this gen boost to insanely high power limits until they hit the temperature amd/intel designed it to be the safe limit.,"for example for amd u probably heard amd cpus reaching and staying at 95c it's an intended behaviour this gen. 

what u should check is how is ur gaming temps.",if they are fine all u need to do is undervolt ur cpu and it will bring temps down by atleast 10c.,my 13700k was hitting 92c after undervolt its reaching at 80c (360mm aio) and i actually gained cinebench scores from undervolting.,what is surprising to me is that ur temps are reaching a little higher for a 13600k.,partially because u don't have an aio so the motherboard has probably configured it to run a little more hot to gain extra performance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had similar problem with my 13600k.,asus prime z790 mb + 13600k + corsair h100i aio and temps were around 95-100 degrees in cinebench r23.,probably would have been more but i stopped benchmark after 2 minutes when it reached 100 degrees.,"i disabled mce, set core voltage to 1,26 in bios and re-applied thermal paste(arctic mx-4) 3 times... now max temp i get is 79ish degrees in cinebench.",i feel quite good now about it.,":)

is there anything else i should change or do differently?",or i just bought not good enough combo?,seems odd that i need to do stuff like that out of the box.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this happened to me.,drop the core voltage to 1.10v.,cinebench at 70c now.,boosts to advertised speeds fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you need to play around the bios a bit.,"do like a -.115 offset, leave mce on (i think its a good gauge of your oc and heat), get that thermalright cpu plate (itll help with -5c).",theres a bunch of different things you can do to get the temps down.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you have an msi mobo by default the [cpu cooler tuning](https://www.msi.com/blog/cpu-cooler-tuning-optimized-power-limit-based-on-cpu-coolers) is probably set to water cooler which enables the cpu to draw a lot more watts (4096w) than it requires and can significantly increase temps because the cpu boosts to whatever thermal limit it can from my understanding, which is around the 100 degrees you're seeing.",changing this to boxed cooler (181w) or tower air cooler (288w) will limit the cpu max pl1/pl2 watt draw and lower temps.,"you can also combine this with the msi cpu lite load (default/auto is 12, intel recommends 9, i'm currently running on 1) to undervolt the cpu which will help lower temps further.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which frame did you get?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
damn guess so.,i didn't use a contact frame cause i saw most people saying they got little to no improvement.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have the dark pro 4 also and i installed my fan about 3 times.,it's hitting 100c just from doing dumb crap like installing a game.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is all you need to do.,leave mce on and limit this to 8/9.,"cheers for that mate, worked a treat.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you mean to change it from auto to mode 8 or 9?,what does that actually do?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
normal if you have poor cooling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
im not understanding by it isnt a stressful test.... its literally a stress test designed to stress the cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my case definitely has sufficient air flow.,wait really?,cinebench puts my cpu at 100% usage so i figured that's as much stress as it's gonna get.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wouldn't turning off mce drop my frequency down to the non-boost speed of 3.5ghz?,"maybe i'm mistaken about what mce does, but i thought that was what boosted it beyond to the max 5.1ghz.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i thought that might be it.,it was my first time having to manually apply thermal paste so there's a chance i messed it up.,"score was 22800, cpu is throttling at around 4.9ghz",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah i've heard that.,my main concern really is how fast it spikes up.,like it hits 100c within a few seconds.,has me thinking that i might have installed my cooler poorly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
temps seem to be fine while gaming which was why i wasn't sure if it was even an issue.,"i tried using intel xtu to undervolt, but undervolting has always been extremely confusing to me.",i tried a -100ma undervolt and didn't really see any change in temps or cinebench score.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's normal for this particular cooler when running cinebench and paired with a i5-13600k with power limits removed.,one of us has actually tested this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's a benchmark.,occt or prime 95 are thorough stress tests.,"you want to test for stability and cooler performance, those are the two to use.",cinebench is a very easy test to pass.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"cinebench is a very easy test for the system, very easy to pass.","as i mentioned, if you want to test your systems stability and cooler performance, use occt or prime95.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, turning off mce just ensured the default power limits are in place.",your clock might drop a bit to 4.9 ghz or so during all core loads like benchmarks but in the real world there should be pretty much no impact.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that could have something to do with your fan curve, fans stay at low rpm at the beginning so it gets hot instantly and doesn't crash because fans are now either working effectively or hitting max rpm, maybe try setting them to max rpm before starting the benchmark, see if it still hits 100c instantly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its because there is no power limit on your 13600k so it will use as much watt as possible until it hits tjmax (100 c).,"for my 12700k thats around 220 w. look in hwinfo64 how much your 13600k uses during the stress benchmark, i think it will be similar.",you can alter the pl1 and pl2 power limits with throttlestop to e.g.,"125 w and you will go down from 100 c in cinebench to 70 c but your cores wont run at full clock speed but around 0.5-0.6 ghz lower than max

my 12700k runs cinebench with the aforementioned pl1/pl2 limits enabled at average 3.74 ghz (p: 4.0 ghz, e: 3.2 ghz) instead of the normal average 4.3 ghz (p: 4.7 ghz, e: 3.6 ghz)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its a bench mark but also a stress test....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hm that's weird.,"i have an msi motherboard and i disabled ""enhanced turbo"" which people claim is msi's version of mce and it dropped my max frequency to 3.5",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you might want to double check that since base (p-core) frequency should be 3.5, max is 5.1, as per [intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/230493/intel-core-i513600k-processor-24m-cache-up-to-5-10-ghz/specifications.html).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh shit i figured it out, i disabled the wrong thing.",now my frequency is around 4.9 and my score improved but i'm still hitting 100c.,i think i probably just installed my cooler poorly.,first time manually applying thermal paste.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the fact that you get decent temps in gaming but only get terrible temps in cinebench leads me to believe the installation is fine, but the heatsink is getting fully saturated.",how quickly does it reach 100c?,how's your airflow?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"corsair 4000d with plenty of fans, i'd say airflow is excellent.",it does hit 100c very quickly.,literally a few seconds in cinebench.,"temps also spike up really quickly in gaming before the fans even have time to spin up, then they come back down.",that's why i thought maybe a bad installation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so, any update?",seeing the same problem here as described by you.,"edit: for all reading it later like me: had the same problem as described, what helped was selecting a lower cpu lite mode in the bios and checking my cpu cooler setup again, in my case i mounted the middle fan of my darkrock pro facing the wrong direction.",went from 100 c instantly in cinebench to 85 c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what extras?,"i can't find anything that indicates sam is different from rebar, even in amd's own papers on the subject.",where did you get this information from?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
from what i have seen it works well on the 12th gen but not as well on 10th gen. do we have information about 11th gen or is it more or less the same as 10th gen?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wonder where they got that information from.,"not doubting it, just wondering about sources.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as mentioned, it's the same thing.",it's not an amd feature.,resizable bar is resizable bar.,"as long as the option is available on your motherboard, there's no advantage from one platform over an another.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if the motherboard supports resizable bar then it could be a similar performance boost.,but i've seen benchmarks.,5% to 15% from sam seems higher than what i've seen from resizable bar benchmarks.,i would need to see updated benchmarks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how could intel clarify?,it's amd's driver.,it's been tested as well and the best gains are seen on amd.,it's not a coincidence.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">well, they are similar, but there are also differences.","amdâ€™s sam feature is originally based on resizable bar, but it has been developed further to bring additional performance improvements.","i posted a link about it above, but here it is:

again.",it's only sam if it's amd cpu and gpu.,otherwise it's just resize bar.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"> the best gains are seen on amd

they aren't.","if you use an amd gpu on either intel or amd, you see the same uplift in performance when you enable rebar (or sam on amd).","how is sam ""better?""","what ""extras"" are you talking about?",rebar is an established standard that's been around for years.,sam isn't some new standard or protocol.,"if it were, it would mean intel platforms would have to license it from amd to include it on their motherboards, and it would mean enabling rebar with an amd gpu would not work.","yet, all you have to do is enable rebar on an intel platform, and it works perfectly with amd gpus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you haven't shown anything that indicates sam is somehow different, or better, than rebar.","i dug through some of amd's publications, and all they say is that sam is their implementation of resizable bar.",that's it.,"you can disagree all you like, but you're not providing any evidence that sam is anything more than rebar.",a few youtube videos that compare nvidia cards and amd cards isn't evidence.,"but as i mentioned, amd cards using rebar on intel machines show the same performance uplift as if they use sam (which is rebar) on amd platforms.",so there's no evidence of sam being somehow better.,there can't be.,"they are the same thing, but amd calls it sam.","if you could provide some evidence, maybe a white paper on the topic, i'd give that a read.","but linus tech tips isn't where i go to for technical information, it's more tech-entertainment than anything else.","hardware unboxed is pretty solid, but even they didn't claim sam is better.","in fact, multiple times, they refer to sam as amd's implementation of resizable bar.",as does steve from gamersnexus.,you need some solid evidence to back up your claims.,"my claim is simple, because it's based on the facts we know and have access to:  sam is what amd calls rebar.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the only difference is that rebar has a much larger impact on performance on amd gpus than it does on nvidia gpus.,sam is rebar with a different name.,"it allows system access to gpu memory in arbitrary sizes, not just 256 mb chunks.",that's all rebar and sam do.,there's no magic to sam; it's just that amd gpus see much larger gains by using it than nvidia.,intel or amd cpu makes no difference at all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
except you don't see the same and this has been tested.,and oh my god.,for the last time.,it is only sam with amd cpu and gpu.,it is resize bar with intel cpu and amd gpu.,"this is seen in gpu z.

"it's literally in the video, you are just not mentally equipped to comprehend.","he said and for the second time: built on top of resize bar, with driver opts and compatibility testing.",it's straight from amd.,"so you are wrong about it just being resize bar, let alone there being any differences between sam and rebar.","sam came out exclusively for zen 3. after, amd extended it as resize bar to further intel and amd systems.",your other claim is flat out wrong.,"i gave a video that went through it by frame chasers, and he streamed the performance differences of which you claim are equal.",so you're wrong three times.,grats.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sam is enabled when using amd gpu with amd cpu

rebar is enabled when using amd gpu with intel cpu.",the diff is seen in gpu z despite amd calling it sam in the control panel no matter what cpu is used.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"call it sam or resizable bar, it's the same thing: arbitrary address sizes to vram, removing the restriction to only use 256 mb page sizes.",that's all it is.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

https://youtu.be/ufgw6gd2v5u

amd have never explained what goes into sam.",only that it's based on rebar since it includes it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm not sure what you think [sam does that rebar doesn't](https://appuals.com/resizable-pcie-bar-and-amd-smart-access-memory-explained/).,"if you can provide any evidence to support the claim that sam is different than rebar (other than the name), i'm more than willing to read up on it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
those two links do not support the claim that sam is different than resizable bar.,"they merely show that rebar is better on amd gpus than on nvidia gpus, and that's down to nvidia's crappy implementation of it.",have a look at how intel gpus perform with rebar enabled vs disabled; it's a huge uplift.,does that mean that intel's rebar is different than nvidia's?,"the other thing you've missed completely is that either on an intel or amd machine, amd gpus see the same uplift in performance with sam (a.k.a.",rebar) enabled.,"so as i said, it doesn't matter if you're using an amd or intel cpu; if it supports rebar, you're fine.",amd doesn't magically get a better result just because it calls rebar sam.,i'm really not sure where you got the idea that sam is different than rebar in some way.,resizable bar has been around for years.,amd's sam uses that same standard.,"it's not something new, or different, except for the name.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"13600k for purely gaming, 13700k if you also dabble in things like 3d work or video editing.","if you're looking for a solid vr setup, all your money needs to go into the best gpu possible.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13700k or kf and do not get the 13900k... too much money and you can use the money you saved from not buying that to put towards the best gpu you can get.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a 12100 could do 4k 60 in most games... that's more of a gpu thing than a cpu thing... the 13900k toss that idea out the window... it is not for gamers... 13600-13700 is more than enough.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i must be confusing the cpu with the gpuâ€™s task.,sorry about that.,i think i might go for the 13600k or 13700k for vr/gaming but iâ€™m open to hear what others might suggest.,thanks for your advice!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think the amount of money saved is probably not that much between the k and kf.,the kf just doesn't have an intergrated gpu so if anything goes wrong with your gpu you wont be able boot to windows.,i have a kf because i have a spare gpu and wanted the ever so slightly better temperatures on the cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 10400f is still good it makes no sense imho, unless you can upgrade for cheap.",the fact that it's only pcie 3.0 is kinda irrelevant the gpu isn't powerful enough to saturate it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you want/need it now, itâ€™s a good upgrade.","if you can wait, try to hold out a couple months for the 13th gen non-k models to release, as the 13400 or 13500 will be much improved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12400f is probably the best value chip at its price.,"only thing i would say is that the 13400/f is going to be releasing here soon-ish, so you might consider waiting for that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"6600 runs fine on pcie 3. its a decent combo, u dont need to upgrade",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i5 10400 and rx6600 here.,it works very well.,upgrade when you feel the need.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'd hold off a bit more until the 13400f is released.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
few month more.,i5-13400.,it will be worth the upgrade.,12400 is good.,"13400 will be much better as you are upgrading mobo anyways..

i don't understand these responses.,there are a variety of videos on youtube comparing the 10400 and 12400 in games at 1080 showing marginal improvement in most games and substantial gains in a few.,is a 5-10% gain on average worth the extra cost?,wouldn't you see a bigger gain from a gpu upgrade by putting that money + selling your existing gpu?,what is your goal?,better visual quality or a higher frame rate for competitive games?,"if it's the latter, and you've already tried turning down the settings, then a cpu upgrade might make sense.","if you're playing on a 60hz monitor, then i'm sure your current config is more  than adequate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can answer that for yourself.,are you satisfied with the performance you're getting in your games right now?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sitting here using my i7-6700k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not really, as you would need a new mobo as well, so 200 for the cpu+150 for the board, at that point you are better off grabbing a 10900, or just keeping the money for a more substantial upgrade as both of those are not significant upgrades in terms of gaming performance",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think you should go with 13500.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's also running 8x pcie gen3.,"and yes, it's a big improvement.","i have had 10400, 10900, 11400, 12400 and 13700.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ðÿ’¯,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i weent from an 11400 to a 12100 (kinda a sidestep) but the 12100 wins easily... and uses a lot less power too at the same time... so a 12400?,"easy yes it is a nice upgrade for sure it's not a giant upgrade but noticeable and with pcie 4.0 it will help too with that gpu and you can upgrade to a much better gpu next time you ""need"" an upgrade.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'd wait for i5-13400(f).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that will be a costly upgrade because you'll need a new motherboard.,it might be more cost-effective to upgrade to a better 10th generation cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
edit: read the comment below this and dont trust amazon listings for what the standard for gpu pcide lanes is.,"this, unlike the 6400 and 6500xt the 6600 actually has a pcie x16 interface, so 3.0 is still pretty much fine.",only reason to upgrade the cpu would be if you play games or use applications that are cpu heavy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and also, the release of the 13th gen might cause big sales on the 12th gen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea if your not in a hurry the 13400 would be better since it will get e cores,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but then you're likely to need new ram as well.,"although the 13th gen chips will still have ddr4 support, motherboards have one type of ram or the other, and most are expected to be made for ddr5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6600 and 6600xt have x8 if i remember correctly and the 6400 and 6500 are x4.,but x8 gen 3 is fine for the 6600,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"lol, most 13th gen boards are ddr4 these days.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it may or may not be.,depends on what you're trying to run and the context of the stuttering.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"which games, some of them just stutter, and sometimes windows is to blame, so it might not even be your cpu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
huh the listing i looked at to make sure i was remembering it correctly claimed it was x16 but looking it up the card is supposed to be x8... huh.,thanks for correcting me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the one that bothers me the most is mass effect legendary edition, it has a lot of stuttering.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqp2mwr0rqa) showing performance of the game with 6600 + 10105f.,you may have to look elsewhere for the cause of your stuttering.,edit: [afterburner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozx8pbfmeem) may help you figure out what's causing your stuttering.,most likely memory limitations from background processes or cpu intensive background processes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have played with gigabyte motherboards a lot.,"for gigabyte, there is no special ""automatic"" undervolting features, and before starting, i have to mention that 12th / 13th gen intel cpus has a feature called cep or undervoltage protection or something like that in the bios.",it can hurt your cpu performance a lot (something like phantom throttling or clock stretching) if you try to undervolting the cpu with these settings on.,"many b660 motherboards do not allow you to turn off cep, though, so your undervolting potential can be limited.",z690 motherboards usually allows you to config that.,"i would suggest you starting with adjusting ac/dc loadline, which is usually located in the vrm settings in the cpu page.",gigabyte motherboard comes with a couple of defaults.,"for z690, the default settings are 110/90, 90/90, 70/90, 50/90 (unit in mohm, the default can vary based on your bios version), but i would suggest you manually feed the numbers into the vrm settings, with ac loadline ""as low as possible"" and dc loadline matching with your load line calibration settings.","it is also possible to use adaptive cpu voltage, but it is not very effective on gigabyte motherboards.","many gigabyte mbs does not offer uncore (ring) voltage offset, so if you are giving a large cpu voltage offset, the core vid will be very low, but the core vid is going to be overridden by the ring vid.","you can see this effect when undervolting with xtu (and it is a good reason of using xtu to try your undervolting profiles, but i doubt if you can lower the ring voltage by a lot.","my 139k can only do -30mv on ring voltage offset, with 1/55 ac/dc loadline, llc at high).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mainboard probably has an online manual on the manufacturers website.,might even have a bios manual.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sure you can.,i can undervolt no problem on my z690 w/ a 12900k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you wont be able to undervolt on b660 board.,"as of now it doesnt work correctly on b660 boards, you loose performance or undervolt doesnt work.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it doesn't work, i tried to find the way out but failed",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
much thanks for the detailed response!,so basically theres no way to undervolt on a b660 motherboard - especially with a 13600kf?,"ive seen a msi z690 motherboard have an option called lite load with different modes, and turning them down reduces the wattage output by a lot, from 250w to 150w while also reducing the temperature (from around 100âº to 70âº).",and all that while not tinkering with the processors frequence.,"but thats all from a youtube video i saw, i cant confirm if thats real or not, but then in that case, would picking an msi z690 board help with that?",all that i want is to get a smaller wattage output and get better cooling on it.,gonna do the same with the gpu aswell.,im pretty sure it should make my electricity bill reduce by a bit.,"heres the yt video i saw, for reference - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mkavitzoly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mkavitzoly)

edit again, after looking at specifically the motherboard they used, that z690 tomahawk is extremely overpriced, or it should be good for what it is in itself, but i dont really think my budget extends that far to double the cost for the motherboard.","i would even try xtu, but i dont know if its good.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it has both a manual and a bios manual.,none of them include undervolting or any settings about the cpus voltage.,i even saw a video with the bios online.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ill have to get a z690 board then =),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you have a gigabyte z690 board?,"if so, could you please tell me what you used?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh ok, thank",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh no.. on a gigabyte z690?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would say it's some kind of automatically setting the loadline and voltage offset.,"(the default 1.4v voltage is pretty close to the default settings on my motherboard, 90/90 (or probably 110/110) ac/dc loadline.","just change that to 1/50 and llc=high lowers the vcore to 1.23v under maximum load) you can do that manually on a gigabyte board, but it requires some custom settings.","z690 motherboards usually allow you to disable cep, and probably the ""lite load"" setting option is already doing that for you, so you won't lose any performance with a lower voltage.",in contrast you may want to look into the cpu settings in you bios to see if you have that option to disable cep and undervoltage protection.,"i would suggest you playing a 13th gen cpu with a z690 board or z790 board since it allows you to feed a much lower voltage into that, but if you have a b660 board already, it may not worth replacing it.","you can always try lowering the voltage on your motherboard first, and see if it triggers the cep (r23 score will suffer in that case) or cause instability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, on b660",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i dont have the pc yet myself, im gonna build it next years summer.",ive seen a video of the b660 gaming x bios and it doesnt have lite load sadly.,"also, sorry but i dont understand what you mean by llc and the ac/dc loadline, never really tinkered with such stuff... sorry.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh alr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if possible could you please take a look through this video about the motherboards bios, and see if any undervolting is possible?",thanks again.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsfc8bxt9jq&t=268s,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
llc = load line calibration.,"ac / dc loadline are two settings that is usually located in the vrm settings (probably there is an ""advanced settings"" option in that), and is called ac loadline / dc loadline.",they are not very convenient to adjust and may require some background knowledge on how they work.,"if you do not have the motherboard purchased already, i would suggest you to go for a z690 motherboard.","msi z690 motherboards are pretty decent, but you can also play with your cpu voltage on a gigabyte / asus motherboard (but they may require complicated settings).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ill see if my budget will allow it and figure it out.,thanks again.,"i should probably not go into those ac/dc settings youve been saying, as i dont have much knowledge on them, but i will look into it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
should i get a gigabyte z690 gaming x board or an msi pro z690-a board?,the msi board is super basic and doesnt have as much features as the gigabyte but it (hopefully) has the lite load option which should allow me to undervolt...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pro a would be better for you.,"z690 gaming x also does not have the ""auto"" undervolt feature (and gaming x is the one i am using), but it has slightly better vrm and better sound card.",both should be sufficient to power on a lightly overclocked 13600kf though so vrm is not a huge issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i really couldn't care about any auto undervolt feature, some way or another i am going to find out the perfect undervolt for it, but i'm looking into the gaming x as it has more fan ports, way more features, is better looking and so on, that's why i'm trying to go into gigabyte boards.","btw, since you have same board, could you confirm that it has undervolting stuff in the bios?",thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, if you can do it manually.","it offers adjustments to ac/dc loadline and loadline calibration, as i have said before.","it also have core voltage offset, but does not have cache voltage offset (you can do that in xtu, but you won't have much headroom to lower that voltage).","i can bring my 13900k down to about 1.2v under full load on that motherboard, while not losing any performance and cause any unstability.","if you can deal with that bios, z690 gaming x a perfectly good motherboard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if it gets same results as undervolting on every other bios then i think it should be ok for me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
shouldn't have any problems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i realize i'm replying to you twice, but i've come into some new information that lead to me fixing my situation entirely in the bios.","turns out msi motherboards (and i'd assume other manufacturers) by *default* will oversupply power and voltage to a cpu, in theory to let the chip push further and improve performance.","which i guess makes for good performance benchmarks, but is absolutely asinine if you care about thermals and power draw.","instead of leaving everything in the bios on auto, i manually enforced intel's stock tdp (188 watts - msi had given it 288), and adjusted a setting called ""cpu lite load"" (this, by default, oversupplies voltage to account for variations in chip lottery / ""bad chips"")

the above results were with lite load 10.,"(it defaulted to 12 for me)

"awesome, that sounds good to me.",thanks for the advice i'm gonna get this cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my (rough) understanding is that lowering lite load is just countering the relatively minor overvolting the board is doing by default.,"undervolting is, i think, a step further, lowering the voltage curve below intel stock specs.",how far you can push both of these depends on the individual quality of your chip.,"if you're lucky you can hit lite load 1.

i do not know if this can or should be combined with actual undervolting - you'll have to do some research there.","and room temp is fairly low at the moment, as it's a basement and it's like -10c outside right now.",rooms maybe 20ish.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

generally arc control is.. okay.,it's just okay.,being prompted for uac and having focus changed to arc control every time on startup is kind of irritating but that's a known issue.,"for overclocking, it would be nice if the projected clock speed/voltage curve was actually charted out while you were adjusting the settings, so it's easier to understand what setting actually does what.",otherwise i'm actually really happy with the oc controls.,oc via curve is much better than fixed clock.,only thing we're missing is that chart and fan control.,"otherwise, is there any possibility of having arc control changed from an overlay to a normal program window?","if i had to give an example, radeon crimson is probably the best driver suite out right now.","sits in the taskbar, opens when clicked on, goes away when not needed.","you can click past it, screenshot it easily etc.",all things arc control struggles with while presenting as an overlay right now.,"i don't mind notifications if devices change, rebar is suddenly disabled for any reason etc.",but those need on/off controls too.,"right now it's global off, or studio/hotkey reminders settings.",the performance overlay is excellent.,wouldn't mind settings to adjust its opacity or change the corner of the screen it occupies though.,adding cpu clock speed to it would also be a good idea.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"it's ok i guess, but it doesn't do the things that it does particularly well.","for starters, it would be nice to have a windowed mode either instead of or in addition to the overlay.",overclocking is kinda weird.,i'd prefer sliders like those that exist for afterburner and precisionx1.,"as it is, overclocking is a guessing game because you don't really know what you're changing with the performance boost slider.","also it would be nice if drivers could download directly through the application instead of linking to a web page, but that's more of a nitpick.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

dislike it.,a uac prompt shouldn't be needed to open up arc control every time time i need it.,issues with updating via arc control.,wrong gpu detected with arc control.,i have heard multiple issues with arc control as well as these ones.,"in my opinion, all the graphics settings for intel arc control should be moved permanently to the intel graphics command centre and get rid of arc control.",the option of using an overlay should still be available if  the intel graphics command centre.,"driver updates should be able to carried out using either intel graphics command centre or arc control

i like it.,"it could use fan control,  a keyboard shortcut to start recording (it's currently annoying to have to switch to overlay each time).",the performance monitor needs more customization as well as fps and optional frametime graph.,maybe recording these with a shortcut like capframeview and having recommended settings for supported games like gf experience.,"it could also use a notification whenever there is an update and an option to update right in arc control itself, rather than linking to website.",similiar to how competition does.,"it could also stop asking for uac on startup, which it still does on 3802.

"- more granular oc control (clock speed, voltage)
- regular window that minimizes to system tray rather than an overlay
- include all the display settings currently in intel graphics command center
- fan control
- automatic updates (which can be turned off) in the application itself, and the ability to update drivers automatically (not sure why there needs to be a separate support assistant to do this - it should be done through the same application and again, without just linking to the driver page)

at the moment, it feels like it's an alpha; it's not even in a beta state.","it feels very unfinished, like it was done as an afterthought.","i bought the card knowing this was the case, but i'm hoping more development will be done on it until it feels fully baked.",honestly...it feels kinda like the development team had never seen what their competitors' applications looked like.,"rather than trying to reinvent the wheel, take a look at what've been industry standard features for the last decade and figure out how to implement them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

sounds like more a nightmare with ddr5 xmp stability.",just for some reason cannot be completely stable the way ddr4 xmp at 4000/3800 or less gear 1 is.,"&#x200b;

and for those who say well occt is not a realistic test you only need to run cinebench to prove stability.",i disagree especially for whole system an d not just cpu overclock stability.,heck cinebench actually puts more heat and power draw on cpu than occt large data set variable.,i can see the argument for cpu stress testing that prime95 small fft and such is unrealistic and not needed as it puts an unrealistic insane power and heat draw through cpu chip.,occt large data set variable though does not put any insane power draw and if it errors stability is not good even if you are game stable.,this is not at all a comparison to power virus like prime95 small ffts with avx on.,"&#x200b;

and this is memory stability with ddr5 anyways triggering other system related instabilities even if small, t still is not good.",there have been reports afterall of bsods during gaming with ddr5.,"&#x200b;

i think asus is problematic with ddr5 on intel based on my experience.",msi seems ok with certain bios and certain ram kits.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks!,decided to do the same.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're actually right.,"i've failed the tests with prime95 and occt, tried multiple times with xmp i and xmp ii and also with cpu overclocked and without.",tried everything with or without or some.,all failed.,so many errors and bosd.,"in default settings, everything seems to be normal without any single error.",this could be a lead to ddr5 system issues for now.,i will try to overclock the cpu manually and make xmp i or ii compatible with voltages.,i will keep fighting until outcome reveals.,i will update and follow up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just gave up on ddr5 with intel asus boards.,"&#x200b;

i went back to an asus baord, but a ddr4 one in quest to find a coil whine free rtx 4090 setup as almost eveyrine who says they have no coil whine on rtx 4090 even with panel off says they have an asus motherboard.",and ddr5 asus boards are out due to issues i ahve had and you are now having.,"&#x200b;

ddr4 samsung bdie 4000mhz 1.5v cl 15-15-15-35 in gear 1 perfectly stable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would get msi because gigabyte has some serious bios issues currently.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
msi z690-p pro doesn't have a bios flash button?,pretty sure it doesn't.,to run the 13th gen you would need to update the bios with a 12th gen cpu or get microcenter to do it for a fee.,unlikely the bios has been updated at the factory.,gigabyte z690 gaming x ddr4 has a q flash button from the looks of it.,buttons on the mainboard vs the back i/o area.,going through mainboard reviews and stuff will make you nuts.,msi z690-a pro might be ok. bios is apparently hard to navigate.,if your not overclocking etc... could go with a better quality b series board but would definitely need to look at their quality.,see what the prices are on pcpartpicker.,"think of warranty if the boards doa or quirky, chance of getting a returned/customer damaged product (amazon).",can read reviews on amazon and newegg.,look at recent reviews since products change.,buying is usually the best before the products cycle ends.,at the start it's risky and there might be further revisions.,at the very end or after production has stopped for a while the number of defective products might increase.,not sure if they refurbish mainboards and send them out again or test returns and send them out again?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how about the msi tomahawk z690 had a bios flash back and great features.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just got the msi pro-a board.,nobody seems to have anything bad to say about it.,i would pick the a over p due to better vrms.,incidentally i also decided between msi and gigabyte.,"the reason i went with msi was that it was black which looks better in my build and somebody had complained about gigabyte having memory issues, although i expect those have been fixed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"asus, msi, gigabyte, as rock in that order, thats my personal prefernce.",i have had zero issues overclocking the piss out of my 12900k on my rog strix board.,not a huge fan of asus bloat ware armory crate but they build a great mother board with some of the best bios software.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i bought the z690 gaming x ddr4 and a 13700kf this weeks and threw my 3080 12gb in it.,its paired with my existing viper steel dd4 4000 16-16-16 kit and after tweaking the sub timings i am getting fantastic performance for vr sims.,extremely happy with the setup,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™d spend a bit more and get the z690-a which has the better vrms.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
msi a pro if its in your budget.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i went for the ddr4 msi pro z790-a for my 13700k.,from reviews it seems it was more than capable of running the 12900k and the requirements of the 13700k are similar if not lesser.,i haven't assembled the parts yet so this is as much feedback i have for now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just got the z690 gaming x ddr5.,based on what i have watched and read the gigabyte gaming x motherboard has the highest price to performance for the i7 13700k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
donâ€™t go for a gigabyte board.,i got the intel core i9 13700k with the gigabyte z790 ud ax board and it wonâ€™t post using either my rtx 4090 or the on board hdmi.,the vga led on the board is lit solid constantly no matter what i do.,it wonâ€™t even let me flash over a new bios.,so stay away from gigabyte boards.,iâ€™m returning mine.,gigabyte support are as useful as apple support - completely pointless!,iâ€™m starting to think the cpu is just to new yet and only a handful of mobos will support it out the box.,obviously you donâ€™t want to go back in tier mobo wise as you want the best features available.,if your going to spend 300 or 400 bucks on a mobo youâ€™d think it would be ready for these chips.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
read/watch  reviews and decide.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
like what you can't just say that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do they?,i bought a gigabyte z690 aorus elite ax recently.,i flashed the bios using q-flash plus and then put a 13700k in it and it's been flawless.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">msi tomahawk z690

>msi pro-a board.,"yeah my board currently for my 9700k is a msi mpg z390 gaming edge ac and i love it, hate how i have to change boards everytime i want to upgrade just my cpu.",i love intel but despise how they changed chipsets like its candy unlike amd.,i'd be fine with buying like a lga cpu adapter like how cpu coolers have lga 1700 adapter kits.,companies should look into that if it's at any way possible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yup strix any day of the week,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

good luck in this day and age of motherboard prices.,sub 200 is basic entry level very minimal oc if at all.,if you're getting a 13700k i'd spend more on a board.,if you switch to 13600k then yeah fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hmm i don't really mess with bios all that much i usually just leave it at turning xmp on.,"i may undervolt the cpu and tighten timings, oc ram but not sure.",is the board that big of an issue or would it mainly be one if i were to be a real in depth with every aspect of my components?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is it the same board?,"which bios version, is anyone else reporting the problems?","that's what i was looking for not just the opinions or anecdotal evidence from ""some person""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got the 13700k on the 28th with the gigabyte z690 gaming x ddr4 so far its been pretty great!,"just combating the temps right now, for some reason when gaming my ""current"" temps are at about 80c using hwinfo64 but something makes it spike up to maximum of around 97c and says i thermal throttled (for a split second).","outside of that minor issue, everything is going great.",probably just have to limit the cpu to around 225w since some light testing with various watts shows that to be alright.,"cooler: deepcool ak620

"well, undervolting did not work on 20a.",it might be fixed on 20b.,but in any case i have lost my temper with gigabyte support.,there has not been a working bios release in 6 months or so.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all z690/z790 boards.,it's been confirmed by support.,"yes, other people have the same issues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you have any problem with booting with that combo?,"also, did you flash a new bios update?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"uh it was a slight pain q flashing the bios but i think i was doing it wrong outside of that no issues, also nah i'm still on f20b bios everything has been fine so i don't really want to mess with it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have that bios flashing issue rn.,could you tell me how you did it.,i'm really frustrated.... did you have the parts in place?,how long did it take to update?,how did you name your file and what kind of usb stick did you use to update it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have exact same components,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i am kind of blanking on what i did exactly (edit below i remembered i think), but i believe what i did was download the bios, tossed it on a drive and renamed the filename gigabyte and took the drive put it into the port labeled bios and i hit that white little button either once or i held it.",then i believe the indicator turned on and it began to work.,"should essentially look like this which i'm sure you already seen [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cqlyrokj\_q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cqlyrokj_q)

**imporatnt edit!!!!!!!!",:** i think i remembered what i did.,"i **didn't** turn on the computer, i instead had the motherboard hooked up but didn't hit the on button what i did was **hit the white flash button whilst computer was off** and it turned everything on itself.",what i was doing before was turning on the computer then hitting the flash button which i believe was wrong.,sidenote: nothing appears on the screen to indicate it downloading it's just the flashing you have to go on if its working or not.,sidenote 2: make sure usb is formatted correctly i believe it needs to be in fat32?,but google around to make sure that is correct,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you plug in everything while you did the update?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nope didn't plug anything in whilst update was going once it was finished i plugged in a single monitor and see if it went into bios which it did then i began plugging everything in, closed the case, and called it a day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this will sound crazy but i had similar issue and had to loosen my cpu cooler mounting due to board/socket flex.,initially i was only able to even post to bios with 1 stick of ram and only in the far left slot.,"i began to loosen my waterblock a few quarter turns at a time until i could boot with the stick of ram in the correct slot #2, then til i could get second stick of ram to post in slot #4.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

found it 102 p core.,69 e core.,my e core seems absurdly bad?,13700k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i donâ€™t think so .,when i first tried it in my z690 i had a sp score of 121 and when i switched it in my z790 i had a sp score of 125 .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah they are.,itâ€™s a bios glitch.,once you update bios you have to remove your cpu and put it back in and youâ€™ll get the real score.,mine was sp125 then i updated it and removed the cpu and reinstalled it and i got the real sp score of sp103.,on overclockers.,com one of the main ocâ€™ers has tested about 100 chips and the highest real sp he got was 118. he was the one that posted you need to update bios and then remove and reinstall to get actual number.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
flash the latest bios (2103 or 2201beta) and update me firmware.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hey bud ya he messaged me he was able to get the latency down to 60 ns from 70 .,think he's shooting for 50 ns.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how do you even cool a 13900k at 1.45v?,:o are you running direct-die cooling?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so i guess e core sp score does matter even if you disable the e-waste cores and use p cores only but want to overclock p cores as much as possible with lowest voltage and best thermals as possible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah it's probably a pressure issue... many asked if i had a 1700 frame installed and indeed i have one installed... i might give the stock ilm a try and test it out... i swapped my tuf to an apex board and i got 6600 c30 out of a 6000 c40 kit which was like exactly what the previous owner of the mobo/ram achieved with his 12900k...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

with e-cores off the 13900k is a super 8 core 16 thread chip quite a bit better in fact than the 7700x as the p cores of intel are better than amd zen 4 at same clock speed and they clock higher too.","update:

well someone over at [overclock.net](https://overclock.net) did say that somehow thee-cores being off totally did hurt single thread performance due to some arch change or arch and having 1 e-core on gets rud of that.",i tested that on win10 and got same exact cpu-z and cinebench single core score so did not see this bug.,"&#x200b;

though here is the thing:

&#x200b;

apparently the thread director causes issues and starts doing everything wrong with e-cores disabled.","&#x200b;

unfortunately you cannot disabled the thread director.","however if you use win10, the thread director is effectively disabled as win10 cannot interact with it.",so this issue appears on 12th gen as well.,so with win10 it should not be a problem at all with all e-cores off on 12th or 13th gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

**affected 3rd party software version**: microsoft windows 10 build 19044

**issue**:

reproduction steps:

- boot a virtualized windows 10 with arc a770 (vfio)
- install the intel arc dch drivers for windows, including arc control and the intel driver & support assistant
- verify that the a770 is now detected in the windows device manager and arc control
- verify that sensors, performance tuning features, 3d acceleration, and compute all work as expected.","all of the above should work fine; but now onto the issue:

- notice that any monitors connected to the a770 are not receiving a display signal
  - expected behavior: all connected monitors receive a display signal
- go to windows display settings and notice that none of the physical monitors plugged into the a770 are detected
  - expected behavior: all connected monitors are detected
- under the ""multiple displays"" heading in display settings, click the ""detect"" button and notice the ""didn't detect another display"" error
  - expected behavior: if no monitors were detected at this point, they would be detected and start receiving video signals after clicking the ""detect button""

**have you done any troubleshooting?",can you reproduce the issue?,"**

the issue always occurs; it is not flaky.","what works:

- using the same setup with an amd rx 570
- using the same setup with an nvidia rtx 3080
- using the same setup in a non-virtualized environment (i.e.","the same exact os image running on bare metal)

what doesn't work:

- using driver 31.0.101.3490
- using an ubuntu 22.04 guest with the official backported kernel+userland here: https://dgpu-docs.intel.com/installation-guides/ubuntu/ubuntu-jammy-arc.html (same issue; no video out)
- physically unplugging and replugging the monitors from the a770
- using another displayport port on the a770
- any variation or simplification of the physical display topology
- any variation of the host configuration (i have truly tried everything)
- fresh windows 10 install",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

running a basic test without changing any settings, it runs for the full 10 minutes, about 21 passes, and scores 30500.

7000+ tuned ddr5 beats tuned ddr4.,"anything at xmp is meh, 6000xmp is about on par with 3600cl16.",the only reason to stay on ddr4 is if you already have 4000+ low timings stuff.,"regarding prices, all xmp does is give you factory overclocked ram that you can do yourself on a cheap kit with the same ram chips, mainly referred to as ics (i don't know what ic stands for though).","7600+ stuff is hynix a die, you can get that on 6000 kits at the lowest and overclock it yourself.","you can also get hynix m die which is the second best ddr5 for cheap on 4800 kits which can overclock to around 7000-7200, and usually with better timings than a die.","theres plenty of resources available online to help identify which kts have which ics, paying loads of money for ram just isnt worth it.","i currently run a ballistix max 4400 kit at 4900cl17 gear 2, just because my 12600k imc is shit and only goes up to 3800 on gear 1. other people with the same ram have managed 4133 cl14, but this purely depends on getting a good imc on the cpu.","whether its better or worse i don't know, i'm waiting for a new case to release soon and then use a new z790 ddr4 board and likely going to overspend on a 13900ks next year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

did you use bios flashback to install a 13th gen compatible bios?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i haven't actually.,didn't even know that was a thing.,how do i find the steps to do this?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, a 12th gen motherboard will not work with a 13th gen cpu until an updated bios is installed.","thankfully, your board has bios flashback, so you do not need to install a 12th gen cpu to do this.","you will need a usb stick to do this, and itâ€™s done with the system plugged in but powered off.","https://www.asus.com/support/faq/1038568/

after doing that, do not enable xmp.","install windows* and all critical drivers, then you **must** also update the intel management engine firmware for the system to work correctly.","*if for some reason you canâ€™t get the system to see your ssd on one of the two cpu connected m.2 slots on your board, thatâ€™s a management engine issue.","temporarily install the ssd in a chipset-connected m.2 slot (#3+), install windows and drivers, update the management engine firmware, and then move the ssd to the pcie 4.0 connected slot (i think itâ€™s #2).",do not use the 5.0 slot.,"finally, at this point you can enable xmp and properly configure the system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i did it.,successfully downloaded bios.,but now i'm getting q code 16. for fuck's sake this is so irritating.,"""pre-memory system agent initialization is started""

wtf do i do now?",gonna google.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm honestly so close to just buying a z790 just to be done with this shit.,i'd gladly pay 150 more,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so much work.,will get on that shortly.,i did however find my mobo on the list of z690s that's supposed to already have the 13th gen bios on it.,does that mean anything?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"tysm dude, you saved my life",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what list?,is this based on serial number?,itâ€™s possible that z690 boards that are new enough will have a compatible bios already installed.,"in which case different troubleshooting may be needed, but iâ€™d probably still recommend doing the flashback routine as a first step.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gotcha.,"another person suggested just leaving it for a few minutes, since some motherboards take that long to finish the pre-memory cpu initialization.",will try that first since it's easiest.,then i'll work on installing the bios with a flashback.,i got scared when i read i needed another chip,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ddr5 can have a very slow training process.,"so you can leave it on for a couple minutes, but i mean it should be more like 30-60 seconds.",double check that your memory is in the right slots (second and fourth).,also re-plug all motherboard power connectors at both ends.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
will do.,i should mention i was using two sticks of ram.,"when i used 2, i got q code 55. which meant memory wasn't properly installed.","once i removed 1 stick, that's when i got q code 12 for the cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
single stick should be in second slot i believe.,what memory do you have?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

13600k is faster 8% on average over 12700k going by meta analysis.,you can undervolt and get 5% easily with 12700k.,"but you get 2 more p cores with 12700k, that could make a difference down the line if you plan to keep your pc for longer than 4 years.","~~i think we are already seeing benefit of more than 6 p cores.~~

~~kitguru review of 13600k wd legion ultra settings was 20% slower in 1% lows than 12700k.~~

~~hub sm-remastered ultra raytracing the 13600k was 10% slower in 1% lows.~~

~~in both scenarios 13700k was 15% faster in 1% lows over 12700k.","which would point to core differences limitation  over architecture differences (especially as 13gen was more cache and in other benchmarks was faster).~~

obviously this is on 1080p and 1440p at 4k there is no difference even vs zen 3.
  

if you game mainly, then what use are the faster cores, if you run out of them.",then you are forced to upgrade like you would run out of ram or vram on gpu.,you get stutter experience in certain cpu bottleneck scenarios.,but when you get them it ruins your experience.,"but it also depends on price if 12700k is same price as 13600k, get it.","but if it's a lot more, then that is pointless as that money is better spend on future platform upgrades (cost of mobo).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nope.,it's 300 vs 340,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a 13600k is at least 25% more expensive where i live.,"i just bought a 12600k for 300â‚¬, and the 13600k can't be found anywhere for less than 395â‚¬.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the pc shop i buy the mobo from takes care of the update, it's fine",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your not alone.,these new chips and even gpus i mainly prefer to undervolt them as stock boost clocks get so close to what you can get on reasonable cooling with an oc it's just not worth it as much anymore.,especially on these cpus that are bouncing into their thermal limit sometimes undervolting ends up with a free performance bump,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 13600k one of the few chips that worth ocing because some of the clock speed down-binning is artificial due to shutoff cores instead of silicon quality of the functional cores.,many of them should be able to do 5.5ghz p-core with 4.3+ e-core and 4.8+ ring.,13700k is a lot more likely to be a disqualified 13900k due to silicon quality and 13900k is already clocked to the moon with the best chips reserved for 13900ks so not much more oc room on those.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most of the people have always been leaving settings at stock and oc has always been a hobby.,these days there is less oc headroom though than there used to be as the manufacturing processes are better and thus there is less variation in silicon quality.,additionally the manufacturers have learned product segmentation to take the remaining quality differences into account and prebinning silicon.,the general outcome is that there is less to be gained.,having said all that.,"i have always oc:d my cpu, sometimes gpu and ram also.","when there is pretty free performance on the table (""free"" in meaning that i do not oc to the level where the power consumption really shoots up), why not take it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're right.,"i always oc'd my cpu's in the past, but i don't care anymore.",even bought a non k variant as my last cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
now cpus and gpus overclock on their own!,"if there is a thermal headroom they will continue to boost high, until it gets hot or power throttles, otherwise , yes overclocking is more of a hobby and benchmarking",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm not sure if you should be drawing that conclusion based on the data you are citing.,"in both cases the 13600k is also slower than the 12600k, which seems to indicate there is more going on in those results than just 6 p cores vs 8 p cores.","https://www.techspot.com/review/2555-intel-core-i5-13600k/

its a lot of cpu for 40$.,well worth it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"even more yes, in that case.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
actually a 13600k with a b660 board could be cheaper than a 12600k with a z board and it smokes it even without oc.,there is zero reason to go for a 12600k now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

he's definitely not alone.,i'm pretty sure that the %'s of enthusiasts that oc nowadays is lower than it was 5+ years ago.,"for me, the extra noise, power/heat just give enough fps to be worth it.","i'd rather undervolt, and bring power/temps, and noise even lower.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,the 12600k hits 4.5 all core.,an easy oc gets 5.1ghz all core.,that is a worthwhile oc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"you missed my point, 12700k has 8 p cores which has potential that could help down the line over 6 p cores.","while in totalt it's only 8% slower, a difference which could be easily made up with simple offset undervolting.",any 12700k can do 5.0ghz p cores (down from 4.7ghz) and a good bin can do 5.4ghz.,looking at benchmarks from frame chasers when oced to max potential 13600k is basically equal to 12700k in performance.,"while again, emphasizing that with 12700k you get 2 more p cores.","as said already it's like with ram or vram, it's bad when you run out of resources.","you just get a stutter and what use are e cores, if for gaming you run out of p cores.","personally rather have 8% slower pc, when uv is equal even, but it has potential to not ""die"" on me in 4+ years and forcing me to upgrade to at least 8 cores to not get stutter in cpu bottleneck scenarios.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ty!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep you used to be able to gain more on overclock years ago but overtime boost algorithms and binning have brought us to where overclocking is much less worthwhile,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you are absolutely correct, the only thing is that it worthwhile for benchmarks results, otherwise the in real life scenarios i highly doubt that it is worth itâ€¦older cpus were able to benefit from overclocking and it would actually results in a feel-able performance gainâ€¦the only thing to do in modern cpus if you are not overclocking as a hobby, is to remove power limits , otherwise intel and amd already squeezing all the performance out of their cpus and the only way to get more performance between generation is to improve the ipc and the cache as well as performance plus physical cores, and definitely frequency, so it have to be all combined to feel that the cpu is actually faster than last generation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks.,i got that deal but i could only buy one :(  so i still need to figure out a cpu for the second build iâ€™m doing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> 12700k has 8 p cores which has potential that could help down the line over 6 p cores.,that's not how it works.,"cpu limitations fall into two groups:

1. single thread performance limited
2. multi thread performance limited

in the case of #1, the 13600k has a significant advantage thanks to higher boost clocks.","in the case of #2, the 13600k still has an advantage thanks to more e-cores and higher clock speeds.","the only software that scales to a certain number of threads, and no further, are old and poorly written.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is exactly how it works.,"you even confirmed it, 12700k has potential to out last 13600k due to mt performance of p cores.",for example st performance of 13600k p cores according to cb23 is 2050 per core x 6 times = 12300 available performance of p cores.,st performance of 12700k is 1950 per core x 8 times = 15600 the sum performance of p cores.,"12700k has 25% more performance avilable to it from p cores, with uv it becomes 30%, as p performance jumps up to around same level as 13600k.","when a game will want to use more than sum  performance of 13600k p cores can provide, it will have to go to e cores.",while the 12700k will still have 25-30% resources available with its sum of p cores without having to go to e cores.,going to e cores incur a latency penalty (due to layout) and also e cores being less powerful.,that is why it's said that e cores are uslees for gaming.,"that is also why like with 4 old cores cpu get stutter in certain cpu limited scenarios, as you need more than 4 cores can provide or you get stutter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"raptor lake has fixed the e-core latency, there's no penalty when e-cores are in use.",> that is why it's said that e cores are uslees for gaming.,and you've been wrong since the release of alder lake.,"2p + 8e is better for games than 4p + 0e

> that is also why like with 4 old cores cpu get stutter in certain cpu limited scenarios, as you need more than 4 cores can provide.","multi-core isn't a goal, it's a means to an end.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are perfect case of 2 people watching same video and coming to different conclusions.,"i would guess you are refering to hub video
 https://youtu.be/wqb96bdsb4m

but i guess you skipped what steve said or just had lapse in memory, he was disaapointed with e cores, go to 11:20 min.",so even the host had different opinion than you.,"in many case 4 p cores were faster than 2 p 8 e cores too, so i don't know where you got the data from.","plus he was disappointed that *when 4 p cores of 12900k hit 100% utilization in hitman, adding 8 e cores did not help!","*

so there goes your *theory* that e cores help.",i rather have more p cores and have definite assurance (if needed) that they will be useful if such situation arises.,"especially like said that with small uv, you get same performance of 12700k (you can uv offset even on b660).",rather than have less of p cores for 8% performance and suffer consequences of having to upgrade sooner based on *speculation* that e cores may or not help.,video comparison of 13600k vs 12600k p cores vs e cores and disabling them.,in all situations running only on p cores were faster over p + e cores.,"https://youtu.be/fl1zydhjera


so yeah my evidence confirms further what i said.",i think we concluded the topic.,"if you still disagree, then just agree to disagree.",different philosophy.,"i will continue to recommend people 12700k over 13600k (at simlar price), if they plan to keep their system for longer time.",it's a valid choice from my perspective.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"12700k has jumped in price, its like â‚¬70 premium over the 13600k and the 13600k is like a â‚¬100 premium over the 12600k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then 12700k is not worth it.,"but 13600k over 12600k, definitely is.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"to be a bit more realistic: of course you can cool 300 watt of power dissipation, that's not that much.",a modern gpu can go to 700watt and they are air cooled.,"the actual problem is that the vast majority of coolers are designed for something like 150 watt, they use a couple heat pipes to a air cooler or a tiny pump to a huge radiator.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for the answer!,will take my time to decide what cooling solution to choose.,for the moment i limited the power to 253 watts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hi there, i just purchased this chip - how do i actually limit the watts used by the chip?",i have a d15 and it's rated to cool ~220 watts.,"sorry for the question, just trying to get my temps under control",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you have the 253 watts limitation on?,what temperatures you get on full load?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's horrible .. it uses a tiny baby pump that barely manages to cool 100watt, not to speak about 250-300.  
it comes with a radiator that could cool 1000 watt and doesn't get more than warm because of the low flow rates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have the same cooler and a i7-13700k and it almost instantly is pegging out on r23 runs.,"what tim did you use, and did you use the new mounting hardware or the legacy?",any power limits on your motherboard?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for the answer!,i have limited the power draw to 253 watts and will upgrade the cooling soon.,"so far it performs relatively the same, but with lower temperatures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great suggestion!,will do that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for the answer!,limited the power draw to 253 watts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if i leave it unlimited it goes beyond 300 watts.,"wonder where it would stop if you can keep it really cool, i guess using custom cooling with liquid nitrogen would tame this cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with any af  aio you can call it a minute.,they have pumps designed for 100watt continuous power usage combined with radiators good for a whole apartment heating solution.,but on the bright side: they have lots of leds instead of a proper pump.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah it's a wild chip.,it took me sometime to realize that it wasn't plug n play like your usual chip.,this one wants to run as wild as you will let it.,a lot of that has to do with the motherboards encouraging unlimited pl1 pl2 settings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we need better off the shelf cooling solutions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or a bad ihs...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what did you choose?,i am looking into this myself right now and i thought the ls520 would be a good decision.,only have the possbility of 240mm aio because of my case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which motherboard do you have?,i ask because in your bios there are two settings and they may be name differently depending on who made your motherboard.,the official name for these two options is pl1 and pl2.,"power limit 1 and power limit 2.

so in your bios you may see them.",they can also be called long duration power limit and short duration power limit on msi boards.,from those names you can kind of guess what they are.,this is where we define the wattage limits for the cpu.,the short duration power limit (pl2) is the wattage your cpu can run at for a short period of time before it switches to the long duration power limit (pl1).,"once it switches to pl1, it will run at pl1 for a period of time (that you can define in the bios) before it switches back to pl2.",these help keep the cpu running cool while also running as fast as possible as it cycles between short bursts of more power and longer periods of lower power.,"ok... 

so what do you do?",set pl1 and pl2 to 253w.,that's the intel spec.,the cpu will handle the rest.,"actually you could set pl1 to 125w and pl2 to 253w to really match the intel spec but you wont be happy with it because how you set the pl1 and pl2, has an effect on the way the cpu boosts it's core speed.","if you set pl1 to 125w, and pl2 to 253w, you likely wont see 5.5ghz often during all core usage because the cpu will be very conservative with it's boost clocks.",so try pl1 253w and pl2 253w and check the frequencies of the cores and temperature of your cpu while running cinebench r23.,use hwinfo to monitor the cpu package temp and the core frequencies as it renders on all cores.,"if it hits 100c immediately when rendering in cinebench... dont worry, the cpu will handle it and throttle accordingly.",the trick is to find a pl1 and pl2 that fits your cooling capability while also getting the most performance out of the cpu while observing it's boost behavior.,a lower short duration pl2 value is going to limit how fast your cpu will boost.,you may want to go higher than 253w.,"many of us with aios are running with unlimited pl1/pl2 because it lets the cpu run as fast as it can, while the aios keep it at just about 100c.",so find the balance for your cooler.,play with the pl1 and pl2 settings.,start with 253/253 and test.,from there you can adjust the cpu lite load mode.,if you have a good motherboard with a powerful vrm you can possibly lower the cpu lite mode value from the default (auto) to a couple steps lower to keep your cpu cooler while not hurting performance and stability.,"some of the motherboards with more power vrms can delivery more than enough power, and in some cases a little too much by default, so cpu lite load can be changed to bring the voltage down during cpu lite loads.","remember if your cpu defaults to lite load mode 9... try mode 8, or 7. dont go up in value.",that is going the wrong direction :) also dont go to low or else your system wont be stable.,try one step down first.,this will help keep your cpu a little cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i didn't make any changes in my bios before i ran tests.,"cinebench was 38,404 and temps were in mid-to-upper 80â°c range.","i was going to disable mce and the intel adaptive boost technology, but so far i haven't seen the need to.",edit: not sure if those temps are accurate though.,i was getting them from armoury crate.,"however, the cinebench score was correct.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how does one do this??,?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you do that?,i was also looking into that!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not sure i follow your not so obvious ""complaint"" here, but you should definitely reach out to steve and tell him how improper the af design is, as he seems to rate af better than most others:

...and as to leds?","af = the least gimmicky aios, no?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the great detailed answer!,i have an msi pro z790a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mine does not go higher than 35000 in cinebench r23 with temperatures sitting around 83â°c.,do not understand the low score in cinebench though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you ever figure out how to limit the power draw in on an asus z690 mobo with a thermal grizzly contact frame with a corsair 360aio and iâ€™m still seeing temperatures on the package of 80+ im only using this machine for gaming.,any tips for reducing temperatures would be appreciated.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have no doubt that steve from gamers nexus is aware of that, he is one of the few non idiot reviewers out there.",but he is comparing available coolers and most coolers are as horrible as the af2's or worse due to bad mounting or even worse pumps.,"that video was 2 years ago, so afaik there are 2 or 3 with significantly better pumps out now.",just look at the tiny size of the pump of the af2's.,the only thing that transports pumps from the cooling block to the radiator is the micro-pump.,"and on top, the cooling block is pure copper but it's very light, it has barely any thermal storage capacity (copper is expensive) which adds up, more metal in that area would permit the micro pump solution to be a bit better in spiked loads.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fyi: i added an edit to my post while you were responding.,"iâ€™m not sure about my temps, but my scores seem to be what i should expect so i doubt iâ€™m throttling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you ever figure this out?,"if using an asus mobo, you may have the 90c throttle turned on within the auto setting of mce.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"show me a better aio for the $105 i paid for my afii 280 then...

my 13700k idles at 30-32c, games at 50c max, cinebench at 60, and any other synth cpu test tops out at 70c...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what aio do you suggest with a decent pump and radiator to outdo a liquid freezer ii 360?,"mine is not cutting it due to low flow, and almost instantly goes to 100c on cenibench.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as an update: i upgraded my lf2 360 with the new gasket and heat spreader, i also added 3 additional pull fans on the radiator that ramp up to 100% if the heat increases too much.","(so a total of 6 now)_x000d_

"i didn't like any in the market right now, it's relatively new that cpus go to 300+w so the coolers are just not ready yet.","i'd recommend at least a 360 radiator, drawing cool air is also a bonus.","a batch of the lf2s have a bad seal and build some slime and gunk inside, you should check if yours is affected.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'd avoid getting g.skills's 5600/6000 c36 or c40 ram kits because of all the reports of instability specifically on those kits.,"if you really like the design of those kits, go for their c28/c30 bins which are hynix, or just buy from an alternative brand and save the cash.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'd say it depends on the prices.,from where will you buy?,do you just want what's best for the money or do you want value for your money?,do you care about the aesthetics of the ram?,most likely the best choice will be to find a ram kit that is on sale.,32 gb ram is more than plenty for anyone who doesn't do heavy workload tasks.,"hell even 16 gb is, but imo if buying now might as well go for 32 gb as some newer games sometimes are pushing the ram",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the most important thing is to buy two sticks, not four.",kingston fury beast should also be good hynix dies.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you need 64gb because if you don't 2x16gb has better performance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"bro i got the gskills 6000 cl36, previously i got corsair dominator 5600mhz cl36 those where running  flawlessly but i saw this gskill kit on sale on newegg , donâ€™t recommend ,  games crashing out of nowhere, did some research after i got em and i see a lot of people with the same issue , returning them and getting the corsair kit back",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
use corsair vengeance or dominator platinum or use kingston fury beast for your build i myself i use corsair vengeance ram i have that kind in mine even though i have ddr4 being the sddm or 128gb and being that in 4 sticks of 32gb at 2666mhz i have that brand in my laptop that is a special edition asus rog mother ship laptop tablet and i swapped out the stock for that kind and the thing runs so fast that the games have no lag and it boots in 8 seconds so if i was you use corsair vengeance ram cause it is the best one out there for fast speeds and for hard core gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
here's a [review from march](https://babeltechreviews.com/fast-ram-makes-a-difference-in-gaming-6-kits-30-games/) that compares 5 ddr5 kits including the g.skill trident z5 6000mhz cl36 and cl40 and corsair dominator 6400mhz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have never had issues with gskill.,that being said all high speed or oc'ed ddr5 is finicky on z690 motherboards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ye i also hard about this.,"can you give me an "" alternative brand of that"" ?",also with some rgb :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, i live in poland so i will not give u a shop which i m buying from.","but i want best what i can get, around 400 euros, even 500. i have read that there is a problem with 6000 mhz speed,  is that true?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i consider to get the g skill as i mentioned , also something with rgb :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nah, i just wanted 64 gb to fill 4 slots in motherboard",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so basically you recommend corsair dominator 5600 cl 36?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that was me until i bought three kits of trident z5 6000mhz cl36/40's.,all of them were horribly unstable ootb on my (then) z690 apex.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"kingston fury beast ddr5 rgb, corsair vengeance rgb or corsair dominator rgb, teamgroup delta rgb ddr5 are some you can consider",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no no no - seriously, please donâ€™t try to do that.",you will cripple your maximum achievable speeds.,"if you require 64gb for a legitimate reason, you would want 2x32gb.",otherwise just stick to 2x16gb.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then get 2x16,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
definitely over the gskill 6000 cl36,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"weird thing is my g skill trident z5 6000 cl40's are running flawlessly at xmp, i've got z790 (gigabyte aero g so nothing special although great value for money) board and a 13700k so that could be a possible explanation if you're on 12th gen with that z690, although not a great one.",and i know i'm 3 months late so a bios update could've done it before i actually purchased my 13700k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was also thinking about corsair vengeance.,is 5200 mhz enough ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes sir, i'm gonna go for 32 gb :).",what ram do you recommend best for value?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5600 cl36 is more like a sweetspot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you want to stick with g skill get the 6400cl32 kit.,it's hynix and even if you can't get those speeds you can run it at 6000 or 5600 with extremely tight timings.,plus as the imc improves with future cpus and better motherboards you can get it to 7000.  on good boards and good imcs - overclockers are getting those speeds right now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

depends on the budget but the 13700k is the best value and you can use a good 280mm aio and apply a slight oc to even increase more performance.,unless the i9 is in the budget.,"beside that i recommend going for ddr5 as more applications or games benefit from the bandwidth, i upgraded from 2x16gb ddr4 3600 to 2x16gb ddr5 6000mhz and the system in overall feels alot smoother and snappier.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the i9 13900 will give you about 5% more fps than the i7 13700 according to the youtube tests.,so it's a question of how much are you willing to pay for he extra fps?,"bear in mind that the i9 is tougher to cool and will use a bit more power - so it's not just the different retail price you have to factor in, you've also got to account for slightly more costly electricity bills!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

a 13600k would be ideal but 250â‚¬ isn't enough for it unless you can get some heavy discounts.,a 12700f is a good cheaper alternative.,if that's still too expensive then go for the 12600k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i think the installers for the 22.180.0 wifi and bluetooth drivers are bugged

for wifi, after upgrading documentation, it shows a generic ""one or more issues caused the setup to fail.","please fix the issues and then retry setup"" error message, with no further details, and the driver didn't actually get updated

for bluetooth, windows freezes during the driver update process, and eventually bsods with an error code about power state failure.","driver also didn't actually get updated

both issues still happened even after deleting all the wifi/bt drivers off device manager.","interestingly, trying to run older installers after erasing all previous wifi/bt drivers somehow the installers claim that downgrade is not allowed.",what ended up working for me was going to intel's website to download the zip of inf driver files for 22.180.0 and manually apply them from device manager,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this was not it for me.,i found out it was what is called in the intel xtu tool is called active core tuning.,itâ€™s purpose is to limit the max freq when multiple cores are active so that you can have a higher freq when only one or two are active.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

another setting that forces all core cpu boost is the high performance power plan for windows since it forces a 100% minimum cpu state",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just tried that and did nothing :'(,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
set it to balanced.,in ~~max~~ high performance it will stay turboâ€™d at 5.5ghz.,edit: forgot the correct name of the profile.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well that's your problem..  max performance will peg your cpu at the highest clock speeds all the time.,you need to use balanced mode if you want dynamic clock speed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"is the ""minimum processor state"" on your active plan a value other than 100%?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
use hwinfo64,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just know that they named their cpus kf for a reason... or any other skew for that matter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" nope, did nothing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

can you see something in this ?,https://imgur.com/a/kvxovad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, because the igpu is disabled!",nothing to do with the cpu cores,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so that was only one of the reasons.,are speedstep and c-states enabled in efi?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you tried more than 1 program to verify the issue is that the clock speeds are stuck at 5.5 and not that the program is faulty?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you changed the minimum from 20% to 100% that's the cause of the cpu not downclocking.,set the plan to balanced and reset its settings.,this will rule out anything power plan related and see if it fixes this behavior.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"run it again, sensors only",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you know what good quality binned chip means?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

itâ€™s never a good idea to pair a k series cpu with a bx60 series board.,"there are a couple of halfway decent ones, but they do lack ddr5 and pcie 5. and bios flashback for 13th gen. there are also some middling ones that should be able to manage a 13600k without significantly throttling power, however they likely still lack bios flashback which makes them a bad choice for 13th gen at this time.","honestly, if youâ€™re on a budget, just get a decent z690 like the msi z690-a.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for this reply bud.,i don't really intend to overclock as honestly the gains are low.,but cost/performance the 13600k reigns king,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

your main priority should be having bios flashback.,"if i recall well, the bazooka does not have that feature.","if you dont have an updated bios, your pc wont post",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"but if they can update it in store with 12th gen cpu before me buying it, then it would be okay, right?",i am more concerned about that board having good enough vrm so that 13600k can be fully utilized.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

how is it?,jumping from a 9900k myself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

just wondering how effective your aio is the way you have mounted it ðÿ¤” no bubbling or whining sounds?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"assuming the 13000 series is better i'll probably get one of those with my existing ddr4 as an upgrade from the 9900k, although if its close performance wise the 12900k might be the way to go for maxing out the ddr4 generation until ddr5 becomes more cost effective.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m at 5 years on a 7600k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what case is that?,itâ€™s hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i loved my upgrade from an i7 4770k to my i7 12700k.,now if only my radeon drivers wouldn't crash from literally everything since i have an rx 5700xt.,it will crash even from chrome,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the struggle is real ðÿ¤“ðÿ˜ž,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i upgraded from 6500 to 12900ks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so .. ummm  how do i get my gpu to sit like that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's a mighty hefty upgrade, but unless you're doing work that specifically needs more cores/threads or gaming above 1080p, don't expect to notice much of a difference.","but if you're say, encoding video or doing a lot of adobe premiere n stuff..hold onto your butts ðÿ˜ž",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
â€œfinallyâ€?,lmao what?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just went from an i7-4930k with a gtx770 to i5-11600k and an rtx 3060ti.,got the rtx3060ti off a friend who dipped out for amd for $400.,my jaw dropped when i could finally play cod warzone!,lol!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
on the eve of 13th gen launch?,have they started discounting 12th gen already for the launch?,ill probably go 12th gen if they are going cheap,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well that was a waste of money...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

but why?,"the 9900 is still an awesome cpu, and it will be for at least another 7 years imo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are making 3years sound like a miserable time...for no reason,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rocking my 9900k as well.,"everytime i feel like upgrading i just think ""damn this thing is still kicking ass though"".",easily gonna keep it for another 2 years so and make it 5+!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've recently upgraded from the i9 9900k to i5 12600k.,temps wayyyyyy lower.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9700k @ 5.0 checking in.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

absolutely agree.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
agreed.,i will be rocking my 9900k for a while.,maybe 2025 or so.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
these upgrade posts always confuse me a little when the hardware that's being upgraded is still perfectly good.,i went from a 4690k to a 3800x and i have no plans on upgrading in the next couple of years at least.,"not that i can't afford it, but swapping hardware is too much of a pain for a benefit that i may not see with current gpus at all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same.,iâ€™m going to milk it for another two generations.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
me too :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
especially if you're gaming at 1440p +.,9900k will still last.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the kf is baller.,that dead silicon inside acts as a heatsink and allows better oc.,"iâ€™m running 5.2ghz on a 280mm radiator, 4.7ghz cache and 4266mhz ddr4.",itâ€™s smoking fast.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
had my 9900k since 2018 and honestly its showing its age atm.i play at  1440p 144+ fps and it can show its age in certain cpu heavy games like wh3/cyberpunk and any cpu heavy games really.,i've heard of ppl switching  from 9900k>12900k for cyberpunk and they noticed less stutters overall from the switch.games are just getting huge these days.especially if you play on a 144hz monitor which requires a beefy cpu to keep 1%s up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"great is a big stretch, even a $100 quadcore i3-12100f outperforms a 9900k in gaming, and isn't too far off in multithreaded performance.",and the i3-12100 will be replaced in a month.,"as someone that previously had a 9700k, 9th gen definitely is showing its age.","i wouldn't pair it with a new upper class gpu, or use it for 1080p gaming.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it depends.. it looks nice but still both processors are way too hot :) 12900ks is a mess actually, i didn't expect those 80+ temps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm not a fan of rgb of any kinds.,it's childish imo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is how it should be.,it works fine for 6-8 years.,some people treat pc building as a hobby and they build it every year or every two years and that's fine for them but that shouldn't be a standard practice.,( my personal opinion ),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

for real.,i keep looking to upgrade to an 11th gen i7 but i'm currently running a 10th gen i5 and i can't justify the price.,figured i'll just stick with the 10600kf for a whiiiiile.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
always kind of funny seeing posts and/or comments like these.,"""i finally upgraded after three years..."" and of course it was upgrading over a platform that's new or relevant for that time.",i just went from a 4770k to a 12600k myself.,eight years of use as my primary and it just became my backup/travel pc.,like you i fully intend to use the 12600k for 6+ years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's why 12 series is on sale.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
true but op still gets to enjoy it today,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it think there will be little difference like it was between 10 to 11 series.,clean and nice setup btw.,":)

p.s: watch out to fully plug in the pci cable to gpu, one of 6+2 pin isn't fully plugged in.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
agreed.,op totally wasted his money when a 13900k is launching very soon.,he already had a 9900k so could certainly afford to wait a month.,how impatient can he be?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
crazy hot mess even on 360 aio.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fractal design flex b-20.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bench-wise the difference is humongous.,but for gaming it's enough 9900k for sure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
<3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not really, the 9900k is valued at like $300.",i'd be surprised if you could do anything more than browse google on a $300 laptop.,"or if you want to go for original retail, still $550 is a stretch for a gaming laptop.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"auto oc is a bloody joke, true.",my 9900k was delidded and even being on 360 ekwb aio it was hot as well.,"no way i can delid 12900ks, it's way too risky.",derbauer killed his 12900k :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
anyone got a thread for me to oc?,9900k with auros ultra gaming motherboard?,z390 i think?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my happiness is immeasurable and my day is made :) gotta research that bios that three times more complicated than the old one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
may i ask why you're doing this upgrade when the 13900k is probably coming out in a month?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i upgraded from 6500 to 12900ks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it can,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's waaay cooler.,i sustain 5200mhz with 75c+- in cinebench unlike **delidded** 9900k that was 80+ hotter.,"the thing is my 12900ks vcore is 1.22v on 5200mhz, 9900k - 1.315v 5000mhz.",the difference is obvious.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"nah, no need to wait forever.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i know intel's changed since the days of 10th and 11th gen but i seriously doubt a noticable performance difference between a 12900k and a 13900k.,9th to 12th is a major difference but it's practically the same difference that can be seen from 11th to 12th.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ek, bruh /flex",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no need to wait forever :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's even good for 4k.,depends on your gpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
correct.,the above thing is a remote for the mobo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think the 9900k was easily the best gaming cpu in the past 5-7 years.,"i have a 7700k and it is about to reach its limits now (hence in-line for an upgrade), though i'm still mostly gpu limited (3080 vr).",a 9900k will easily last years before feeling obsolete.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
im rocking a 8400,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

bro 8700k at 5ghz crying in the back,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 9700k was great!,i used one for a few months but found it not to be enough of an upgrade over my 5ghz 2600k so i sold it for msrp and got a 9900kf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why did you upgrade then?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep same.,2025 at best.,"i've never, in any game topped out the cpu.",and work is all migrated to gpu these days,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have a 9900k and iâ€™m trying to think when i should upgrade, maybe 4 years from now?",it does get really hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the pc i built for my son is running a 9900k oc'd to 5ghz (1.32v) stable ambient temps of 20\~24c and being cooled by an h100i xt using ll120 fans as push config (front mounted 4000d) barely broke 70c in non-real world stress tests... during gaming it averages between 50's\~low 60's.,my daughter's build runs a similar setup but a 9700k also overclocked runs similar temps with an h100i xt with the same fans.,"i believe your motherboard might be the culprit of your temps, normally msi doesn't go nuts in auto oc'ing... (assuming you're not doing it yourself).",they're both running msi boards too z390's.,now the 12900k is a different monster....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what case is that looks so sleek.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yup, literal waste of energy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

nopes.,aio at the top is the way to go imo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no sense in upgrading a cpu every three years but i guess some people have more money than sense.,"gpus are a different story, i usually buy every generation haha",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"daaaaayum man thanks, wtf i didn't notice this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"actually, no.",13700k has same core count as 12900k and likely have higher clocks.,that didn't happen between 10 and 11 where actually core count decreased from 10900k to 11900k.,13900k will be one tier higher than 12900k.,13700k will beat 12900k and so on.,so i wouldn't buy a 12900k at this point.,better to buy a 13700k in few months.,"i am not talking about gaming benchmarks fyi (not just), but overall perf across the board.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

mine gets hot too and i have the corsair h150 on it.,upgrading is up to you when you feel like your cpu is holding you back.,before the i9 i was on an i5 3570k.,"so about six generations, but i didnâ€™t have a high paying job as i do now.",iâ€™ll see what 14th gen brings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

well it depends.,"if you're doing cpu intensive tasks, an upgrade every couple years usually is quite noticable.",not everyone is using their pc just for gaming.,people have different workloads.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'm already on the thermal right frame.,upd.,i figured it out.,the mobo hits up to 1.55v vcore in auto.,"gosh, it's wild.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

was running 6700k until 2 weeks ago.,6700xt.,had no idea how much the cpu was bottleneck until i built a new 12700k system with the same gpu.,gaming is so smooth now.,canâ€™t imagine how good itâ€™ll be with a 3080 and a 13th gen chip!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah itll he worth the wait for 13th gen as itll be the second iteration of the new p & e cores design!,until then maybe look into overclocking?,i think the 6600k would benefit from it considering the gpu you have.,"i made my 3570k last 9 years with a 4.5 ghz oc before upgrading, gave the old system to my brother and that little 3rd gen i5 is still gaming today!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you never should have spent that kind of money on a 3080 when your cpu was only a 6600kâ€¦.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i know this is intel sub reddit but have you looked into zen 4 with 3d v-cache?,they're supposed to launch early next year.,3d v-cache does wonders for gaming.,i'm considering upgrading my 9700k when the zen 4 3d v-cache launches.,i play a lot of tarkov and 3d v-cache boosts frames by a lot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you poor little soul haha,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have an h110i and i average between 45 and 55 degrees on my 9900kf.,maybe you're needs thermal paste if it is getting hot with an h150,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what temps is hot for a cpu?,i run all kinds of high processing power apps and games and never go above like 54?,or around there maybe little lower or higher if i can remember.,i have the noctua nh-d15 cooler and itâ€™s verrrrry cool.,54 might be high though.,idk anyways mines never been hot try my cooler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am using my i5 3570k with 16gb ram as my proxmox server.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've got a 9900k and 3080ti which feel great.,"an upgrade only looks like a 3% fps gain, does it feel more smooth or is there more gains than that?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wow, that is shocking.",you got the frame and a decent 360 aio and its still cooking away at 80c?!,"intel have to really get their shit together for 13th gen, thats bananas hot.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ok, i was just implicating.","elsewhere you wrote about a higher than needed vcore, have you tuned that and received better results?","should definitely work good, have fun.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you are probably correct, speaking paranoid i could think the original screws for the clamping mechanism could have a detectable force or some glue inside which could be tamper-detected.","but yes, where should intel get the information about mainboard modifications..

"yep, i ran into that issue with my asus board and the 10900k oc... a lot of days of tweaking to get it just right lol.",9700k & 9900k still viable till this day.,love those two pc's!,":) and even better, they're happy with their pc's!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your motherboard might be auto overclocking it with high voltage.,also (can happen) reseat the cooler apply thermal paste.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
air bubbles if any will not interfere with the liquid flow as much.,"if you mount as op, you will hear occasional gurgling sounds (since air bubbles would be near the tube's opening); although this wouldn't kill the aio.",mount at the top and you're gold.,"also, many manufacturers recommend mounting aios at the top in their instruction leaflet, if possible.","if not, mount with tubes bottom; with the radiator being the highest part in the loop.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your aio is mounted just fine.,"as long as the pump is not the highest point in your setup, you're fine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no way, really?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if that 18% means that much for you, sure why not.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
was about to thumbs up until that last part about  30fps...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"by the way, that wasnâ€™t me that downvoted you, but i respectfully disagree.",the price to upgrade from a 9900k to a 12900k to get 18% performance doesnâ€™t make much sense financially or performance wise.,itâ€™s like getting a toyota avalon when you have a camry that is 3 years old.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
correct iâ€™m just saying the real world difference between the 9900k and the 12900k is 18%.,"so he bought a new board, new ram and new chip for 18%.",i hardly think thatâ€™s worth it in terms of a worthy upgrade for the cost.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have been on both subs for years.,and intel sub mostly acknowledges amd as a good competition and nothing bad.,just because i didn't mention amd doesn't mean anyone here means it isn't a good option.,"i didn't mention amd because op already bought the system, and the person replying to was comparing intel cpus only.",so amd is irrelevant in this thread.,"it's your opinion that buying rpl doesn't make sense but considering most people upgrade 3-4 year cycle anyway, at which point - any upgrade would need newer mobo, so that's moot.",that's my opinion anyway.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"by that logic, he didn't need ti upgrade anyway.",that's why i said not just gaming.,my point simply is that 10-11th gen is not same as 12th- 13th,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i had a similar issue with my 12900k, thermalright, new cooler and bla bla bla, the manual voltage was the biggest difference.",1.290v and stable 5.1 oc and now no more than 80c on stress test and 50c on gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"check your llc, thatâ€™s probably why itâ€™s hitting that high.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can undervolt these pretty well.,mine is at 1.226v under 100% load.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why are you using auto vcore?,the first thing i would do with a 12900ks is to lower it as much as possible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same.,"i just bought the ks and am trying to decide if i should keep it or swap it for the k, since it runs cooler.","i could wait for gen13, but this i9 is already going to be overkill for my needs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well i play at 4k so it is still a really great experience.,"i know it could be better, but it is still amazing.",the only games iâ€™ve had trouble on are like assassins creed and battlefield could be better.,every other game seems smooth to me.,"just got done playing spiderman with no issues

the reason they are so out of wack is because i originally had a 1080 with the 6600k.",i upgraded to a 1080 ti and then the 3080. with the way the gpu market has been i have used each card for two years and then was able to sell my old one and upgrade for only $200 or less each time.,it was basically a free upgrade.,whereas upgrading my cpu i might as well build a new pc at that point,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
home computing is an evolution.,upgrading part by part when funds become available.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i bought a 3080 12gb with my 8600k knowing very well i would be cpu bottleneckedâ€¦but it still gave me a massive performance jump when not cpu bottlenecks

and besides, its only until 13th gen comes out and its paired with a 13700k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"without knowing his use case, that is a silly assumption.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, i was just making a point about the 9900k not being so old :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and its probably gonna be a year before i properly upgrade to something like a 13600k... i wanna get a 4790k before october but i don't think i will,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1% lows are greatly improved.,the games i play are mostly cpu bound.,e.g.,escape from tarkov.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on the workload.,80c in prime95 ftt is actually decent.,it's important to consider the impact of thermal density in these baseline temperatures.,at some point both air and liquid coolers aren't constrainted by wattage (bigger coolers can dump the heat from higher wattages) but by thermal density.,think of it like this - even an infinitely large and efficient cooler won't cool to temperatures below ambient temperature as long as you're using ambient air to cool the radiator fins.,so an utopian perfect cooler has its contact copper permanently at ambient temperature.,"you can simply calculate the maximum heat transfer between the cpu and the contact pad, and this is where the bottleneck lies nowadays.","with insanely small cpu's you get very high thermal density, and the only way to increase heat transfer when you're limited by surface area and thermal density can't be blowing more air through your radiator fins, equilibrium must be reached by achieving a higher temperature differential between the ther pad and the cpu.",aka higher cpu temperature.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, definitely.","but still it's too hot, absolutely no surprise.",cinebench 90c.,still playing with vcore.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you don't mind me asking what settings did you have to change to get the temps down?,i have an asus motherboard and it's pushing my cpu voltage to be 1.4v idle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks i'll try to reseat it with fresh paste.,how do i check for the auto overclock?,i have an asus mobo?,is it the ai overclock tuner thing?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you better watch [my research post](https://www.reddit.com/r/overclocking/comments/vrx7wy/front_and_top_radiator_placement_part_3_final/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) why the front is better in terms of cooling.,and no way the aio could be killed that way.,been using this configuration for 10 years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if the 9900k was holding him back and upgrading doesn't financialy hurt him, why not?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most people riding the latest trends just resell parts to upgrade.,itâ€™s really not that hard.,"i went from an i5-2400 to i5-7500, to an i7-7700k, then i9-9900k, i9-12900k, to a i9-12900ks.",living near a micro center and knowing how to sell on ebay helps minimize losses.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah 60 fps is a hard limit for me.,30 fps games make me sick unless they are super slow games like ms flight simulator,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"what youâ€™re doing is fine, i was running a 6600k/1080ti on 1440p 144hz 1ms and had to run most games at low settings to even get 100+ which is great for the age o the processor.",this will now be my ladyâ€™s computer only needing to buy a psu and case.,upgrading to the 12gb 3000 series and i5 12600k (mobo + cpu was $450 combined with paired savings) the video card for $750 and an m.2.,32gb kit.,"all in all it has preformed fantastic and i love the output but running a 3080 + ocâ€™d 6600k would be nice until funds are free for a new cpu, especially if only gaming",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"sounds much, but ok, depending on your use case it should not exceed that level.","my 8700k@5000mhz@1.35v runs to about 85â°c in prime95, normal use of gaming never reaches that.",i can feel the enthusiasm and you surely will find a good level.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"no, go into your bios and see if the ai is running rampant auto oc'ing your processor.",usually to achieve high boost clocks it would need higher voltage depending on the quality of the chip.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea i did mention that it wouldn't kill the aio.,but are the gurgling sounds not audible ?,>been using this configuration for 10 years.,is that the very same aio that you have been running for the past 10 years in that very same configuration?,my guess is no.,"also the reduction in efficiency of the aio would not be apparent immediately, but would definitely impact the lifespan down the line.","also, typically, you wouldn't want air to be pulled from outside of a radiator into the case.","i understand that your cpu will run cooler, but it would result in feeding warmer air to other components with gpu being most sensitive to temps.",i would always do aio rad exhausts unless i can somehow fit relatively more intakes in the case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

amazing post!,this procedure fixed all my issues.,i'm running a maximus z690 hero/13900k/ddr5-6400/sabrent rocket 4.0 plus(gen4)  in m.2\_1 with a samsung 970 evo plus 1tb in m.2\_2 and a samsung 970 evo plus 2tb in m.2\_3.,"i couldn't get xmp to work - post error 23  
mb wasn't detecting port m.2\_1

now everything is fixed after running with this procedure so thank you very very much for this post!",!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea this issue had me stumped.,"i went crazy reseating my ram and cpu multiple times, using my ddr5 test ram modules (crucial 8gb x4), and reverting back to the old cpu.",but i wanted to give people a more detailed description of how to fix because some forums were limited in the needed steps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"asus did a poor job notifying people about the issue, the warnings should be noted in the updates.",i was curious if other non-asus motherboards were affected.,thanks for clarification on that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it depends on how the motherboard's uefi is assembled as well.,"on some systems, especially oem, the uefi updates will also update the intel me.",asus doesn't seem to be including me updates with the uefi updates.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for gigabyte, i just updated my z690 bios (z690 aorus ax elite ddr4) and it looks like it included the updated intel me firmware.","i just ran this to check (this is by extracting the asus package from what op posted):


    fw\fwupdlcl64.exe -fwver

    copyright (c) 2005 - 2022, intel corporation.",all rights reserved.,"fw version: 16.1.25.1917

you can see that the gigabyte intel me fw is a higher version (16.1.25.1917) than even the one included in the asus package (16.1.25.1885).","edit:

you can also use this tool from intel to see what version your intel me firmware is (in addition to checking if its vulnerable): https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/19392/intel-converged-security-and-management-engine-version-detection-tool-intel-csmevdt.html",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">â£400 for a z690i gaming wi-fi itx motherboard and it becomes inoperable due to outdated me firmware

you probably bought a really old z690 with old firmware.",from my understanding the latest models of the same motherboard get newer firmware from the factory itself right?.,(or should atleast),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sorry, iâ€™m not familiar with msi boards.",but people have responded in this thread that msi doesnâ€™t have the same intel management engine out of date drivers that asus boards have.,create a post in the intel reddit thread requesting assistance; iâ€™m sure youâ€™re not the only one w/this issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

iâ€™m not sure because i donâ€™t know of anyone attempting that since this is all fairly new.,but i would think not since the intel me firmware and drivers are linked to the motherboard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i asked a few friends with gigabyte z690 boards and they didnâ€™t have any issues whatsoever.,i personally bought an msi one and itâ€™s safe to say the new me firmware is indeed bundled within the bios update,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

would this be possible with no chip on the board?,itâ€™s a new build and i donâ€™t have an older chip.,"and thanks for your help, much appreciated!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hi artisan -- wondering if all went well with your build?,i am having a tough time with an asus z690/13900kf build.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just finished my build today.,"besides some minor hiccups on my part being rusty, everything went pretty well and it posted.",what issues are you having?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
need?,no they don't need one.,can it benefit you?,yes it can by making sure it doesn't bend and provides good even contact.,not everyone goes ham on their components.,another side note i would make is some folks use aio's with back plates that make the contact frame irrelevant as they already have the bracing needed to keep it from twisting.,older intel's motherboards and aib partners at the time came with back plates to stop flexing.,so its up to you but anyone who has used one will not likely tell you its a bad investment.,cheers!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"its not been fixed, and the issue isn't with the cpu, its with the mount on the motherboards, which still remains the same.","a contact frame costs $15, no reason not to get one.",intel are dicks for not fixing / updating the stock mount on z690 / z790 boards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think alot of the thermal issues can be solved by setting power limits on the chip.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

iâ€™m running a 13700k with mce along with a nhu12a and my temps are decent.,highest temp iâ€™ve seen was 78 while gaming and that was when the map was loading.,no contact frame though i do have the thermalright one.,might give it a go once i repaste later on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it wasnâ€™t expensive, you donâ€™t even need the thermal grizzly one.","i just got the cheaper option you can find plenty, itâ€™s easy to install watch the gamers nexus video, no issues",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

is that yes or no?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what case are you using?,"i have the nh-u12a black and plan to get a 13700k, did end up checking if the frame improve temperatures?",not sure if i should bother with the contact frame for this cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"gaming power usage is extremely low, the problem is with productive workloads.",run cinebench with that cooler and the 13700k will hit throttling in 30 seconds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have a fractal torrent.,i didnâ€™t bother with the contact frame though i do have one.,"also i used noctua nth1 thermal paste and oddly the temps the next day were even better than they initially were, but i have some cryofuze in the way so i may install the contact frame when that comes in and repaste.",i also run my u12a fans at full speed as they donâ€™t really make much noise.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

tl;dr from thermal-grizzly web:

**the standard integrated loading mechanism (ilm) has contact points that are in the middle of the elongated cpu.",the surface of the integrated heatspreader (ihs) curves concavely due to the resulting uneven contact pressure of the processor in the socket.,"as a result, the base plate of the cpu cooler rests primarily on the edges of the ihs, so that the thermal ""hotspot"" in the center of the cpu is not optimally covered.","**_x000d_  
_x000d_  
**the intel 12th gen cpu contact frame has a special inner contour to shift the contact pressure from the center of the cpu to the edges during assembly.",this avoids the concave curvature of the ihs.,this means that the cpu cooler rests better on the processor and a larger contact surface is created to dissipate the waste heat of the cpu.,**,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what i will try, as soon as the replacements are in which have been ordered 1-2 weeks ago:  
1) i will test a replacement of the gasket, there is possibly some gunk inside (the cooler is 1 year old) so maybe this will give an improvement in heat exchange.","it also comes with mx-5 paste (i used mx-3, probably little difference)

i dunno i'm using a corsair 4000d mesh case that's sitting on the floor with clearance in the front and back to make sure air gets in and out cleanly.,running my 12700k at 5/5/5/5/5.2/5.2/5/5 and 4/4/4/4 with 4.2 ring clock no issues.,my 3080 is mildly oc'd as well.,i'm running most games i play on max settings g-synced to my 1440p/165hz monitors at 165fps.,i think the hottest i get gaming is in path of exile with a screen full of aoe spam i've seen 55c.,"edit: i do manually use c-states up to c7 and rush to halt along with that, which many people turn off when oc'ing which is stupid.",really helps sip power in idle (4-8w package power in idle).,i also turn off frequency scaling and leave the clocks constantly maxed since the c states save far more power than frequency scaling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if it was 160w then cooler can be aired up (doubt, idle temperature way too low), you'd need to turn the pc up (place some other radiator on the cpu, so it won't die) and shake pump and radiator while switching what's on top while shaking.","of course, before doing it make sure you've got paste squished in like in the green area [https://i.imgur.com/ecsgbd2.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/ecsgbd2.jpg), not red.","cooler is absolutely running, it's indicated by ""low"" idle temperatures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4-8?,"highly doubt it's accurate, there should be no way to get power draw lesser than 12w on 12700k, especially when overclocked.",do you have dc loadline set correctly?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i picked up a 13700k, it somehow runs cooler in gamming then my 13600k i think i had a crap chip",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes i do.,"i'm slightly undervolted, but again, aggressive c states paired with rush to halt which most overclockers turn off works wonders in idle.","that's what hwinfo is showing, not sure why you think you're more correct than it is.",and it's not adversely impacting benchmarking at all.,my cb23 [scores](https://i.imgur.com/zbmvk5z.jpg) are decent.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not an expert and donâ€™t have one, but seems like the thermalright gets the job done for a lot cheaper.",anyone feel free to correct me if thereâ€™s noticeable performance differences between contact frames.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for some it improves nominally like 2-3 degrees.,for others it improved 6-7 degrees which is pretty substantial.,personally for my new build for 13 gen i am just going to install the frame from the get go.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i used the thermalright one.,and it works great.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i used the thermalright frame and it dropped a few degrees c from my load temps.,"i believe the thermalright has ""legs"" which the grizzly doesn't that ensure proper mount pressure so it's harder to screw up.",at least that is my understanding.,easy to do and i'd say worth it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't use it and i don't have a issue with temperatures.,ok yes it might decrease even more but for just a few temps less it's not worth it in my opinion.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is 'worth it' to you?,what do you think an extra 100 or 200mhz boost will get you?,"like, nobody can answer this but you.",what kind of disposable income do you have?,etc.,etc.,"for me, as a non mlg420xxx69 g4m3r, that extra boost i might get on my mediocre 12600k just ain't worth it.","for you, maybe you're chasing the 3dmark record on a 12900k?",so you tell us -- what's it worth to you?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"imo itâ€™s only worth it if youâ€™re overclocking or using an i9, grab a thermalright one if you do itâ€™s much cheaper",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"some people say its great others say they had no difference, ive never used one, but have had no temp issues since i had it, prob depends also on what block/cooler you use as well",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what cooler are you using?,if youâ€™re using like an ekwb it doesnâ€™t make much difference as they have a solid backplate and good mounting.,aios and air coolers might benefit most.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
only if you have bad contact seen after placing paste and removing the block,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i refuse to use one.,"there is no way to confirm that you didn't under or overtighten it, and that can lead to inadequate cpu contact with the socket pins, which can cause all kinds of issues, like the pc not booting, poor ram overclocking, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"after watching several videos i haven't really understood this: if i don't use a frame, does  that mean that after a couple of years bending will leave my cpu in an inoperable state due to bending?",is it possible that the cpu will break into two pieces?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not worth it in my case as it only made the temp drop 3c or so with air cooling.,"i was also afraid of a poor install of the screws but after having done it, not much of a real issue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i went with thermalright for my 13600k and i went from 97c full load to 85c.,it seems to even out the inconsistencies that everyone is experiencing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this apparently heavily depends on what cooler you have, the shape of the contact surface and the installation pressure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i bought the thermalright one.,my own personal experience is that it dropped the temps ever so slightly at idle and at load like maybe 2-3 degrees so not a substantial drop at all.,but thats not why i bought it.,short of someone changing their setup every year for the sake of â£13-15 so thatâ€™s like $13-15 i expect my setup to last quite a few years so in that regard it was just peace of mind in regards to the bending of the cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"whats the performance difference over just having a stock one, keeping everything stock?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"based on gn's reviews, yes.","if there was ever a case when a product at the fraction of the price is objectively superior, then this is it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so since the 12th gen the mechanism which holds the cpu in place better know as the ilm or intel locking mechanism has found to exert a lot of pressure.,"this in effect 'bends' the cpu so is not even on the heatspreader which makes poor contact with whatever your choice of cooling solution be whether it be air, aio or custom .",now this in turn makes an already hot running cpu even hotter.,what the contact frame is suppose to do is just hold the cpu in place but without the kind of pressure that the ilm exerted.,so that means in theory that your cpu heatspreader will be flush to the cooling solution of your choice.,making better contact.,"now some people have found it made no difference, some say marginal and some say substantial.",i got like 2-3  degrees.,you could get 0 difference or big difference i can't say as it varies from user to user.,there are two main ones that people use.,there is the one from thermal grizzle and that's about $50 or 50 euros.,or the other main alternative is the thermalright version both do the same thing and that is $15 or 15 euro.,i got both of mine off amazon.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i5 13600k vs. i9 12900k.,my money is on the i9 12900k.,"is the the i7 13700k better than 12900k, then yes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"13700k is a bit better than 12900k (higher clocks/oc)

not 13900k with 16 stupid e-cores

if price does not matter, then 13900k/z790 ddr5 7000",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depending on the game the 13600k moves to just above or just below the 12900k from benchmarks that i've seen.,if you do anything that will utilize every core the 12900k would be the higher performer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for gaming the 13600k is slightly faster.,12900k is better for non-gaming workloads,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nope,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,which is why if you have a 12th gen processor its an easy/clear cut upgrade..... not sure what the point of the post is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in gaming the i5 wins, in multicore the i5s 6 + 8 cores would be trading blows with the i9s 8 + 8 because they are faster cores, overall unless you get a killer deal on the i9 the i5 is better in almost every way and the 13700k would beat both of them",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> 13600k is not better than 12900k (only 6 p-cores)

it depends on the workload and core count doesn't really matter.",for gaming the 13600k > 12900k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yea ok so i just bought a i9 1200k 8 months ago, what do i do?",can i sell a i9 12900k still and buy a i9 13900k???,even then wont i be impacted by having a z690 motherboard if i wanna get another i9?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how so?,i ask as a 13600k owner.,the single core performance is only slightly better on the 13600k from what ive seen while the multi core performance is up to 12% worse.,value wise?,"the 13600k ofc beats it, because its so close to the 12900k in performance while costing $80 less.",might as well shell out an extra 20 bucks for the i7 at that point.,"(athough for gaming, you really don't need to, this gen i5 is a monster.",the first time i have ever gone i5 in an upgrade but i'll be damned.,it's like an i7 in i5 clothing o.o)  but by all appearances the 12900k beats it out just slightly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"of course you can sell your i9, add a bit of money and get i9 13900k, why is that even a question?","and regarding z690 - everything will work fine, you might only need a bios and/or me firmware update which is easy to do.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes if you don't care about overclocking its right up there with strix imo.,very stable.,prime probably doesn't have bluetooth and a few other usb options that strix does but if none of that extra crap is needed prime is great it would have the same chipset and that's the important thing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hah!,so you just helped me.,i just checked and my 4090 was running at gen4 x8 instead of gen4 x16.,now i checked this before to make sure it was x16 when i first built the system.,it was gen4 x16.,but that was before i put my other m.2 drives in.,so apparently i've been running at x8 since putting them in.,now the solution is simple and i just fixed it myself.,"the solution is do not use slot ""m2\_2"".","as we can see from the msi specs it says ""\*pci\_e1 slot will be gen5x8 when installing m.2 ssd in the m2\_2 slot.""",this is because pci\_e1 and m2\_2 are share the gen5 lane.,now gen5x8 is as fast as gen4x16 so it shouldn't be a problem except it is because the rtx 4090 only supports gen4.,"if it did support gen5, it could run at gen5 x8 speeds and still be as fast as gen4 x16 (which is all it really needs).",so installing an m.2 drive into slot m2\_2 hurts the performance of the 4090. this is common on all of the z790 boards.,"so to solve this, i simply have to move my second m.2 to a different slot other than m2\_2.",[here you can see i'm now running at x16 again](https://i.imgur.com/rfzyta2.png)... thanks to you :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you could just as well have 790 with ddr4.,or 690 with ddr5.,the chipset has no influence on the choice of memory (as the memory controller is integrated into the cpu anyway).,"literally the only difference between 690 and 790 is that 4 pcie lanes (of downstream chipset ) are upgraded from pcie gen 3.0 to 4.0. so, instead of having 3 pcie4.0 ssds you can now have 4 pcie4.0 ssds.",it's literally the only difference.,so if you don't care about adding *4* (!!!),"nvme ssd's (or don't mind one of them being 3.0 speed, then there is no practical difference between 690 and 790   (except price)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'd get the bigger 2tb m.2.,they should know of this configuration issue with the z790 gen5 slot and m.2 but as you can see.. its still possible to make mistakes.,"i'm well aware of this and still managed to screw it up :)

so the slot issue is basically this.",gen5 is double the speed of gen 4. this allows them to run gpu and m.2 on the single pcie lane at gen5 speeds.,the problem is the rtx 4090 does not know what gen 5 is.,it can only operate at gen4 speeds.,so when it sees the slot is x8 speed.,it thinks it's a gen4 x8 slot because it has no understanding of gen5.,gen5 x8 is the same speed as gen4 x16 (remember the 4090 only needs gen4 x16 speeds).,it sounds like you're buying it built from ibuypower but you will be putting in your 3080 yourself?,"whatever the case maybe, it's an easy fix so you shouldn't worry.",you can get the bigger samsung m.2 or run multiple m.2s.,the board has enough m.2 slots but i do think getting the bigger 2tb drive is a wise option.,1tb is kind of the minimum size i'd recommend today.,it's a good size but 2tb will give you a nice comfortable size.,if you need more in a year you can buy another 2tb and use both.,it's best to have the biggest m.2 you can get rather than buy 2 of equal total size.,btw i feel like nvidia purposely limited the 4090 to gen4 so that in a couple years when we are thinking about upgrading to the new nvidia card with gen5... it will push users to buy the new card because of the performance benefits of gen5 :) sneaky.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i ordered two drives; a primary 980 1tb m.2 and a cheaper 780 2tb.,"i'm guessing if they used this order:

1. samsung m.2 1tb 980
2. rtx 3080
3. samsung 780 qvo ssd

then, will the 3080 have gen4x16 ?",(or am i not understanding this correctly?),"i recently watched a review where z790 won't even support gen5 pcie fully, that once gen5 gpu comes out, we all need to upgrade everything.",that would be very frustrating to many of us who paid extra for a z790 mobo...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok i missed something in your other post.,i thought you bought two m.2 drives and were concerned about which slots they go in.,instead you bought 1 m.2 and a ssd drive.,"while both are solid state storage, the way they are installed is very different.",as long as they install the m.2 in the first slot (m2\_1) you will get x16 just fine.,"to be even more clear, as long as they dont install it in the m2\_2 slot... you'll be fine :)

the ssd itself will be connected via sata cable and does not factor into this pcie speed configuration issue.",so yes the 3090 will be running gen4 x16 if the samsung m.2 is plugged into m2\_1 on the msi z790 carbon.,the ssd is a sata drive that connects to the sata controller on the motherboard for traditional storage drives like hard drives and ssds.,the ssd will not have an effect on pcie speeds.,these boards can easily support a gen5 gpu (once they become a reality).,keep in mind that x16 is more speed than your gpu actually uses.,your gpu would perform pretty much the same at x8 in most scenarios.,again i didn't notice it until i looked.,so there is plenty of bandwidth on the gen5 for future gen5 gpus.,"just like gen4 x16 gpus, they wont maximize the bandwidth either.",also keep in mind that the intel lga 1700 on these motherboards are at the end of their life so we will see a new socket by the time we need to upgrade.,that will require a new motherboard.,should a gen5 nvidia gpu come out between now and the next time we upgrade... it's going to run just fine.,even if it needs gen5 x16 because we have other m.2 slots that we can use that do not limit the pci gen5 slot to x8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you so very much!,"i think to make my life easier, i'm probably going to keep my original order and upgrade to 4090 once the new gen5 gpu comes out since i will only use this pc for a few games at 1440p.","i got tired of using [shadow.tech](https://shadow.tech) (virtual pc machine) on my m1 mac mini...

it's a great board.,price is right.,anything more is ridiculous overkill.,again there is no future for the lga 1700 socket so its not worth spending more than you need on a 1700 socket board.,i originally bought the msi z790 edge ddr4 but changed my mind about using my old ram so i got the z790 carbon ddr5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4 cores or 4 threads?,what are you using them for?,are they your best cores in xtu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the answer to that question depends entirely on what youâ€™re doing on your pc (which apps, processes, services, etc., are running) at the time youâ€™re checking usage.","gaming, for example, will (warning: generalized blanket statement incoming) primarily utilize only a single-core for the main process (resulting in high utilization for that 1 core) while background tasks get moved to additional cores/threads with much lower utilization.","as an example, letâ€™s say you finish a match of cod: warzone 2 and go back to the lobby.",only a single thread is running the game while another thread is running a background task of uploading your stats for that game to their ingest api.,seeing high utilization across a low core count is normal in this case.,"**however**,

letâ€™s say you are encoding a videoâ€”converting it from one format to another.","most popular applications, like handbrake.fr, will set a default value thatâ€™s 75% of your total core/thread count.","you can change this value in the settings for these appsâ€”so, for this example, letâ€™s say you choose to use all available cores/threads.","while encoding, if you checked utilization and only saw activity on 4 cores/threads then thereâ€™s a problem.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's two cores in use actually, and they are probably the two cores capable of boosting to 5.8 ghz through turbo boost 3.0 max and tvb",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

see i thought the same thing.,"if the cpu says it supports up to ddr4-2666 then that's the max you can have, right?",but everything i read and hear says when you enable xmp you overclock past that and it should work at the ram speed as long as your motherboard supports it.,"i'm so confused... as far as the memory being supported, i got this specific memory from the manufacturers website, so it's 100% supported.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that completely depends on the cpu and the integrated memory controller.,past 2666mhz your overclocking which nothing is guaranteed really.,turning on xmp beyond 3200mhz is honestly hit or miss most of the time.,it took me 2-3 hours of tweaking voltages and testing to get ddr4-4000 memory working on my i9-9900k.,i had to keep adjusting the vccio & vccsa voltages until i found where they'd boot and then how much voltage i needed for stability.,also going too high on these voltages can also cause instability.,"so yah for that fast of ram, your not going to just turn on xmp and instantly have it work.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

interesting thread!,just received my tr frame and will spend some time tinkering.,"i have a lot of experience with custom loops, oc, etc., but at some point, i decided the 12th gen are fast enough not to bother and got lackadaisical thinking that with aio and stock turbo settings my 12900k will run cool enough.",(iâ€™m sure it did not) then without doing any research i bought the 13900ks popped it in and the whole shebang crashed hard on the first benchmark lol.,"so, the journey begins since i purchased 13900ks from newegg which does not offer refunds.",otherwise i might have reconsidered.,1. turning off asus multicore enhancement stabilized my system but throttles heavily after about 20 seconds of cr23 with mid 36k score after 10 minutes.,2. try the thermalright frame and some voltage tunning.,tight setup at the moment and really do not wish to disassemble the case to install it.,iâ€™ll first see if some hot glue will hold ilm backplate in place.,any other creative suggestions?,3. upgrade my corsair 4000d / h115i to phanteks evolv x / 420 aio or maybe a custom loop.,(itâ€™s a hobby after all),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

just wondering if yours is running a constant 5.2ghz.,ever since i've installed mine in a msi z790 edge wifi it runs 5.2ghz even at idle.,no over clocking done just straight up standard bios settings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"starting to think you might be right, i reset to stock settings and all went back to normal, slowly started undervolting in increments and got back to the old undervolt and all the p-cores were consistent 5.3ghz.",one thing i did however was get the latest intel management engine driver and seriel io driver.,no clue if that fixed it but worth a shot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"mine does not do that, it clocks quite low in idle.","im on a z690 edge rather than z790, but i would look into your windows power plan and power mode and make sure they're set to just balanced.",if they already are then i would assume there is some sort of setting in the bios that's on by default that is letting the cores boost clock at all times.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is in power saving right now.,the only way ive found to clock them down atm is to use msi center user scenario and put it on silent.,cuts it in half but holds that solid.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mine is also t 5.2ghz at idle.,only downclocks on power savings mode.,asrock mobo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

frequency in and of itself does not damage anything.,voltage and temperature do.,"frequency can raise temperature, but intels throttling behavior is designed to ensure safe temperature at all times.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"excessive voltage can degrade (or even kill) a cpu, however whether reasonable overclocking voltage levels would noticeably affect a cpuâ€™s useful lifespan is debatable.",i do recall that excessive system agent voltage from a lot of x99 motherboards in their default â€œall core turbo overclockâ€ option ended up killing a lot of broadwell-e cpus rather quickly.,"at a normal voltage range the lifespan of a cpu should be in the decades, so cutting a few years off that is immaterial.",iâ€™ve never seen anything that said that frequency alone (independent of voltage) has any effect.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"warm idle but good load temps could be the result of running windows in the high performance power plan, or simply the fan curve.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"on alder lake i would regularly see idle temps 5c **below** ambient with direct-die cooling, while raptor lake idles 10c above ambient with the same direct-die cooling solution.",temperature sensors used in chips are notoriously unreliable at low temps due to how they're calibrated however.,your load temps are perfectly fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't think it's fair to compare the temps of different systems with different coolers in different cases running different windows settings (balanced vs high performance).,neither your load temps or your idle temps are particularly bad or worrisome either.,for being concerned about cpu temperatures i'm surprised you're running your aio in an exhaust configuration instead of an intake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my fans always run at 1200rpm at idle, so i doubt it's that.","i do run in high performance, yeah, but i've found that i sometimes have stuttering issues in certain games when i'm not.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would it be better to have my aio mounted on the side as intake and have fans exhausting out of the top instead?,"also, both pcs are now running balanced and the temps on mine havenâ€™t changed at all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if youâ€™re running windows 11, i would recommend balanced power plan and best performance power mode.","if youâ€™re not running 11 and are getting stuttering, i would try 11.

are the systems using the same motherboard?","other system components could also affect idle temps, like the gpu and even psu.","still, low 30s really isnâ€™t bad (especially if youâ€™re running high performance - you can probably knock off 5+ degrees if you turn that off).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in terms of rad placement it's kind of a trade off - running it as an intake means that cold air is flowing through the rad and your cpu temps should improve, but the downside is now that heated up air is entered your case and potentially raising the temps of your other components, most notably your graphics card.","either option (side intake or top exhaust) is perfectly fine and viable, but intake in some way is what i would choose if cpu temps are your priority.","with that being said, i also have a 13700k (although a kf), a 360mm aio, and a lian li o11d xl, and that's how i have mine setup, with the rad as an intake on the side and fans exhausting at the top.","with the fans at the bottom intaking cold air directly at the gpu, my gpu runs extremely cool.","in a case without those bottom intake fans, i wager running your aio as intake would 100% have a negative impact on gpu temperatures, and gpus are pretty sensitive to heat when it comes to boosting behavior.","[here's what my setup looks like](https://i.postimg.cc/chqjlzc3/20221125-211223.jpg), [and the back.",](https://i.postimg.cc/wmgjtprg/20221125-211243.jpg),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's abnormal for gaming.,what i can see that the case has a very old design and no top fan.,it's possible that the rear fan can't exhaust enough hot air from the cpu and gpu as the both dissipate approximately 350w during playing games.,what you can do to check it - open the case and put it on the right side and have a look at temps then.,"also use hwinfo instead of msi so you can see max voltage, temps, and clocks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
update: i realised that the rear fan (the one right behind the cpu and gpu was on the wrong side so i repasted the cpu fan and flipped the fan now the cpu temps are 70-80c and gpu 75-80c.,thank you all for helping!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"85-95 celsius is not an unusual temperature for an i7-10700k, especially when taking into account intel's turbo boost.",that is expected during the boost phase.,"however, your motherboard could also have the cpu power limits unlocked, causing a prolonged cpu boost that causes those temperatures.",you may want to try to disable it.,"i think asus calls it ""multi core enhancement"" in bios.","another thing you could try would be to repaste the cpu/cooler, with a high quality paste, like the noctua nh1 or nh2.",also make sure your case airflow is good.,what's the temperature of the rest of the components ?,"now, is that ok ?","well, it's not ""recommended"" for the cpu to stay above 90-95 celsius for prolonged hours, as that degrades the chip longterm, but it's not catastrophic.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thats high for gaming.,i would repaste and make sure you've got good mounting pressure on your cooler.,i have a 10700k 5.2 all core and my temps are no where near that.,also check motherboard settings auto voltages can be excessive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would it possibly get better if i added more fans?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it does seem abnormal in gaming load though.,even with unlocked power limits on a nd d15 hitting 95c in a game seems warm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"itâ€™s not a bait and switch, itâ€™s for select products with select retailers.",return the cpu and buy it from a participating retailer or return the cpu and buy an amd cpu if thatâ€™s what you want to do.,fwiw iâ€™m fairly certain newegg participates in this promotion.,best buy probably doesnâ€™t have the system setup to support this.,when i purchased the arc a770 i got an email within 5 minutes from newegg and redeemed it no problem.,this thread title is misleading and borderline misinformation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which processor did you buy and which retailer?,looks like only 11th and 12th gen intel is eligible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i just claimed this offer without issue, what exactly did they tell you?",edit: after reading your comments it is definitely not at all intel's fault and is the retailers fault.,"go buy it somewhere reputable and you will be fine, the retailer has to give you the key.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just got a i7 13700k via amazon and was deliver november 29. yesterday december 1 i got an email about the promotion that i didnâ€™t know about but i had to register in intels website to get it.,when did u order ur cpu and did it arrive yet ?,?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

worked for me.,both my 13900k and a770.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what was their reasoning for not honoring the promotion?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you bought a $500 i7 because they were giving you a $60 game?,"ironic, considering your username.",this isn't an intel problem but a retailer problem.,the cpu itself is fine and intel isn't at fault.,if you want amd then you should've bought an amd.,don't buy a cpu because of the software they bundle; buy it for your own personal needs.,"i agree that getting boned on your software key sucks but if it's a cpu you truly want, return it and re-buy it elsewhere if the lack of the $60 game is a deal breaker.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this needs to be higher.,"itâ€™s at participating retailers, and best buy isnâ€™t one of them.",thereâ€™s always a fine print somewhere on promotions and op didnâ€™t read it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the username was generated by reddit.,"i bought intel because at the time, with the promotion, it was better value than amd.",it is an intel problem because they are the ones advertising the promotion.,if the retailers were advertising the promotion they would be the ones baiting the customer and switching.,"i don't care if i have amd or intel, i just want best performance per dollar.",this promotion tipped the scale for intel.,now that i know it's a scam i'll be returning my motherboard and processor on monday and buying amd.,the point of my post is to raise awareness so other shoppers don't fall for this bait and switch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no thank you i've already spent $500 usd on this and been scammed once.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, thatâ€™s rough.",iâ€™ve heard best buy is very hit or miss with the master keys.,itâ€™s unclear if thatâ€™s on intel though or if best buy was just poorly prepared.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"what proc did you buy, where and what date?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
interesting.,opâ€™s link only lists 11th and 12th and has an expiration date of december 31st.,that one is march of next year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
best buy may very well not be participating in the promotion.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

on the retailer.,it's stated in the eligibility section of the terms and conditions of the offer.,intel doesn't advertise they will provide a master key anywhere and aren't listed as a retailer that would provide one.,"tier 1 support agents have tough jobs and are generally provided insufficient/outdated reference documentation; they probably provided the best information they were aware of at that time, but it doesn't mean its the gold standard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

and intel told you that it was up to the retailer after you tried to submit a ticket?,edit: also itâ€™s probably best buyâ€™s fault for not honoring it.,intel likely already gave best buy the keys to send out and they just arenâ€™t giving them out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

nah i just went from 1080 ti to 4090 but still on my same 7700k build for now and honestly the 1080 ti was already being maxed out for me.,you would only maybe see gains in the 0.1% lows if you play these modern games that artificially inflate cpu usage with poor scaling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'm also thinking of switching from a 6700k to 13700k!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had a 1080 with the 6700k.,got a 3070 and saw very minimal gains as my cpu was at 100% constantly.,decided it was time to build a new system around the 3070. mw2 was the game that made me finally give in.,went from barely 50 fps in the beta at medium settings 1440p to maxed settings 1440p 110 fps consistently.,same gpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as a 6700k owner who just bought a 13700k the 6700k held up great until a couple years ago if you just play 1080p games and have a mid tier gpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™m still on ivy bridge i5, why replace what ainâ€™t broken, it opens browser just fine",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there's nothing wrong with the 6700k.,i've also got one and see no point in upgrading for at least a few years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you play at higher resolutions itâ€™s not a big deal.,played at 1440p with a 1080 so the cpu didnâ€™t have to work as hard at 1080p.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nothing wrong with it, iâ€™m still using a 4790k myself and though i will be upgrading soon to a 13700k or amd 7700x/7900x it is still powerful enough for most games and apps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea the 7700k era definitely did not last long.,"however as someone on the 7700k still, i feel it's held up great for gaming specifically despite being destroyed by these newer chips.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just got my z790 board today; cpu arrives in a few days.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
850w should be fine.,you might need to power limit your cpu just a little bit if you feel like you're going to use both it and your gpu at max load.,i got ddr5 because i'm going all out this build but from what i can tell it doesn't really affect performance that much.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you won't know yourself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you will be amazed.,i hope your gpu is able to take it cause that's the bottlenecker now.,went from 6700k to 12900k.,my man it is a whole new world up here.,you will not regret anything,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm doing the same upgrade soon!,"4670k to 13600k, can't wait!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7700k?,to expensive to be worth it i guess?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i was pretty stubborn with it kind of hoping something major would go wrong with it so i could justify upgrading.,have given my brother the old setup now and hopefully it serves him well for abit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"games using less threads than you have, but pegging a single thread to 100%, will bottleneck you but something like msi afterburner is reporting total cpu usage, so it'll reflect something lower than 100%.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">4770k

if you see your cpu stuck at 12.5% usage it means you have 1 core 100% usage.",(100% divided by 8 cores = 12.5% per core.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean.... if u can't get a good deal on both at once no point passing up on one of them.,you definitely won't loose performance in the meantime till u upgrade both.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my original build was a 770 which died and i replaced with a 1660s 3 years ago or so.,i'm still at 1080p so it's doing the job for now.,will go for a 3080 and 1440p 144hz  when the prices are better here (aus).,your cpu might not be as much of a bottleneck as mine was but it's a night and day difference in normal use and gives me room to upgrade the gpu and make a nice and hopefully long lasting machine.,think i got nearly 8 years out the last setup bar the graphics card and a power supply.,"if i get the same out of the new build, i'll be stoked.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at some point it's definitely worth it.,with some games my cpu is bottlenecking my gpu like 40%.,having a better gpu wouldn't do you any good i that case.,i5 6400 and gtx 970 btw,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm still on a 4790k and 1070ti.,my plan is to upgrade my platform to 13600k in the next month then upgrade the gpu in the spring.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, it is worth upgrading.","especially from 4790k, you will see a noticeable difference going to 13th gen, even 12th or 11th i think.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, depending on the game.",when i upgraded from.,"4770 to a ryzen 1700, there was a big uplift in civ 4 and 6 turn times for example.",any games with single core or low threads can benefit.,flight simulator is another one.,iâ€™m now on a ryzen 3950x and can find single thread scenarios that bottleneck even with that.,also may benefit other uses.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i found a good deal on a used 3070 a few weeks ago.,saw minimal gains over my 1080 as even that was bottlenecked in some games by my cpu.,even at 1440p.,so now i have the full potential of the 3070 with my cpu barely getting to 40% utilization in most games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don't wait.,i upgraded the 3570k to a 12600k rocking the same 1070 gtx.,it transformed vr.,it's very nice always using 100% gpu.,finally the 10 series unleashed.,plus it's not just games.,"everything else is such a pleasure to use now, i open shit without thinking, lightroom minimize open a game who cares.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i am upgrading from a 7700k right now, but honestly it hardly feels like a must even with a 3080.

"same boat as well, got everything at home except the freakin aio cooler :/",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea my thoughts too.,i can't think of any scenarios that will push my cpu and gpu to their max simultaneously.,i think i'll see how it goes and if i detect any instability i might throttle the cpu or get a new psu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what chip are you planning on going with?,i'm not decided yet as i plan to upgrade sometime early next year.,i was leaning 7700x personally but it's hard to recommend that at current prices when the 13600k is around now.,"i don't nitpick between benchmarks myself, i feel like most people will barely tell the difference between these chips as any of current gen chips will destroy the 7700k and would be a significant upgrade.",i feel like the 7700x will be dropping to 300$ when the 3dvcache models drop next year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think limiting power draw to max tdp on both is just the right way to go anyway.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hmmm if you need to upgrade i would go for  12600k instead.,you will save at least $300 on mobo and cpu.,since you game at 1440p.,between 12600k vs 13600k is about 15% at best difference at 1440p.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you have the patience of a god.,i couldn't wait if i was in that situation.,even w the old gpu (i'd oc if not already done) your pc will just move a lot faster.,gpu is really only noticeable during gaming or other professional things that i don't do.,godspeed to you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah you could probably buy a 12400f and a cheap ddr4 board for the same price as the 7700k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hwinfo or afterburner if you want to see a screen full of thread info in a game, itâ€™s too much for normal use but you can see",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to me it was an easy call to go with a 13600k.,"i can carry over my ddr4 kit and buy a dirt cheap b660 board that allows memory oc - it will be just fine for the next two years or so, later on i can upgrade to a by-then discounted z-board and far better (value) ddr5 ram vs current offerings to unlock extra performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the world is a magical place full of people waiting to be offended by something.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
will this mitigate overpowering without any cost to performance?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
?,they would need new mobo no matter what.,12600k vs 13600k isn't $300,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm running raptor lake now with my existing gpu.,you did not undersell this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's what i did.,came from 9th gen i7 to 12th gen i7 bring my ddr4 and may go ddr5 later.,may even get 13th gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sounds like a solid plan.,the 13600k is a monster for the price.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

limiting a 13700k or 13900k to about 150w pl1 and 125w pl2 (13900k) or 125w pl1 95w pl2 (13700k) will cap power at 150w or below without any performance cost to gaming.,gaming is almost entirely desensitized to power limits because you only need to power 30% of your cpu before amdahls law kicks in - gaming just isn't a very parallel task at heart - it's all about running a small part of your cpu at full power which can easily be done on a power budget.,"multithreaded performance is different because by default you actually do want to power all the silicon you have, but running the suggested settings would only drop performance by about 10%.","that last bit of performance, if your want it, is where you spend 150w more and power draw becomes ridiculous.",i don't think that's worth it.,"with a 150w power limit on the cpu, you have 700w left to power a 4090 and the rest of the system.","power limiting the 4090 to 80% would make it draw less than 350w at the cost of like 7,5% performance.","the only annoying part about power limiting the 4090 is that msi afterburner doesn't seem to auto apply my profile at startup, but it's probably a setting somewhere.",at this point your pc is completely quiet and at less than 500w for cpu+gpu.,i literally have zero worries about my 850w psu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think his point was that the older mobos are cheaper,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"well... considering that columbus, ohio is widely thought of as perhaps the leading test-marketing location in the usa for new products -- due to the perception of the city being the epitome of ""average,""in every possible sense of the word -- then it logically follows that it would produce ""average"" semiconductors as well.","once the fab is actually built and running, that is.",which it isn't.,"say, considering the semi-snarky tone of ""average ohio semiconductor"", is there some sort of geeky competition going on between intel's fab locations that i'm just not hip to?","if so, do tell!",i'm all-in when it comes to talking smack about things i know nothing about!,:-),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

gonna go against the grain and say that offering a complete line of hedt products is good.,some people need memory or io-heavy configurations or just want a starter chip and to upgrade down the road to split the cost up.,"there historically have been lots of products like i7 3820, 4820k, threadripper 1900x, etc that crossed over into ""regular desktop core count"" territory and that's fine, it doesn't hurt you to have the option available.","i specifically disliked when that option went away with threadripper 3000, and generally feel that was part of the overall big-picture of pushing asps upwards and forcing people to spend more for things they didn't necessarily want.","entry level hedt being accessible is a good thing - remember historically this went as low as $375 for a cpu and $200 for a mobo, it never has been high end, just higher than consumer.","cutting hyperthreading is dumb though, and i really don't see many people taking the 6c and 8c most likely (although there will be a few takers for storage servers or licensing reasons - and again licensing reasons are a place where capacity-on-demand helps too).",even the customers who might be interested will probably want ecc.,"weâ€™ll also have to see how well the mcm solution performs, of course.","first-gen epyc was pretty bad and even with 2 dies here the scaling may not be all that amazing (and thatâ€™s a broader criticism of sapphire rapids in general, not just the ws series).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm glad intel is bringing high core count + high i/o solutions to the desktop, it has been too long and prices have suffered with no competition in the market.",i'm also glad that these cpus are now been referred to as workstation cpus rather than hedt because i doubt we're going to see hedt prices unless you're only looking at only the <16 core range.,"with names like 'w7-3465x' these are meant to compete with threadripper pro, will be interesting to see how these xeon cores compete considering the lower cpu clocks compared to threadripper but that's where the ipc will do the talking.",hopefully these cpus provide good alternatives to threadripper pro and result in more sane pricing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that is just a rumor though.,but it might also be a special design for data bandwidth per thread.,all kinds of weird designs are made for specialized needs.,amd for example has an epyc sku with just single core active per chiplet to maximize cache and data bandwidth per core.,that's a $3000 8 core.,or it could be basically a cheap design for the bulk workstations that don't actually need much computational power but the oem benefits from having them on the same platform with the bigger ones.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

at least -50mv on core voltage offset will be safe and you improve your temps a little!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

with my nh-d15, temps under full load cinebench r23 average 89 to 91c.",it runs hot though within spec.,i would have thought even at 5.6ghz with e cores off would have provided enough thermal headroom to have better temps.,if your e cores are on and p cores clocked nearly as high as mine my cooling setup or mount must be crappy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

everything is stock currently with e cores on.,it runs 5.5 or 5.8ghz.,i hadn't attempted to tweak just yet as the load temps were too high for my preference with such a beefy air cooler.,i haven't gone over 89c yet at 100% load but i only ran it for about 5 minutes.,"the back of the pc i/o panel is already too hot for my liking and i'll probably end up see how close i can get to stock speeds while under volting instead of what i normally do (maxing out speed)

this was before any undervolting.,"i'd expect you should get no higher than 30s idle, but i'm not an expert, so please check with others.","i don't have a graphics card, which might account for a large part of my lower idle.",quiet cases do tend to run a bit warmer.,i have a front mesh (meshify) case.,"if your quiet case has a front door that you can open or front filter you can remove, try that.",also check your idle temp with fans at full speeds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have a 64gb optane in my system as a scratch disk and use it from my most used apps and it doesnt really make a difference from my wd black ssd.,"i also have 64gb of ram and used to make a ramdisk to do this also, same thing.","if you are going for absolute fastest, it would have to be a ramdisk, get like 128gb and put your most used programs in there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is a reason optane is dying.,even compared to a gen 3 nvme.,not at all worth the complexity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"could just be me, but i personally noticed no differences when switching from a 250gb samsung 860 evo to an optane drive as my main os disk.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ignoring the insanely priced p5800x, optane is not worth it for regular users compared to a good quality pcie 4.0 ssd.","donâ€™t forget that on the currently supported hybrid drives, the ssd portion gets pcie 3.0 x2, and the optane portion pcie 3.0 x2, so maximum sustained transfers are way below a normal 3.0 ssd, never mind a 4.0.

unless youâ€™re running a database server serving tons of requests, the reduced latency - which yes, is quite a bit better - is not something especially noticeable during normal use, and kind of balanced out by the reduced performance elsewhere.","if your goal is latency and nothing else, then i guess it would make sense, but if the goal is balanced performance, i would say a good pcie 4.0 ssd - maybe even a raid 0 of multiple drives if you want to go wild - would be better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>i know chasing 1-2 seconds in a best case scenario seems silly.,"real world you're usually chasing milliseconds, not seconds.",not very many programs are actually bottlenecked by latency alone.,"usually it's a combination of latency, bandwidth, cpu and internal software delays for synchronization.","get a fast disk that's large enough for your needs, whatever that ends up being.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there was a video showcase on this sub opening some >20 programs all at once on optane.,it was pretty cool.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how about optane p5800x?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ssd's are fairly cheap these days, especially 120 gb sata models, even 120 gb nvme models.",running 4 of them in raid 0 would probably work well for 4k randoms.,there's also pcie sata cards that can mount the ssds,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you're gonna go for optane, get a newer model.","you'll see small improvements to loading times across a variety of programs, here's a loading time test i did with a few drives

"i mainly have it for endurance reasons

optane never panned out.,"tried it, bandwidth and capacity are more important.",just buy a primocache license and more ram.,slipstream your windows down to the bare minimum support you need.,disable cpu throttling.,itâ€™ll be snappy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
disastrous time?,i am assuming that is because intel stopped producing the optane?,"if you get one today, you'll use it till it dies which can be many years from now.",right?,by then replace it with a gen6 or 7 or 8 or 9 or whatever gen that year will be.,so it doesn't matter if there are more of the optane around or not because by then the newest ssd will be faster than the current optane.,i don't know of any gen 4 that are out now.,i know that samsung's 990 is coming out on the 21st of this month.,i don't think you'll find any comparisons between an optane and a gen 4 ssd.,why would a reviewer spend time on this type of performance comparison when they know the optane is not being produced anymore.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

optane has like the best random read and write speeds,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so you download the compressed file and save it onto your optane drive and then decompress it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how do you slipstream windows?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's very fast (ever used a linux live cd?),but disk persistence can be problematic.,the most useful configurations i've seen for ramdisks are temporary storage for high-io operations as well as a generic read-cache populated at startup.,configuring the system to load a few games (especially if you play them often) from disk into the cache at startup can help quite a bit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the programs mirrors to a drive upon reboot, never had a problem.",there are free ramdisks from everyone from ms to amd.,also top end ssds are at all time lows like 980pro for $120 if you only have pcie 3.0 or a hynix p41 plat if you have 4.0. the real optaned were only geared for servers and tuned for database workloads.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i got a 13600k on an msi z690 carbon, bequiet!",240 aio and was getting those temps while running cinebench r32 (whenever the pc mangaged to finish the test and not crash).,i had to reduce the power on pl1 and pl2 since msi motherboards have the nasty habit of pumping your pl1 and 2 values through the roof if you selected a water cooler (they were set to 4092 watts).,"that deffinetly helped, i was able to reduce temps to low 70s-80 celsius and actually allowed for cinebench r32 to finish with no issues (scored 2124 btw)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just got done testing my new setup against cyberpunk 2077 with crowd density maxed out and graphics turned to ultra.,i have the i5-13600k cooled with the nh-d15 (which is like the goat of air coolers) inside a fractal torrent (which seems like one of the best picks for air cooling towers right now).,i haven't messed with any bios settings or anything else.,everything is stock performance.,i just plugged it in and turned it on.,i parked v outside the main hub where it's super crowded for like 30 minutes and just sorta ran around while watching temps for all 6 p cores.,it's 68 degrees fahrenheit (20c) inside my home right now.,cpu temps didn't want to go above 60c.,they did spike above it.,one time i saw 67 on one of the cores.,"usually they hovered between 58-63, mostly staying at 60. i called it after 30 minutes.",pretty happy with this setup.,these raptor lake chips are a bit warmer than older ones though.,"after closing the game and writing this comment, i checked the temps again and all cores are idling at 28-30c.","based on what some others have said here, i feel really good about my setup.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

approach: i didn't want to lose capability from the cpu, otherwise what would be the point of buying a good cpu right ?",so my first approach was to just modify easy settings.,remediation: i changed one single entry in the msi configuration.,"in oc set cpu cooler tuning to ""boxed cooler"".",by default mine was on tower cooler.,i know that the d15 is a tower cooler but what is really do is change the max power provided to the cpu from 270 (tower setting) to 180 (box setting).,"which is anyway the max power wanted by this cpu, so basically we are just saying ""don't overfeed it"".","results:  
cinebench results: multi: 23350 single: 1970

i had to use a water cooler this cpu just runs hot dude the days of air coolers are over with this gen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm looking to get a 13600k.,i currently have a xeon e5-2697v3 which at full load is around 70c.,heat is really a concern especially for summer months where my a/c can run constantly (other issues there but won't address them now).,from the video if i set to mode 5 that should keep me around where i want to be.,do you think my setup will be stable on an air cooled heatsink say the deepcool ak620?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why mode 2 and not mode 1?,was it unstable?,"i disabled half the e-cores, hyperthreading, & enhanced turbo.",cpu lite mode 1 seems to be working for me with prime95.,highest temps i can get are low 80s when stressing only the p-cores (if i stress all cores the temps are lower).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
doesn't disabling enhanced turbo drop the max frequency from 5.1 to 3.5ghz?,seems like a big performance hit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"exact same motherboard and cpu, i fixed my temps by reducing the lite load from (12 default) to 5, its like a -20, -25c difference, i was hitting 99c as soon as i was pressing start on cinebench, crazy stuff, now im sitting at 75-78 with mode 5 with no performance or instability issues, mode 1 indeed is too low",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i've heard but i'm not a fan of aio reliability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what stress test are u using,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm not sure since i applied everything all at once but what really made a difference was going in msi bios and adjusting the cpu advanced features from mode 12 to mode 9 ðÿ‘,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would you happen to know what those setting are on a asrock motherboard?,"iâ€™m having heat problems with my 13600k on a 240mm aio, corsair 4000d.",i also reseated my cooler and it still didnâ€™t seem to help.,it reaches 90-95c in cinebench.,60c in games.,it is pulling 230 watts on stock speeds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"hey, i wanted to get this setup too, is the thermal paste that comes with the liquid 280 enough or should i buy some extra?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
does the thermaltake plate help at all?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"open the case,turn on the pc,watch the fans spinning up.",they should be spinning relativelylow and even speed without serious load on the cpu.,then after a few minutes start a benchmark or game or whatever what will load your cpu to 100 celsius degrees.,the fans should not keep the same speed under heavy load like they do in idle state.,"if they do,than something is wrong with the speed control of the fans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah i am recommending an aio cooler for the 12th+13th gen also, i think you may be confusing my bios configuration about the boxed cooler.","that is just a setting to bring the cpu power consumption down, to reduce temps.",my aio runs the same with the lower setting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there probably is a performance drop, but while i'm waiting on a new triple fan aio cooler then this is an ok solution for the temps for now",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if you play on a 240x160p screen you should get the i9-13900ks for less bottleneck.,"now for real, if you only gonna play even with the i5 13600k you will not have any issue.","i have r7 1700x and rtx 3070, and i play everything in 1440p and guess what?","the bottleneck in my setup is my 1440p 165hz monitor, because fisically it cant show more than 165fps in any game",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

a 12100 will definitely bottleneck it in a lot of games,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
processors from 12th gen and ryzen 5000 series won't be a bottleneck even 11th gen won't be a bottleneck to a 3080 at 1440p so you are pretty safe buying a 13th gen or ryzen 7000 series.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don't shift to a 13900kf shift to a 13600k it would be a hell of an improvement over a 2nd gen ryzen.,13900kf is fast but not as much a fast as 13600k or kf that it is noticeable.,you can also switch to 5800x 3d just upgraded the bios on your motherboard and the 5800x 3d is a drop in upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"meh, i've run crazy voltages before, have good water-cooling and i upgrade fast.","also intel doesn't check warranty claims for damage due to over voltage damage (which it isn't technically, because 1.5v is within spec).",but i've yet to kill a cpu due to voltage.,the only dead cpu i've had drowned when my water loop had a leak because i'm an idiot.,so i'm not worried that it'll die and i'm not worried about getting it replaced *if* it dies.,i'm just also confident that i'll probably clock higher if i walk right over their auto settings and do it myself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

where exactly did i say 'at stock with no overclocking'?,asus mce / gigabyte auto oc is not stock with no overclocking!,gigabyte shoving 1.5v into these chips for 6.0 on two cores is not stock with no overclocking.,what exactly is wrong with your reading comprehension?,"all the cases of degradation so far are with far less than 1.5v core voltage which this gigabyte feature is doing, and likely also less than whatever asus mce puts through them, i mean you are literally commenting in a thread about overclocking these chips to 6.0, not about running them at stock.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it is true.,if a 65nm chip could experience much more degradation at 1.5v then a 14nm one which has far less atoms per transistor is going to experience electromigration even faster.,and my experience with this 7700k proves that to be true.,i didn't even push super hard with insane workloads and it still lost stability at previously good voltages multiple times.,"it's reality, it's physics and there's no avoiding it.","seriously go look into electromigration, read up on it and understand what it is.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"it's weird it's telling you to download a copy, as intel is not offering codes to download mw2, but rather the game becomes available when you link your intel account to your battlenet account, and from the screenshots, it looks like account linkage succeeded.","i'd say to make sure you have a phone number associated to your battlenet account, as it is required by the game.","if you're still having issues, start by contacting support at [https://softwareoffer.intel.com/support](https://softwareoffer.intel.com/support)

best of luck!","&#x200b;

edit: another thing that came to mind is that it could be a cookie related issue.","try opening incognito mode, sign into intel gaming software, click on the modern warfare 2 bundle, and check if you have a ""how to claim"" window at the bottom of the page.","if you do, try going through the linking process again while you're using incognito mode.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i signed out of my social media account to re-sign into intel dashboard and managed to get rid of the 303 error.,i don't know if this is because of it being fixed and a coincidence or if it is a solution.,i did it because this is a common cause for accounts being locked on the faq.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

u fixxed it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's unironically exactly what's happening.,i've been able to recreate the redeem now option to redeem the game 3 times and two of the times it said they are out of codes.,not sure why but it's definitely an issue with codes and not server because you can recreate the redeem option by basically opening 20 tabs and using the tabs that work over and over and the end result is always out of codes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

code wise they should basically have unlimited codes.,seems like a activision issue of not supplying the codes fast enough more than intel.,or maybe just because the website was so dead that error message would just display instead of another error message.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you are in golden territory though!",!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what so is an upgrade worth it from 12900k to 13900k if you sell 12900k?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how did you get it so cheap?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i see your running an asus board i canâ€™t figure out how to get to bios what method did you use to get there?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can you get this data without booting to the uefi bios?,can you use a utility to get it in windows?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mine is a sp 95. p core 105 and e core 78.,"&#x200b;

i think this is average for this chip as i so far have not heard of any lower and only some higher.",the chip is already highly binned to be a 13900k.,"&#x200b;

although i very happy with my 13900k i did hope of corse of a so called golden chip because i bought at launch hehe but i guess they are very rare and iâ€™m not really into buying a lot of them picking the best returning rest â€¦ just not my style.",also because there is potential never to get one after a lot of work and money out swimming until refunds etc.,"&#x200b;

at least i feel very good about the bin because my last cpu the 10900k was one of the lowest bin, a sp63.",did run 5 ghz great though.,but you donâ€™t have a lot of wiggle room with 13900k â€¦ 100-200mhz or at very best 300mhz (5.8ghz all core ) â€¦.,i can run 5.5 and 5.6 pretty descent but 5.7 require a lot more and very much for 5.8 ghz.,stock 5.5 or 5.6 would be the wisest choice.,but i have invested a ton of money in cooling and tool which are shipping to me as we speak so iâ€™m going for 5.7 ghz.,"i am waiting for de lid kit, iâ€™m gonna lap, liquid metal under ihs and bought a flat cold plate for my water block .",so i deserve at least 5.7ghz hahaâ€¦iâ€™m not sure if i wanna oc the e cores.,they are not really used and they are supposed to be efficient and i donâ€™t want to use additional power budget on them.,p cores are what matters and i am working to get ring cache higher than 45x but so far unstable.,i donâ€™t know why?,48-50x cache eventually crashes even on manual voltage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think you lost actually...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i believe sp is based on how low the temperature is on ur cpu is at boot up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what do those numbers mean?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thank you!,yeah i got it for $350 so not a bad upgrade.,$300 off  lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

damn you lucky mf lol.,nice my 12900k was 78 but this one is 96 i was shocked lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same... bought on release date and got 110/88.,i assume after a while intel starts holding back good chips for the ks variants.,so maybe it's the advantage of buying early.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

asus' intel boards have the ability to readout and display the voltage/frequency curve as programmed into the cpu by intel at the factory.,"it's interesting because every individual cpu has their own unique v/f for every p-core, e-core cluster, cache/ring and even the integrated memory controller.",the predicted overclockability of the cpu is condensed into a single rating known as the sp which serves 2 purposes: as an input for the ai oc autoaoverclocking feature and for extreme overclockers to be able to bin cpus quickly and accurately.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s a maximus ai ocing approximation based on your cpu cooler and cpu performanceâ€¦my 10700k was a 72 lmao,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
haha yeah i work pretty hard and have no expenses.,thanks lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
damn you probably have a 100+ sp with that voltage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably not safe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

a better sp will request less voltage and run cooler.,the really good chips present vids of 1.35v or so.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

estimation of chip quality based on how low the vid is.,it kinda predicts overclocking potential.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nope got it on a discount lol $300 off baby,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and it was pocket change so it didnâ€™t matter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i noticed a difference between the two.,1% lows are better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
got my 12900k for free sold it for $300 and used it to buy the 13900k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"asus has an exclusive algorithm that calculates how good your silicon quality in your chip is which translates to how well it can overclock 

70-80 =shit 
80-90= alright but below average
90-100= average 
100 -110= great 
110+= golden chip 

the p cores and e cores have different scores since they are different ccds.",e cores will always be lower than p cores,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
â€¦.what?,did you reply to the wrong comment?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not if itâ€™s $300 off lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hahahah i am lol you know what im happy with this score my 12900k was 78. ill take this nice upgrade lool,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you tested manual oc on your chip?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"quick question about memory, whats the optimal speed and latency.",i tried reading and ended up a rabbit hole of 2 vs 4 dimms and different opinions on it.,i like 4 cause of the look but  people say its wrong.,i got a gift card from bb so i will most likely purchase everything from them if that matters.,could do another vendor for memory if needed be.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its based on your cpu v/f curve cooler score has nothing to do with your sp.,"you can adjust your cooler score and optimism score to tweak how the ai will oc your cpu, and is actually great and just as good as anything manual",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i suppose that isnâ€™t terrible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thats what im saying you dont need manual overlocl because the cpu already coming with a insane factory overclock that doing 5.5 ghz all.cores.,so sp predictions is not so important anymore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well you are right but i oc my with 1.29v at 5.7 p and 4.5 e cores.,temps are just fine under cinabench r23 87c max.,i have to say my multiscore is 41550,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you need to reset your sp and you're not going to like this one bit.,"your sp gets glitched if you install a cpu with an old management engine (me) firmware on z690
first, upgrade your me firmware with the patcher.","if you have dual bios you need to do this on both bios chips

https://rog.asus.com/forum/showthread.php?126385-firmware-intel-me-(h610-b660-h670-z690-b760-h770-z790)

then, flash your bios to the latest version for your board.","not sure if it's on the asus support site, the motherboard forum section here or rog forums or not.",make sure you flash both bios chips (you can use usb flashback to avoid annoyances).,"the current me version should be kept, if it's not , check the bios boot screen for the version after upgrading.",now you need to remove the cpu.,"first, before you remove the cpu, power off the system, unplug/switch off the psu and then clear the cmos by either the onboard jumper or the clr rtc/jumper blocks (you can use a spare ln2 board jumper if there's one available or a screwdriver if there is no back button).",hold the clear cmos down for 30 seconds.,then immediately remove the cpu completely.,then clear cmos again with the cpu removed.,"now, attempt to power on the system with the cpu removed.","of course nothing will happen, but this is to make sure everything is cleared.","then re-insert the cpu, clear cmos again 30 seconds.","then finally, re-do the thermal paste, install the cooler, plug in the psu and boot the system.",the sp should now be reported correctly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

wdym,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
where did he get that degree at?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just curious why did you upgrade from a 12900k to 13900k?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's exclusive to asus.,msi has a far more primitive version called cpu force 2 on their motherboards which scores cpus based on their voltage and temperature in bios while at stock clocks/voltages.,"in that scoring system, a typical 13900k scores 150 points (according to sug0ilover who binned many chips) with above average chips scoring lower - 140, 130, 120, 107 (sug0i's golden sample) etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s exclusive to rog maximus afaik-not just asus itself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if your listening to pcmr on fb they will laugh at you if you have 4 slots and 2 sticks, which is dumb, 2 sticks is always better for overclocking, latency, longeveity, stability and heat.",so if you want 64gb of ram get 2x 32 gb sticks.,though with ddr5 you can run dual channel off 1 stick.. google it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, should get better over time.",plus my room was already hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what type of cooling are you running?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
im reading this weeks later and for some reason im running into issue like 2 out of 4 sticks of ram and my first m.2 slot isnâ€™t being recognized.,i rma the mobo and asus said its fine not sure whats going on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
haha nah not a baller just manage my money well lol.,yeah true.,also does your 13900k run at a all core 5.5 on the p cores?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no problem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
got my 12900k for free sold it for $300,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to be fair, he already has the mobo for it, so itâ€™s a strait swap, and you can still sell a 12900k for about 75% of the value of a 13900k

even if it is silly for someone to spend so much on a used 12900k, here we are.","so the actual upgrade cost is really quite cheap, and the increase in performance is quite significant",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got my 12900k for free and decided to sell it for $300 so i that profit to the 13900k and got it for $350,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the explanation!,i assume i have no way to get this information on an asrock board?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not quite.,it there on my strix and formula.,not sure where you got that information from but it's wrong.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
asus 360 ryujin 2â€¦ i have to say my ddr4 runs 4300 cl15 gear 1. also i have frame instead motherboard bracket,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no one buys 12900ks second hand for that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how did you get a free 12900k?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in my experience with my asus prime z170-a (didnâ€™t feature it, also was much more bland uefi-but otherwise very similar) maximus rog hero z490, & z690â€¦.and afaik is an acronym for as far as i know-but now i know that the rog strix mobos also feature it!",thank you!,iâ€™m guessing itâ€™s an rog feature then?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12900k is still only $60 cheaper than 13900k in western canada.,a little cheaper for black friday sales.,people see an i9 and see 600 instead of 800 prices.,add to that they are available used.,yes there is definitely a substantial market of people who will purchase them for 75% of the cost.,not understanding that 13700 and even 13500 in some cases would be just as good.,they just see i9 unlocked.,"factor in release 12900k that didnâ€™t have avx disabled on chip,  there are even informed people with certain needs that would leap at a og 12900k at 25% cheaper than a 13900k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

had something similar happen to me on an msi board but neither the lan or wi-fi worked.,i had to use a usb drive and download the intel drivers from another computer and install it to the new computer.,so weird that i had to do that.,maybe you can reinstall the intel drivers or make sure you down load it from the intel website itself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

go to the motherboard manufacturer and go to your driver page for your motherboard and you should download the lan driver.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

using what cooler?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
see what the power draw is.,"you can undervolt or set a power limit etc......

as another poster said it depends on the cooler.",it also depends on the case cooling and the cpu usage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that sounds about right.,iâ€™m seeing high 70s on the 13900k with a 360 aio cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at stock settings those temps aren't surprising.,it's not your cooler it's the power consumption.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm looking at slightly lower temps in a hyte y60 with a deepcool castle 360ex and 7 case fans.,today i was from mid 70s and high 60s on a normal gaming load and mostly low 80s on a stressed load.,it's a warm chip and will definitely be hot most of the time unless you are running custom loops or top notch cooling options.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yea i am sitting sitting around 89 degrees while gaming.,i am using the h150i elite lcd cpu cooler.,i think they just run hot...i first tried the msi mag coreliquid c240 but the temo of my cpu was high (like it is now) so i switched to the h150i for more cooling and it seems to behave the same way...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm a little late to the party but anyway heres my experience: im using the h150i elite 360mm cooler form corsair.,games like mw2 or apex run at around 60-65c.,"hottest game i ran so far was battlefield 2042, hitting an average of about 75c, sometimes hitting the 80's.",cpu running on stock settings btw.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"undervolting is better, after that on top you may or not want to add power limiting.","with undervolting you can run same or higher clocks even at lower temps, with less voltage delivered to chip.","while power limiting is usually limiting power delivered to get lower temps, it can better your performance, but not always.","for example in auto a chip can run 5ghz at 1.2v, with maunaul setting the voltige you can potentially lower it.","so rhe chip runs 5ghz at 1.1v, that lower the temps and makes the clocks more stable, potentially increasing boost time frame or even it could run 5.1ghz at 1.1v.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2 44m 360s,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at first i was pretty unsure if my temps are normal as well since the cpu runs really hot compared to my older ones.,iâ€˜ve also watched some reviews and i think the raptor lake generation is just a really hot one as most of the videos have similar temps to mine.,so far my cooling hasnâ€™t really improved a lot but i heard that undervolting the 13th gen chips can bring some pretty big temp improvements and only decreses performance by a few percent.,might have to try that out once as my case has pretty good airflow (corsair 5000d airflow) and iâ€™m still reaching those temps.,performance whise im really happy tho and it doesnâ€™t seem to thermal throttle as fast as some other chips.,let me know if you find something else that could help cooling!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

is stretching ddr4 support for so long really a good idea?,i feel like they should just pull the band-aid off with ddr5 only support but aren't doing so just to have at least one competitive advantage over amd.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the thing is that amd at least has an edge in the gaming market.,"the 5800x3d is still very capable and performant â€“ and fits on dirt-cheap, old boards with ddr4 memory.","it's a no-brainer upgrade for all amd users and even when buying new, it's a good value choice because you can literally take the cheapest board and ddr4 ram you can find without any performance impact.",the release of the new 7000 series x3d cpus are already scheduled for next year.,"if they are anything like the 5800x3d, then intel is absolutely under pressure, as there is nothing in the intel pipeline that can match those cpus in gaming.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ddr4 support is the one competitive advantage intel has right now.,"for anyone  that upgrades every five years or so and is coming from a build that already has ddr4, raptor lake is an excellent choice.","for those that upgrade more often, say, every 1-3 years, then buying into am5 now and making the jump to zen6 in 2025 or 2026 is a much wiser investment.","upgrade path aside, am5 is just flat out a better platform than lga1700 given the additional pcie 5.0 support.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel are financially shaky at the moment, amd is not.","intel are probably smarter in this respect, knowing gamer's who already have ddr4 can buy new motherboards.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"especially since current mobo/ram memory controllers probably wonâ€™t even support those speeds so am5 people will have to upgrade as well, seeing that the 7950x is already struggling to get 7000+ on ddr5",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'd say the reason productivity has taken a backseat is due to the performance in general.,all but the absolute slowest cpus take care of most productivity tasks fast enough that unless you're doing it professionally it's just not worth getting a higher end cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i prefer intel but the 5800x3d is amazing in some games where intel lacks, escape from tarkov with a 5800x3d beats streamers using a 12900k/3090 with my 5800x3d/3080, while i'd be more than happy to take on the 13600k why buy a new board and ddr5 when a quick drop in upgrade can keep me going, x570 has all the features i currently need.","i'll wait for cheaper motherboards from both sides and the faster ram kits that will also drop in price will be nice to get when i upgrade gpu in a few years, with how nvidia and amd are being so greedy with pricing on gpu's that'll be some time away.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i skipped the whole amd zen thing and still run a 6700k but i'm not going to upgrade to 5800x3d.,because it wil be cheaper in the long run to jump on 7600x and ddr5 and get a high end chip in 4/5 years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that kind of ipc gain is actually really good gen on gen...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 7700x and the 5800x3d are the same price and perform equally well.,"since i was building from scratch i purchased (in canada) the 7700x for $330usd, the strix b650-a for $285usd and ddr5 ram for 225usd.",if i built with the 5800x3d i may have saved $250usd but i figured it made sense to spend the extra and be good until 2025 with regards to future proofing for amd cpus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sorry i have to step in here that makes no sense.,"first, 13% ipc improvement is ***massive.","***

second, zen3 to zen4 was only around a %3 increase.",for reference intel 12gen to 13gen was a 1% ipc increase.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i feel like in  a transitional period this is fine, especially since board partners can make ddr5 only boards.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"probably the ddr4 variants will be primarily for mid-ranged to low-end boards, primarily the h770 and b760 lineups.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> is stretching ddr4 support for so long really a good idea?,how is this stretching?,"alder lake supported it, why wouldn't its successor on the same socket?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you really complaining about having more consumer choice?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,not only ver cost effective for the consumer and producer but also good in a sense that ddr4 still holds up very well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"we're only talking about 13th gen here, right?","the socket, shared with 12th gen, already supports ddr4, so it would be dumb to prohibit the majority of 12th gen owners from upgrading their cpu.",when 12th gen was planned ddr5 was very rare.,so compatibility was a necessity.,"when 13th gen was planned, chip shortages were still pretty bad, so limiting compatibility would be a risky bet on ddr5 being as plentiful as all the cpus you wanted to sell.",it makes a lot more sense to go ddr5-only in the next socket design.,"amd simply got to the socket transition point sooner, and the ddr5 supply was just good enough to risk taking the leap.",(which also makes sense if they plan to keep the socket around for a long time.),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the increased cache and lack of infinity fabric style arch seems to result in intel still seeing near ddr5 (base speeds) performance with ddr4 kits.,"so for budget builds, it really is an advantage.","people can reuse their 3200/3600 ddr 4 kits, and save $250 in ddr5/motherboard costs and get very similar performance out of a chip like the 13400. which will beat the entire zen 3 lineup aside from 5800x3d.",for cheap.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s the real tradeoff involved with long support for a socket: youâ€™re tied to the choices you made at the start.,"so amd had to rip the ddr5 bandaid off with am5, since they plan to support that socket for 5+ years like they did with am4.","on the other hand, since intel switches sockets every other year, they can afford to support ddr4 & ddr5 simultaneously on their current socket, and delay ripping that bandaid off until 14th gen when the ddr5 market is more mature.",the upside for the intel strategy is that you can target more price points with the same platform.,the upside to the amd strategy is that it makes it possible for users to upgrade their systems down the line for a much lower price.,"on the whole, i think the optimal target is probably somewhere in the middle, likely on the order of 3-4 generations, instead of 2 or 5+.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"meteor lake won't support it, so this is the last platform to do so.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the whole 3d v-cache situation is super interesting to me.,intel at least had the capacity of doing the same thing.,they added edram to the i7 5770c back in the day pretty much just because it would have been a pos without it.,so i'm surprised that they just let amd eat their lunch on that front.,"but amd, by releasing the 5800x3d kinda cannibalized their own 7000 series chips.","it seems to me like everybody has the ability to add these huge cache systems, and knows it's pretty much the silver bullet for gaming, but really don't want to release products that have it unless they feel like they have to.",and when they do neither company seems very good at assessing it's market position.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cheapest boards won't run 5800x3d at its full capacity.,let's not misinform people.,5800x3d requires decent to high end mobo too just like intel counter parts.,x3d variant is expensive compared to 12600k and 13600k.,"they perform similar in gaming, x3d is faster in some and around 30%-50% slow in multicore/production tasks.",given pricing of x3d and 13600k you are always better off buying 13600k even for gaming.,edit : well am done explaining this.,"everybody is just guessing and claiming.. no source, just parroting what someone said.",there is one source from amd unboxed and am not surprised that its the only source.,thank you everyone for participating in the game of *no actual proof*.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for gaming yes overall 5800xd is useless  even zen4 xd will not be able to beat raptor lake with high memory speeds or highly tunned ram and just need another zen moment intel is even planning lunch a raptor lake refresh and push meteor lake to 2024 since amd will not be able to match with raptor lake performance at gaming and overall,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i used to think the same, i also upgrade every 5 years.",but i was looking at the options of upgrading my pc.,maybe i could reuse the mobo (b350m board for 1st gen ryzen) and put ryzen 5 5600 in it.,ram?,"2400mhz, even though it's still ddr4 would like something faster.",psu?,"650w was great few years ago, but may not be enough for a beefy gpu.",gpu - obviously to be replaced.,"so outside of case, maybe psu and maybe motherboard i still had to replace most parts.",i assume the same will happen to people buying into am5 now.,your 5600mhz ddr5 will be a lowend ddr5 in 5 years and you'll want to buy an entry level ddr6 anyway.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this is just the mantra which ties the whole platform to the cheapest component, the mobo - ridiculous.",with intel you can sit out the next two years and swap to ddr5 with the same cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nothing about the amd platform is good.,i have an am4 5800x parired with gigabyte x570 master and it is a dog shit platform.,"i have had nothing but driver issues and problems, not very often but they are there.",i have never had such problems on intel.,i will never buy amd again.,"amd has shit driver support, still to this day after over 10 years.","i first dumped their gpus and now their cpus, never again.","if feels to me like ignorance is bliss in this situation, i suspect that people that have the odd driver issue or compatibility problem just assume that it is a pc thing.","it is not, coming from an x99 platform prior to this setup i can say i have never had such diriver problems like i do on x570.",could be the manufacturer.,"anyways, i switched to gen 13 intel now, just waiting on my cpu water block.",not looking back.,amd is a good entry cpu manufacturer plaqued with some driver issues.,also the infinity fabric design is utter trash.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is that to say that ddr4 and ddr5 compatibility for raptor lake os stemmed from the financial troubles intel is experiencing until now?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
stock price isn't everything.,intel is still grossing nearly a hundred billion a year.,their finances are fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i donâ€™t think it has anything to do with intelâ€™s finances.,ddr2 and ddr3 where both supported by amd and intel during the transition period.,ddr4 support was first added by intel on haswell hedt where price sensitivity was not a problem.,consumer skylake released after that still supports ddr3 memory.,"without hedt/server leading the adoption of ddr5, it is a sensible move by intel to both support ddr4 and ddr5 and it probably paid back, when ddr5 was barely available at launch.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the current amd chips can barely get to 6400 let alone 7000.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i saw a poor guy yesterday that couldn't get his 5800x3d to post with a 3200mhz kit.,had to run it at 2666. there is something to be said about intels imc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would have to agree.,even the lower tier cpus these days are fully capable.,"and as you said, if you do it professionally and make money, then those minutes will add up to $$.",but not super applicable to your average consumer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yea why buy new if you already have x570.,no point.,plug in a x3d and rip!,our hope with gpus is that intel actually starts to infringe into nvidiaâ€™s bottom line.,time will tell!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"zen 4 is impressive, but the terrible ihs design handicaps the potential.",the entire am5 lineup will suffer from the same flaw going forward.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"those results are also inflated by the use of ddr5 ram so i doubt the ""real"" performance uplift is that big.",take for example the performance difference of 13th gen when using ddr4 vs ddr5.,if anything i'd argue the actual performance uplift of zen4 is somewhat unimpressive if we also include the fact that they jumped to lower nm.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"honestly, if you've waited that long and don't have to upgrade right now waiting for the 7000 x3d early next year may be worth it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as much as 13% is good from gen to gen. the price just isn't good at all.,"the cpu is $50 increase across the board, the motherboards are another $50 - 100. and ontop of that, they only support ddr5, which is another $50 - 100 across the board.","piles it all together, they are $150 more expensive for similar performance compared to intel's platform.",how do you expect 13% to be enough?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"zen 4 isn't a bad improvement gen-on-gen, but amd's priced it out of competitiveness thanks to hugely expensive motherboards.",the mediocre io-die situation is also pretty appalling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no joke... where was this guy when intel only progressed 5% in 4 years across 4 generations and changed the socket 3 times in the process.,skylake to comet lake was nothing more than more cores and a few instruction sets.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"plus that the premium boards + good cpu chips can take ridiculous bandwidth anyway, so accepting ddr4 hasn't really slowed down ddr5 advancement either.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for some reason i thought they were talking about meteor lake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's not just the socket by the way, the memory controller is also basically unmodified - hence keeping keeping ddr4 support not really being an significant engineering expense.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i donâ€™t know if that completely accurate about needing high end boards for the 5800x3d.,the performance on b350 boards showed the same performance when gaming.,granted they didnâ€™t test every single b350 board but the screenshot attached showed there were no difference between the three gens of am4 chipsets.,https://ibb.co/pdgwhn4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">800x3d requires decent to high end mobo

does it though?","you already can't overclock, so if the vrm holds fine at stock, then that's it.","cheap amd mobos support fast ddr4 ram anyway, so the high end option is more about io with a 5800x3d.","sure, check if the mobo you are getting has good vrm, but that's pretty much it with 5800x3d",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not really.,"cheap boards are doing fine, same as cheap ram.",especially when you look at real-world performance.,"the beauty of the 5800x3d is that the overall system costs less than a 12600k or 13600k system, as they require more expensive ram and more expensive mainboards to perform well.","people upgrading often need to buy only a new cpu, while upgrading to an alder or raptor lake system also requires at least a new mainboard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what would even be the point of getting an adl or rpl cpu with ddr4 just to swap out the motherboard and memory in two years just to keep the same cpu?,it would be far more cost effective and a much bigger jump in performance to just get zen4 now and drop-in upgrade to zen5 in two years.,i seriously donâ€™t understand what iâ€™m getting downvoted for here.,"itâ€™s objectively true that am5 is superior to lga1700 in every way; pcie 5.0 support for m.2 and graphics, and an upgrade path on top of that.","the only issue is cost of b650e/x670e, but itâ€™s not as though z6/790 is exactly cheap either, besides some of the lower end stuff.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

itâ€™s easier to get a high speed on quad channel because itâ€™s the number times four instead of two.,i have 32gb of memory on my 10900k at 4400mhz c14.,iâ€™m wondering  how much faster your machine could be with better ram.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

dunno this review you linked compared ultra fast ddr3 to crappy ddr4.,if we do the same with something like 4200-4400mt/s ddr4 gear 1 tight timings and compare it to 5200c40 ddr5 i dont think the difference will be that much bigger.,6000cl30 which is used for most review in zen4 is way better.,there is a german site that did review with zen 4 at 5200mt/s and performance was way worse.,https://www.pcgameshardware.de/spider-man-miles-morales-spiel-72802/specials/pc-benchmark-technik-review-1407865/3/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't think so either.,that wasn't the point.,i was replying to their comment about going am5 now with a 7600x for longevity having waited to upgrade from their 6700k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
alder lake was over 2 years after comet.,"and given rocket lakes reception, many argued that wasnt a step forward from comet.",which makes the whole thing even worse.,"yes, alder lake was a huge breath of fresh air, and 13th is looking potent.",we're finally back to gen over gen improvements and competition.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how is the stagnation with intel at the time?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you even read the comment?,i didn't mention sandy at all.,skylake to comet is 6-10th gen. and it was the same architecture the whole time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's because of how the 5800x3d works.,the magic thing that this cpu does is simply using the l3 cache to reduce the time the cpu waits for the board.,"here is a comparison with 5 year old boards:

[https://www.techspot.com/review/2475-ryzen-5800x3d-older-am4-motherboards/](https://www.techspot.com/review/2475-ryzen-5800x3d-older-am4-motherboards/) there is a $100 msrp board in there, but the main thing here is that even the old chipsets don't really slow down the x3d.","here is a comparison for ddr4-3200 and -3800 showing negligible differences: [https://static.techspot.com/articles-info/2449/bench/hzd.png](https://static.techspot.com/articles-info/2449/bench/hzd.png) (and both outperform 12900ks with ddr5-6400 )

the 5800x3d doesn't even demand good quality vrms (gaming doesn't really stress the cpu much and it can't be overclocked anyway)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
first hand experience with aaa games.,my gaming power only exceeds 90w during black screen loading as monitored by hwinfo.,"&#x200b;

newsflash: gaming.....isn't very power intensive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am not making the claim that it does or does not.,you can't argue that i am spreading misinformation when there's no information in my post.,"the fact that you want to argue with everyone and anyone on the subject matter makes it hard to believe in the legitimacy of your unsourced claims, from where i stand there's an infinite amount of sources relative to your current none.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so then what were you saying in your original post?,what will a more expensive motherboard offer for the 5800x3d if not stronger vrms?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™ve got a b550 meg board and am pretty impressed with it for the most part.,"iâ€™m not an ultra enthusiast or anything, so i donâ€™t do a ton of in-depth tinkering other than a slight overclock on my memory and undervolt on my gpu.",iâ€™ve yet to have any issues with it.,for those that like to really dial in their settings then i concede intel seems best given the overall stability and overclocking headroom afforded by both the cpu and memory.,"but the average user canâ€™t really go wrong with amd, at least in my opinion.",sorry that your experience was less than ideal.,good luck with the new build though!,i was considering raptor lake as well but decided to stick with what i have for another few years.,"hopefully motherboards start trending down in price, because i agree.",$300 used to be enthusiast tier and now itâ€™s borderline mid-range.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whatâ€™s your source for this claim?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think this isnâ€™t correct.,"the frequency is defined by ddr (double data rate), and is completely independent from channel count.","overall it should be at least as difficult, usually more, to stabilize four channels instead of two.","this is completely different if running two dimms per channel of course, which will obliterate your signal integrity compared to four channels with a single dimm each.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"with intel money if they get the right people in they could have it fixed within a year or two, while working on bringing newer products to the market.","look at ati, the community alone have made awesome drivers for those products back in the day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fast ddr4 didn't exist when the 6700k launched.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
100% fair,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"comet was also literally the fifth time in a row that youâ€™ve shown skylake to the class, intel.","that era of total stagnation was very abnormal, even in the â€œbad yearsâ€ of ivy/haswell you still got 10-15% gen on gen. and obviously they were working in the background and just couldnâ€™t actually manufacture the stuff they were designing because of the 10nm problems.","rocket lake was disappointing too and they turned avx-512 into a mess on lga1700, but, at least client is moving forward again.","unfortunately for intel, while client is starting to recover, the server team is still very bottlenecked by the node and just not executing well on top of thatâ€¦ sapphire rapids had *13 known steppings*.",5 of them were base-layer changes even.,"thatâ€™s absolutely cray cray, when is the last time you saw an e2 stepping or whatever?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the steps from 6th all the way to 10th gen was like 2-3% increments for ipc because they kept the same basic architecture and only increased core count.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ipc slightly better from 12th -> 13th however 13th gen  clocks much higher, has more overclocking potential, better imc, and more cache.",the sweet part is the i5-13600k is a direct upgrade from the previous i7-12700k for cheaper.,same with i7-13700k vs i9-12900k/s,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you didnâ€™t specify anything, you said 4 years across 4 generations.",could be before or after skylake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

check out ahoc on youtube.,they arenâ€™t linked like there were with am4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
afaik first adopter of ddr4 was 6700 and then amd launched their first ddr4 cpus a year later?,am5 is almost a year later to support ddr5 compared to alder lake launch.,after that much time of course ddr5 is more matured and faster compared to what was available at the alder lake launch.,so i dont think those two are really comparable.,6400cl32 was practically a no-go 9 months ago because it cost 800â‚¬ if you could find it whereas now i bought it for 235â‚¬.,we all know 3rd gen to 11th intel gen saw very little performance increase per generation but i dont think this is something you have to feel good about beating when comparing ipc uplift generation per generation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
am i taking crazy pills?,"12th to 13th gen ipc gain was 1%, almost their worse ever.",i feel like most people in here do not understand what ipc means.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"bottom of that comment literally reads 

""skylake to comet lake was nothing more than more cores and a few instruction sets.""",so clearly you missed a huge portion of what i said.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m not debating price.,iâ€™m debating your argument that you need a high end motherboard in order to run the 5800x3d optimally.,iâ€™m not telling anyone to go buy a b350 motherboard but if someone has one already and wants to upgrade then itâ€™s possible to run that chip.,the video i sent shows there is virtually no difference in performance with their testing.,again not all boards are made the same so iâ€™m sure the bottom of the barrel (bad vrm) boards might not be a great fit.,if someone is new to am4 then absolutely go get the newest board if prices are decent.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"again, have a look at how the 5800x3d works and where the performance improvement in games mainly come from.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s irrelevant as the 5800x3d really doesnâ€™t put much pressure on the boards.,i often even see just around 60w of power consumption during gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"gigabyte x570si

itâ€™s got a-tier vrms on the ltt list.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, they arenâ€™t but that doesnâ€™t mean they are not gear 1. in fact it strengthens it because memory can now be overclocked independently (and fclk can be overclocked too).","on the other hand, intel is tied to gear 2 and thereâ€™s no working around that atm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its not a debate.,its misinformation from op that cheapest motherboards will run 5800x3d.,its clearly misinforming people.,"price determines cheap, decent, high end motherboard categories.",i never said there is performance difference betweens b350.,i said cheapest won't run it.,your video shows the same thing that i was claiming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
expensive one.. good for you .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel can go over 8000mhz on the ram.,"amd can barely go above 6200. 
in what way is that a strength?",their ddr5 memory controller isnâ€™t very good lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m confused.,please give me an example of a â€œcheapâ€ motherboard incapable of running it.,the b350 chipset was the cheaper chipset vs the x370.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you talking about â€œaâ€ series motherboards?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it was the same price as the b550i when i bought it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i bought this exact board from quietpc a couple of weeks ago and it came with the [1603 bios required for 13th gen](https://www.asus.com/news/oujwh1old5n6oglf/) (manufactured 07/2022.),"given the small volume of stock, you'd be unlucky to get an old build if you buy from an established retailer that sells out often.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

any reason why you want to pair a b series instead of z for a k series chip?,"and if you want compatibility out of the box, you would need to buy a z790, or at the least look for a 600 gen board with support for usb flashback.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i feel like it high compare to other processors 

can confirm this?",how much of temps you are getting?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for my asus board (tuf b660)it would have had to have been after 8/2022 for it to have the right bios.,if you contact asus support you can rma it and they will update it for you but you are looking at a couple of weeks between mailing time and their backlog.,i ended up going to microcenter and paying them $40 to upgrade the bios.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't think z series offers much anymore.,overclocking these chips is a useless venture except in competitive benchmarking.,most motherboard vendors published raptor lake compatible bios update already in july.,it's unlikely that boards would come with older bios versions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ez bios update is the standard bios update through the bios.,bios flashback would be mentioned on the product page and there would be a button for it on the back panel if the board supported flashing with no cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can reinstall windows without losing personal files.,you will lose installed applications though so bit of reinstalling to do.,i wouldn't recommend trying without reinstall.,sometimes it works but all kinds of weird problems can occur.,when i went from intel to amd many years ago it seemed to work but i had completely random stability problems before i reinstalled windows.,this time i went from amd to intel and windows crashed immediately on login screen every time before i reinstalled it.,edit: if you end up like me with inoperable windows just let it crash and restart a few times and it will eventually restart to the recovery mode where you can do the reinstalling.,you could also try with safe mode to manually fix it but it can be a bit tedious to go through all the drivers and removing everything you don't want anymore.,"editedit: oh, and the windows reinstall doesn't touch other drives except your system drive.",so if you have a steam library on another drive just reinstall steam and tell it where the library is and all the games will appear.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
backup important files and do a clean win install on new hardware... trust me i've been through a fuckton of hassle doing otherwise,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when you say 60% you mean 60 degrees?,run cinebench and report avg temps using hwinfo (reset log before you start the test of-course),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i guess i can buy a pentium for that price lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so buy a non k cpu then?,"also whether boards will come with that bios depends on if they were made after the update, most z690s are going to be old stock.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes 60 degree*, my bad 

i have recorded my temps using, cpu temp and msi centre 

when ever my all core hit 5.1 ghz , it touches 100 degree, 

what is your idle temp on 13600kf?",or 47 degree idle is normal for 13600kf or i have some fan mounting issue that why i'm getting high temps,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there aren't any non k 13th gen cpus yet.,"also, we don't yet know if 13th gen non k chips are going to suffer from same problems with system agent voltage than 12th gen non k chips.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
some people (like me) don't want to wait.,i was still using a i5-6600 (non-k).,i have fears about china's intentions for taiwan so i'd rather buy gear right now than wait for tsmc to be destroyed and a global ram/chip shortage.,i settled on the asus tuf b660 but everywhere i went had stock made from april.,if you don't have a 12th gen then you'll have to have a shop update the bios for you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if one were to buy a non-k cpu, they'd have to buy an i7 if they want both p and e cores.","and as far as alder-lake users are concerned, myself included, a 13600k would be a better upgrade over a 13400 if they don't want to spend for an i7.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for me to be able to provide an accurate answer do what i asked: reset the temps in hwinfo, run cinebench multi (\~10 minutes) and put a screen shot from hwinfo where all the cpu info is visible",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"still, why does the system agent voltage matter if you aren't overclocking?","all non ks will run ram at the speed listed in their specification, was it 3200 ddr4 and 5600 ddr5?","you don't need sa voltage if you aren't overclocking, also sa voltage is also locked on a lot of non z motherboards like asrock ones even if you put a 13600k in them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all chips and motherboards allow ram speed overclocking.,sa matters because it limits ram performance.,"also, i went to read some asrock manuals and it seems at least that b660 motherboard allows control of all voltages.","but it isnâ€™t about manual control, the limit is on the cpu.",k chip allows the profile to set higher sa voltage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it doesn't matter if op isn't going to overclock.,overclocking the ram does absolutely nothing compared to overclocking the cpu anyway.,"i have a tech support reply from asrock saying their non z boards do not allow sa adjustment with a k series chip installed, so who is right?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
xmp is overclocking if you use faster than 3200mhz kit.,and memory speed absolutely does a lot.,"also, the sa voltage setting absolutely is in asrock b660 bios.","edit: so if you are out of the loop, the locked sa voltage on non k chips has caused many of faster memory kits to be unusable.",you can buy a 3600 kit but itâ€™s unlikely to work on non k 12th gen cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so don't buy a kit thats faster than 3200 for a non k cpu.,"i'm fully in the loop, i was probably the first person on this sub to buy a 12600 non k and complain that i couldn't even stabilize 3600 cl16.","having said that, if someone actually wants a k series cpu, they should be buying a z board.","if the reason is 'i don't want to overclock', then buy non k / non z and 3200 ram.",memory overclocking is soft unlocked on non ks for a basic overclocking experience.,currently the average ddr4 kits are now only being sold with 3600 cl18 xmp.,"that will have no issue with running at 0.95v sa, it was only 3600cl16 or better that becomes unattainable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so you are saying that unless he wants to spend extra for a feature he doesnâ€™t intend to use he shouldnâ€™t use other features either?,you make zero sense.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which asus boards?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you tried tweaking anything in bios?,i had to increase my vccio to 1.25 in order to get stability with a trident z5 5600 kit.,12700k system.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"an update from me after my frustrations with failing xmp ram stability tests:_x000d_  
_x000d_  
with a core i9 13900k on an asus z790-f strix and then after switching motherboard to asus z790 hero wondering if the strix was not up to the task, these are the results i have gotten with both mobos confirming that ddr5 is difficult to run at xmp with many kits_x000d_  
_x000d_  
i had 2 kits of 32gb g.skill trident z5 6400 32-39-39-102 and 7200 34-45-45-115. both would bsod or freeze randomly during an occt variable large data set run at xmp 1 and xmp 2 settings.",even tweaking other things they still failed.,i had tried reducing the speed of the 7200 to 6400 and 32-39-39-39 timings and would still randomly fail.,then i lowered it to 6200 and it seemed more stable as it finally got through a full 1 hour run of occt large data set variable without fail.,"however a 2nd run, froze up completely at around 30 minutes._x000d_  
_x000d_  
frustrating after trying so many things and no where to turn, i was close to going back to a ddr4 board to pair with my 13900k._x000d_

but one last thing i decided to try corsair vengeance ddr5 6000mhz cl 36-36-36-76 kit of 32gb.",apparently the g.skill trident z5 are hynix a and m die kits and the corsair is a samsung kit.,"was wondering maybe if my mobo or hynix based kits are just not as stable at xmp settings or in general and are only better at tweaking and achieving higher frequencies if you have the patience._x000d_  
_x000d_  
so far one full pass at docp/xmp1 settings on the corsair 6000 kit._x000d_  
_x000d_  
on a 2nd run of occt large data set variable test and almost 40 minutes in and no freeze/bsod nor errors.","hopefully this is the answer._x000d_  
_x000d_  
perhaps maybe the lower heat spreader underneath the noctua nh-d15 fan is better for my setup as well as the trident z5 are taller and less room to maneuver the nh-d15 fan._x000d_  
_x000d_  
or are asus mobos just better with samsung than hynix._x000d_  
_x000d_  
its strange how now hynix is supposedly the better ram with ddr5 where as with ddr4 it was samsung and hynix was mediocre or crap.",perhaps samsung is better for stability at xmp out of the box for both?,"?_x000d_

i actually had to download some firmware to enable stable xmp.,there was a recent post about it because it wasnâ€™t included in the most recent bios.,you had to individually install 3 types of firmware.,i have a rog strix z690 formula mb with the 13900k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"almost the exact same thing happened to me on the same board and cpu, though i had tested 6000  and 6400 ddr5 ram.","the z790 hero and 13900k was completely stable and benchable at 32 gigs at both speeds, but errors in the 64gb dimms, the 1 and 3 slot at both speeds.",rma'd it two days ago.,the windows mem test and on board passmark mem tests were able to point out specific errors between 60-64gb only.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you using slots 2 and 4?,manual recommends that for 2 dimms,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a z690 hero running a 13900k and the 7200 g. skill kit you have stable.,it passes testing with zero errors.,default xmp would not work though.,"try these settings:
reset your bios settings to default
select the second xmp (xmp ii)

ivr transmitter vddq voltage 1.40
memory controller voltage 1.35
dram vdd voltage 1.40

"im running 7200 dominators on z690 unity-x on stock xmp, didnâ€™t have to touch any settings.",i would guess itâ€™s either the cpu or motherboard.,i doubt itâ€™s the ram.,if you want fast ram i would highly suggest a motherboard with two rams slots.,"for example apex, tachyon, dark, unify-x, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its not the cpu for a fact if 6400mhz is not stable.,"check the memory modules with hwinfo if you bought them at microcenter, check if they are legit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
an update i even tried downclocking the 7200 g.skill to 6400 and same issue with 32-39-39-102 timings as that is what the 6400 kit has and i would think it would be able to handle them.,"&#x200b;

_x000d_  
with a core i9 13900k on an asus z790-f strix and then after switching motherboard to asus z790 hero wondering if the strix was not up to the task, these are the results i have gotten with both mobos confirming that ddr5 is difficult to run at xmp with many kits_x000d_  
_x000d_  
i had 2 kits of 32gb g.skill trident z5 6400 32-39-39-102 and 7200 34-45-45-115. both would bsod or freeze randomly during an occt variable large data set run at xmp 1 and xmp 2 settings.",even tweaking other things they still failed.,i had tried reducing the speed of the 7200 to 6400 and 32-39-39-39 timings and would still randomly fail.,then i lowered it to 6200 and it seemed more stable as it finally got through a full 1 hour run of occt large data set variable without fail.,"however a 2nd run, froze up completely at around 30 minutes._x000d_

but one last thing i decided to try corsair vengeance ddr5 6000mhz cl 36-36-36-76 kit of 32gb.",apparently the g.skill trident z5 are hynix a and m die kits and the corsair is a samsung kit.,"was wondering maybe if my mobo or hynix based kits are just not as stable at xmp settings or in general and are only better at tweaking and achieving higher frequencies if you have the patience._x000d_

so far one full pass at docp/xmp1 settings on the corsair 6000 kit._x000d_  
_x000d_  
on a 2nd run of occt large data set variable test and almost 40 minutes in and no freeze/bsod nor errors.","hopefully this is the answer._x000d_  
_x000d_  
perhaps maybe the lower heat spreader underneath the noctua nh-d15 fan is better for my setup as well as the trident z5 are taller and less room to maneuver the nh-d15 fan._x000d_  
_x000d_  
or are asus mobos just better with samsung than hynix._x000d_  
_x000d_  
its strange how now hynix is supposedly the better ram with ddr5 where as with ddr4 it was samsung and hynix was mediocre or crap.",perhaps samsung is better for stability at xmp out of the box for both?,"?_x000d_

do you have coil whine on your strix.,i have heard it is hit or miss though it seems the asus 4090 cards that have it have it worse than others usually??,"&#x200b;

i have heard best results for almost no or absolutely no coil whine is on asus boards with a good sample card from really any vendor base don responses form what mobo the ones who stated they had no whine were using.","&#x200b;

how is your 4090 strix in terms of coil whine on your asus board?","&#x200b;

its ironic because it seems maybe asus motherboards are best in terms of mitigating gpu coil whine compared to others yet they have the most complaints about coil whine for their high end gpus.",though its mostly gpu but it seems you need asus board and good power supply and a good card with right components to not hear any whine at all.,with other boards i speculate all cards even whine free ones that people report still produce too much audible buzz/whine.,but just speculation based on posts i have read on other blogs and no definitive answer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
id believe it if it was asus's fault.,i bought a strix z690e off hardware swap last week but it kept shutting down randomly in memory tests with 2 sets of 5600mhz ram ( gskill and corsair ).,so i was able to return it thanks to the seller but got a z790 tomahawk instead.,"i'll try that with the 6400mhz ddr5 kit i got a few days ago as well, running with a i7-13700k",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i would join our asus pcdiy group for discussion,  


with this noted most improvements on on 2 dimm where they should be not 4 dimm as there are no 4 dimm kits.",4 dimm kits are for those purely wanting aesthetic or pursuing ultra high density where dram scaling is understood to have a significant downtrend relative to overclocking.,"16x4 is possible 5600-6000mt as is 32x2 5600.  


as you have a msi board, you should inquire with msi and msi users as to the quality of their pcb topology and uefi tuning.",i can tell you these values are possible on asus but cannot on a competitors board.,best of luck.,do keep in mind if going for a mixed kit it may require you to manually tune the memory parameters.,also keep in mind the easiest way to generally resolve post/boot issues due to limits on 4 dimm operation is to drop the dram divider.,this commonly happens when users buy 2 sets of dimms like 6000mt and expect to load an xmp profile.,you can load the profile and then drop the divider before saving.,that being noted some sub timings may need to be revised.,good luck with your build.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

technically a r5 5600 or 12400f would be your best upgrade.,but its not going to happen with that case.,it doesnt use matx/atx so your standard diy components isnt going to fit.,i dont even know if acer uses the standard pins for cpu power.,your prebuilt most likely has a garbage stock or worse than stock cooler so u aint really throwing a i7 there either.,your biggest upgrade is probably another 8gb stick of ram and maybe a ssd.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

then does it really matter?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i mean, that makes sense.","80/120=66%, so my cpu has 34% more load than yours, 70\*1.34=93.8â°c.",although the two might not be strictly linear.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, because some scene in the game (city centre of night city), is extremely cpu intensive.",also different games with different engine will behave differently.,so it does matter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so just test those in the city centre.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

is there no way to properly test then?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

getting trapped in upgrades on the same platform is one of the biggest pit falls of intel's tik tok.,"you would gain more in gaming by selling your current mobo and cpu,and  switching to a 12400 and new motherboard or even a 13600k for a little more.",unless you need the extra pcie lanes and such found on the x299 platform,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"none, sell this crap and get even a 12400f, that will simply demolish this waste of silicon literally everywhere, while taking a fraction of power.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you want to keep the current motherboard?,you can get a i9-7900x for under $250 and gain a few extra cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"we're all working why anyone even purchased hedt i7 for x299, they were all disastrous for anything and horrendously priced.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, iâ€™ll be keeping the motherboard.",and is extra cores equals better performance ?but is there any bottleneck going on if iâ€™m using a 3060 ti?,i feel like my performance has a lag or stutter to the gameplay.,itâ€™s not my internet cause i get over 1000mbs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
really depends on either the games you play or what you do with your computer.,do you see your cpu usage pegged at a 100% when your gpu usage isn't?,then you might be bottlenecked by your cpu.,do you multitask a lot of cpu intensive applications?,then more cores will be beneficial.,"if you play a game that's single-threaded, you probably won't see much gain.",i think your 7800x is probably going to be fast enough for most games for the next few years.,i'd probably save the money you would spend on a cpu upgrade for your current platform and put it towards an upgrade to a 13th or 14th gen motherboard and cpu in a few years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"sorry, should've mentioned this is clock speeds after cinebench run, where your clock speed will hit max.",you want your effective to match your clock.,they are way off here.,"i got it close to 5.4 using xtu aito tune, surprisingly.",i'm going to reflash bios and reinstall windows.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this still wouldn't guarantee that the effective clock will always show the max.,the polling rate of hwinfo will take the average of all clock states across a given interval and if anything happens within that interval it can affect your shown effective clock.,"to quote martin at hwinfo:

""steady 100% utilization doesn't guarantee that.","the maximum clock reached depends on several factors (power, current, silicon fitness limits, temperature).","so when either of those limits are hit, the clock will be reduced and this might fluctuate so frequently that it's not captured by the instant clocks.""",your cb23 score is pretty much within the margin of error for a 13900k.,were you running the application in exclusive mode to get some extra points?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"no, it won't, which is an issue.","clock stretching, throttling, etc will cause it to not match.",but you want it to match.,"common misconception is when people look at core clocks thinking they overclocked properly, when their effective clocks won't even reach that high.",cb will push it to the max.,"you should always hit it, from an overclocker's perspective.",i'm just coming from ryzen so i wasn't sure if i needed to do something on intel.,"that's not margin of error either, 3k points is huge.","like i said, xtu ""fixed"" it where i hit 40k points, hit 93 degrees, and reached 5.4/4.4.",so i know something funky is going on,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's on expert.,there isn't any avx offset option,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thereâ€™s both windows drivers and firmware.,typically a mysteriously underperforming 13th gen cpu on a 12th gen motherboard is related to old me firmware.,i think using certain xtu versions can have an issue (something about configuring power limits also reducing maximum attainable frequency).,"perhaps since the op did have another model cpu installed for a time, a full cmos clear might be worthwhile.",beyond that i have no idea.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

- unexplained performance deficit (no limits being reached)
- broken xmp profiles
- cpu connected nvme slots may not work

- missing bios features/options

"agree, had a shit case before.",changed to h7 flow from nzxt since and it only hit 91c for a second in cinebench.,i have cheap 140mm fans though.,will have to try prime 95.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"same temp spikes, it'll be fine idle or doing something, then it will spike and go back to what it was fairly frequently...i even took off the puml and re pasted to see if it was a contact or paste problem and it looked fine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm not sure.,seeing this kind of spike occasionally on my end as well.,average temps are the most important.,are you running any background programs?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am using a ml 360 r that is 2 1/2 years old and had to buy the lga 1700 bracket for it.,gaming temps are around 55 to 70ish with spikes into the high 70s at times.,the 13700k definitely runs alot hotter than my 9700k.,i will look for a new aio in january most likely,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"undervolting can, while simultaneously (and ironically) increasing cinebench scores due to not hitting the thermal throttler.",try it.,"for reference:

with air cooling (thermalright pa120)

stock everything else",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, are we talking i cinebench r23?",because in multicore i get almost instant 100â°c (stock) with a dark rock pro 4. and also thermal throttling.,my score is a bit lower than what i've read so far (around 29000).,"already tried repasting, same results.","i've read that this is ""normal"", just not sure how well i'm off here.",coming from amd 3700x these temps are a bit scary.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"keep in mind it's a single run, im sure 10 minute run i'd reach 90+c, i dialed down the voltage which helps reduce temps as well",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with the rock pro 4?,"then i must have botched the thermal paste, cause under load (in modern warfare 2 (also a bit oc)), i spike into the 90's.","but i am usually around 75-80  


after and hour idle, core temperatures is averate 40c",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank god.,i haven't received my 13700 yet but i'm building a new pc and managed to get a d15 for nearly half-off.,i've been using a 212-evo on an 8700k forever so it's a relief that the 13700 can be reasonably air-cooled.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just a small oc to 5.4ghz on p cores and 4.4ghz on e cores.,the idle temp you have is just a bit too high even with an overclock should be no more than 40 degrees at worst.,"double check you cooler, is it an aio liquid cooler?","also, in bios i would not use ai overclocking as that tends to push way to much on the vcore voltage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i get the same temps.,and i also have 60 idle with a custom water loop,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
interesting.,it seems the 13th gen intel runs hotter.,"no background apps, and avg temp 60-65 c in mw2.",my vertical gpu mount for 4080 and o11d mini case could be contributing too to the heat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i might look into that.,but now i just power limited it to 125w.,lost like 3000 points in cinebench and it sips half the power.,worth it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i recently upgraded to an i7 13700k and i am in the same boat as you.,i am using a corsair 280mm aio in the nzxt h510 flow and the second i load up cinebench r23 (multicore) the chip skyrockets to 100c.,the intel xtu software says its immediately thermal throttling.,i have tried repasting and reseating the cooler to be sure but i still get the same results.,have you done any more experimenting?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that makes a lot more sense now ;)

i now undervolted as well, -130mv and now i achieve temps in the 90s w/o throttling (10min run).",single run maxes out at 84â°,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just put in a dark rock pro on mine and i didn't care for it at all - my last cooler was a noctua and theirs has much better (and easier) mounting system.,"i'm at 41 basically at idle (this web browser, steam, and music bee)

one thing i noticed with the dark rock was that even once i screwed it all the way in, the fan was still sliding around a bit, it's mechanism is absolutely garbage.","i dread taking this thing apart again, but i think i might order a black noctua and return the dark rock before the return period is up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
noctua nd h15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just make sure you screw the heatsink all the way in.,at first i was too gentle and had high temps.,then i screwd it all the way in and temps were fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13th gen indeed runs hotter.,tried a few different coolers so far my deepcool ak620 is the best.,spikes to 88 at the worst,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i ended up downvolting by -0,13v and now it stays in the 90s w/o thermal throttling, i can live with that (better score and less power consumption).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yep, i undervolted by -0,13v and now it stays in the 90s w/o throttling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think with spring you always screw until contact( end ) without applying torque on it since spring wont unscrew by it self.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
one time i screwed my cpu cooler too tight & it affected the ram,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is the ak620 noisy?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
does your cinebench score improve or decrease?,i have heard different things about undervolting and the effects it has on performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you undervolt through the bios or xtu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can you explain how it affected your ram?,i think i have some kind of ram issue... from time to time i can't boot my pc and need to touch gently ram (like trying to push it in) and then my pc boots alright.,can it be because i screwd heatsink to tight?,i don't think heatsink touches the ram tho...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"under heavy loads, the fans do get a bit noisy.",if you play with headphones though i doubt you'll notice it.,"if you do pick one up, make sure you take extreme care when mounting.",if anything is crooked even slightly it won't cool very well.,if everything is lined up though it does a fantastic job.,i never break 80 celsius.,mostly stay between 40 and 70 while gaming.,with jumps into the upper 70s.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also just to add.,"under normal gaming session, as long as you aren't pushing your pc to it's limits, the cooler is very quiet.",it only gets loud if you are doing something extremely intense like a benchmark or some seriously demanding games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it increased since there was no more thermal throttling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bios since i have dual os on my machine and wanted it for both,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for me my system was able to boot, but the ram wasnâ€™t able to do dual channel mode.",searched the internet for answers & concluded it was because cpu cooler was strewed too tight,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">noctua nh-d15

that's great.",what are your idle and ambient temps?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok iâ€™ll have a look!,thanks for that!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ambient is usually 70 degrees fahrenheit/ 21 degree celsius.,idle temps usually float around 35 to 40 celsius.,with jumps occasionally in the 50s.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the 13400 vs 12600k is another interesting example.",12600k in many regions (most major ones) are selling below launch rcp now.,"this means any increase in rcp for the 13400 vs the 12400 essentially starts running the price up close to that of the existing 12600k, which will still be faster (10%+ higher clocks) and possibly better in other ways (unlocked sa voltage).",you also avoid the previously mentioned motherboard issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

all you have to do is update to a current bios and update the me firmware (thatâ€™s a separate process).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i donâ€™t think it strictly matters, like if you do it in the wrong order it will break anythingâ€¦ however i would do bios first, then me drivers in windows, and then me firmware.","i know me firmware updates are a relatively new concept for most users, but iâ€™m also not aware of a previous generation where an me update was essential to new model cpus functioning correctly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the situationâ€™s a bit trickier for a brand new system.,as far as i know you can only flash me firmware from within windows; there are no available standalone tools.,"a compatible bios (via flashback)* and incompatible me should still boot enough to get the me firmware updater to work, but the system may be a bit wonky until this is done (like broken xmp support, missing bios features, and poor performance).",so donâ€™t bother setting anything up for real until after this is done.,"the biggest catch is that some users have experienced cpu-attached m.2 slots being non-functional until after the me update, meaning itâ€™s possible you will have to temporarily install the ssd in a chipset-attached slot, install windows, and then move it to the more desirable cpu-attached slot.","iâ€™m not sure if this is motherboard brand or me-version specific, as i donâ€™t think everyone experiences this.",if you have any issues be sure to post back.,should be easily fixable.,*remember that flashback is done with the system off.,"so it doesnâ€™t really matter if you have it fully wired with all power cords or not, because it wonâ€™t make a difference to the process.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

awesome!,glad to hear it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the me firmware update is done in windows.,as far as i know you need the me firmware update as well as the bios update for your motherboard.,"i have not yet seen any post on any forum where a z690 user dropped a 13900k, 13700k etc without the me firmware update.",although i am happy to be proven wrong.,but once everything is done i am sure you will be happy with the way it runs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just load the latest bios from mfgr and you should b good to go.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok thank you for that!,how do you update the me drivers in windows?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
biostar required an me update to enable 11th gen compatibility on z490.,even required you to update me firmware separately.,guess they were ahead of the times.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you need to understand cpu vf curve varies part to part.,if you have good part then you might observe lower maximum voltage.,in the end you need to understand that if in default setting it's going to 1.36 volts then it's should be fine since it's verified by manufacturing fliw,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whats the reliability criteria,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its more like 38 actually,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
multicore enhancement is only the name for asus boards.,it will be called something else for your board.,that board is on the cheaper side so it might not even support it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its different for each rail and ip.,for intel processors generally voltage_reliability  it's highest for cpu and lowest for gt.,"maximum voltage depends on the type of standard cells used, robustness of the power grid and maximum operating frequency.",in post silicon validation it's verified through stress test.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hyper threading is not multicore enhancement.,just have to go to whatever settings in overclocking section and see what you can find .,a way you can tell is download hwinfo64.,"when opening it , check the box that says sensors only.",hit ok when it asks if it can use certain sensors.,then look at the option for pl2.,if itâ€™s over 253w then it is on.,if itâ€™s not then your board doesnâ€™t support it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it hits 5.8ghz because itâ€™s very fast,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not really if you think about it.,"in 2017 
-2018 i was buying partial trays of i7-7700kâ€™s and i7-8700kâ€™s to delid+liquid metal, binned & sold them.","quoting myself on how a lot of 20 i7-7700kâ€™s binned:

â€œmy breakdown is as follows:

3/20 (15%) chips are head and shoulders above the average chip.",they'll btd at 5.6ghz and run any software at 5.4ghz.,13/20 (65%) are average.,"btd at 5.4ghz, run all software at 5.2-5.3ghz.","4/20 (20%) are not great, but will run any software 5.2ghz stable.","every chip will run 5ghz without touching voltage beyond llc-1, every chip will run 4.9ghz out of the box touching nothing.â€

the fastest i ran across on water would run 5.8ghz.",companies are just being more aggressive with self-tuning and as a process matures the spread between good and bad is tight.,so they run 400mhz faster clock than half the cpuâ€™s from five years ago could run (or 600mhz faster than most chips).,ipc is much stronger now ofcorse.,thatâ€™s the impressive part.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"why ycbcr explicitly, why not just rgb?",hdr is independent of this and independent of color depth.,its just that intel tries to enable 10 bit color depth when hdr is active.,but only if there is enough bandwidth left and everything supports 10b.,"previous generations of intel igpus did not give you control over color depth or format and chroma subsampling, but alder lake has added controls for both.",but only for native hdmi ports.,"but i believe manufacturers still need to ensure the signal quality for hdmi 2.0 (tmds 18g) ports for this to be available, same as with dp hbr3 speeds or maybe even with an additional converter chip (i was sure there was an intel igpu generation with completely native tmds 18g output, but the alder lake specs say it still requires the pcon chip for the full tmds speed).","and yes, i can force my hdmi monitor into ycbcr on my native hdmi 2.0 (tmds 18g) port.","intel said this will not work via dp-hdmi adapters and it does not for me (but may only be a driver not hw limitation, not sure.",intels specs say the formats are supported on dp as well by the hw).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"update:  
ok, so i have learned a couple things.","i have been able to test this laptop with its iris xe graphics on a 4k tv that a desktop computer is successfully connecting to at 4k@60hz and 4:4:4 (though rgb doesn't work, it's not really needed as 4:4:4 chroma subsampling is enough).","using the same hdmi cable and tv input that this desktop computer is using, this laptop cannot match the desktop computer's settings using the hdmi connection on the laptop.","namely, it can do 4k 4:4:4, but only at 30hz, or i can do 4k at 60hz with only 4:2:0 compression.",it can't do 4k at 60hz and 4:4:4 (nor rgb).,"using a thunderbolt/usb-c to hdmi dongle adapter (this one: https://www.amazon.com/dp/b08mswmxt4?psc=1&ref=ppx\_yo2ov\_dt\_b\_product\_details), this laptop is able to connect to the tv as i need it to without issue.","same tv input and cable, through the dongle, and this same laptop hits 4k@60hz at 4:4:4 color easily.","perhaps this is expected, or this is a bug.","either way, i was able to get my requirements out of this laptop via the thunderbolt connection.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it was my understanding that straight up rgb wasn't an option for 4k@60hz for bandwidth reasons.,"thus, chroma subsampling (ycbcr) is used.","there are 3 variants of this, 4:2:0, 4:2:2, and 4:4:4, with 4:4:4 the only one that can guarantee clear text, which is important to my use case of having the tv be my pc monitor full time.","somewhere i found a bandwidth chart of all the various options vs the 18gb/s of hdmi 2.0, but i don't have time to retrieve it right now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am having a similar situation with a hp elitebook 840 g8 (intel iris xe) and my hdmi 2.1 cable + lg c2 is only able to muster 4k@120/60 at 8-bit color depth.,nothing i do can get it past 8-bit 4:2:0 chroma.,"i do have 2 usb-c thunderbolt ports, and i am thinking about buying the adapter you posted and seeing if my lg c2 can do better than 8bit 4:2:0.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok so this is why my hdmi connected to my 4k tv was lagging a bit using vlc player.,on my 28 inch monitor with display port is fine.,"so, i should try a display port to hdmi 2.1.

side question, my laptop can play 4k hdr 10bit on youtube, but won't let me get it on netflix.","i get hdr label, but no 4k.",i understand hdcp but intel graphic command says its hdcp compatable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so 3840x2160 8b rgb is still within tmds 18g, just barely, but it is.","actually, ycbcr 4:4:4 takes up the exact same amount of bandwidth as both have 8 bit per channel and 3 channels, leading to 24 bit per pixel.","4:4:4 is actually no subsampling, just a different coordinate system for the same colors.","also ycbcr always uses the limited color range 16-235 (instead of full range 0-255 within each 8 bit value), which makes it slightly less precise.","with rgb, limited color range is optional and only needed by terrible tvs.",ycbcr actually is only useful for chroma subsampling and various compression tricks used in video encoding.,"which is why the tv world is using it, as basically all the picture sources, such as broadcast tv, video files, bluray disks internally use ycbcr and chroma subsampling already, so one can save bandwidth on the hdmi cable that one can then use for 10 or 12 bit color depth used in hdr.","edit:

since gpus calculate in rgb, converting to ycbcr is an additional step that only makes sense if it is the only thing your screen supports or you want to use chroma subsampling.","with most video players on pc, you cannot even prevent the conversion back to rgb.",so even a video file in ycbcr would most likely be converted back to rgb and then back to ycbcr again  by the gpus display outputs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in the specs of the laptop, what version of hdmi does it list?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's great info.,thanks.,i have my home desktop computer (rx6800xt) plugged into a 4k tv and i can only get 60hz with subsampling.,rgb drops to 30hz.,"i don't really care, i just want to know if it's even possible for the iris xe to hit 60hz and have small text readable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i believe it's 2.0b,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then you are probably somehow limited to a tmds 10g connection (effectively hdmi 1.4).,"&#x200b;

have you enabled whatever mode your tv needs to allow the full bandwidth?","most tvs have some option for this, often not very obvious.","or if its an older tv, maybe you used an input that is limited to the slower speeds?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">2.0b

as i think it was stated before, 4k@60 4:4:4 is very near the theoretical limit of hdmi 2.0. go with thunderbolt.","hdmi 2.0 does 18gbps, tb 3&4 do 40.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, thanks for that, but i've gone through all of it.","it's just, i think, a fact that this setup doesn't quite hit the theoretical maximum, probably because no setup actually does.",anyway... none of this gets me any closer to knowing what this laptop chipset can do...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i ordered that same adapter you bought.,should be here wednesday.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this not true in general.,"if you can find no other resolution etc.that surpasses the 10g limit of hdmi 1.4, then you are surely limited to that.","either by the monitor, the hdmi output or some sort of software bug.","&#x200b;

but hitting 4k60 8 bit rgb is not rare on actual hdmi 2.0 (tmds 18g hw capable) ports.","i have multiple monitors that do that here (4k tv, 2 dell desktop monitors with hdmi inputs) and i can drive this resolution from 10th gen uhd graphics via usb-c-hdmi adapter, alder lake uhd graphics via native hdmi and alder lake xe graphics via usb-c adapter or either of my nvidia gpus (one maxwel, one ampere).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1. no
2. it will result in same power draw anyway.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it would be better if you simply reduced the frequency of the p-cores or the power draw.,"after all, a higher core count at lower frequencies usually is the way to go for efficiency.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
select low powered mode from bios.,dont try to under clock or anything.,modern cpus are very very very efficient at low load.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can i use only e cores on legion slim 7i for best battery life?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s not that simple.,the e-cores are more efficient at very low speed but not when under heavy load trying to run it fast.,so what you would ideally want is only e cores when the machine isnâ€™t actually doing anything important but p-cores running any software you are using.,best let the machine decide those.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i saw some good gains the 13700k is like 70% faster single thread.,also came from 9700k.,"playing in 4k 144hz 3090, but i enjoy all types of games and got the 13700k below msrp unlike the 4090 which is still sold well above msrp in germany.",the 9700k is good but i saw it hit 100% on single core often.,every 4-5 years it is noticeable to upgrade the cpu imo.,spider man is the most notable case of the 9700k showing itâ´s age.,the ecores are getting 500 points in cpu-z whereas 9700k gets below 600,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are not a bit but extremely bottlenecked with that pair.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
given you're playing at 4k then i don't think you would notice much difference for the majority of games as you will be gpu bound.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rocking the same setup.,i think the 9700k is still a solid processor.,"honestly, i'd only upgrade when it starts to feel that way.",i'm looking to upgrade next generation me thinks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it replaced a hx850i corsair psu as i wanted a little headroom plus the ability to upgrade the gpu down the line.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
although i am running a 3070 now so i could use a pcie 4-5 mother board,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seriously 8700k is still a very capable cpu even for gaming.,at least use it for a htpc build,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i didnt know days gone had issue with stuttering, i know it has this weird issue with gamespeed at launch.",i put the game on hold when i was still on 8th gen because i dont have the time for it and just finished the game last month on 13900k and it was a stutter free experience.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
apologies as i should've included this in the op.,i also game on a 1440p 165hz g-sync monitor :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hey this is interesting.,how do you know the 10700k was a bottleneck?,i got the same setup and same monitor settings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there is no way a 10700k bottlenecks a 3080, period.",especially at 1440p.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this!,"people should stop upgrading every new gen, just because.","i swear, many people don't need to upgrade every year.",use your electronics for longer people!,stop e-waste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
days gone is typical bad port performance wise.,for all console port i usually wait at least one year after the release to play it because eu am fed up being the guinea pig paying full price for a beta.,and the fact that we needed a 13700k to say it is stutter free is terrible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the biggest factor for me was with spiderman.,"no dlss, everything pretty much maxed out at 1440p 165hz.",my 3080 was running between 45 to 65% being max.,"thats when stuttering would happen, to low frame rate, and drops.","unless i disabled hyperthreading, for my 10700k, then i was okay, but then at that point.","my cpu is running around 75% to 85%, and high temps.","however, for games like forza 4, to horizon, to cyberpunk, i would avg just about the same fps as my previous 3070, with my current 3080 + 10700k.","then, with 13600k upgrade, i saw just about a 20% uplift.","only with games like god of war, to red dead 2, which is very gpu bound, i didn't see much difference for 1440p.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
read my other comment.,i already mentioned the games i was good with my 10700k + 3080. spiderman was the biggest issue for me.,"i really didn't want to upgrade, because i was short on cash.",although it only cost me about $340cad extra in order to upgrade to a 13600k barebone system.,"again, games like red dead 2, god of war, or basically any heavy gpu bound games, i had no issues.","any other games that rely on cpu just as much, well, thats where the issue starts for me.","all i can say is play spiderman if you have it, and see for yourself.","otherwise, i had to upgrade for a reason.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
kinda depends on which games you're talking about.,"but, for a game like spiderman, farcry6, horizon, or forza, you're looking at about 15% to 20% difference.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i see.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"far from a smart buy, but such is life.",i would advise undervolting your cpu btw!,i managed to get my max temps under sustained cinebench r23 down by like 5c.,"also, did you get a contact frame by any chance?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had the same feeling regarding the whole socket thing but given i won't be buying anything for another 4+ years then it doesn't really matter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as op said below, i dont care about the socket as i will be using this cpu for the next 4-5 years anyway.","that being said, 7000 series with 3d vcache will probably be better in gaming",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can look at the 13th gen being the pinnacle of what the architecture/socket can do while as 14th gen will be a new architecture and will further be optimized with 15th gen/ future refreshes as theyâ€™ve always been doing.,14th may not even bring substantial improvement over 13th gen and thereâ€™s rumors of them going with less p. cores for the flagship.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same feeling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
going from a 9th gen to the 13th gen this thread is mainly focused on is hardly 'every new gen',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i heard about some issues with running all cores enabled unless you turned off e cores.,you running stock 13600k settings?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that ok i think.,not a big jump.,im.,using a 6900xt and in aaa titles it still runs perfect in 3400x1440 ultra.,despite tarkov,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
such is life indeed!,temps have been that good that i haven't even looked into undervolting.,aida64 yielded a max temp of 84c after running it for an hour with an ambient room temp of 25c.,no i haven't used any contact frame either.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that is correct, i do find that people tend to upgrade more often than necessary though.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
?,i have no issues whatsoever with my 13600k.,"if anything, i oc the e-cores ghz a bit to 4.1ghz, and i got better 1%lows, plus my 5.6ghz on all p cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's hit or miss depending on the game.,"some games/the scheduler seem to properly know how to handle the e cores, while others try to treat them as normal full power cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hmmmm for cpus, anything above 15fps is a pretty big jump, especially for 1440p gaming.","for me,  i was mainly facing a bottleneck with my 10700k.","where i would face stutters and dips, due to my 3080 being a bit too powerful for 1440p gaming.",where my 10700k couldn't catch up.,"as long you're not facing any stutters or dips, then you should be okay.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hell yeah.,the 13600k is my next processor upgrade from my 8700k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, you are right.",15 fps is good.,i hope for some more from 8700k to 13700k.,my max fps are good but i dont like the big fluctuation over 20 to 40 fps.,i dont have stutters and triple a title run well in ultra mostly around or over 100fps.,its still super fast but there are games the 6900 is bored.,unoptimized titles like tarkov.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
remember... it wasn't just a cpu fps gain for me.,you also gotta remember that my previous 10700k was holding back my gpu in fps gains.,"if you have some sorta fps counter like with msi burner, check what is the % for your gpu usage.","if you're hovering around lets say 70 to 80% most of the time for all your gaming titles, then for sure your chip is holding back your gpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

paste containing silver can be non-conductive.,look up the specs of your paste.,non-conductive paste won't destroy anything but it can still ruin stability because of parasitic capacitance if there's too much of it.,your local reliable repair shop should deal with easily with ultrasonic cleaner.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

is it a good paste for gpu?,arctic silver 5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's fine.,most thermal paste is the same.,it does have silver in it but it's not electrically conductive.,i like that it stays more gooey/less viscous over time vs mx4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

best cooling system is a peltier.,second best would likely be a custom water loop.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you need one of the best aios on the market.,360mm is a must.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
280mm aio at the minimum,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks!,"i ended up buying the ""be quiet pure loop 2 fx"" cause it was cheaper and only slightly slower fan speeds haha my cpu is around 55c playing the witcher 3 maxed out settings but my gpu is more like 77c.",how is your gpu staying so cool?,"also, what are your cpu settings?",stock or?,mine is slightly tweaked.,"200w, 1.24v, p-cores are 5.4ghz at the moment and e-cores are 4.3ghz.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you sure?,i thought peltier elements only divert temps from 1 side to the other and are shit for cooling?,!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah but which 360?,"there's so many at vastly different pricing lol there's a ""be quiet pure loop"" one at $150 cad, but then the corsair icue h150i elite capellix at $250 cad, slightly different fan speeds is all i can see being the difference (besides rgb which i don't care for one way or the other).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
any aio though?,"i was looking at the 360mm ones, but they're vastly different in price.",main differences i can tell is mostly fan speed which i'm not sure how much that would factor in.,one is 2000 rpm at $150 cad and the other is 2400 rpm at $250 cad.,"the $150 one is refillable, the $250 one is not but rgb which may be the reason for increase in price (i don't care for rgb one way or the other).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
look at you baby.,hell yeah.,mine are stock.,"i tested over clocking and got it to 6.2 with the cooling corsair but im reality since this 8a also my work computer and i come from a 6700k which i was used to running at 4.0ghz stock, jumping to a stock of 5.5 to 5.8 on the 13600k it is too much power.",i really have a hard time using most cores or even using them at max.,"for the memory, because i have 128gb, well look at my channel https://www.youtube.com/@xtremelinux i go into details about testing xmp (i got it to 5600mhz stable) but again, am coming from ddr3 2100 and now the stock for it is 4800 which with xmp got to 5600. so i rather leave them be.",the pcores run stock at 5.5 on the z790 hero and the ecores run stock at 4.4ghz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the lian li galahad is a great choice if you can afford it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just a thought as i've got the same cpu and wondered why my idle temps were slightly higher than expected.,is your pc power mode in high performance by any chance?,"that's something that will hold your cpu at it's max clock speed at all times, no matter the demand.",just an idea!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"at least on mobile, reddit uses too low of a resolution for any of the numbers in that video to be readable.","rather than post a video, why not just state the frequency you get and ask if that's normal?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just reset your motherboard bios settings back to the default.,old school overclockers used to disable the processor from idling.,this was because they fixed the block frequency and multipliers when overclocking.,so they disabled all intel c-state idling systems and ran their processors at max frequency all the time.,there is no problem from doing this.,i ran an old i7 i-930 like that for 10 years.,near the end i pushed the overclock to 4.0ghz.,was at 3.9 most of its life.,you can reset the bios defaults and it should idle again.,the way intel/motherboard manufacturers do overclocking now is with tables.,and so you don't really need to do much to get a higher overclock.,just set the maximum clock you want and let the tables handle the voltage.,"if the voltage appears too high, they have a way to lower the entire voltage range at one go.",or you can perform v/f points for your freq/voltage points.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have the k version and mine does the exact same thing.,max clocks on idle for some reason.,i went from a newer bios to an older and it's still the same thing.,if i adjust the power setting in windows to power saver that's when the clocks drop from this max speed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
totally normal thats how my 13600k sits at iddle too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

itâ€™s an i5 13600kf and itâ€™s pretty much just staying at max clock speed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
use the balanced power plan.,thereâ€™s zero reason to use high performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that happens while on the balanced plan.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
check the planâ€™s minimum cpu speed.,"and if itâ€™s not 100%, you might need to clear cmos.",there are bios settings that can disable the cpuâ€™s ability to adjust frequency.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so you want it to say 100%?,also this happened after every bios update.,would i still need to clear cmos after a fresh bios install?,also thanks for the help.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, minimum should be set to the lowest possible option, and maximum obviously st 100%.",if the minimum is at 100% then the cpu canâ€™t decrease its frequency (this is basically what the high performance plan does).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
makes sense.,what does the balanced plan set the minimum to?,i'm not in front of my pc at the moment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i was about to say â€œiâ€™m not eitherâ€, but iâ€™ve got my freaking laptop on my lap lol.",itâ€™s 5%.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"alright, so after checking mine.","it does say minimum 5% but it per hwinfo the ""active clocks"" are are %088 for p-cores and 3890 for e-cores.","however, the temps are low, voltages are low, and power draw is low as well.",i am also using a z690 board for me 13600k so maybe that could be why?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

can you tell me what your vcore is in cyberpunk or warzone while youre gaming?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
more cores are not a bottleneck if the application or specific game you run doesn't require more than a certain amount to run at its best.,single core frequency and ipc gains over older architectures are the primary factors.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"modern games started to utilize more cores than they used to, which is why a 6 core is minimum these days for good gaming.",it can actually be bad if the game uses e-cores instead of p-cores since they have higher latency and could cause stutter.,but single core clockspeed + generation improvements are still a big factor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you want undervolt protection to be set to off as that is the whole  point of undervolting it.,if you set it at -0.05 and it was fine did you not try incremental steps or did you just go balls deep in at 0.1v?,you need to find the exact value then.,it jst not the offset core voltage that drops temps the most.,it is a culmination of the little tweaks like 2c here and 3c there.,these all add up in whole scheme of things.,slow down and just take your time and make sure it is stable once it done you can save the profile to bios or whatever and forget about it.,setting at -0.05v and then charging in at -0.1v is never going to end well unless you have a decent cpu.,try -0.055 and then -0.06 sooner or later it will crash as obviously it can;t handle a -0.1v offset drop.,i am guessing arounf the -0.08 v and onwards where it starts reaching its  limits,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i see ... it seems there is a lot more tinkering to be done in that case ... i will do the minute increment.,plus i believe i need to change the ilm socket with that of thermalright to make sure there is proper contact with the cold plate.,question to ask: i noticed the watchdog in xtu is disabled.,is this enabled in the bios or is there another way?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i use a contact frame in both of my motherboards i canâ€™t remember if it was â£13 or â£15.,i do know there was a discount at the time.,does it make a difference?,well in my strix z690-a it dropped the idle temps by 2c and load temps by 5c so not anything special.,but with all the other tweaks my 13900k tops out at 82-84c in cb23 r23.,so by itself it is only a marginal difference but combined with the others then it is worth.,for my z690 formula i couldnâ€™t say as soon as i got it i swapped the ilm straight over to the contact frame so it could of made a huge difference or absolutely none and i wouldnâ€™t know it but for the sake of â£15 i donâ€™t care enough about it.,when you are talking about the watchdog feature in xtu are you talking about the real time visual graphs that appear at the bottom?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i was watching this video by gamers nexus and they did test on the pressure and coverage, the normal ilm missing 1/3 of the space ... and considering 13700k is a heat generator it would be best to increase contact surface and for $7 it isnt something to skip over.",the watchdog i am refering to is xtu allowing you to revert back after a crash or save your changes as a profile.,"i read one place it has to enabled first in the bios but i am not sure about the veracity of that info, thats why i was asking",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i donâ€™t use a 13700k, i have for my testing a 12900k, 12700k and a 13900k and yes i have seen the 13900k at 100c if you let the motherboard run it defaults.",this to me is not how i want to run even if it is normal or not.,any cpu regardless for my usage which is strictly gaming if it goes over 65c then i cannot accept it.,"5950x, 12th gen, 13 th gen i have tweaked to make sure it stays below 65c when gaming.",i have never used the watchdog feature.,i spent so much time tweaking the 12900k to get the temps under control when i first got it at release i kinda had a ballpark figure to work with the 13900k so i am comfortable with the settings i used.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well my temps are better now ... not near where i want them ... sure cinebench test will push the limit but i do not expect it to go 99-100 degrees for the entire duration of the test.,gaming like apex does not reach beyond 70 but only when i am firing up the game it would go 90+ for a short duration.,i guess the whole temp control is a journey considering the numerous variables at play,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 12700k is faster but iâ€™d be surprised that you need the additional power unless itâ€™s for work.,you current cpu is still really fast.,you could easily wait at least another generation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why do you want/need to upgrade?,according to your history you just built this pc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"running 4 sticks overclocked isn't a good idea and in most cases, not really possible.",i'll explain.,you're lucky you can even set xmp 1 and have it crash.,the reason is you're using 4x16gb dimms.,if you were running 4x32gb dimms you would not even be able to turn on xmp at all!,"the ram would simply default to 4000 mt/s and the best you could do is 4400 mt/s with 4x32gb dimms (128gb total)

ok so that's all kind of complicated and confusing :) 4x16gb will run with some oc, but 4x32gb wont run at all with oc.","the reason for this is the 13900k's spec is basically 4400 mt/s for 4 dimms, also known as 2dpc (2 dimms per channel).",this is why your xmp crashes.,the memory controller can't really handle 2dpc overclocked at all.,"now, in some cases you might actually get those 4x16gb to oc in a 2dpc config but not at the best speeds possible, and there would likely be stability issues you can't see because you're doing something you really shouldn't be trying to do.",using 4 dimms is fine but overclocking them is not going to work.,"4 dimms are for capacity, not performance.","if you needed 128gb of ram, then you would have to run 4 dimms at 4000 mt/s and live with the stability and less than ideal performance.",you have 4x16gb dimms which is 64gb in total.,this is just bad.,you want 2x32gb ddr5 dimms running at 6000mhz+ using xmp.,this will give you far better performance and stability because running 1dpc (1 dimm per channel) gives you much better bandwidth and latency.,this is a much better performing setup than 4x16gb dimms and both are 64gb.,so anytime you use 4 slots (2dpc) instead of 2 (1dpc) you're giving up performance in favor of capacity.,2dpc will not overclock with xmp.,"the only reason why it ""kind of works"" is because you have 4x16gb dimms which are a little easier on the controller but really you shouldn't run 64gbs of ram divided across 4 dimms.","you instead should run 64gb of ram divided across 2 dimms, 1 per channel, giving you maximum performance, overclocking stability, and better latency.","so the solution is:

option 1: run 4x16gb at 4400 mt/s (lower speed and increased latency)

option 2: run 2x32gb dimms at 6000 mt /s (much faster speed and decreased latency)

option 3: try to overclock 4x16gb above the spec 4400 mt/s and hope you can get a stable 5200 mt/s, which may have stability issues you cant see, and still wont be as fast as option 2. you can try increasing voltage etc but they will never run at their xmp settings in a 4 stick configuration.","you bought the wrong ram, or you're trying to use ram that you had before.",either way you should not be running a 64gb configuration with 4 sticks.,run 64gb with 2 sticks.,you want 2x32gb ddr5 6000 cl30 or close to cl30 as you can get.,you should return what you have (if you can) or sell them and get the right memory sticks.,only buy 4 dimms if you need 128gb of ram and are willing to give up performance for stability and increased memory capacity.,everyone else should be running 2 memory sticks for the performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1. try xmp2 as xmp1 is an auto overclock on some timings.,"if that doesnt work then you need to lower frequency or try to look up what voltage to raise
2.memtest is probably the best for stability
3.try disabling mce if your not happy with the temp.",these chips are extremely hot and are made to be at that temp under stress.,"you can undervolt but you need to do it while running cinebench so you know you undervolted too much and lowering performance
4. no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'd buy the best ram you can if you plan to oc 4 sticks.,for example i have g.skill ddr5-6000 (4800) cl 30-40-40-96 2x32gb sticks.,i did oc 4 of them to 5200 just fine.,5600 was unstable though.,4800 is an easy oc to do.,4400 and 4000 are spec.,as for future investments... yeah am5 probably will last longer but intel may release something that surpasses am5 heavily.,so it's a gamble.,buy what you think is the best now and will fit your needs now.,in 3 years there will absolutely be something better.,i would not expect amd to release chips each year from now that significantly increase performance enough to make upgrading every year worth it.,in 3 years from now... am5 will be almost dead... and intel will have?,we don't know.,the other gamble is ddr5 128gb.,it's possible that we may see a single ddr5 chip with 64gb on it that runs faster than 4x32gb sticks.,so you may be able to buy 2x64gb ddr5 chips by the end of the year that run at 6000 mt/s.,so buying 4 sticks of 32gb now may not be a wise investment unless you absolutely need it.,it's worth considering along with the performance hit you take for running 4 sticks.,i went back and forth on this quite a bit and returned my second 2x32gb kit of ram and i'm living with 64gb total until 2x64gb kits come out.,or atleast i hope they will soon.,we may even see 2x128gb kits... the ddr5 spec does allow for it.,it's only a matter of time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i've built 3 4x32gb z690 systems and had no issues running 3200 mhz.,running the imc above stock with 4 dimms isn't the easiest thing to do but 3600 mhz isn't much faster so it'll probably work.,definitely run memtest overnight once you get it built and running at 3600.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's likely 2 rank per stick, 2 rank and 2 sticks per channel would push on your imc heavily.",13900k usually have a good imc performance.,"i have a similar configuration, with four dual rank 16g c9 sticks.","they are able to do 3800 on gear 1, but the stability is questionable.",i would say you may have some difficulty doing gear1 at 3600mhz.,"however this really depends on the silicon lottery, your sticks, and your motherboard, so your experience may vary.",gear 2 should not be an issue at this frequency.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

looks like a intel will have a 112 lane workstation cpu soon.,i suspect you are looking for something smaller than a workstation.,"â€œthen there's the sapphire rapids-112l xcc dies which will offer up to 112 pcie gen 5.0 lanes and will be featured under the workstation platform.â€

">sure i can add more ssdâ€™s but then my gpu will drop to x8 instead of x16 thus losing performance

that's not right.","you have another 8 lanes to the chipsets, so you wouldn't consider doing this (if your board even supported it) until you had 4 or 5 nvme devices.",>when should we start seeing at least another extra 4 or 8 pcie lanes on intel cpuâ€™s?,i doubt we see more than 12 non-gpu lanes.,probably they'll upgrade the chipsets lanes to pcie 5.0 but keep the number constant.,if you need 32 plus lanes you're looking at hedt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"5960x has 40 lines, it was a hedt platform

having more pcie lanes directly from cpu simply doesnâ€™t make sense for typical desktop systems.,it only adds cost and power consumption without bringing any realistic benefit for a desktop cpu.,having two platforms (desktop and hedt) makes more sense,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ok im a little confused on the first part, so in my case i have 1 gen3 m.2 nvme ssd as my primary drive and 1 gen 4 m.2 nvme on a aorus pro ax z590 board, could i add another gen4 nvme ssd to this board and still keep my gpu at x16 ?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"also, x299 hedt (ie.",10980xe) has 48 cpu lanes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
on z590 the number of lanes depends on your cpu.,if you have an 11th gen you have 4 cpu lanes and 8 3.0 dmi lanes to the chipset.,if 10th gen you only have the 8 dmi.,you can always add more nvme devices if you have the slots.,"depending on available lanes they may share bandwidth, so no difference real world but not ideal for raid 0. your motherboard manual should have the details.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you do know that the chipset has its own lanes as well?,"z590 has 24 pcie 3.0 lanes on top of the 16 you get with a 10th gen cpu, or 20 with an 11th gen cpu.","these chipset lanes are connected to the cpu via the dmi interface, which is not included in that lane count (but is equivalent to 8x 3.0 lanes).","step up to the z690 or z790 chipsets and you get 28 lanes on top of the cpuâ€™s 20, and the dmi interface doubles to 8x 4.0 lanes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why wiuld you put the gen3 drive in the main drive slot?,thatâ€™s the only one thatâ€™s gen4 on z590.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"because gen 3 is fast enough for my main drive, now for gaming i need the absolute fastest speed possible so thats why my gen 4 drive is what i use for my games",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

itâ€™s weird right currently iâ€™m using 1 for my gen4 m.2 and number 4 slot at the bottom for my boot m.2.,moving forward for my next upgrade what brand should i go with that should let me run at least two gen 4 m.2 nvme ssd  without cutting my gpu speed down to x8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no on my mobo the bottom most slot is the only gen 3 slot so i have my main gen 3 drive in it, my top gen 4 has my gen 4 drive for my games, thatâ€™s my setup im not sure if that answers your question but everything is in its perfect place",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
get a z790 board and you should be able to run 4 or possibly 5 pcie 4.0 drives without cutting gpu lanes.,just be cautious that any m.2 slot on z690/z790 advertising pcie 5.0 support will drop your gpu to x8 (regardless of whether you use it in 5.0 mode or not).,"i havenâ€™t seen much lane sharing on 12th/13th gen. just the aforementioned pcie 5.0 issue, and sometimes some sata ports will drop out.","for example, my z690 hero will let me run 4x 4.0 and 1x 3.0 ssds with zero impact to the gpu.","the z790 version bumps that to 5 x 4.0.

but, be aware that all but one of those drives are chipset connected, which means 4 share a single 8x 4.0 interface to the cpu (along with all other system devices other than the gpu), so simultaneous heavy use of two 4.0 ssds can technically saturate that connection.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh ok i misunderstood what you mean on your original comment then.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what current z790 mobo from asus would you say would let me run at least two gen4 nvme ssd without cutting my gpu speed down ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no worries, i canâ€™t wait to upgrade to 15th gen intel so i can have 4 gen 4 drives if i want in the future",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all of them?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol already looking ahead so far.,iâ€™m still on 11th gen for now too and iâ€™m okay with 1 m.2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"as a dude with a 12900k and a 4090, go 13700k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i5, you dont need an i7 for 4k gaming, especially not at only 120 hz.",anyone who says otherwise is either playing city builders or doesnt have a clue,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13600k is fine.,"for rich gamers like you that can afford it, i recommend multiple ssds so you have two copies of your data.",so if one ssd dies your data is still safe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
go i9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i9 is better for games due to its higher working frequencies.,"i7/i9 eats almost the same amount of watts, so you need efficient aio for both cpus.",if money isn't a question - go for 13900k.,"you're already aiming at the best gpu/display, why would you use not the best cpu?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm running a 12600k and just ordered a 13600k for my 4090. do i need to go higher?,i feel like it's the sweet spot for the budget.,i just game at 4k@120 mainly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you're operating an old schema, which was broken by a 4090. some games are poorly coded and cant reach over 100 fps due to a 'slow' cpu, actually cpu isn't slow at that moment, but it needs to perform fast that garbage code to reach higher frames, even 120.

the amount of frames that 4090 can render is far more than we were able to get on the previous gen at 4k, and 4k may stay a simple '1440' for a 4090, removing itself from being a bottleneck.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hi, yea seems like reasonable to me as well.",i ended up with 13700kf but it's still in transit so i can exchange.,i was thinking it should be okay with going for just medium tier option.,i'm not planning to change my monitor since it's 48 lg oled tv and i really like it.,will stick around with 'just' 120 hz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as far i know it's going to to be easier to overclock i5 or even i7 than i9 when you need to maintain stability on all cores + amount of power draw from i9 oced is really pushing most of the 360mm to limits.,i don't want to spend another 200 bucks for delidding i9 to  keep it in a normal temps.,this stuff was tempting and it was fun when best i7 cost like 300-350 usd like 8700k + cheap delidding tools not like 600 bucks + another 200 for the equipment.,im actually watercooled with 3x360mm rads so i don't have to worry much about the cooling but i9 is kinda like 4090 it;s better to undervolt if you don't have very good cooling solution and you need to win silicone lottery as well (or go and buy 13900ks).,if i dont need to go above 120 fps is i9 really needed?,most of games prefer higher frequency cores instead of amount of the cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"stupid, its only 120 hz.",'why not just get the best one is a dumb answer.',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the best for what?,an i9 has double the e cores.,"if op plans to edit 4k videos in his spare time, or transfer large files constantly, i9 may be for him.",otherwise it makes little difference in gaming performance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its probably fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's completely irrelevant, arguing that the bottom 1% of games that are poorly coded for high cpu usage is not a practical or real use case.",i'm not theorycrafting here this is real world use.,4090 w/5800x here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the low input lag totally makes up for it anyways, i also use the c2 oled and it's great",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're not familiar with how these things work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
op did have the nicest display and best of the best gpu.,why does he need to limit himself to 5% straight performance and better improvement for low fps in games like the spiderman series?,saving 200 bucks?,that's silly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i went anyway haha.,it gains like 20 or 30 frames and makes my games run at 120 4k a little easier.,both awesome processors either way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"your fantasy will break after you enable gpu monitoring, or at least will use alt+z sometimes to view if your gpu is loading 90% or less.",if that happens - start counting how many games.,there is a topic around from a guy with 11700k who was struggling to get 144 fps with his 3080 in warzone2.,11700k is slightly better than yours 5800x and it was a bottleneck for 3080 at 1440p.,please stop sticking exceptional 4090 for your old schema with gpu bounding at 4k.,if you're afraid of listening to some random guy in reddit comments - watch the hardware canucs [video](https://youtu.be/yqviii515ki).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"why would you assume op plays that particular game, or cyberpunk, or whatever stress-test meta game people throw around these days like crysis 3 back in the day.","200 bucks is not nothing, why would he waste 200 bucks on an i9 when he stands to gain nothing from it?",a 13600 or 1700k is perfectly fine for gaming.,at 4k his gpu will be at 99% utilization with either processor.,"aio is also not necessary for the 13700k i can tell you that much, unless planning to overclock, but overclocking is really not necessary with this cpu.",provided you have decent airflow case + at least a dual tower air cooler.,"with a 4090, he might need some more fans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you have to check motherboard vendors' website for certified memory modules with frequencies you willing to buy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's unclear to me from your message that you referring to basic motherboard info that it supports 'up to 7000' or a direct memory module list with vendor name timings and capacity that supported by the [motherboard](https://rog.asus.com/motherboards/rog-maximus/rog-maximus-z790-hero-model/helpdesk_qvl_memory/).,so you even can pick those 7800mhz modules and be okay because they were tested,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think i explained the issue here in a wrong way , my concern isn't the motherboard ( because i've already checked that my mb can supports memory higher than 7000+ ) 
 intel core i7 13700k spec say that the core i7 13700k supports memory ddr5 5600 according to the intel website , besides of the mb which can supports the ram mt/s up to 7000+ then why intel says the core i7 13700k supports memory type 5600 ?",", are you saying that it doesn't matter what cpu says and if mb can supports more cpu will go on with it ?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i5 12400 or the upcoming 13400, but for the latter wait for a b760 board as 13th gen doesn't play nice on b660s.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but i guess none of them would work on my current board right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sadly intel isnt so nice to release new cpu's that fit into a 5years old motherboard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh you sweet innocent yet naã¯ve summer child.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
task manager clearly shows it running at 100%.,"checking on my laptop and i see the same behavior, despite performing excellent on 3dmark benchmarks and games (among peers).","so the issue is with kombustor and in fact, looking at their [change log](https://www.geeks3d.com/furmark/kombustor/downloads/) it is clear that they never added support for any intel igpu beyond the hd 630 back in 2017. 

that's why it isn't reading the sensors properly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"because it's shared memory, which is allocated from ram, your gpu will use what it needs.","looking at the utilization, your gpu is working as intended and 2gb was what it needed to run the benchmark, it's just bad because it's an igpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"because it is slow, pretty expected",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i got an i7 12gen, as from what ive seen this igpu runs valorant for around 100 fps, i run this game at 8 fps, i got 24gb memory.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 96eu version of iris xe was the fastest igpu on the market at release and even now [only the 680m](https://www.computerbase.de/2022-08/mobile-igpu-amd-intel-test/) beats it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
kombuster is not a game.,more ram will not make your games run faster.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"true, but the 680m is not just a little faster, it's a whole new level of performance for integrated graphics.",it's 60-100% faster than iris xe depending on the game.,and you won't have to deal with intels graphics drivers.,"the guy was right, amds igpus are fantastic.",you can get them in mini pcs now.,"i'm actually thinking of getting one as an htpc that can also do a little gaming, they're that good.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"im not talking about kombuster, there  is a game called ""valorant""..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ooh iâ€™d definitely recommend you wait for the ryzen 7000 mobile series to come out.,"if youâ€™re not in a hurry, you can probably get a mini pic in less than a year with the new phoenix point or dragon range apus with rdna 3 architecture.","rumors are is that it can perform as well as a mobile rtx 3060 running at lower wattage (60 or 80, canâ€™t remember).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i'm aware of those.,"one rumor says that they're going to double the cu count from 12 to 24, and upgrade them to rdna 3 as well.",that will definitely make the lowest end video cards more or less obsolete.,"it's gonna be at least a year before they become widely available though, and maybe even longer to become affordable.","with 680m you get good enough performance now, and when it's no longer good enough you can plug in an external gpu and still use it for gaming.",the cpu should be fine for gaming for a long while.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i assume the pcb is thicker on that board for whatever reason.,is it more than 8 layers?,asus doesnâ€™t seem to specify how many layers it is.,"iâ€™m pretty sure the z690 hero is 8 layers, but evga has a 12 layer z790 board so higher is possibleâ€¦ especially at the price of the extreme.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
huh?,the ilm is the exact same on every motherboard.,are you really sure you have it the right way?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
others have run into this problem with the tg frame on z790.,you can get longer screws or get a different plate.,i bought the thermalright one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
daggyz i had 0 issues installing the thermalright contact frame on my z790 maximus extreme.,you might consider switching it out with the thermal grizzly one.,steve at gamers nexus says there no performance difference between the two so you have nothing to lose.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
having the exact same problem right now on a rog strix z790-f. coming from a direct die 9900k so it's not my first time.,the screws definitely aren't long enough.,"i can get one side in, but then the other side is already lifting up.",following the gn video where the guy screws backwards at the beginning... that's not even possible.,the screws aren't even reaching the hole to hear a click when screwing backwards.,"when i'm reading, that strix z790-e is working well, i'm not sure anymore if it's the mainboard.",i guess it's probably a wrong batch of the frame.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just an fyi the tg frame isn't supposed to screw down flush to the mainboard it has space between the frame and the mainboard where the screws go in it.,the other frames come into contact with the mainboard like the original ilm.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
weird.,debrauer recently showed in his [ek cryo cooler video](https://youtu.be/_wcegymcb7w) that the contact frame fits into the board.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"update: fixed

basically the issue is that the screws that come with the motherboard don't entirely thread all the way to the end of the screw.",the tolerance with the contact frame is very precise it seems and it definitely needs that tiny bit of thread length on the screws to be there to be able to mount.,"solution: 

buy same 6/32 screws but make sure they are threaded to the end.","i purchased some everbilt branded ones but with a hex key socket head that still fits within the frame, and the thread reaches until the very end, allowing it to grab on to the backplate and mount correctly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"mine was like this, just had to use a little bit of pressure to start it.","you are not supposed to screw it all the way down anyways, you're barely supposed to have the threads start to prevent hurting the memory channels.",mine works fine and i've seen upto 10c drops with my 13700k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have the same problem.,"i managed to do it by forcing the screws down, then decreasing the pressure bit by bit.","i have not tested the system yet, hopefully it will do the trick.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i use z690 maximus  extreme, same problem here, wasted full day without sleep to figure this out still nothing can be done, i change to thermalrigth bcf easy no issue can install.",tg contact frame may need to add on longer screws as maybe asus extrem mobo is thicker,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have the z790 maximus hero and tg frame.,while i could get it on it was only barely as the screw could just get grip but i feel itâ€™s not even.,"one corner a,ways difficult.","i tried two times now reseating frame and water block, and my water block does not get perfect contact.",i suspect the tg frame is not even due to very short screws.,i have a convex/concave water block.,ek quantum magnitude.,so iâ€™m considering trying the oem ilm.,maybe it will be better for this installation and water block.,half top cpu 13900k donâ€™t have contact resulting in half of p cores up to 10c hotter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
does anyone know if the default contact frames on the z790 boards were fixed to avoid the bend on cpu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hole location is not.,ct is not needed anyway,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes i know.,orientation is correct.,transferring it from a z690 hero to a z790 extreme and it legit does not fit.,i can get one corner to screw in but that is because of some tolerance to work with.,"the others are not able to screw in because the tolerance is not there anymore, and push down with some backing behind the back plate and pushing on the frame firmly still does not allow any other screws to thread.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am genuinely baffled why people buy the more expensive yet worse product out of the two.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i wonder what the issue is, because when comparing the screws to those on z690 hero they look pretty much the same.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"same issue as mine, and same steps taken following the gn video.",you make a good point about a bad or different batch of the screws provided with the motherboard possibly.,"i've just purchased some same length 6/32 screws at the local hardware store, unfortunately they didn't have enough of the next size up in length in stock, but what i noticed was these threads looked to have more threading at the very end when compared to the ones that came with the motherboard.",i will update later with my results.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm having z790-e, can report that same issue exist, stock ilm screws are not long enough :(",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
right.,the issue is the screws seem to not be long enough to mount it like so.,or the pcb/backplate is different in thickness on this board.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh wow.,"i'm honestly intrigued now because mine just does not want to fit, but clearly his works so i wonder what the difference is.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you happen to have a link to the screws you purchased?,i'm also having this issue with the frame on my asus z790 maximus hero,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks for posting that screw size, unbelievably hard to find the cpu backplate screw size for the intel 1700 socket_x000d_  
_x000d_  
i'm having the same problem as others on my rog strix z790.....they really should include screws with these tg kits given how expensive they are.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
right.,"the issue is the screws don't reach to even be able to start to thread, even with massive pressure.",one side is doable but like you said it's not suppose to be all the way down.,"getting longer screws would fix the issue, but the question remains, is the pcb thicker or is there some variance in the two thermal grizzly contact frames i purchased that don't allow them to install?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>een damaged causing it to not be able to fit all four screws properly.,"have you tried checking the backp

is work fine?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
result ?,i have same issueâ€¦ and half p cores up to 10c hotter â€¦ iâ€™m considering stock ilm.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"update, i try to use longer screw that come with aio ryujin 2 have 6-32 unc but with philip head but i dont think it matter, i use the shorter one that is 8mm lenght (i believe it is longer by 1.65mm than original screw) and it work fine just enough to cover to then end orginal backplate.. 

am not sure is there any other effect later on but the lenght is just nice with my z690 maximus extreme maybe because of the thicker pcb layer",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i just tried to do this on my z790 hero and sure enough, screws are to short to thread  properly with the contact frame installed.",debating if i should get longer screws and try again.,although i wonder if this will effect the torque applied during installation.,"edit: tried a thermal right frame and while it did work, my pcie lanes for the gpu slot went to 8x.","maybe i used to much or to little torque when installing, regardless i am going back to stock ilm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not needed i can confirm on aorus master with 13900k bitspower block,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thats really weird.,it should be the same.,because you should be reusing the same screws..... sorry i dont know much more,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
got the same problem with rog strix z790-f. i'll try the thermalright soon.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m not sure but some reviews by end users i read on the tg frame had the same problem on z790.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you tried installing the backplate for your cooler first before you install your contact frame?,gn talked about having the backplate from you cooler installed first so itâ€™s easier for you to screw the contact frame in place.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"https://www.homedepot.com/p/6-32-x-1-4-in-hex-socket-head-stainless-steel-socket-cap-screw-2-pack-805098/204274323

actual screw is way shorter than the picture.","make sure you have a set of both metric and sae allen keys as what one of the reviews said, the socket seems to be a weird in-between size but as long as you have a set of both allen keys you should find one that fits.",you will need to buy two two packs.,you can honestly find any screw that is 6/32 ã— 1/4 as long as the head fits and the threads reach the end.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not sure if it helps but for comparative purposes i am using the asus rog strix z790-e mobo.,i can't imagine there being a massive difference in pcb thickness but i suppose it's possible.,i think the easy solution here is to buy a thermalright for $15 off amazon and see if the issue persists......if it does then i think this might answer some questions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i used other screws from my other z690 mb and they did the trick right away.,z790 extreme has screws that are not threaded at the end.,thatâ€™s the problem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i am ""happy"" that another one confirm my thoughts.",i have the tg frame and yes although i could install it the screws are so short that it feels wrong in a way.,i think it makes the frame not even which is super important.,i reseated twice to learn that my water block does not make contact at top cpu.,also i learned that my expensive water block is (ek quantum magnitude) actually convex specifically designed to intel concave ihs.,so i actually need a little bend lol!,so my results are in check running stock but half p cores are up to 10c hotter than rest thereby limiting a lot my oc potential!,so in a few days im gonna revert to stock ilm.,i am sorry to hear with the 8x pci-e. but have you otherwise great results temp wise?,i have same mobo as you.,i was also very careful not to overtight this frame as in the end its the socket pins taking the pressure..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did the thermalright frame went fine with the z790-f board?,i ordered the same board and i plan to get the thermalright contact frame,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, makes no difference unfortunately.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hmm i did not notice if i have that issue.,my thought is that they are too short â€¦ iâ€™ll take it apart tomorrow â€¦.,i have to try my water block on stock ilm as itâ€™s specific designed for that â€¦ some thing i first read and noticed some days ago haha â€¦.,"if it works great with ilm, iâ€™ll save the tg contact frame and save up for a flat cold plate for the water block and then some proper screws and do a lapping.",but for now i need to get better contact and temps.,iâ€™ll post result tomorrowâ€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i went right back to stock, going to test the thermal right again see what happenes.",i may have out to little force last time.,or to many.,not sure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it was just delivered.,i'll try it later today.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i installed thermalright with original screws without any problems.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
from your previous comment you said you were able to get one in because of tolerance.,it seems like the backplate for the ilm and the contact frame is not installed properly or has been damaged causing it to not be able to fit all four screws properly.,have you tried checking the backplate to see if there is any damage?,i doubt thatâ€™s the reason but itâ€™s what i can think off.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have unfortunately a water block contact issue.,i started with tg contact frame but it was uneven contact and some p cores up to 10c hotter.,"i then today reverted to stock ilm, and that has made it worse.",even at -.0095v offset  some p cores (half cpu) gets to 100c.,in cb r23.,the water block is one of the most expensive out there: ek quantum magnitude rgb so its incredible disappointing!,also to take apart the pc all the time!,i'm just done for it!,this is a great example of buying the most expensive don't give best results!,the water block is convex designed for intel concave ihs.,but top half cpu just does not give contact and worse with ilm.,i reseated all 3 times.,so this is bs.. i am gonna write to ek and hear what they say.,"there is the possibility to lap the ihs, use contact frame again with correct screws but then i will have to buy a new cold plate for the water block that's perfectly flat and all these toy exchange parts for this block are very expensive!",its just a principle for me that out of the box it performs bad considered it should be among the best and most expensive!,i am mad now!,:)   i am going into a think box atm haha!,:)  but otherwise its an awesome cpu no doubt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what were temps like after u switched to stock?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the update.,"good to know, guess i'll be doing the same when it arrives",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no damage to either plate.,i actually just went and picked up another contact frame from the central computers and low and behold same thing...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so if u had just used the stock ilm without ever trying the tg u think you would have avoided all this?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe tried the thermalright one from amazon.,it can be easily returned anyway.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you follow exactly what gn did for the installation of the frame then i am honestly out of idea.,so itâ€™s either yourâ€™s defective or tg made some change to the frame.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, i just installed the ilm yesterday- it was way worse!",even with voltage mod its still 100c in cb r23.. so i have ordered the correct screws for the contact frame and will go back to that along with lapping the cpu and water block!,so it will be a few weeks before i have all parts .,.,.,but even with the incorrect screws the contact frame is better than stock ilm.,now i tested both.,disaster with my water block and stock ilm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah all i can think of is that tg made changes, maybe even a bad batch?",i would say pcb but clearly in the video they have it on the same board just fine...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
haha.. you and i are in somewhat similar boat.,i also hit 100 in r23 immediately.,i'm running 2 internal 360 rads and a mora with 25degrees water temp.,my 4090 hits 44 at max.,with 200/1500 oc.,the cpu on the other hand... sucks.,"i've seen package temps of 55degrees just browsing chrome... i've only been on stock ilm so far, will switch to thermalright contact frame tomororw.",honeywell tpm7950 pad which is supposed to be good...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
try contacting thermal grizzly about it.,see what they have to say.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when i used the  cf i had better results.,i can however get the cpu down with tweaks.,but itâ€™s never gonna be perfect before i do the mods.,the convex water block is not optimal for a flat cpu obviously.,"so i am lapping the ihs, reinstall the cf and j bought a flat cold plate for water block.",and liquid metal under ihs heheâ€¦.,i expect amazing results but cannot do the mods before one week time.,please let me know your results with your frame.,should no matter what be better than stock ilm.,"but let me know your results and experience, also was the mount and screws good?",good luck,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i think i will.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i havent tried the contact frame but will do it today or tomorrow.,mine is the thermalright one so there should be no issues with screws.,i've also purchased the fengzao one and maybe will try that next week.,"i'm using soft tubing, so i should be able to remove the block and change frames without draining.",hmmm what if you didn't lap either the cpu or the block?,wouldn't they fit by default?,i assume by default ekwb makes the blocks fit for the cpus without lapping.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"seems normal to me, put on a power limit or undervolt.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is normal.,if you want to lower the temp you will have to undervolt or limit power draw.,these cpus run very hot under extreme stress.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what motherboard do you have?,you have to set a lower vcore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that sounds weird.,"when all fans in my case are full blasting i was looking at ~75c max, and iâ€™m using a 240 aio instead of a 360.
even when my case fans arenâ€™t spinning much, purely relying on the 2 aio fans still yields me max ~90c.","i would suggest to go into bios and check for certain settings like cpu voltage, mce and llc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a 13700kf/prime z790-p on a custom loop as well.,i get around 70c depending upon the ambient temp on r23 running 5500mhz all core and 2 cores at 5900mhz.,i used the guide below to properly tune it.,https://www.overclock.net/threads/asus-maximus-z790-extreme-and-intel-i9-13900k-a-tuning-guide-for-beginners.1801569/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is not normal.,i have a 13700kf and cool it with a kraken x63 280mm aio and my temps stay around 72c running cinebench all core with a score of 31k.,no undervolting at all.,just enabled gaming mode on msi mb.,my radiator definitely puts out heat during the test.,something isnâ€™t right.,"i did use thermal grizzly extreme paste, not sure if that makes a difference",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if his radiator is not getting hot at all, no warm air coming from the rad then he has poor or no contact to the cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"mce is disabled, already undervolted and it saved me some temps but not anything significant, i'll start messing with the llc's soon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gaming mode seems like a sus setting.,elaborate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ah ok, i was asking because in msi motherboard there is a setting â€œcpu lite loadâ€ that simplify a lot the voltage settings, it just lower the vf-curve giving much better voltage and temperatures, i don't know if in asus motherboard there is something similar",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that sound like youâ€™ve done most you can do.,undervolting alone should give at least 10c temp drop especially youâ€™re undervolting 0.15v.,maybe you should also look at power limits if you donâ€™t mind sacrificing ~10% performance.,pl1 at 125w helps a lot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the only one thatâ€™s somewhat difficult to install is the thermal grizzly one because it requires very specific torque specifications.,the thermal right is easier than screwing in a lightbulb.,just leave your cpu in the socket when you take off the stock one youâ€™re golden.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it does help.,i use the thermalright one with my 13900k.,just donâ€™t over tighten it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"had thermalright for my 13600k since day one, it puts much less stress on the cpu than the default ilm.","if you feel intimidated here are some tips:  
1) use some masking tape to secure the back plate of the default ilm, the backplate will fall off when you removed all 4 screws.",2) put the cpu in the socket before unscrewing the ilm.,"this will protect the motherboard pins, the screws are not overly tightened and can be removed easily with very little force.","3) don't overtighten the screws when installing the frame, stop when you feel resistant and then do a 90-degree turn to tighten it a bit more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i didn't notice any temp gains, all within margin of error.","imo its worth it for peace of mind and to help with thermal paste overspreading., plus it kinda looks cool, but then again no one sees it.","its just four screws, very easy.",since you will be doing that i'd suggest to take the opportunity and apply quality thermal paste e.g tg kryonaut extreme.,also careful not to drop anything on the socket pins.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i used the thermalright on my 13700k build.,didn't have any trouble but was definitely nervous doing it.,definitely watch youtube videos about install.,i put the cpu in the socket and then removed the stock bracket just incase something were to fall on the socket.,then counter rotated the screws till they clicked and then cross tightened till i hit a wall with two fingers on the little tool.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just installed the thermalright one on my z790 board with a 13900k.,i'm actually impressed that it does what it's meant to.,dropped my temps and keeps the cpu package temps just below 100 degrees for the most part.,there is the occasional 1-2 cores that still thermal trottle when you are running a long benchmark but on the whole i'm quite impressed with how easy it was to install for the benefit at least in my scenario.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i just installed it on msi z790 carbon gaming with i9 13900k and z73 kraken 360, i was suffering from thermal throttling on xtu once i run it immediately and gaming temps (simracing titles) reaching 72c and idle temps reaching 45c, now idles between 30 to 35c, gaming i'm between late 50s to early 60s.",it did a great job for me to be honest.,"by the way, i'm not into benchmarking, just simracing only.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just ordered a thermalright frame as well and recently discussed if i should get a different aio.,"i'm hoping it's fine considering i've had this build for a year so hopefully whatever bending or deformation happened, can be ironed out and that's not permanent.","i am in the same boat as you but after i get it installed, i'll edit this comment to let you know about the results.","from what i've read through numerous posts, the contact frame mods works best with a flatter coldplate so aios and waterblocks like the lfii should benefit greatly.",asetek aios which are slightly convex may not benefit as much.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it was real ez to install.,the only thing that concerned me was dropping something on the motherboard pins.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
does it still work on cpus that have been used with the standard ilm already?,as far as i understand if you use the standard motherboard ilm for a while itâ€™s already â€œtoo lateâ€ and the cpu will have bent permanently.,maybe thatâ€™s why some people donâ€™t see any differences in temperatures?,i could be wrong though but i think iâ€™ve read that they could measure the bending after taking out the cpu hence it should be permanent (?),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have the thermalright and used it with my 13700k and nhu12a.,iâ€™m not noticing a huge difference in temps if any tbh.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i dunno tbh i wanted to buy one, people say grizzly is easier to put on but at the end of the day if you understand it then itâ€™s not hard to put on.","the thermal right has like a better or the same effect as the grizzly one, everyone will say grizzly is better since it has the measurements on the screw inserts but the thermalright kinda is just as easy.",youâ€™d have to do do even tighten pressure so like x-pattern till you feel tension with the cpu pins and then stop which i kinda like more.,(just be carful and do like 90â° on each screw at a time).,but yeah i think it wonâ€™t become common that contact frames replace the originals since itâ€™s not as user friendly.,"anyway 


tl:dr. contact frames are better but look up a video on correct usage",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the thermal grizzly one is nearly impossible on 13th gen..  at least on my asus z790-e board the screws were too short and i couldn't even use it.,at best i only got 1 screw to thread then i couldn't get another screw to catch the threads.,the thermalright one worked great on the other hand!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you should elaborate in over tighten.,"ie, turn screws until they stop.",turn untill resitance then a 1/2 turn and stop.,hand tight then a 1/4 turn.,non of the reviews ever cover priper mounting pressure outside of getting a nm torq screwdiver.,i am curious as i would like to get one of these brackets too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you can just leave the cpu in place.,there's no need to take the cpu out when you do the assembly process.,"it sounds wrong, but the cpu won't break because of some screws bouncing off the ihs.","motherboard pin, on the other hand, most certainly will break.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i bought the thermal grizzly contact frame since i wanted to support der8auerâ€™s continued development.,i had the same issue as you though using an asus z790 motherboard.,i had to buy a set of 6-32 3/8â€ screws to get it to work.,heâ€™s really got to update the instructions or provide the screws.,i could easily see somebody putting too much force on the cpu trying make it â€œfitâ€.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

depends on the motherboard.,"they work on 13th gen.

for my asrock z790m-i, i got my thermal grizzly contact frame screwed in no problem.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it does not screw in unless you have a backplate installed, such as the ones that come with aio's.","the screws are not too short, buying longer ones just means you are applying too much pressure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"installation how to:

gamers nexus has a video on the thermalright frame and a segment in it is about installation.,i have also bought one for my 13600k and installed it day 1 - it was easy even though i was a first timer installing a cpu on the mobo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
glad it helped.,:),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean when you start feeling the screw is not loose any more.,what you want is something that is not lose but also no overly tightened.,if you get to the point where it cannot be tightened anymore then just go backwards in like 90 degree to loosen it a bit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's assuming there was a cpu in there in the first place.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great to hear!,"iâ€™m thinking about changing the ilm on my 12600k as well, i just bought and installed it before going abroad for a couple of months so itâ€™s sitting there unused and potentially bending :) i will check it out when i return.","igor mentioned that itâ€™s more likely to bend under heavy use/high temps, so maybe iâ€™m lucky.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i found something from igor, he was wondering about the same thing but the answer is still kinda vague:  

â€œbut anyway, i just put the cpu into a socket without a washer mod to see what happens.","after the first installation, the cpu was still unchanged and even after 8h in prime95 small-fft at 5.1 ghz and 1.2v, the shape of the cpu seemed unimpressed.","but after 2 days and various heat cycles, something actually happens and the ihs slowly loses its convex shape.","considering that my i9 cpus have been in use for months, i wouldnâ€™t be surprised if the i3 also had a concave valley in the middle after a few weeks, as long as it was consistently run in a standard lga1700 socketâ€ (https://www.igorslab.de/en/lga1700-washermod-part-2-mainboards-ilm-manufacturer-and-cooler-before-and-after-comparison/2/)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i mean itâ€™s the same install process, the thermal grizzly one has less variation in build quality so they have a â€œcookie cutter wayâ€ of putting it on correctly, canâ€™t really say itâ€™s easier since you should be putting them on the same way.",again just confused what you mean by easier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you are supposed to use the stock screws from your board?,i don't understand how it is suddenly shorter.. maybe the backplate feel off and you didn't notice?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yah get the thermalright one.,asus on 13th gen used slightly shorter screws so it wonâ€™t work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what i meant is that gamers nexus say the thermalright one is easier to install - kind of as i said above.,if you're confused about that feel free to give them a message and ask them what they meant by that.,regarding my personal comments though about it being easy to install.,"well, it was easy to install.",there's not much more to say on the matter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

probably a few degrees iâ€™m sure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
after installing is there much difference?,also did you tighten the screws much i see online some people recommend just having the screws turned 90 degree's only other say turn until you feel good tension.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

everything ok.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
really ?,because i started getting higher ping in games itâ€™s lagging and i donâ€™t know if this may have caused it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"oh no that wouldnâ€™t work because the msi website has a very outdated driver for my pc, the driver dates back to 2018 so i leave it like it is.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you should be *very* concerned about this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tj max is 100c.,how did you get to 112?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
obviously yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"either your monitoring software is misreporting things, or youâ€™ve modified various rather important settings in the bios.","technically the system should not let itself go higher than 100(ish), and as a safety backup, should power off as soon as it hits 110.

i kind of feel the issue is with the software.",verify with a program like hwinfo64.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
make sure you update your motherboard bios.,if the bios is bugged then manually set the temperature limit at 95 degree.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m running a 13900k with a d15 with an unlocked power limit with no issues on an msi z690.,iâ€™m just a gamer so i have no reason to run cinebench i ran it for like 5 minutes once it topped out at 98c.,itâ€™s at 5.5 p core 4.3 e core.,in 3d mark time spy extreme cpu test the hottest iâ€™ve seen it get was 88c.,i generally just play games and it doesnâ€™t usually go above 80c.,for stress test i just use intel burn test very high and that doesnâ€™t hit 100c either but close.,make sure you are using the correct mounting kit (the lga 1700 mounting kit for the d15 which you have to buy separately),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
put a cooler on your cpu next time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"probably it's pulling power above 300watt, make sure in bios pl1 is 125 and pl2 is 253

fan curves enabled in bios
mce (multi core enhanced) is off in bios",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you just doing benchmarks?,i doubt a game will peg the threads like that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ill check bios first.,i have a asrock z790 tiachi what settings do i check in the bios?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lmao i think asrock bios has no chill.,i set tj maxx to 100 and the default \[auto\]  was 115c max !,[gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|neutral_face),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is your average cpu temps in cpu intensive games like bf 2042 on the 13900k?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
!,[gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grimacing),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok thanks ill check it out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah this is just stress test benchmarks and stuff.,although i do feel the temps even in gaming are kind of high but never touches 100c it usually hovers around 84 or something.,but i made the choice to change the cooler.,buying a new type of thermal paste like thermal grizzly and buying a artic lf 360mm aio,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would just load defaults.,"but if you havenâ€™t specifically gone in there and modified those settings, it really feels more like a misreporting issue.",check with other software.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 yo - i was having this issue with the same cpu/mb combo.,i was using intel extreme tuning utility  for monitoring and i realized my cpu under load was hitting 115. it was default bios settings too.,"i did buy a contact frame, some better thermal grease, slightly changed my radiator fan position, and dropped 15 degrees.","look up the reviews of the thermal grizzly contact frame, its an issue with the mount is that it slightly bows the cpu not allowing for full contact with your cooler.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a spare asrock z790 itx and tested on 13900k no issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well i did try cinebench r23 and did a multicore test and the hwinfo64 numbers in the cpu section were all red and were pretty much over 100c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ill see if i can find a way to limit the tj maxx through bios for now until i get a new thermal paste solution and set it to 100c like you said.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i know about that now.,but crazy this mb lets the chip run at 115c regardless to me thats just insane,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how much over?,100 is the throttling point and is perfectly normal and safe.,"thatâ€™s the max temperature the cpu wants to maintain, and a cpu like the 13900k without power limits will hit it.",you may see momentary readings of 101-103. more than that shown in hwinfo would be a serious issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whatâ€™s your cooler?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol.,i saw 104 for like a second at one point with unlocked power limits on an air cooler before i researched and tuned things.,glad thatâ€™s not terrible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
noctua nh-d15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m using a d15 with a 12900k and even that can throttle.,a 13900k is guaranteed to.,youâ€™re going to want to set reasonable power limits - likely 250 watts or under.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
an aio will benefit your system greatly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you think even the best aio in the market it will still throttle?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the d15 is rated for like 200,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
an arctic liquid freezer ii 360 or 420mm shouldnâ€™t throttle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, but depending on your case setup it can do better.","with a 12900k i tend to stabilize at 235 watts sustained load on a d15, but thatâ€™s also with no contact frame and less than premium thermal paste.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"huh, that would actually work for my 3900x with pbo then.",i guess i'll look into that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i was looking into those just now, 420mm looks crazy on a aio.",never knew it existed.,heard lots of good reviews on it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with liquid metal tim yeah won't throttle.,"with other normal pastes, it probably would.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well it would make sense, afaik it's max is 200w to keep it at **ok temperatures** rather than 100 and throttling ðÿ˜‚

idk if thermal paste quality would make such a gigantic difference as the tim used by intel is usually far worse than whatever arctic silver or whatever paste you'll buy from a store and more importantly: your thermal paste layer is **thinner**",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
careful with roblox.,that place is shady af and super risky.,they closed their own forums because they were unable to moderate it.,they don't even pretend to moderate the content in the game.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah i mean shit, you could get her a system for roblox super cheap.",almost anything can run it well enough for kids.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this setup gets weirder the longer i look at it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good point.,"99% of the time i am in the room and my kids only play with their cousins and classmates, but i completely agree, there are a lot of creepy people in those online games.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ooof!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah it's very much living room only in our house.,"that said the kid only plays with friends from real life, he chats via skype/teams not the game, and overall it's been a positive and social experience for him.","there are some real rip off purchases though, but he learnt that the hard way via pocket money spends and is now much more cautious.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ufffff 8700k best cpu, delided with liquid metal, best decision and so much fun building the system",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the new box style is basically the modern version of the older box styles 6th gen- 9th gen definitely had the more unique design which looks really nice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[this is the old box design](https://www.amazon.com/intel-i7-4770-quad-core-processor-bx80646i74770/dp/b07pnd9t4f/ref=sr_1_4?crid=3m4e8grbine5m&keywords=i5+4770k&qid=1669572891&sprefix=i5+4770k%2caps%2c289&sr=8-4), just given the simplified modern look.",bleh.,i agree that 8th gen boxes were pretty though lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my favorite component purchases were the oem parts that came in anti-static bags and a white envelope.,it just feels more pro-sumer if it comes without fancy packaging,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
naah.,"especially the ""for a great vr experience"" quotes don't age well.","what would the new cpus have, ""for a great metaverse experience""?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i am running a 9900kf and 3080ti currently in my rig so it's doing good i will have to update my mobo one day lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
saving on ink,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
definitely glad i chose the 8700k over the r5 1600. aged much better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,colorful retail packages for a component is just wasteful & dumb.,"make it black and white, put the specifications and requirements and call it a day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are the edge of consumer computing and now it looks like the chip belongs in a soul crushing office.,just a cpu sitting on a shelf in the it overflow storage room.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"frankly, they should just make the box a lot smaller and save all the extra plastic/paper and etc.",save our environment!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
idk why anyone cares what kinda box they have lol.,idk why a cpu box is bigger than my $1000 cellphone box ðÿ¤·â€â™‚ï¸,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the whole minimalist design hype is getting kinda boring,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i agree the 13700k box is bland af.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"good god, that old box is ugly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you and i made very similar upgrades.,the i7-8700k was an amazing cpu while i had it.,pushed it to a solid 5.0ghz overclock.,the old box style looked great.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
honestly itâ€™s kinda silly to make the boxes look so good considering very few of us will see one in a store or pick it off a shelf.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the new redesign of the old one is much more recognisable on a shelf tbf.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don't you know all sharp angles are new design hype... before that it was round corners.,before that..dark coloring..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i like the minimal design, but i literally couldn't care less what the box looks like considering i never look at it more than once.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's in keeping with the current fashion of flat design that was inspired by the move of mobile design toward simple flat images rather than the skeuomorphic design (images based on real things) that preceded it.,but on mobile at least there was a point to; getting rid of 3d and transparency effects simplified graphics rendering and lengthened battery life.,i'm not a fan of that trend.,the results are often very bland.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13900k comes in a wafer.,that is so dope.,but not worth 300 euro more then 13700k in europe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why bother?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
plp,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the new box looks a bit more professional honestly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i honestly like the 13 gen one more, but the 8 gen one is also fine",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the old intel logo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i like the new boxes better personally, sleeker design and just looks higher quality imo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
skylake boxes were the peak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wow, funny the 8000 series is old now...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they went from something cool to 2000s dvd graphics for all the upcoming movies they stuff into them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh shit, first glance i thought right was the new, because how flashy it look.",but i was wrong :(,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 7700k and 8700k boxes were the best,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, the current box design treats me like an adult.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very happy my 9700k came with a cool box.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i dunno... the i9 box is pretty sick...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i kinda like the 10th gen boxes best,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my 9900k ""box"" will always be the king",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think its cuz the old box looked too gameyâ€¦ they wanted something that also looked good for basic consumers to be sold on without being too intimidating,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thought we were reading left to right for a second.,i don't use intel so i wasn't sure ðÿ§,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yup!,"but this one:

no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
im gonna assume that the right one is the old one i don't really pay close attention to the box,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bruh!,no way!,the new design is 10x better.,way more clean and aesthetic.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the old ones are a lot more ugly imo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have a big moving box for pc hardware

"see the thing with the old box is i put it on a shelf because it looks good, but the new one is so bland i donâ€™t think iâ€™m going to.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it did me well but it was starting to show its age with a 3090. was definitely one of the best from intel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

just burn the box.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
now is a great time to upgrade your 1060. people are selling off graphics cards for cheap.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well at 4k you should be completely graphic card bound.,i am at 1440p looking for over 144hz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ngl back then i buy gpus based on the box design (on the same chip),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

your settings probably didn't apply.,i have msi motherboard and i9-12900kf.,i changed undervolt settings for 50 times before i read that you need to disable some security in bios - undervolt protection.,"when i turned that off, my settings applied.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
could you share what values you got?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no problem, if i can help just write me.","check the max watts running something like cinebench, if it is more than 253w then there is something wrong",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh i assumed from â€˜stock 13900kâ€™ we were talking any uncapped power limit.,"what a shame sorry to read that, best of luck with the next one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what app are you running to achieve these temps?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a lf 420mm and can sustain almost 280 watt forever.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is your vcore while running cinebench?,"1.4v is much, but that might just be a value when the cpu was idle.",in any case i would guess that you are pushing too much voltage to the cpu and that's just not coolable with normal means.,but in order to fix that you need to start your overclocks from the start and find out stable values that can keep you under the therman limits.,i personally have 1.3v during cinebench.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i donâ€™t think this will solve your problems.,you mention in your other comments you canâ€™t feel anything through the tubes and no vibration on the pump so iâ€™m leading towards a broken pump in the aio.,you sound like you know what youâ€™re doing so i assume you took the sticker off the cooler lol?,if you did then it sounds like your cooler is defected.,notice how your min temps at 26.5watts are 47c.,thatâ€™s not normal.,so leads me to believe there isnâ€™t any heat transfer taking place from cpu to radiator.,itâ€™s just boiling water in the aio.,try get a replacement aio and iâ€™m sure that will resolve the issue.,"also, just to confirm, when you have been remounting the cpu block, did it look like the mount was good?",as in the paste has been squished out to the edges across the whole cpu?,should look something like [this](https://www.ekwb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/08-1030x344.jpg),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12th & 13th gen is physically identical in terms of ilm.,just make sure you keep the ilm back plate on or you'll find yourself screwing into nothing and wondering why it won't work.,"here's some stujff you can do that should bring down the temps (if it's not a broken mount)

*cpu lite load down to 8 (should be 9 stock)

*long duration power limit 220w

*long duration maintained - 64s is fine, i would set to whatever the closest number to 100 you can put in

*short duration power limit 280w
 
*cpu core votage mode - offset mode

*cpu core voltage offset mode negative (-)

*cpu core votage offset (0.040) (remember, this is actually negative 0.040 because of the offset mode switch being to negative)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thanks again!,"i already did that, as the manual suggested :), if you take a look at my wattage is indeed always below 250w, precisely it is 200 watts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hows the 13600k ?,what was your last cpu ?,i want this cpu for 1440p gaming.,"coming from a 12400, would you think its a boost worth buying ?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
by the fact you're hitting 100c in 5 seconds.,and also no vibrations from the pump is a give away.,make sure it's plugged in properly or try a new fan or pump header,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think arctic recommends using the cpu fan header and they have a guide for different mobo manufacturers for setting up the fan curve.,"https://support.arctic.de/en/pwm-settings

you could give it a shot before going through the trouble of sending it back",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
try the aio header.,usually aio header is not pwm and usually has full dc power all the time.,it will spin your fans and pump to max as soon as you turn on the machine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"contact frame/washer mod

careful cooler installation

a case with top tier airflow helps - my cooler sits in the draft of a 180mm fan and cools the cpu passively much of the time.",there's certainly variance in how motherboards handle power delivery/voltage regulation and that can impact temps.,"i think this is the bulk of variation seen- just setting a slightly more conservative power limit helps a bunch, and undervolting even more - although i haven't had time to go through that process with the i9 yet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yes, fixed voltage.",my chips isnt be best in terms of silicon lottery so you may get better or worse results,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good news.,"i was able to get it stable using [intel extreme tuning utility](https://i.imgur.com/cyw2vpf.png)

in turbo boost you set it to 80w, which is the recommended for eco mode, and works pretty well.","in the games i've tried i'm getting 50c, which is really great.",[this guy](https://youtu.be/6niig7qycke?t=242) also talks about the app if you are interested.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
agreed.,the chip is insane.,"5.2/4.2 @ 1.1v, almost 37k, 195 watt at peak power.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you change min/max ring ratio?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah i dont know my actual fps, its limited to 138 fps.",gotta be somewhat higher,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"looks like he has an ultrawide, thus pushing more pixels than your g7.","i have the 32"" version of the 1440p/240hz g7 and an lg ultrawide that is 3840x1600.","the ultrawide obviously gets less frames as its pushing more frames...

that said, this game does not have a fps ceiling that i know of, check your settings, probably limited there.",i cap mine at 240. good luck!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thank you, what a wonderful starting point.",with default settings (except xmp for my ddr4-3600).,"mce on, i did -0.1 vcore offset and i'm running now a constant boost of 5.4-5.5ghz (5.0-5.1ghz before), pushing my cinebench (10min) from 38122 to 39750. all that with a noctua nh-d15.","pushing it to -0.105 was already too much, but -0.1 seems to run stable so far.","after turning off mce, all cores boost to 5.3ghz, still got 39570, temps are mostly between 85-90â°c now and no thermal thottling anymore.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mine is 270w with 0.0120v undervolt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for writing this up.,very useful information.,i'll be giving your numbers a go as my baseline to see what i can manage performance-wise.,the only thing i might try differently is limiting max power draw to 253w and checking gaming power stability and usage with that kind of undervolt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's quite good.,what kind of core voltage offset are you running to achieve this?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wow you have a golden sample.,do u have an asus board?,mind sharing your sp rating,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
okay im at - 0.08v and set pl1 & pl2 at 125w.,why do you go with 260w?,you doesn't have to.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
little to no difference.,every individual chip is different.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, but the post i was responding to was talking about 125w and 65w limits, which would arguably be reached by most users under normal workloads.","obviously if you set a limit above whatever your cpu regularly draws, then the limit will not be reached and cannot impact performance â€” but at the same time, having that limit is literally meaningless until the power draw reaches it, at which point it will impact performance.","but, cpus are clearly getting to the point where they are capable of drawing more power than can be effectively cooled, so power limits are going to be a fact of life.","but i would argue that undervolting should be step #1, and then after that, limiting your power draw to whatever your thermal solution can handle.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"got it, thank you!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you also run occt / prime95 avx tests?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think i will also do a power limit near 250w, depending on how much impacts on performance.","also, remember that this power numbers are only reached on huge demand on applications like cinebench, designed to use every little resource on the cpu.",on games you will not have that much.,"i do game programming and even when compiling a lot of things or shaders, that workload doesn't reach the constant load of cinebench.","&#x200b;

as a final notice, using intel extreme tunning, by default, 2 cores are in x58 (5800mhz).",i recommend you to put those on x55 (like the rest of them) so the voltage offset doesn't fail when trying to reach x58 with less voltage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i run a fixed voltage for both.,5.8p/4.5e/5.1cache.. voltage is 1.260v in the bios.,"if i run the cpu stock, i can get by with just 1.190v auto llc@230 watts max r23 30 minute.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i am confused here as i am running 6.2ghz from my 13900k, though the voltage is a bit high and even in a really excellent custom loop i'm hitting limits of the ihs i believe.","probably need to think about direct die and liquid metal next.. i am quite certain i got a golden sample though, a lot of people don't understand sp or dont talk about it or dont believe it.","mine changed when  i updated the bios for 13th gen microcode on strix z690a d4, running 32gb of g-skill b-die ddr4-4400 at cl 14 1.46v mem..

i am curios to see what other sp ratings people are getting (honestly) as ive seen some that were too good to be true and no screenshots to show it.. im wondering where i stand!",thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes i do!,"i have a 24cores, 32threads processor and i want to get as much performance as my aio can dissipate.","i work programming games, and i need to build, package, and compile often, so those cores really do a hard work all together.","if i go to 125w, performance will be reduced for sure.","and at 260w i do not suffer throttling, so it's my sweet spot",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
valid points here.,"will agree to disagree on undervolting in specific applications eg for work from home business use, the questionable stability over time from an undervolt would push me more towards power limiting over undervolting in those scenarios.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is your cooling solution/temp here?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
liquid metal makes me nervous.,try artic mx-6 first and then let me know if that helps,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh okay, im only gaming with my 13900k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i usually test with a super unrealistic workload, like prime 95 small ffts with avx.",any issues and i reduce the undervolt.,"this doesnâ€™t allow for those massive -0.1v undervolts that might pass cinebench or normal daily use, but like you, i donâ€™t want any instability.","but every hundredth of a volt drop does have a measurable impact on power draw and heat output, so i find it worthwhile.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"first of all, if budget is not a concern, i would suggest going with the latest tech, z790 + ddr5, considering you have spent such an amount on the cpu.","however, if you wanna save some bucks, look up the differences between z690 and z790, if you have a motherboard brand/model in mind, look up what their z790 counterpart has that the z690 hasn't and see if you need them.","now when it comes to ddr5, performance wise there isn't a lot of difference if you already have some high-end ddr4, a higher-end ddr4 can even beat lower-end ddr5 sometimes.","imo, having a ddr5 ready motherboard opens up room for upgrade when better and cheaper ddr5 sticks come out in the future.",if you decided to go with ddr4 you are pretty much stuck with a tech that is phasing out.,"edit: i forgot to mention, z690 will work after a bios update, make sure your motherboard support bios flashback feature that allows you to flash a new bios without a cpu, most if not all z690 should have this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
z790 better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"z790

i'm running 8200c36 32gb *hyperspeed*",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had a z690 paired with my 13700k but i wanted faster ram speeds so i went to the z790 platform.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ddr5 is better, aida bandwidth latency numbers are misleading.",and you don't need to go crazy on memory overclocking either.,use a 5600-36 profile and switch command rate from 2t to 1t and you are already nearly as fast as 6400 mt.,and for \*most\* realworld applications you will not notice (or even measure) a difference compared to 8000+ mt (unless you oc the cpu to go along with it).,"that being said, you already own 64 gb memory and money doesn't grow on trees.",your ddr4 at 3600 mt will never reach the throughput of any ddr5 sticks and the 13900k can make good use of it.,i bought a 32 gb kit of patriot 6000-36 sticks using the coveted hynix ics at 200 eur (incl.,vat).,that's less than what i paid for my 3200-14 ddr4 trident.z a few years ago.,ps: consider undervolting the 13900k.,if you are using a power limit then this will already give you a good performance boost and the power usage can drop considerably.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
z790 and ddr5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i use a z690 motherboard for my 13900k.,"i just bios flashed it, update the me firmware and updated the other me update via windows and that was that.",i have both a ddr4 board and a ddr5 board and the process was the same for both.,i use a 6400mhz gskill kit and have no immediate plans for faster memory so the z690 platform is fine.,and with no current upgrade path after the 13900k as there will be a new socket for next year i didnâ€™t see the point of the z790.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you're not going to overclock, then you will be saving a decent amount of change if you just go with a b660 mobo.",it can still run 13900k chip.,"as long the bios is flashed, where you can speak to the staff for them to do it for you at your local pc shop, then you're good.",i know thats how i did it at my location.,"with the b660 mobo, i was able to run my 13600k at 5.1ghz stock setting right outta the box.","for gaming ddr5 vs 4 isn't much difference, maybe you're looking at 8% difference at best, especially at 1440p+ gaming.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i do have a kit of trident ddr 5 64gb 6000 speed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which mobo do you have?,z790 apex?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
now i just wish nzxt would release there z790 board already.,i have the 13900k and ddr 5 sitting here waiting for it lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is the me firmware?,because i'm assuming i will have to do a bios update once i get the nzxt z690 board.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yep, z790 apex",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hi there, there are 2 versions thatâ€™s need updating.",the first version is for the firmware which were based upon 12th gen. so basically when you look for the bios for your board manufacturer you want the bios with the 13th gen cpu support and the updated me firmware update.,then just flash it.,the second one is and can only be updated via windows.,you download to your desktop and just run it .,it will then do the rest by itself.,also to answer your question about ddr4 vs ddr5 if you game at low res like 1080 or 1440p then is a small fps difference with the odd game showing larger gains.,but on avg it can be between 3-10fps depending on game.,is it worth it?,only you and your wallet can answer that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

found this, only thing suggested of importance i guess is disable fast boot.",power settings - what the power button does & in bios.,i'd do this before refreshing windows & keep it off.,also i just tested an older driver just to be sure & yes a newer driver will supersede it on restart.,so makes it kind of pointless because windows will get a newer driver unless you disable that too.,so keep this in mind.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for suggestions.,using driver explorer and reviewing device manager i was staying consistent with 3 different driver versions that i had indented to try.,asus version + 2x intel versions.,would retain at boot.,the older drivers would keep a startup entry in hklm\\currentcontrolset\\services.,netwtw10 + netwtw08 - i had tried removing 08 manually thinking it was perhaps trying to use both same time but no go.,all drivers gave same behavior.,"as did a fresh install of older win10 21h1

i did try disabling fast boot.",same thing.,also did bios flashback downgrade to previous bios.,asus tier 2 didn't really give it any time of day and went immediately toward labeling a hardware issue and going for rma.,their rma only offers refurb boards despite this motherboard being less than week old.,said no thank you and did a replacement on amazon.,replacement be in tomorrow.,+1 for amazon replacement.,lets just say i'm going to be bouncing off the walls if upon rebuilding system i get same behavior and this is a asus uefi mb / microsoft / intel software problem.,the net is riddled with ax200 + 201 code 10s going back 2 yrs.,i hope i'm wrong and its hardware issue that is getting resolved.,see what transpires - will share result of mb replacement.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"you need to enter the bios and find the 'lite load' setting and reduce it from 12 to 1.

"didn't find a lite load settings but saw a load line, not sure if that is similar, though it does not have a numerical value.",what about undervolting?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"undervolting is another option, the option i referred to is called lite load on msi, other brands maybe have a different name and i'm not sure what its called on those.",what mobo do you have?,"in any case get hwinfo64 and check the voltage under load during cinebench, its likely super high at default bios settings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think on gigabyte and b660 the option is to undervolt.,it would be useful if you could check what the stock voltage reading in hwinfo is first.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"kinda forgot the stock voltage but after seeing others with similar cpu the suggested offset is -0.150.

do i need to change anything else?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this really does not seem right.,"before undervolting, my reading on cinebench23 was 30800 or thereabouts.","after a -0.150v undervolt via the bios, i ran cinebench again and the score was hardly any lower, if any difference at all (cannot remember the actual numbers).","so your score seems much too low, and the undervolt does not seem to be the cause.","but i am no expert, so what is going on i cannot say.","btw my motherboard is a gigabyte aorus elite ax ddr4, i don't know what effect that has on the different scores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i wish i knew what to suggest to help.,"i have a noctua nh-d12l, so it's air cooled and seems to be ok. a couple of my cores did max at 100 during doom eternal, which is what made me try the undervolt.","it was only the 'max' spike though, so it was probably ok, but i am much happier with the lower numbers i am now seeing and with no performance loss that i can see.","i also fitted a thermal frame to be sure the cooler sits well to the cpu, but that only made a degree or so difference, so none of that would seem to be the cause of your situation.","i hope someone can help, if you are happy with your application of the thermal paste, i wonder if it is a faulty cpu?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
np.,"my 13600kf wanted to run at 1.375v at stock bios, on msi setting the lite load to 1 reduced it to 1.25v and no performance loss for me.",i've seen someone who had their 13700k running 1.45v at stock bios setting.,"its not that these chips run hot, its that motherboards are setting the voltages too high at stock.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i've been forgetting something important all this time, you also need to complete cinebench and make sure the undervolt is stable.",oops.,so many people i've advised on this and someone reminded me on ocnet it might not be stable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
before i had a cpu fan which ran couple of my cores to 103 and 101 degrees then  i installed the aio which stopped the temp to 100 max.,thermal paste is well cover the cpu.,no idea except to think something might be off with the cpu but then other things should also go wrong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea my 13600k would hit 1.4v no problem.,msi lite load at 8 and i'm g2g at 1.25v max during cinebench.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just reverted back to do a proper cinebench test and so far 1.360v to 1.387v across the cores  with temp on the package being 100 until it is throttled.,didnâ€™t quiet get what you mean â€¦ should i do a cinebench test after the offset?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you're getting almost 39000, sounds like you just lost the silicone lottery",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what are your sp scores for your cpu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s not low lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"try hwinfo64 to dump the average effective frequency, there might be a frequency drop somehow, and it can also show you what is the limiting factor.",my guess is current / power limit.,r23 is not ram-sensetive.,"even if you get spike up to 90 degrees you shouldn't see a throttling (the default tj is at 100 degrees if you have not changed it), and that is the expected result given your cooler.",it could also be too much programs running in the background.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for the reply.,"iâ€™m ok with accepting that fact, the thing is because these chips run so hot iâ€™m mainly looking for validation that iâ€™ve installed the cooler correctly and itâ€™s mounted right.",i havenâ€™t been able to see the chip push past 283w max whereas i heard itâ€™s supposed to go past 300w when unlimited,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it says sp 96 when i boot into bios,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
of course it is hot when you run cinebench.,">29c idle and gaming anywhere from 50-70c

that's great.",it isn't a cooler issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my score is low than yours.,"my cb 23 score is 38700ish with max temp 100c (it temp throttle), hitting 324w max.",to top it off i can only undervolt -0.020mv which does jack $hit with lowering temp.,at least it stays 60-70c while gaming so im cool with it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
check your individual p core and e core sp score.,if your p core is less than 100 than yeah you got a below average vid which is probably why even with unlimited power your chip is only reaching 39k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"interesting, so iâ€™m probably right in the ball park with the cooler mounted correctly, i guess can chalk it up to silicon lottery like the previous replies indicated.","iâ€™m curious why i canâ€™t break 300w though, what cooler are you running?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hey so i checked i believe it was 71 for the ecores i saw it a few hours ago but for sure it was in the 70s so looks like you are right, any recourse or should i just stick with it?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hey so i just doubled checked, p-core sp 106 and e-core sp 78, these are the values in ai tweaker\ai features.",in the bottom right hand in prediction it says sp 96 with a cooler 167 pts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
im using arctic freezer ii 360. im kinda surpise your cpu doesnt push further.,i highly doubt temp throttle is your issue since you dont even hit tjmax during cb.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i've been testing raptor lake, what i can say about this subject is that any potential cooling improvements will depend on the motherboard and it's socket

you aren't going to notice a difference without a/b testing or you did something like the other 12900k help thread yesterday where op spread the paste flat before putting the heatsink on which left an airbubble.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you probably should.,keep the old ilm.,they seem to have ok reviews on amazon.,are there any negative long term effects of the cpu plates?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's not explicitly necessary always on alder lake as is and raptor lake will likely be the same.,the most significant factors are how much thermal headroom you'll likely have with your use case and cooler selection.,some coolers and use cases absolutely do not need it and the risk of installing it (ie potentially voiding motherboard and cpu warranty) is not worth it.,i suggest seeing how you thermals are first unless you're opting for a cooler which regularly shows substantial benefit from a contact frame (in which case i'd reconsider the choice of cooler rather than a contact frame ideally).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just get the anti bending frame.,"it's not that expensive, is easy to replace and can only benefit you.",in germany it costs 13 euro on amazon since some time.,i got the exact same thing on aliexpress for 8 euro.,in general the 13th gen will have the same issue as the 12th gen. there isnt that much room to play with.,they will probably try to counter the bending a bit but overall the issue will stay.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gamers nexus got a 10 degree reduction with these things on a 12900ks.,i'll be getting one as i'll be using the same cooler they did in their review (arctic freezer2).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"probably, i don't see them changing the ihs.",i'm doing fine without a corrector though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there's no way they are changing their verified design to accommodate non-stock oc users or to improve their performance.,the risks are too high.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it really doesn't matter if you have the proper mounting kits.,"with my noctua d15 and the 1700 proper mounting kit they provided, i saw zero benefit with the contact frame.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, it will, it's going to have the same ihs and we already know z790 have same ilm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're talking about the contact frame.,"it's like $7 shipped on the slow boat from china, and has been proven to work by gamers nexus.",it can offer up to 10 degrees celsius cooling benefit in the worst cases of ilm pressure.,is $7 worth it for peace of mind?,i think so.,"as long as you aren't a jittery mess when you install it, there's very little risk of doing damage.",there's plenty of tutorials on how to easily install it online.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, the ilm isn't changing, only the cpus.","if you get an lga 1700 cpu,  and you care alot about thermals, then yeah i'd get a bend correcting frame.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

>are you sure?,"because the socket, socket lock and cpu should be exactly the same.",i am unable to google and find anything basically around the frame and 13th.,gen.. also because the z690 and z790 are basically twins hehe.. very very small internal change in chipset but exactly same layout and design.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"they use the same exact ilm on both chipsets, the cpu generation isn't the factor to consider.",it will be beneficial to either.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and what difference do you think that makes?,"this isnt an issue with the cpu, its an issue with the bracket on the motherboard.",z790s are still using the same retention brackets which means bending and even poor cooler to ihs contact out of the box will happen on any chip you put in them.,"the bending correctors also only work if the ihs and cooler contact plates are as flat as possible, if it doesn't work that means either or both of those are too uneven and not making good contact still, in that case the only option for improvement is to lap the ihs.",or it can also mean they were already flat with good contact to begin with.,"overall, using the bend corrector is far easier to do than either lapping or delidding, but for people it does nothing for then those are the two remaining options.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"with or without the same cooler (arctic freezer 2, size shouldn't matter as only the cpu mount does).","they did a bunch of contact tests, with stock retention bracket, the contact between the cooler baseplate and cpu ihs was horrendous, less than 50% of the cpu was touching the heatsink.","with both the thermaltake and thermal grizzly bend correctors, most of the baseplate was in contact with the ihs.","the reason the cooler is important is that it also has to be as flat as possible, and they said arctic freezer 2 has some of the most level baseplates out of most coolers.","if the contact frame did nothing, either the cooler base is not flat, or just out of the box the cpu could be even more uneven.",in that case the only way to get an improvement would be if the cpu was lapped.,also you mention 0 degree reduction as in you added it after already using the cpu and stock retention bracket?,is it possible that the cpus might even get slightly bent beforehand and then the contact plate cant straighten them enough?,(too small to notice by looking at it).,"i'll be wanting to put the thing on as soon as i get the 13th gen chip, so the ihs is as flat as possible, i never lapped a cpu before and really don't want to.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my bracket arrived today, though it wont be installed until i get 13th gen which will be when software bundles are added.","motherboard and case should arrive this week, but i'll use my 12600k without the bracket as you have to remove the bracket to remove the cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
100% confirmed by thermal grizzly support.,there are difference with screw lengths with z790 boards.,they will be selling bracket with screws to fit it.,in some z790 boards screws are shorter and its actually too short.,leading to situation when u start to catch one screw and the opposite one its impossible to get because its too short.,the bracket itself its same as 12 gen one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so far, about 7-10 degrees down compairing both mine and my friend's.",he didn't intall it so we could check on the differences.,"so imo, it's was totally worth itfor the price and the easy install.","plus, the cleaning of the thermal paste that might get on it is super easy too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"> near-silence isnâ€™t achievable anymore

i'm pindrop silent cooling ~400 w actual.",r/watercooling .,my rads (360 x2) are in-case which is terribly inefficient so i probably can't go much higher wattage without more rad and a bigger case.,(i have a *reasonable*-sized full atx.),people go silent with multiple 3090s and a threadripper.,"external-rad is not even exotic anymore, you load up the site and you buy a mora3.",that's it.,"---

putting parts in a metal box was a neat idea at first but now its just dumb.",you're trying to cool an ez bake oven.,"whisk the heat from the hot elements and either move it adjacent to a case side, or ideally outside of the case completely.","before you go ""hurrdurr watercooling hard"" the industry is going in one direction.","if you want just want silence, you can do it ridiculously ""safely"" and its one initial outlay and the parts don't need biyearly upgrades.","use d5, epdm, distilled with minimal additive, take care of your stuff, koolance qdcs for an easy quick yearly flush.","if you go ""showy"" then yeah, hard tubing and colored coolant etc is higher risk and higher maintenance.","$100k+ watercooled **server racks** in data centers literally use epdm and koolance qdcs, they're that safe and reliable.","if you're buying $400+ cpus and $800+ gpus, spend $800 and get cooling that will get you through the next ten years or more.","--- 

my next build is in a cerebus x (matx-sized) with an external rad, qdcs so i can optionally ""loopback"" to a single 240mm internal rad to detach from the mora.","i can cool a zillion watts silently in matx-size, or run it self-contained in a pinch or move it to another room for some light couch party games or ti watching party or whatever.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"it could be down to tolerances in ihs flatness then, unfortunately the paper gamers nexus used to test contact they said was very expensive stuff and was funded by the viewers through patreon, so normal people can't do that test on their chips.","if theres no reduction then maybe thats due to failing on the ihs variance lottery, i haven't lapped a cpu before and wouldn't want to.",reselling lapped cpus is a bitch because a lot of people will avoid them due to it being easier for scammers to sell any chip as a 13900k.,"the bend correctors only make a difference if they improve the contact between ihs and baseplate, and theres generally a lot of tolerance on just how uneven those can be.",or you might even already have a perfectly flat cpu too so the bend corrector isnt doing anything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"it absolutely doesn't need to be done, but its something that is far easier than lapping or delidding and doesn't void warranties or affect chip resale value (you don't have to ever mention using the bend corrector in an rma claim, but you can't hide a lapped or delidded chip).","it costs 5-15 bucks to get the thermaltake one, thats like what the same cost of thermal paste?",it might even increase resale value if you mention a bend corrector was used and post a picture as second hand 12th / 13th gen chips without the bend corrector are going to end up turning into a pringle after several years of use.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i did a lot of research on watercooling a few years ago, and ended up sticking to air because i was concerned that the pump noise would always be the limiting factor.","at least an air cooler can go completely passive when idle, but a pump is always going to be running at some nominal flow rate.","thatâ€™s not to say my setup turned out superior to liquid cooling - i ended up choking off too much airflow, so the fans have to come on anyway.","hopefully i can achieve a better balance with my next build, and watercooling is definitely an option.",i did learn that â€œmore foam = more quietâ€ is not the way to go though (thank you gamers nexus).,"as someone who really does chase silence though, iâ€™m still a little annoyed that the fanciest and most exotic cooling options are still inferior to just putting your pc in a closet or passing cables through a wall from the next room.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a silent build doesnâ€™t even require high end water cooling.,a noctua dh-15 on a 13600k and an asus/noctua 3070 is a beast of a silent build with a bequiet case.,there will also be 40 series asus/noctua cards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

haha lol pump noise!?,i have had custom loop for many years and nothing beats it compared to air regarding noise..  i got a 4090  rtx and every other past nvidia gpu makes a lot of noise when pushing 4k ultra.. i hate it!,that's why and the temps i converted many years ago...  my pump at least don't really need to go over 50-70% and its very very low in audio... in desktop mode its at 25%.... and usually when it need to work a little you have audio and game etc.,ruining.,"its very low in ""noise"" compared to all these fans on high end cpu and gpus.",i am waiting for a 13900k and now i got the 4090 rtx.,these beasts need exotic cooling imo.,that's what they are made for unless you want the vacuum cleaner ruining in your case.,"i will give the 4090 some credit though, because where being the most insane gpu ever its actually not ""that"" loud compared to previous gens... but still annoying and very audible when im used to lc.",i am currently waiting for water blocks from ekw but they are unfortunately one month away still ..  :(,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well i know i said it works!,but i have come to another conclusion.,half of my p cores are up to 10c hotter.. and i reseat twice!,as it turns out half of the cpu don't have contact with my cooler.,"i suspect the short screws to have an impact here, but more importantly i learned that the expensive cpu water block i bought (ek quantum magnitude rgb) are actually made and designed specifically convex to intel concave ihs.",so i actually need a little bend lol!,:) i am gonna in a few days try the stock ilm for better results.,so far i don't have great or expected results with the frame.,its is within spec but the half hotter cores limits my oc a lot.,please let me know your results.,did you buy these screws aftermarket?,and if yes please link.,also what cooler do you use?\`most aio have flat water block and thereby benefit much more of the frame.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have a d5 - its nothing compared to fans..  only way to go imo.,at idle or desktop mode mine runs at 25%... barely noticeable and what is is not a problem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in a silence-focused build the pump is often going to be the loudest part because it never turns off completely.,at idle my all my fans stop spinning and itâ€™s just passively cooled.,so obviously adding a pump is going to make some noise.,"my pc definitely spends more time just browsing the web than in intensive workloads, so it actually makes a lot of sense to optimize for idle noise rather than full load noise.",coil whine makes games run pretty loud anyway :-/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what ssd brand/type did you put in?,and i am assuming as a second ssd or did you replace the original?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, i thought maybe i've accidentally somehow touched something even though i was sure i didn't, so i removed the drive again and it worked normally, i put it back and the issue reoccurred, removed it again worked normally, hopelessly surrounded the drive with duct tape and put it again, but again the same issue.","so i came to the conclusion that it probably is interference, especially since the network card is close to the place where the sata drive would be plugged in.","what gives me hope that this can be solved in software is that similar issues with the same card happened to others, although they have different models and the  configuration that worked for them didn't for me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's a sata iii drive, put as a second drive.",the brand is called goldenfir which i assume is chinese since i bought it from aliexpress.,"i would think it could be the reason, but it is my second purchase and the first one works great on my old laptop (which i'm using right now).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wouldn't buy stuff like that on aliexpress.,i once bought a intel wifi + pcb for a desktop on there.,i kept keeping weird crashes but with very long times in between.,now i have a gigabyte intel wifi pci-e card and everything is gone.,i'm guessing they use all kinds of b-grade pcb and faulty chips to make a profit.,throw it in the trash and buy a proper ssd in your own country.,sata ssd's aren't that expensive these days.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"okay, but what if the issue is in the network card itself?","because on one side, i have the same model and it works without causing any issues on my old laptop, and on the other, i've seen multiple reports of issues like this with the network card being the thing in common... i think i will just uninstall the drive on my old laptop which is working fine and put it on my new one and see if that confirms where the issue is.","with that said, ssds are still relatively expensive in my country (algeria) like any imported electronics basically.",(maybe due to taxes and inflation),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the memory controller is part of the cpu die for a long while now and usually is the same across the entire generation (from celeron all the way up to the core i9).,"with that in mind, the i5-8250u will likely work just fine with unbuffered 32 gb ddr4 ram sticks, meaning you should theoretically be able to use 64 gb without problems...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

e-cores get assigned to do tasks that dont need to run on the p-cores.,you can try changing power mode to best performance in the new windows 11 settings.,power plan - balanced.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"normal, stop being paranoid.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what version of windows?,which games does this issue reliably reproduce with?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dude e-cores or not you get the same fps so whats the problem?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is happening in all games.,it's a new build and fresh windows install with bios all software up to date.,many p-cores sit idle while e-cores are loaded at 50%+.,as a result the power consumption is higher too compared to when e-cores are disabled from the bios.,is keeping them disabled my only option?,is there a fix where i don't have to use affinity manually?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
knowing this may be paranoia is now causing paranoia.,lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
windows 11 pro version 22h2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am trying to find out if this is the expected behaviour because the e cores are supposed to handle the background tasks but all of them are being used for gaming.,only people who are using 12th and 13th gen will be able to confirm whether this is normal or not.,if this is happening only on my pc then i have to find out why.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't see any p-cores idling?,"only some hyperthreads are idle, which i believe should be scheduled after e-cores anyway.",do you have any actual issues from this behavior?,is the performance and power consumption really better if you disable the e-cores?,using 110-130 watts during gaming sounds normal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, because threads bounce from core to core and games use many, many threads.","for example if you have a quad core processor, you can be bound by a single thread but it look like all 4 cores are only at 25% - because a single thread that would peg a core to 100% just bounced between those 4 cores within 1 second.",you just can't tell the difference between whether its a single thread bouncing around or multiple threads loading the cores evenly.,looking at task manager is almost useless for determining if you have a cpu bottleneck because of this.,"something is always bottlenecking - either the cpu, the gpu or the monitor.",the best way to determine which is the bottleneck is the gpu usage.,it's not foolproof because gpus are also comprised of multiple different structures internally - but at least they are not homogenous like a cpu.,turning vsync off and making sure the framerate isn't capped takes the monitor out of the equation.,then it should be easy to tell.,"if gpu usage isn't 100%, then you likely have a cpu bottleneck.","in other words, the gpu can't hit 100% usage because it's waiting on the cpu in one way or another.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there's more than just simple cpu/gpu bottlenecks.,sometimes the ram is the bottleneck.,sometimes the gpu *driver* is the bottleneck.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, bottleneck is a gradual thing where the gpu spends more and more time waiting on the cpu instead of rendering.",it's not an on/off state that happens at exactly 100% cpu load.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes it can and it is easy to test.,you either run high resolution to gpu bottleneck or low resolution to see how many fps you cpu can push in any game.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you won't know how the cpu bottlenecks without a better program than task manager.,"but if you're intent on using task manager, look at the total utilization of the process and divide the total cores/threads by that number.","example, 6 core cpu with 25% utilization means the program can't maximize 2 full cores (1.5 cores means it's probably coded with a max of 2 cores in mind).","so if game is using 85% of of the total cpu, it depends on the amount of threads the cpu has, and it's not really a per core usage number.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a 9700k at 4.9ghz with an rtx 3080 running at 1440p and quad channel 32gb 2666mhz ram if that helps at all.,getting 80% gpu usage with either of the cores being 85% at most.,"also worth noting that when gpu usage goes up, the cores can hit 87% and such",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm using rivatuner statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rivatuner statistics server uses the same api for polling cpu usage as task manager does.,the only viable way to determine bottlenecks is to look at gpu usage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you only have dual channel ram.,4 sticks of ram doesn't automatically mean 4 channels.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
even with 4 sticks it's still dual channel.,but you do get some bonus for it being 4 sticks similar to two dual rank dims.,but yes you can be cpu bound even if it's not at 100% usage.,ram speed also can impact some fps in some games more than others.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what fps are you getting?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
playing mw2 i usually get 95% usage but it sometimes dips to 79-85% even when there's not much happening on-screen which is just weird imo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
on darktide i get 70-80 fps average with dips to 60. dlss quality 1440p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hedt?,not sure what that means lol.,i have 3600mhz dual channel on the way already so no need for an oc.,just wanting to find out in advance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you have a 9700k with slow-as-molasses memory, it's hardly that surprising",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
game isnâ€™t optimized.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm using 3600mhz ram currently.,is that really considered slow?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what are your usages like with your specs?,i get 85% at most on either of the cores with 70% gpu usage on average.,its worth noting that during the cpu-intensive moments in a horde the gpu usage can jump up to 99% gpu usage with 85% cpu usage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's got to be one of the least helpful answers possible.,so what if the game isn't *optimized* to meet your arbitrary standards of performance?,"what's important is to determine the bottleneck, it's either cpu or gpu.","cpu performance will improve with faster memory, partifularly for skylake-based cpus and zen 1.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sorry, i mistook you for someone else.",in that case it's just your cpu not being able to keep up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it is essential to try out different games and benchmark tools because each game are optimized differently, make sure your fps is unlocked when you're testing.","imo, so long your cpu is not reaching 100% usage frequently then the cpu is not the one to blame.","there could be other factors that are bottlenecking the cpu other than the gpu, like rams, or even the game if it is poorly optimized.","tldr: if your cpu does not push itself to its limit frequently based on your current usage, upgrading the cpu will not help much.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looking at the cpu/gpu usage wont change the fact the game is poorly optimized.,12900ks with 3080s avg ~90fps at 1440p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i see.,let me ask one more question then.,do you think quad channel 2666mhz memory could also be bottlenecking my setup?,"i have noticed dips to 85% gpu usage in mw2 when testing things out, but cpu usage never goes above 85% on any of the cores.",do you think faster memory in dual channel could have a significant impact?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mw2 (especially wz) is just badly optimized this time around compared to mw(2019).,the speeds will help for noticeably higher frame rates but not maxing out either the gpu/cpu has nothing to do with bottlenecks you are experiencing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what else could be the bottleneck do you think?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i boot up darktide and it immediately spikes to 100 degrees using a noctua d15, from everything i've read this is ""normal"" and performance has still been good.",according to this https://www.techspot.com/review/2552-intel-core-i9-13900k/ it doesn't matter if you chuck an expensive aio at it - it will still hit 100. the only possible way to tame it might be a custom loop with multiple rads lol.,if anyone knows anything i don't please tell me it doesn't feel normal to play games at 100 degrees.,"edit: i reseated the d15 and now get 60 in darktide, be absolutely sure you've tightened it on there until the screws stop being easy to turn",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i dropped 10c by undervolting vcore by offset - 0.1000mv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if your thermal throttling in games then its a problem.,if you are doing cinbench and stress test then yeah it will reach 100. i have a 13900k and a 360 aio but i get 50-60s going on in cyberpunk.,you got a mounting or cooling issue,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have to agree with cradenz on this one.,i have had a 13900k in a 280mm ekwb aio for the last month.,generally sit around 85-90c in cinebench getting 38k (i have turned mce off until i finish my custom loop) and in games i am around 45c depending on the scene.,i have not seen any temps higher than 70c in games while actually playing.,if you are getting greater than 75-80c in game i would check to make sure your contact is adequate.,just an fyi: cpu is lapped and i am using a contact frame from thermal grizzly and using mx-6 thermal paste.,i found a 3c drop in temp with lapping and 2c with the contact frame for reference,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sounds like your plate is not making contact with the cpu or your thermal paste is squished out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a 13900k and a 4090 on a msi mag z790 mobo and i was thermal throttling aswell.,even when thermal throttling i still had good cinebench scores (40700).,but i was reaching 100 degress celsius immediately.,what i did was i just put the core voltage to offset (-) and the offset at 0.09. now my cpu doesn't get hotter than 85 degress celsius on multiple cinebench runs and still have the same score.,hope this helps.,"&#x200b;

this is exactly what i was going to say.,any cpu will instantly hit 100â° if the cool plate is not properly seated.,"itâ€™s really easy to not seat it properly, to over or under tighten it, apply paste wrong.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol damn intel that's an aggressive factory overclock,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was having throttling issues with your same set up.,i changed the offset to that and it did work.,but whenever i play fivem gta i will get a gpu error crash.,itâ€™s weird but it is from the offset.,when i change it back to normal it doesnâ€™t crash.,is there anything else i have to change besides just the offset?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to be fair it still screams up to 100 under heavy load, but at least now in games it's fine",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i226-v on my z790 tomahawk also has similar problems.,it shows network cable unplugged sometimes when i boot up my pc.,i have to disable and re-enable the ethernet controller for it to detect the lan cable again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
by any chance is it hooked up to an old switch/router?,iâ€™ve had that happen with both i225v(2) and (3) (periodic disconnects/downgrades to 100mb) until i swapped out a decade old gigabit switch for a modern router.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"two things i noticed:

\- auto negotiation would sometimes drop from 1 gbit to 100 mbit.",my router is right beside the table and the cable is 2m at best.,"i used the same cable on an intel 1 gbit controller without problems before, but after switching cables i have not yet seen it happen again.",time will tell.,\- sometimes the whole i225-v controller is absent in windows device-manager and a reboot is needed to bring it back.,the last couple of times this \*always\* coincided with an unstable memory overclock.,something to keep an eye on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the â€œnetwork cable is disconnectedâ€ on modern versions of the i225-v seems to be primarily related to communications difficulties with the device on the other end of the cable.,typically installing some other brand name switch in between the two helps (iâ€™ve had no issues with hp and netgear products).,"the disappearing device, or â€œdevice cannot start (code 10)â€ issue seems to be some kind of long standing bug that, for me, happens usually during reboots or after being in the bios, and for me, almost always requires the pc to be physically unplugged to fix.","with that said, it doesnâ€™t happen very often for me.",bit saddened to hear that folks are also having issues with the i226.,how hard is it to fix this?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

have you considered first checking under the aio pump?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
check aio is fully working an redo thermal paste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"definitely rule out mechanical issues first (pump not working, bad paste, etc.)",but that voltage (1.257v) looks very high for 4.5ghz.,i have a 10900k @ 5ghz all core that has a similar voltage under load but that's 5 vs 4.5 ghz.,btw are you using a gigabyte motherboard by any chance?,if so they always pump too much voltage on auto.,i had to tune mine to get it to behave.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
please tell me that there isn't a protective film on the base of the aio cpu block.,it sounds obvious but i have seen it too many times.,it really sounds like a bad contact.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you need to overclock it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"checklist:

* verify pump isn't at the top of the ""loop"" ( bubbles are bad ) and working.",* verify fans working.,* verify paste application.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had this when i first got my 9900k.,my aio cooler wasn't mounting correctly.,"it turned out to be a bad bracket, and i replaced the whole with a noctua nh-d15 temporarily until i figured out a replacement aio.","but i never did and the noctua is actually still on there 2 years later, does a great job.","but yes, do check your cooler mounting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as others have said this is definitely either a pump issue or a bad mount

what are your idle temps?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is your ambient temperature?,have in mind that +1â°c increase in ambient temperature means more or less that the cpu temperature will rise in over 1â°c.,"so if someone at 23â°c ambient temperature gets 80â°c in cpu, that same person will get a cpu temperature of 95â°c at around 34â°c.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that test makes my laptop explode,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you by chance using an msi aio?,they were recalled due to sediment buildup - could be affecting your temps.,might also check your uefi for fan and pump settings.,"depending on the motherboard, there may be ""smart"" cooling profiles that aren't appropriate for what you see trying to do.",i would definitely monitor all of your fans and pump to make sure it's reacting to the changes in temp.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

im using a gigabyte z370 ultra gaming 2.0. i didn't know extra energy could do that.,i thought it would be proportional to the clock demand but that might be the issue as i saw an overclocking video from jayztwocents and he reached 5.3ghz on 1.200v.,ill try to lower that and get some new thermal paste.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yah that is very high voltage for just 4.5ghz..    my 9900k runs at 4.9ghz @ \~1.22v.,vids @ 1.244v so there is a small amount of vdroop.,running ts bench in this screenshot.,https://i.imgur.com/i3hdtav.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that won't make more than a 2c difference.,unless you're also fixing a bad mount along with that.,"more likely your aio pump isn't working, or the cooler isn't even touching the cpu properly.",you also shouldn't delid a cpu that is soldered.,like some have suggested.,"unless you really, really know what you're doing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
more voltage = more heat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not all cpus are created equal.,your cpu might top out at a very different speed and voltage before it becomes unstable.,that fact that  jayztwocents reached that speed at that voltages means little.,"also don't use any ""auto"" settings for the voltage, pretty much any overclocking guide will tell you that, most motherboards err on the side of caution and will put in way more voltage than you would really need.",it is part of the art of overclocking to find that sweetspot between voltage and (in)stability.,start by making sure your cooling is in order.,replace the thermal paste with quality paste and make sure your aio is good.,also make sure your case has good airflow.,you want to get rid of heat as quickly as possible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5.3ghz at 1.2v is almost impossible from almost all 9900k mine can only reach 4.9ghz at like 1.35v,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"he is saying pump should not be in the top of the loop, not cpu, for sure most of aio pumps are on top of cpu, in other words, do you have your radiator in top, side or bottom of your case?","if it is on side, are the tubes that connected to radiator in the bottom or on top?",and if they are on top are they above or below pump/cpu level?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1) the contact is terrible
2) the aio is fucked.","bad pump, clogged something, corrosion because the maker messed up the fluid.",there have been a few models with that issue.,msi recently had a big recall.,check that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

who the hell even downvotes you.,delid is a must for 9900k.,been 3 years on a dellided 9900k with -8 degrees drop.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
haven't done any heavy clocking on intel chips for years but that voltage seems really high for stock.,with every architecture you kind of have learn how it behaves and play around that for the best oc results.,i'd say manually set the voltage to around 1.2v and clocks around 4.6ghz as i think that should be stable regardless of the chip.,then up the clocks from there until you either hit a stability or thermal barrier.,"if you hit a stability barrier, add some voltage (0.025v-0.05v) and repeat until you hit a thermal barrier.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i haven't and a lot of people are saying that those mobos do that.,is it like updating a firmware/driver on windows or do i need a pendrive?,i have never updated a bios.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes but on my tests it went from like 330 fps to 590 on a bot training map and from 280 to 390 on casual at 5ghz and 4.8 on the other one.,i think its because csgo depends a lot on single core performance.,but the cpu was at 75 degrees on less than 25% load.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the tubes are above the cpu level and the radiator is on the side,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as far as i know the 9900k is soldered, not worth the risk to delid it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i tested enabling mce to see what it would do as it sets all cores on a 5ghz turbo and it went up to 1.520v.,i think that my mobo is overvolting it and thats causing the thermal throttle.,do you know if it is safe to try and lower that manually on bios with static values?,is there any risk if i set it too low?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes but mine was not doing that.,it was running at max 4.2ghz for some reason and i did the tests at 5.0ghz on cores and 4.8 on cache that was previously 4.3. so it was an 800mhz increase for the core and some more for the cache.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"people love to talk abou overclock but hate to talk about delid, sad.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
overclocking the cache should be considered last as the performance benefit is extremely slim.,"overclock the multiplier on the cpu first, memory second, cache third.",i actually donâ€™t run a cache oc because it requires a lot of extra voltage and therefore heat.,and for my workload (games) itâ€™s like less than 1% performance increase.,"in your case, youâ€™ve got some bios setting thatâ€™s limiting your cpu, thatâ€™s why itâ€™s clocked so low.",iâ€™d look into disabling any limiters and see if you can get it to boost to 4.7ghz all core like itâ€™s advertised to do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i did what any person with a brain would do and decided to send my ddr5 board back and keep my ddr4 for another generation and run it as fast as i could 

and it was a wise decision my pc gets much better fps than the family members
if you guys dont like that i dont really care

maybe i would come close to my ddr4 fps with that a die or maybe i would only get it stable at much slower speeds due to imc problems thats â£600 im not willing to spend  for -20% to +5% until i upgrade again on 15th gen

lets face it to get the same gaming performance on the 90% of games that prefer latency over bandwidth as my tight sub timings 4100 gear 1 cr1 i would need something like 8200 cl30 cr1 yes yes i should roll the dice again 
pick up a â£600 ddr5 board then spend â£600 on ram then just hope it hits stupid speeds that nobody has been able to get yet on dual rank and that my board adds cr1 support for ddr5

wrong.,intel pl1 and pl2 are 253w.,motherboards out of box without pressing anything in settings are releasing unrestricted power limits that are not what intel has in spec for 13th gen. and the tau thing yes you are correct on that.,they will boost however long they can.,but anything over 253w is not stock and is an overclock.,even intel themselves have said that.,donâ€™t confuse the 2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sorry but thatâ€™s literally impossible with intel guidelines.,the upper limit would be 39k.,anything above that is overclocked territory.,keep in mind motherboard come out of box overclocked.,so even if you didnâ€™t touch anything itâ€™s still technically an overclock,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

wrong.,intel cpus have not followed pl1/2 since 95w days.,nor is it an enforced spec but merely guidance on how to design your power delivery and cooling solutions.,intel allows for motherboard vendors to design their boards to deliver whatever it can and run unlimited to the max cooling potential.,"out of box with my asus board and my dark board, both will pull whatever it needs to deliver the clocks provided the cooling is there.","that is stock behavior, and saying i need to go into the bios to limit this would no longer be stock as i am changing defaults.",the mce argument died with 12th gen when they fully removed any time limit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"youâ€™re right, but the conception of stock is kinda a moot point with 13th gen. stock more means running it without manually doing anything.",stock requires manual configuration on every motherboard.,"also, iâ€™ve heard the 13th gen is meant to thermal boost until it throttles, part of the design, which is why the motherboard manufacturers set it the way they do",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i did notice in the hwinfo cpu area it did say yes in the thermal throttling section but yeah for sure didnâ€™t go over 92 max it was usually in the 80s during r23.,"itâ€™s harder for me to determine thermal issues with these chips because they run so hot, are you running windows 11 or 10?",iâ€™m on win 11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i dont care what you believe and i didnt say its limited to that but odds are against you due to imc and ram availability at that density and such

firstly he is only using single rank 16gb sticks
secondly dual rank is much harder to drive at higher speeds

show me him running 30000% karhu and his voltages to achieve that

wrong again.,alder lake 12th gen followed the pl1 of 125w and pl2 250w if you turn off the unrestricted power.,itâ€™s up to the motherboard vendors what they allow out of the box.,again.,just because intel allows the motherboard to unrestrict power does not mean it is stock.,it is still an overclock!,mce is on out if box not because intel has it stock.,because motherboard vendors have it on to give more performance.,stop confusing the two.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

his latest vid was 1 hour 20 mins stable (atleast).,do you really believe you need to reduce frequency by idk 2000-4000 to get it rock stable?,"i know he got 32 gigs here, but you are just so wrong if you think you can only have potato frequency with dual rank sticks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah i agree.,itâ€™s a weird time to get back into building a pc.,"last time i did it was 2600k build and that would overclock awesome but never got to 90 and high temps back then would scare the shit out of me, or make me think my cpu was gonna die.",now people seem to accept it and not worry about degradation so much.,time will tell i guess,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i was thinking the same thing, i did see 4095w in hwinfo so i assume it was unlimited but i donâ€™t know for certain if mce is enabled as i only enabled xmp in bios, would it be on by default?",another thought i had was pinning the cpu at 100 min state in the high perf plan in windows,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ok dude, whatever.",believe whatever you want to then.,if you ask intel they will tell you itâ€™s an overclock themselves.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

spoke to the provider.. they can't do onsite repair as they're too busy atm.,i opened up the case... the noctua nh-15 is loose as in i can twist it relatively easily from side to side.,it i press the cooler down hard with positive pressure from one hand the tdp during cinebench shoots up to 250tdp.,"when i let go it goes down, albeit it went down to about 125 rather than the 75 i saw originally.",clearly the cooler got loose in transit .... or wasn't fitted properly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

_x000d_  
the cooler no longer twists, so it's better than it was, but clearly isn't on firmly enough._x000d_  
_x000d_

"i think i know the answer to this.... 

when it's thermally throttling at 75tdp the noctua heatsink is cold to the touch and the exhaust air through the thins is cool.",the fans are spinning at 1500 which i believe is max.,presumably those are both signs you are all right and the noctua is not doing it's job for whatever reason (not seated correctly/thermal paste).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you're up to it, the fix is pretty simple assuming they properly applied thermal paste, just screw it down.","firmly, but not super tight.",you don't want to bottom out the screws.,i'm sure there's guides on youtube if you google it.,"if that's not enough, you can remove the cooler and reapply the paste, but i don't know if you have any on hand.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no i don't have paste on me and don't like to remove the heatsink if i don't have any to hand.,i'm pretty sure the tower is firmly fixed now so i guess the problem is either how they applied the paste or that the support for the tower isn't firmly screwed in.,"if my pushing the tower boosts performance then something isn't making contact properly....

interesting!,i'll have to look more into getting an aio as well.,"that said, i realized i had the middle fan (the one sitting dead center of my cpu) the wrong way which was creating negative air directly over the cpu lol sigh...i swapped it around and also added a bit more thermal paste and my temps came down a bit, but still feel like i can get them even lower.","most of my cores are idling in the mid to high 40s instead of mid 50s, and under load i just barely peaked at 100c averaging more high 80s low 90s, where as before i was hitting mid to high 90s a lot more under load.","as for the power plan, i hadn't thought of that entirely.",what do you have it set to now?,mine is high performance by default.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

did you reinstall the windows after changing the motherboard?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

intel imc doesn't work nice with 4 sticks of ram.,"[https://images.anandtech.com/doci/16959/dramadl\_575px.png](https://images.anandtech.com/doci/16959/dramadl_575px.png)

the official support for four dual-rank sticks is 3600. intel's memory controller in alderlake can't work with this much ddr5 memory at stock speeds.","if your thinkstation supports ram overclocking, you can try.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the memory controller has to work harder the more sticks of ram you have.,"it also depends on how they physically run the traces on the mobo since ram timings are very sensitive to that stuff 

this is why most extreme overclockers only run with 1 stick of ram.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™ve been mentioning this since like november last year, and motherboard makers arenâ€™t keeping it a secret either, but the official rated speeds for alder lake ddr5 are:

- 4800mhz - 2 dimms in a 2 slot motherboard (aka msi unify-x, asus z690 apex)
- 4400mhz - 2 1r or 2r dimms in a 4 slot motherboard
- 4000mhz - 4 1r dimms
- 3600mhz - 4 2r dimms

your 128gb is the last option.",more memory modules of higher density involves a more difficult topology to keep stable at high timings.,companies like dell even advertise that their 128gb ddr5 products are running at 3600mhz.,"and if you remember the very first alder lake benchmarks to come from intel last year, they specified 4400mhz ddr5 memory.",why?,because that was their own specification with the motherboards they had.,"and technically is also the spec for 95% of ddr5 motherboards out there, despite everyone thinking 4800mhz is the baseline.","also, just as a general rule, alder lake does not like running with 4 sticks of anything (well, at â€œmore than baseline speedsâ€).","if you require lots of memory, either accept that itâ€™s going to be slow, or try to stick with 2 dimms maximum (ie 2 x 32gb) as that will be easier to tweak.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah good luck with 4 dimms.,i run 6600 but itâ€™s two dimms on unify-x.,i hear 13900k can support up to around 7200mhz on two dimms.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is there really a point going ddr5 at this point in time?,seems like there isn't much improvement.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
computer programs can run very differently on different hardware.,depending on their implementation they maybe just not designed for ddr5 memory.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are using the 4 slots.,if you only use 2 it will be 4800mt.,also another thing is activate xmp.,good luck sr!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is some chance to overclock the memory if the resisitive load can be increased by lowering the impedance.,this will force higher currents in the mb tracks for better signal integrity at cost of more heat.,but it depends on how much current can the io buffers of the cpu and udimms sustain.,probably it is time for manufacturers to implement buffered memory on the desktop.,they can't keep us forever limited to 32gb of ram.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"issue comes from atrocious secondary and tertiary timings, as xmp got crazy in terms of timings/frequency curve already at half life of ddr4.","regular joe needs to wait for new xmp implementation, the rest of us can simply fix what's broken in bios.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"for specific workloads the higher bandwidth will be a blessing but in most cases you're right, ddr5 doesn't bring much improvement at the moment",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mts (megatransfers) is more correct than mhz.,"since ram is ddr, the real physical frequency is actually half of the listed one.","""3200mhz"" ram actually runs at 1600mhz physical frequency, but it transfers data twice per clock cycle (ddr = double data rate), so it achieves 3200mts.","edit: to the person who said that mts is a *sucky* unit and it should be megabits instead, that would require multiplying the mts by the bus width, which differs between types of ddr, even in the same version (non-ecc and ecc typically have different bus widths).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looks like its a small form factor prebuilt.,nearly all sub-itx custom mobos and even some itx will use sodimms to save space.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"shit signal integrity due to the higher mhz, requiring the lowering of clock speeds to compensate.","is also problem on higher end motherboards, which cannot go above 6600mhz at some times because of said signal integrity",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
high frequency buses are always point to point.,"pcie, usb, sata, etc all hook one device to one port.",in the old days we had parallel pci and parallel sata where you could split and have more than one device per bus.,"they maxed out at ~100 mhz or less, not 5 ghz+.","it is hard to design a split in a high frequency line that will work correctly, and even harder to design it so that it will work correctly with and without something in the second socket.","tl;dr be amazed it works at all with two dimms per channel, ddr5 is probably the last memory type that will allow that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it could be to retain signaling integrity across larger capacity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's because memory controller can't handle too many memory ranks at high speed.,it is like asking one babysitter to take care of two vs four hyperactive kids.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so thankful for all the responses i dig some digging too and while technically slower by clock speed the added bandwidth is still faster than the ddr4 variation would have beenâ€¦for reference the specs of this machine now configured is:

pretty much.,you can lift 4 dimms to 5200-5600 mhz but have fun with that with no overclocking experience.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it would depend on the board.,"if you're sticking to an oem system, then you will be very disappointed.","however, if you're going with a custom system then xmp should be able to handle clocking them higher.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"you are right, but you did not include the technical reason that signal integrity is worsened by having a second dimm installed in a memory channel.","consumer-grade dimms are udimms, or unbuffered dimms.",that means that a cpuâ€™s integrated memory controller is directly connected to the memory on each udimm with no chips that can assist the memory controller in controlling the memory chips on the udimms.,"this results in the lowest possible latency, lowest possible cost, and high electrical loads on the memory controller which hurt signal integrity.","servers and workstations that are designed to hold large amounts of memory use registered dimms or rdimms, or load-reduced dimms or lrdimms.","rdimms are built with a register clock driver or rcd which intercepts the clock and command buses from the memory controller, amplifies them and cleans them up, and then drives the amplified signals to the memory chips at the cost of one clock cycle.","this immensely reduces the load on the clock and command buses, but do nothing to the data busesâ€™ loads and latency.","a lrdimm adds data buffers on the data buses which intercept the data on the data buses in both directions, amplify and clean up the data signal, and drive the amplified data signals in both directions at the cost of latency.",this intensely relieves the load on the data buses.,"to be clear, lrdimms include an rcd to buffer the clock and command buses like what an rdimm has.",both rdimms and lrdimms allow servers and workstations to support larger memory loads that consumer-grade systems cannot support at all or can support only at lower memory throughput.,"these types of dimms add latency, but this latency is nothing compared to being forced to use virtual memory on the ssd or hdd.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

is this likely to get better with raptor lake and z790?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that depends on what motherboard and cpu that you have.,"if you have a consumer-grade cpu, you can't do squat about that unless you want to try to overclock the memory and memory controller.",consumer-grade cpus and/or firmware for them cannot use neither rdimms nor lrdimms and are stuck with udimms.,"intel users will have to buy a xeon cpu, the required memory type, and a motherboard that can host both.","some workstation motherboards can only take rdimms and cannot take lrdimms, for example.","you could go the hedt route if you have not bought anything yet since hedt processors have more memory channels, and then you can spread out the dimms among the additional memory channels so that you do not have too many dimms weighing down any one memory channel too much.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hmm interesting, do you mean the built-in ecc for retries and faster bus speeds etc?",that would make sense i guess.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
xmp 3 profile (xmp has 3 settings and i use setting 2 in that) and bios updated to 1601 or higher (which also enables 13th gen on the z690 just fyi) i do get to add voltage to the pmic as i'm not locked to 1.1 modifier.,"a dedicated circuit on the motherboard safely circumvents ddr5 memory pmic restrictions, allowing you to step past the default 1.1-volt limit and push frequency and timings to the max.",not all can take advantage of these features currently but word is it will absolutely trickle down.,no eta when though.,pretty sure there is a list of boards that can take advantage of this currently asrock and asus z690 atm for sure.,don't have link off hand for the list of supported boards but its out there for sure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to use mbps would require a complete change in the numbers that are used as primary specs, and they'd be even more meaningless to the end-user.",the numbers could differ vastly between similarly performing ram sticks based on how ecc is done and some other parameters.,this would only cause end-users to confuse the marketing number with real world performance (the bus mbps is very different from the usable mbps).,"imo the correct thing would be to just use the physical frequency, not the transfer rate (since there are two **transfers** for each single physical clock cycle).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you dumb?,mbps is dependent on both mt/s and transfer size.,you can't tell with any certainty what a 6400mbps memory is.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"probably, to what end result?",but (disclaimer)..  i am no mind reader nor genie..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
donâ€™t forget that rdimms etc are *already* at the lower speeds from the start.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"well, and i preference this with, this is an educated guess, but just like ddr4  had such early issues running overclocked memory  with 4 modules in xmp and was finally fixed, i don't believe is any different with ddr5.",again its only an educated guess and natural progression of such hardware.,the earlier is gets adopted the more resources are put into maximizing it for applications etc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"guys stop concerning about idle temps, there are not used to be like years ago....now idle temps are very tricky since intel turbo boost clock that when non load some cores go very high overclock, see your cpu 5.4 ghz on 2x cores, so those will be definitly more hotter than all the others on idle, and cpu idle temp max will be registered the highest one.","also there is no more like idle, now with all windows 10/11 updates and bunch of rgbs, temp softwares, headset, mouse or keyboard software that are running always on background, there is not very a real idle that you think.....

sounds like a cyberpunk optimization problem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cyberpunk isn't a great example anymore.,"when it first launched it used avx, but so many people complained about crashing (most likely from unstable overclocks) that they removed it entirely from the game.","i was running a 4770k up until a couple months ago, and with avx, it was running pretty well.","without it, it ran ok, but avx made a noticeable difference.","now i'm on a 12700k with win11 22h2, and i'm not getting any more frames than i did before.","it's noticeably smoother, and i'm able to bump up a few settings that were cpu dependant, but that's about it.","granted, i'm on a 1080, but it didn't have anywhere near the impact i was hoping for.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my 1080ti needed to go.,it's a great time to sell them bro.,just pocketed 192 after fees on ebay for my evga sc2.,that thing was so fucking loud it made me die inside sometimes even with headphones.,it's part of the reason i went with asus tuf.,this card is quiet and amazing so far.,does things with ease where my 1080ti was just shitting the bed all over the place at 4k.,"my c1 just wouldn't let the 1080ti be, so i had to upgrade asap for the gpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

with a 1070 lol?,idk bout that.,i'm seeing big or decent gains coming from a 1080ti even.,at 4k a 3080 literally puts a 1070 into the coffin lol.,but yeah last couple years and some backlogs then a new system.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

agreed!",i plan on keeping mine for another 2-3 years as well.,unless intel releases a 14790k of course.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah nice lol!,what is the difference with that one again?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in what?,i'm getting 100 fps at 5k dlss quality in rdr2 on my 7700k and 4090. totally gpu limited even with dlss instead of native where it's even worse gpu hit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah i find most of what i do outside of gaming works pretty well too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you probably had to honestly.,i used to have one as well.,the big thing with my old mb and cpu was that it did not have that little bit of extra to it that helps get you past the ultra stuttery stuff on difficult content.,on my last setup the 2600k was shitting the bed for whatever reasons.,the new mb had better pcie too.,"that was a great cpu though, and it could still do a lot of work in non-4k on my older system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ah yes, glorious inconsistent 30fps and a stutter followed by a stutter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cpu matters a lot for gaming.,it's not just about maximum framerates but also minimum framerates and frametime consistencies.,"are you actually attaining a consistent 144 fps, or is that just the resolution and frequency of your monitor?",i'm asking genuinely as i couldn't imagine a celeron to provide that level of performance in modern games.,i'd expect a wide difference in gpu performance between your 12700f and either the celeron or 3770 systems.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this comment hurts my eyes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

0.1.2.3

\#####

4.5.6.7

it would be like this:

0.2.4.6

\#####

1.3.5.7

this would also explain why 0+1+4+7 or 0+1+6+7 are cooler than just 0+2 and the like.","that being said, windows follows the core order of the bios and even knows which cores are set to higher ratios (and thus prioritizes them for thread scheduling).","this is not a problem of core quality or cooling, unless the pump's internal layout would benefit that 2 cores apart thing.","the logical vs. physical layout might be onto something, though.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i have one ordered, i have not tried it yet.",you still using the stock backplate?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there might be an issue where the thermal grizzly requires longer screws on some mainboard/13 gen cpus.,the frame should screw into the backplate that came with the mainboard.,so not the cooler back plate but the backplate that came with the mainboard.,basically the cooler backplate holds on the mainboards backplate then you screw in the cpu frame to the mainboard backplate.,should be installation videos on youtube.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i do not own that frame, so take anything i say here with a grain of salt.","i do not know if it is important to use the original screws - as far as i know you do not tighten them all the way down anyways - but if it uses one of the two common threads used in computers, i would personally have no issue replacing them with screws of a more appropriate length.","i also saw a post by someone who said they pre-tightened the frame with 3 extra long screws, then put the 4th short screw in, and replaced all the longer screws one by one with shorter ones.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the screws are to short in some motherboards.,i had this exact same problem on my z790 hero with the thermal grizzly frame.,"i also had the theme alright frame on hand, and that one works no issue with the stock screws.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what gpu you would recommend?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that would mainly depend on your budget.,iâ€™d honestly say go for 3000 series for nvidia or 6000 series for amd.,if youâ€™re on a smaller tier budget then a 3060 ti ( 3070 as well ) or 6700xt would be fair.,if youâ€™re on a bigger budget then i would recommend seeking out a 3080 ti or 6800xt.,"4000 series nvidia and 7000 series amd are putting up good numbers, but are pretty expensive as it stands.","if you can swing it though, then i doubt youâ€™d be disappointed with either of the offerings they have.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not surprising considering it still has 8 e-cores,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i may seriously upgrade to this in like a year if there are good microcenter sales on it.,it looks promising for a ~$200 cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the i5-13500 looks like an energy-efficient (65 tdp vs. 125) locked 13600k.,https://www.cpu-monkey.com/en/compare\_cpu-intel\_core\_i5\_13500-vs-intel\_core\_i5\_13600k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a major purpose of e cores seems to be to pad benchmark numbers and garner more positive reviews.,a 7700x or a 7600x will crush the 13500 in games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it could be a very interesting entry multi-media processor.,for photo and modest video editing this would be quite good.,i also think light 3d work like blender could profit quite much from this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seems like based on this chip (8 e cores) vs the 12400f which didn't have any e cores at all we can expect some e cores be added to the 13400f plus some additional clock speed.,my guess is minor improvement or games but big improvements to multicore depending how many e cores they add.,i'd rather see them add even just 4 e cores in the name of keeping the price down.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i mean, it will since it's basically a locked 12600k that said the cost will be higher than the old 12400f, so it's a bit of a wash.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
stock performance looks pretty impressive to me.,"we'll wait for real 3rd party reviews, but it's definitely more cpu than the 13400, and could be a budget champ if the price is right.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

bclk overclocking is not going to drive significant sales for intel.,it's basically in practice a novelty feature.,"the cheapest bclk oc capable board, the 660m mortar max you are referring to, for example is $70 more than the msi b660m pro-a (with the same capable vrms) in the us.",that $70 difference you might as well just buy a 12600k/13600k and be fine with the higher clocks out of the box (and in the 13600k's case actually have the newer cache hierarchy and other improvements).,especially as most gaming buyers don't even want to bother with having to oc or do any tuning and just run what is out of the box.,"the actual factor slowing intel sales against amd am4 cpus is that while adl (and likely rpl) prices have slightly gone up over the last year (in many regions), zen 3 cpu prices have completely cratered in retail in many markets to the point that 8 core zen 3 is now priced against 6 core locked adl cpus, and 6 core zen 3 against the 12100.

as for raptor lake the issue here is while the headline points to the high mt perf gain, the st perf gains are minimal over alder lake in this segment because basically every sign is just pointing to the locked cpus still basically being alder lake.",just how interested is the budget gaming diy segment in more mt throughput performance from more e-cores versus just per thread perf?,especially since there is almost certainly going to at least be some price increases.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

all my temps look great, no issues.","even though water cooling (aios) seem super popular, i stuck with what i know.",these two builds are christmas presents for myself and my son.,"i was on, as stated above a 7th gen i7, and he was on my previous 3rd gen (3770k) i7.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ak620,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you're primarily gaming then noctua nh-u12a.,it keeps my 13700k cool and doesn't cover up memory like the bigger coolers (assuming u have rgb memory).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hey _webgems, it looks like you are having a cooling problem.",first - dont be afraid of 100c.,its normal for laptops.,"if youre running a high tdp load with a desktop i9 cpu, this is inevitable.",if youre hitting 100c in things like gaming and lighter tasks - then we have a problem.,"if thats the case, the first thing you want to do is to repaste the cooler.",taking it apart and putting it back together will solve the problem more often than you might believe.,"double check and make sure youre using the proper mounting equipment - using lga1200 mounts on a lga 1700 system might work, but performance wont be ideal.",make sure to test the cooler under power limited conditions before assuming its not working right.,"most non-sff coolers can handle loads of 200w, so test with a 200w power limit.","if youre still experiencing hot temperatures after checking all of the above, then its time to return the cooler or file a rma for repair.","*i am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.",please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/intel) if you have any questions or concerns.,*,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love my thermalright frost spirit 140. got it when i saw a sale for $30.,it does need an $8 mounting adapter for the lga1700 socket.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thermalright pa 120 will fit but the lga1700 brackets are sold separately.,"personally, i use scythe mugen 5(rev.","c is the one with lga1700 brackets included), it's been working well, the size is not too big and it has one of the best memory clearance, doesn't overhang on the ram sticks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don't sleep on scythe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

+1 for d15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would you say in that order?,iâ€™ve been hearing great things about the peerless assassin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
okay iâ€™m probably leaning towards the same one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how are temps man ?,on 100% load and while gaming,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™d get the se rgb one, does that one come with it?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they all perform pretty much the same, 1c give or take.","just take whichever looks best/is cheaper

oh i forgot nh-d15, but its usually more expensive",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ak620 would be my choice.,its insanely good for its price and size,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
didn't do much gaming and wasn't checking the temps much since i got it mainly for work productivity.,i played god of war only and everything was smooth.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

>scythe fuma 2 rev.b?,performs worse than 4 i listed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"fuma rev.b is a great cooler, i did my research.",i would highly recommend this if you are on a budget and the chassis is a smaller one - ak620 is a huge cooler!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

depends on what motherboard you have.,the chipset provides pcie lanes as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well the mobo lanes are just as fast as the cpu lanes for my gen 4 m.2s, so it should be fine to use the chipset lanes for other things as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
through the chipset would likely limit the bandwidth and quality of the video would it or should that be fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what cpu were you using prior ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice.,i really like the look of these boards although sad they are ddr4 only.,did you already have the ram or buying fresh?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ddr4 or 5?,what ram you running and did you get new ram or reuse same from 12600?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i do beleive the msi z790 edge ddr4 has better everything 

not hating on asus i have an x570 hero my self 

but i've heard that the msi edge is so much better with so much features and vetter vrm and also cheaper

so why did you go with this z790 asus one just curious?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

sold both the cpu and motherboard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lmao was about to post the same thing.,asus making visually stunning motherboards but then the go and put all of this stupid ass writing all over it and sometimes in broken english.,it's embarrassing ðÿ˜‚,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
g a m e r s,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the z690 strix mobos from asus have a huge design mistake.,"due to the height of the vrm cooler, large air coolers either wonâ€™t fit or will only fit in weird orientations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes but not by much at least on the websites i checked.,and i kind of wanted to save the time on updating the bios on a z690 board.,personal preference really.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah.,although the motherboard has slight bent panel connector pins.,will they still work,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes.,what leds do you mean by the way?.,currently waiting to get a new gpu psu and case,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
was considering the z790 e gaming but was â£200 more expensive than this.,and also i don't plan to upgrade to ddr5 yet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
will have to see how the aio handles the tdp of the cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12600k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
both motherboards were ddr4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
liked the white aesthetic of it.,there was a msi z790 white variant but i quite like the look of this one.,and it has nice leds on the vrm cover,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no i don't have any benchmark results atm as i don't have the rest of the system yet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the stickers that came in the box are the worst thing i've seen.,made sure to get rid of them after,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh wow seems like a pretty big oversight.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe they assumed that everyone who spends so much on a motherboard would also spring for a liquid cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i have nh-d15s which will have to mount upside-downâ€¦ hopefully that is fairly straightforward,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you sure about that?,have a z690 strix d4 and a  noctua nh-d14.,works totally fine in normal horizontal position.,have an 12700k and thought about upgrading to an used 13900k in 1-2 years.,would upgrade to a nh-d15 then.,"but if that wouldn't fit, that would be a bummer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fitting an aio to my motherboard anyway,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
save the time?,"it takes, i shit you not, 45sec -> 2min max.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that makes sense thanks for the info,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
better bent panel than bent socket pins :d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah it should be fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea just bend them back straight,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"like the motherboard has its own rgb lighting, also what cpu were you using prior ?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
honestly the best thing to do imo.,"only went ddr5 cause i fortunately had the extra to play around with, and wanted to gift my pops my ol mobo+9900k+ram+cooler as an all in one internal for him.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"definitely, some of the best air coolers (e.g.","noctua nh-d15 and bequiet dark rock 4 pro) canâ€™t be used with the board, making it watercooling-only when using i7 or i9 k skus.",unfortunately asus didnâ€™t fix it as a revision but only did so on the z790 versions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thatâ€™s a pretty dumb assumption to make, especially since the maximus, tuf and prime are compatible.",top-end air coolers perform on par with aios and are still quite a bit cheaper.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, a lot of noctua coolers wonâ€™t fit in standard orientation (blowing towards back of the case) per the [compatibility list by noctua](https://ncc.noctua.at/motherboards/model/asus-rog-strix-z690-a-gaming-wifi-d4-5375).",looks the same for all the atx strix z690 boards.,same for [bequiet](https://www.bequiet.com/en/motherboardcheck).,the plastic covering on the northern vrm is too high and blocks coolers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh ok. i was running a 12600k but sold it and got a 13600k.,didn't really need a i7 or i9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i mean, if there was a performance jump from ddr4 to ddr5 in gaming i would consider it but there isn't a massive jump.",therefore your only paying more money.,in certain workloads it may benefit but not in gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i know him irl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's always worth looking at [https://ncc.noctua.at/motherboards](https://ncc.noctua.at/motherboards) as well as cpu compatibility.,noctua's professionalism for producing this is just another reason they're the best.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ah well at least there's some solution then.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for sharing the list.,"interesting though, because according to the the list nh-d14 isn't supported.","for me though, it works totally fine.","there is not much space, but it is *not* touching or blocking.","if i think about the nh-d15, which has a little bit more width in the north-south direction, it could get a little tricky indeed.",but either way.,"if you really want air-cooler over aio (which for me totally would be th case), then you can make it work.",even if you have to bend or cut the lowest fins/plates on the north side a bit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

cool ig,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
up to you.,i came from an i3 8100 before the 12600k.,i personally think from a 9600k it will quite the upgrade.,depends on the gpu though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i use a corsair h100i elite capillex with a relatively balanced fan curve.,"when running stock clocks i have an idle package temp of around 40c, and while gaming it reaches 50-65c.","when idle, my temps sometimes spike up to the 50s sometimes 60s too, so i think that is just the way it is.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mine is 40 to 50c idle at 0.710v and 4 w tdp.,using 212x cooler.,"ðÿ˜… all fans are silent and ambient temperature is 25. 

i set max tdp to 65w because cooler is unable to maintain temps.",looking to buy a new cooler for more better temperature at loads on atleast 200w.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what i am most concerned about is how **fast** it gets to these temps.,"the second it is hit with any kind of load, at spikes to this temp, not slowly warm up.",stress is 90 degrees the second i start the test.,can you share your experience regarding this?,i have mine cooled by cooler master masterliquid 280ml.,not very happy with the results but i can see that they are similar to most of you guys.,"still haven't undervolt it though i don't think it would make much of a difference...

"i have been playing games and ran cinebench r23/time spy a few times with no issues so far, though this will officially be day 1 where i am going to stress test it to make sure its fully stable.",i had it at -0.130 at one point but obviously i'm not that lucky haha.,"but yeah i will try and remember to update this comment with how it goes, so far so good though, no need to underclock or lower the amount of undervolt!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

nah i already bought mw2 before the cpu as well as i bought it at microcenter and didn't have any codes on receipts.,not too big of a deal i would have had to go through the hassle of finding someone to buy the code,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how do you redeem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea ole gal runs hot af.,im not used to these temp levels and im sitting here freaking out over 80+ c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you monitor for whea?,- 100mv undervolt caused my gpu/pcie connection to throw errors but didnt know without hwinfo telling me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how did u cpu hit 5.1 on p-cores?,did u do that remotely or did it boost to that automatically?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which contact frame did you get?,and are you air cooling or water/aio?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a dark rock pro 4 and i am not really happy with the results.,the temps jump up and down constantly according to hw monitor.,"when i boot the pc, cpu hits 70c sometimes and goes back down to 40. my idle temps sit at 40c, cinebench r23 took it to 100c and when i try gaming on games that support multhithread likes cyberpunk or no man sky i hit 92 c sometimes.",i think my asus mobo is overclocking the cpu by itself and i'm not sure how to stop it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i recommend the deepcool ak620, great air cooler for its low price.","i discovered i have a bad case (for thermals) which is the lian li lancool ii which isn't the mesh version, so airflow is non-existent, but i have since just left the front panel off along with creating a two intake and one exhaust format with the stock case fans and ended up idling at around 33c [https://i.imgur.com/rfcusaa.png](https://i.imgur.com/rfcusaa.png) (current temps with pc being on for 3 hours on high performance power plan)

the maximum temps seem high during gaming but when i look over at the ""current"" it's usually around 65ish.",though max will say 77-85c at times however it's just a spike up and doesn't actually stay there.,though it's currently winter and when summer hits i am curious to see the temps.,"&#x200b;

cpu ""settings""

my old undervolt was unstable but i found -0.80 to be stable and i limit power to 230w just very slight lowering.",i undervolt using the intel utility tool because i've been lazy to set it in bios and have discovered sometimes the undervolt will remove itself and i just checked and the undervolt has been off for who knows how long so for the temps i am currently getting just shows how great the ak620 is.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah in terms of artificially stressing it using cinebench it does get to 90 then thermal throttle in pretty much an instant.,"in terms of just normally using it for gaming, editing, etc.",i do notice that the highs do spike up here is an image of all my temps as it stands currently with pc running for only a few hours [https://i.imgur.com/rfcusaa.png](https://i.imgur.com/rfcusaa.png) as you can see the cpu core temp has hit a maximum of 76c even though all i've been doing was listening to spotify and watching videos on my browser.,if i go in a game for a few hours it will hit a maximum of 77-85c however if i look over whilst gaming the temps are flickering all around 65c nowhere near what the maximum temps indicated.,"&#x200b;

tl;dr: yes, the temperature ramps up instantly on a sudden load i have noticed and makes the maximum temps on monitoring programs seems kind of worrisome but looking over at the ""current"" shows it's to be within normal, gaming hits a max of 77-85c for a second but averages at 65c.","&#x200b;

they were throttling when they were at 5.1. my p-cores hit 5.3 normally.,i tried forcing them to 5.4 and that was also stable with my settings but didn't seem worth it since that doesn't let the cores go down in idle the same as automatic setting  so idle energy consumption goes up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there was no offer on when i bought my 13700k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my hwinfo got messed up when i put the raptor in.,i didn't know i was looking tj to max for my e cores and was concerned about temps which is why i initially asked.,"my idles are upper twenties but gaming i'm mid 80's (msi 360r v2), i wonder why my idles are lower but highs are higher.",averages are mid 50's (if i quickly alt-tab to hwinfo).,"replaced the stock rad fans with 3 noctua nf-p12 redux 1700 pwm, 3 noctua nf-a12x25 pwm intake fans, 1 noctua nf-a12x25 exhaust.",case temps are pretty cool.,are you gaming for your loads?,my temps based on far cry new dawn 4k ultra.,"edit; well, apparently my higher brain function is active only at night.",i'm on only running 8+4 eps connectors which is 225w roughly.,bit shy of 253w for boost ðÿ¤¦.,guess i need a new motherboard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

was playing a game and noticed this [https://i.imgur.com/pxngdur.png](https://i.imgur.com/pxngdur.png) as you can see somehow it hit those temps but as you can see by the current temps they weren't anything crazy.,not sure if its a software bug with hwinfo64 orrrrr?.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how'd that go?,i got one thru amazon and neither intel or amazon will give me a code,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you can still avail it depending on if your retailer is giving the keys.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the reason i bought a new cooler when i bought my cpu was because i believe the 212 can't handle the power output of the 13700k (from the posts i read about it), power = heat but the ak620 is rated to handle that tdp output and from the temps i am getting i'd say it's working!","make sure you install the right bracket for it, the lga1700 bracket and use the right ""setting"" it has like these numbers on it 1/2/3 for levels so make sure to read the manual for the cooler to get it right!",and of course when screwing down the cooler twist a few times on one side and then the other a few times and repeat until its fully tighten down.,i had some bad temps the first time around until i repaste and rescrewed it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah... also 212x struggling even at idle(4watts).,so have to buy ak620.,does both 212x and ak620 has same heights?,because i m wondering if it fits or not in my atx case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel pretty much told me to f off, said they don't give them out go ask amazon.",called them and they said it isn't on the product page so they aren't giving me anything.,i asked them if they are a participating retailer because it says they are on intel's website and they told me yes.,but they won't give me a code because it's not on the product page.,makes no sense.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, was either playing far cry 5 or fc new dawn ultra everything on a 450w 4090 @4k.",could have been a crappy mb i had originally for all i know.,i did do the suggested power limits in the bios (mine were auto - 4025w ?tf?).,also noticed the fan curves were pretty bad.,also did the undervolt of 150mv.,temps plummeted into mid 70s with 3d mark time spy extreme stress test.,prime95 almost instantly pegged to 100 so i'm not messing with that further.,-- so far no whea errors but will game tomorrow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

weâ€™ll i ended up getting my i7 13700k for around $355 after discount and coupon from microcenter so iâ€™m wondering if they only do the game promotion when itâ€™s full retail price or something,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good to hear!,also been monitorin for a couple of days myself and no errors.,:),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i paid 440 but it was amazon not microcenter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"got mine at micro center too, around the same time, $355 too, w/no game.",maybe they just weren't doing the promotion anywhere over the week of black friday or whenever their bf event began?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
these types of motherboards do only exist for server hardware and the cpus need to be designed for dual socket operation.,tldr: desktop cpus are single socket only (as stated by [intels official data sheet](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/230496/intel-core-i913900k-processor-36m-cache-up-to-5-80-ghz.html),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

means it only supports single socket setup.",usually xeons have 2s scalability.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the only motherboards that have dual sockets are for xeons since it hasn't been an option for mainstream consumer chips for the over the last 20 years.,"once upon a time physical dual sockets were supported with consumer desktop intel chips in the mid to late 1990s with the original pentium, pentium ii and pentium iii until intel put a stop to it with the pentium 4 released in the year 2000 and ever since then xeons are the only chips that support dual sockets.",old timers who are familiar with the computer scene in the late 90s might remember the 300mhz to 500mhz mendocino celerons that accidentally supported smp and some motherboard maker came out with a 440bx-based dual socket 370 board and intel was less than amused.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"alright, makes sense i just recently discovered the concept of dual socket cpus so i didn't know they were restricted to server hardware and wanted to make sure before i ended up getting rid of my other 13900k.","i appreciate the explanation and help, thank you!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is asus specific i have no idea about other brands.,the renamer comes with the bios file.,"all it does is rename the file to the name specified in the directions, since the actual bios file is always named according to board and version number, but flashback looks for a specific and constant filename.","you donâ€™t need to use it, so long as you rename it yourself.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a part of the asus process,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it works with just the 24 pin connector,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
youâ€™re not actually turning the system on to do this.,itâ€™s all done while the system is â€œoffâ€ with just standby power.,so all you need is the 24-pin.,none of the other cables would have any power going through them anyways.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"windows 11 and bios updates added an undervolt protection that ignores undervolt settings, to prevent security vulnerabilities.",you may need to update bios and find the undervolt protection setting and disable it first.,the intel xtu may indicate if undervolt protection is enabled when you try to adjust voltage in software.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep i agree with that.,i lower the vcore the temps going down but the numbers are there lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so basically i just disable undervolt protection and thats it?,when even used xtu nothing happens so i guess i have to disable it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mce?,enchanced multi core performance?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i lack exact steps, but i do recall that the seperate undervolt protection setting had blocked the negative voltage offsets from taking effect.","only really need to undervolt the multiplier that applies to the full core load, otherwise idle gets undervolted a bit too far also.","i found it actually better to adjust the power limits when a cooler, more efficient system is desired.",let the cpu make its own decisions for efficiency within the given limit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1. i need to install the radiator at the top of the case, do i attach the fans facing down or up for optimal cooling ?",(ie push vs pull)?,"2. i don't really plan on doing much over clocking, (besides a benchmark perhaps after setup, and maybe a few years down the line when system slows a bit).",how do you guys see the waterforce x 240 performing inside this case with the 13700k?,"still haven't opened the box yet, so if the consensus is that the 240 aio will be insufficient, then i need to think about a 280 (max for cg560).",thanks guys....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you never mentioned any temps at all lol.,this was the comment i was looking for but no temps :(.,can you enlighten me please on initial temps vs after undervolting?,edit i see now you mentioned cpu package 92c what were the cores sitting at temp wise stock?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for your answer.,funny thing iâ€™m using the same mobo except iâ€™m using the a4 h20 case,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"bruh, 240mm aio is completely fine for 250w.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why would a 240mm aio perform any worse on an itx case?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just lock the power limit of 13700k to 200w.,you'll lose like.. 5% in multithread compared to performance without any power limits and you'll be able to easily cool it with air cooler (probably any 6heatpipe one).,still the performance will be high af.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i7 and i9 typically much different in tdp and thermals.,just wait for i7 reviews.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i donâ€™t plan to overclock the cpu lol 5ghz is enough at stock,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
idle temp 40-46c.,temp while working/trading/gaming 56-65. temp during cinebench 92-97 without throttling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.reddit.com/r/sffpc/comments/yeed2y/lian_li_a4_h2o_with_13700k/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sorry i wasn't more specific.,"core temps at stock were generally in the mid-upper 80s, and peaked in the low 90s.",none of them tripped thermal throttling.,after undervolting (i ended up at -0.75v) temps were capping out at around 80\~81c in cinebench.,"still got hot with prime95 (90c) but again, no thermal throttling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sure, in a well-ventilated atx case.",in a small itx case you are gonna have a hot and loud mess.,[lots of people building itx agree with that.,](https://youtu.be/69ujclj9e4q?t=465) 12700k which has maximum turbo power of 190w and 13600k which has 181w are the best fit for a 240mmm aio.,(13700k has 253w.),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
limited airflow compared to a bigger case and therefore heat build-up.,i timestamped a videolink in my other reply.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then it should be fine.,just set a reasonable long time power limit that you can cool and let the cpu boost when it likes to.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thanks!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on a case.,my ncase m1 can keep the 13700k at 82 degrees with ek 240 aio and two noctua 120mm buttom fan on cinabench.,"while gaming i barely reach 60 degrees, mostly at 58.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
240mm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you have your aio as intake or exhaust?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is 240mm still completely fine?,i ordered 240mm and started wondering if it's going to handle 13700kf.,"for me it will be idle most of the times, in high stress only in games.",what do you think?,i'm afraid 280mm won't fit into my chassis.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
exhaust.,every post iâ€™ve read with an a4-h2o has it set to exhaust.,have you seen otherwise?,iâ€™m curious to try one intake and one exhaust but iâ€™m too lazy to switch the fans unless i see that someone recommends it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah 240 is fine.,mine works perfectly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s either a defective cooler or improper installation.,can you hear or feel if pump is working?,have you ensured that pump is not the high point of the circuit?,have you applied the paste properly?,is the waterblock installed securely?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
donâ€™t forget to remove the â€˜ remove before installing â€˜ sticker on the aio pump block.,itâ€™s a small mistake but really easy to make.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you plug in the pump?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why are we using an aio on such a low end cpu?,the 10100 should work just fine with the stock cooler it comes with.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pump isn't working.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it being that high at idle sounds like it may not be making proper contact with the aio.,i would check that first - iâ€™d imagine even if the pump wasnâ€™t working youâ€™d see lower temps than that as long as itâ€™s making contact with the cpu.,the 10100f is about as low powered as it gets,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

bro the 13700k is over 30 percent better in gaming with it being around 50 percent better in certain games.,plus the single core performance is over 40 percent better.,"the multi core performance is well over 60-70 percent better and when you add the fact itâ€™s also got ddr5 and pcle 4/5 support instead of only ddr4 and pcle3, on top of double the cores, itâ€™s a huge upgrade.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i agree, gamers that are upgrading now should think what will happen in 3-5 years from now.",cause i believe 3-5 years is a good upgrade cycle for pc components or the whole trinity of components (cpu-mobo-ram).,seeing games ramping up in gb sizes and we are slowly transitioning to be gaming in 4k120/1440p240 on the pc.,the telltale that highend gpus and cpus are going to have 100mbs of l3 cache in this coming generation is a given already.,there will be hard bottlenecks if one of the 2 has smaller cache.,"as i have already seen people upgrading to faster gpus that are clear fps monsters, but they keep their 3 - 4 - 5 years old cpu and are stunned why they are not getting near the fps that they see in reviews.",their cpus just have smaller 30mb of cache while the monster gpu is pushing insane amounts of fps towards the cpu and it just chokes up.,as last we are transitioning into a new generation where they slowly are leaving ddr4 behind.,"intel is hitting a support wall on the lga1700 socket, amd just released their first cpus on the am5 socket.","they both have solid ddr5 support, well intel is ahead with already having ddr5-8000 oc working on top flagship products.","amd is a bit limping with a wall at ddr5-6000, hope they recover soon to go ddr5-8000 or intel will sprint away.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what a rude comment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"you won't gain much by cpu oc, ram overclocking - tons.",xmp/expo are very conservative and obscenely loose.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes and from just researching this it appears that the tdp is being over what the specs on the processor are recommended by intel.,i think msi is going 100w over this and it really has complicated things on if it's a general issue with all motherboard manufactures or just msi.,i don't want this cpu temp throttling out of the box.,i am not an ocer but want the performance of what the cpu provides.,also taking buying that fix for the lga1700  socket may help lower temps as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i score about 1000 points higher in r23 with mce turned on, sure it still throttles, but with a good cooler you can get more out of it.",it throttles but it's just able to extract more heat energy.,just something to bear in mind.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
turbo enhanced will force each cpu core to it's factory fused maximum ratio.,"this means 6 p-cores at 55x and 2 p-cores at 58x, with the corresponding voltage needed for 58x ratios.",the equivalent setting on msi is *cooler tuning*,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>auto should be 100.,"103 is an overclock

yea :) but on a lot motherboard auto or  default is just oc.","like in my gigabyte z690 gaming x ddr4 board with 13900k auto is just:

\- mce on

\- no power limits

"yes, whiile this is true, i am not sure about msi, though i have used some of thier top tier boards and they are awesome on the upper end especially, rog boards with mce literally can set no power limit in one click, well, 2 technically.","i will tell you that out of the box, you will likely see some throttling, without the plate for the cpu will help with this and i just did it myself as my 12th gen cpus were all flat, this one wasn't, so i bought and reccomend highly the thermalright over the thermal grizzly, and i love thermal grizzly and derb8uer products, use them all the time, but the thermalright is cheaper, same performance other than ln2 and you arent lkely to bend any pins.","luckily i have a .06nm specific torque driver i got to replace acrylic tops on gpu's and found everything on a pc should be at .06nm torque, but with the thermalright just remember to tighten the screws diagnol slowly and as tight as they came out, which youll find is barely past finger tight, there is a thread in here somewhere and i followed advice i got and not only that but i recieved the part the same day from amazon $12.","some people will diable e cores, which helps with temps a lot, and mostly you won't even feel it but benchmarks and some games for fps are huge gains, i mean there are 16 of these e-cores!","that said intel always comes overvolted, they all do, and its to pass inspection regardless of the bin quality, but i won't lie, these run  very hot default during loads, but its worth it.. your best option might be thermal velocity boost, where you can set or use auto specs to drop ratios at specific temperatures, i often use this as it will keep the cpu under 75c no matter what mainly.. there are so many bios settings now that even i am lost, and ill tell you overclocking is not really needed or extremely beneficial, however default bios settings just don't match all of the people who use this cpu, we are talking about a cpu that i can easily and fastly run 6 vms at the same time each is equivilant to 4-6 threads and 4gb of ram, and it does this like a champ, but for sure get the plate cover, also look inot tvb if you havent already its an intel idea so its not technically overclocking if used how they want you to, but is still an advance even from adaptive boost 3.0 and you can always set a power limit for turbo and non turbo loads, there are many tools in your board whatever it is that can keep this cpu tamed, and remember also more doesn't always mean better anything over 300 watts at most is pointless, often less!",but best of luck to you and let me know if i can help or pm me!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if this is a tl;dr, please do us all a favor and you don't need to say it, im alerady telling you if you know it and don't need to read it, then its tl;dr.. i'm only here to help!",this is dependent on xmp / memory 100%.,"if you are using certain motherboards so far a ddr4 variant, (have only used even numbered mt/s ddr5) but say your sticks are 4133 or w.e.","on a 100:133 or ""odd"" ratio speed rated xmp profile its simply your motherboard is technically meeting its xmp rated speeds starting at 4000 mt/s and using your bclk to overclock your ram and also now your cpu (unless you are able to change your external vrm to separate settings like svid and stuff, can get complicated) as well as other settings related to that embedded controller in your cpu and i use 4000 mt (or to those who insist on using mhz as a measurement which is a whole different topic), therefore if you do the math to reach 4133 mt/s ram speed, that's really set to 4000 on the board a 103.6 will put your ram at 4133!","this is also board dependent, some use this some don't, my apex loves to do this with all of my odd ratio ram and some cpus will be fine with this, and i find often that is a bit too much of a stable bclk oc.","also bear in mind, bclk is often the only way to overclock non ""k,ks,kf"" sku or locked ratio cpus.","this was very common with say the i5 6500 back in the day where many people were running these at the near 5.0ghz (if lucky) range, however it throws off many other things, and stuff like usb ports often would not work properly or at all, etc.. asus boards particularly will prompt you to let you know that when you enable xmp its going to raise your bclk to whatever.","from a lot of time overclocking on high end oc boards down to very low end boards i can save you much time and bsods and aggravation by stating 2 things, 1) odd ratio ram usually overclocks better, regardless, just an observation, and 2) bclk is not really a practical daily way to oc typically in large numbers, but more so a way to achieve dependability, stability, and add that final touch to an ""almost ideal"" overclock, especially where you have say an all-core of 5.6 that occasionally crashes and if your bclk settings are on auto and set to say 100.25, dropping it to 100.0 or 99.8 is a great way to make everything run smooth, in the case of the common 103.6 boost, its ridiculous, your better off to run your memory at the next speed up and drop your bclk back down, also this is where you get funny looking numbers, so no hwinfo 64 is not lying to you if you play with bclk and readouts do not match the box!",same in opposite direction.,"it's rumored that 100.0 is the most stable, but in reality, 100.000 is where your speeds are where they are rated, at the end of the day nearly everything when it comes to overclocking is entirely based on silicon quality of your hardware much more than its rated speeds!","look at our 13900k, for example, these are rated to run at 3.0ghz... lol and somewhere somehow boosted on paper to reach 5.8ghz on the best 2 or 3 p-cores, and 5.5 on the rest, and i never honestly looked at what the e-cores are rated for, maybe 4.3 max boost, i run a benchmark/fps blasting stable at 6.29ghz/4.91 (p/e core) with nothing more than mce enabled, unlimited power, and simply a user defined cooler score of 201 and optimism of 110 (to match the sp).","undervolting is done by the optimism / best case scenario svid, and the core oc is done by the cooler score, rog boards can be that simple to overclock/undervolt, granted my cooler score would auto be around 179-188 with a custom loop, 2x 360mm rads kryonaout paste, an ek block on cpu/gpu and active backplate on a 3090, but because i scored a lucky sample of sp 110 and still keeping temps below 84c at the worst possible (and yes the custom pressure plate, the cheap one).","that is an amazing overclock and by far for me the fastest, i have an i5 12600k that runs an all core of 5.55ghz which is also impressive since it doesn't touch 62c at 5.55.

i know this is not new info for many nor do i claim to know it all or more than any person, sometimes my replies are long, but i imply my answers to help those like me when i knew nothing but wanted to know more and the answers, i would get just didn't break it down to my level of knowledge at that time.","that said, it is pretty funny when i start off with ai oc and upon post it says, ""overclock 113%"".. lol, that is true, just from the 3.0 default speed which i don't know why anybody would run at 3.0 unless its an average between the p and e cores like many things seem to be displayed as..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, it's true, sites don't bother with doing secondary and tertiary timings and stupidly fight over the lowest possible primaries, which is a waste of time on ddr5, so results are as they are.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, i agree with this man right here.","as silly as it sounds, the truth is you will not feel a difference in 2000 mt/s with ddr5, and while the primary timings look and are quite loose, the vast majority of benchmarks will show nearly very little to no difference, games will not feel faster, at these speeds with intel, were at a point where honestly the only way i could get anything to feel any snappier that works though its deployment method people have a crazy variance of opinion, but i run 3 980pro 1tb nvme drives in raid 0, or striped, as i get 3x the performance which is still stupid margins for real life tasks, and i do risk losing my data 3x more than others arguably, but i still keep 3tb of storage, games load very fast, its not uncommon to not see a progress bar for a whole second installing some software, but the unseen til i tried it benefits include 10-17c temp drops on all 3 drives from idle to load respectively, and the total writes to all drives are not only even but 3x less than using one at a time.","samsung magician does not work, and i cannot usefully overprovision my drives, but even though with a killer sample 13900k that runs 6.29ghz on 3 cores and over 6.0 on the rest of p cores, i get better scores by running at 5.8/5.6 and 4.6 on e, while mce enabled, i set limits to 270 p0 and 255w p1 with 448 second bursts, or 128 seconds with xtu.. lol.","my temps stay below 72c idle at 23-27c and it uses less than 1.3v at all times, so high numbers look good on paper, and its cool to see an almost 6.3ghz oc, my cinebench r23 scores are near 43000 multi with these settings, right under 40,000 stock even without xmp on ddr4-2133 for baseline, that speaks for itself... scores are 41000 when at 6.29 power unlimited and just let it thermal throttle to 84c on its own, so i much prefer the great temps and low voltage which i do all from ai as manually i really cannot beat these with any noticeable difference and be stable.","i can also turn mce off and get almost the same results, there are many ways to skin a cat here, but to sum it up, i actually do better with b-die ddr4 4133 oc to 4533 cl14 than ddr5-6200 cl38, other than aida64 memory speeds and latency is much better, yet still unnoticeable.","i go based on real world usage and feel and silicon bliss over what i read, most of what i watch and what it says on the box!",i would comfortably say the days of ram overclocking benefits for daily usage are over as of this current new wave of ddr5 kits.,"you can have a ... measuring contest over timings all day long, but the same os and hardware on 2 systems one with ddr4-4533 and ddr5-6200 the above average person even won't be able to guess which is which without reading the numbers, some will finish first on one some on the other.","it's hard to imagine why anyone would need more than a 13600k for anything even intensive workloads, these things are just amazing right out of the box, and thats the first time i have ever said that!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i guess my bigger question in all this is why you wouldnâ€™t just plug the 2nd monitor into the gpu that has at least 4 ports on it and disable igpu from bios.,igpu has a slight performance impact on a 13900k.,itâ€™s basically a backup in case you need to rma your gpu but need to be able to keep using your pc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this is pure conjecture on my part, but i suspect it's so that the video will work if you move it to the monitor connected to the igpu (and third gpu etc.).","for example you can even straddle a video across two screens, one connected to one gpu and the other connected to another gpu.",if the gpu isn't already handling the video it would be blank.,i do appreciate that there's other options they have.,but from their perspective they need to think about a seamless user experience above relatively small additional power draw and increased complexity.,increased complexity is where bugs hide.,"even if you're not showing the desktop, i suspect there's both edge cases and legacy reasons.","like for example video decode may go through a large part of the standard ui path, so it's not easy to just separate it out.","if they were doing a ground-up from the beginning new ui, kernel, etc.",etc.,then these sorts of things could be somewhat simply solved relatively speaking.,"but with the huge amount of backwards compat in windows, weird things are going to happen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

cpu lite mode 9 (auto) is the default for the 13900k.,you changed it to mode 10 which increases the voltage above stock default values.,you've made the chip hotter by doing this.,you want to go down in mode.,typically you'll be able to run mode 7 stable.,you can even run mode 6 on a board with a good vrm.,it may crash though on that board.,don't play with bios until you learn what these things do or you could cause yourself more problems.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

my whole thought process going into this was getting basically the best... 360mm right now  is non negotiable for me lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
one thing to keep in mind is what is the ambient temperature in the room when you are looking at temps.,it can impact the idle and load temps a lot.,you should try to compare a change at the same ambient temp.,itâ€™s also going to go up the longer you game since itâ€™s dumping heat in the room.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"bin is simply how good a chip is compared to others, 'golden bin' usually refers to the top 1-5%, bottom bin meaning weakest.","normally this is based on how well they overclock, higher clock at lower voltage = good, low clocks / requires a lot of voltage to pc = bad / bottom bin.",based on 'binning' which is when chip manufactures test and handpick chips for different speeds / core counts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hey guys!,"as the title says, iâ€™m a little confused about which of these drivers i should be downloading after a fresh windows install.",i usually donâ€™t like to leave it to windows update.,installing drivers from the manufacturer website seems to be better.,but iâ€™ve never heard an io or gna driver before.,should i also download the meupdatetool on firmware tab?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you so much!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>should i also download the meupdatetool on firmware tab?,mandatory!,"(before bios update)

so

1 update firmware v2

restart pc.","2 update bios (optional)

3 me driver

4 intel chipset driver

restart pc.","5 intel serialio driver

6 intel gna

nice yeah my brother has a 12700k and he used the intel tuning utility to get at 5gz all core this will my first pc happy i went with a beast 13th gen as its so much more powerful plus even out of the box i'm sure it will hit 5gz in games right ?,so i don't have to overclock straight away,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

try a new beta driver.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just bought the graphic card so i installed the latest drive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

just to let you know youâ€™re not alone.,one year ago i built a system with an asus z590-plus motherboard that also comes with an intel i225-v (3).,everything was perfect until i tried to connect to my company vpn.,it just didn't work.,after trying everything like different drivers and configurations i ended plugin in a pcie nic.,with that card the vpn now connects flawlessly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

my i5 4670k is a stutterfest in this game.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"rtx 4090 with a 13900kf, the game shows 100+ ultra+ rt but isnt that smooth, looks like there might be stutters cause of cpu bottleneck",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good to see that it utilizes all of those cores,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s funny how differently coded games affect raptor lake so completely different.,i noticed that mwii doesnâ€™t even make my i9 13900k break a sweat.,it stays in the 40s (c).,and at 4k 120hz my 3090ti will be at 100% and the i9 at ~20%.,but in the division 2 it jumps to 40-50% cpu usage and heats up to 55-50c.,iâ€™m wanting to try that new w3 update to check it out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
shocked to hear about this.,i heard cyberpunk runs better.,lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for gaming try this, disable your ecores (which lets you get the cache to a closer frequency to pcores) and see if your stutters are reducedâ€¦ i run my 12900k without the ecores but higher all core clock and cache is 800mhz higher than with ecores.",the reasoning is that ecores cause the cache to have way lower clocks and might cause stutters or slightly reduced performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

turn e-cores off.,kills stutter completely.,stutter is because it's sometimes waiting on e-core for milliseconds too long,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

just to point out this is irrelevant to 13th gen as you can now run ring over 5.0 and overclock e cores on top.,"i will be wating to give rtx witcher 3 a playthrough once my new setup is finished, i have all the stuff, currently waiting for my backups to finish and then still need to test the cpu ocs.","13600kf, 3080 ti, and if it helps 4300cl14 g1 2x16 ram.",also got raid 0 nvme setup now with 13k read and writes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the turn off e-cores is a myth.,after bios and win11 updates you will have a 3-4% decrease in average when turning the e cores off.,lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's not really true.,on my old cpu i was bottlenecked in the witcher 1 because most of the cpu was unutilised but one core was maxed out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
had a similar issue and i was like why does my game look like itâ€™s on low settings when i know i maxed it out.,i had to manually check for an patch that fixed it for me.,so maybe try that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not related to topic, but does your 9900k bottleneck your 3080 or nah?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"no, we need amd and intel to team up and make the 14900kx3d",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe you'd be better off setting cpu affinity for the game so the game only uses p cores?,"that way background processes and stuff can still use the e cores

i think processlasso can do this easily, but otherwise just use task manager",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it seems he has one of the p-cores maxed out.,none of the e-cores are working hard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you mean the lack of memory bandwidth?,using properly tuned ddr5 fixes that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
correlation isnâ€™t causation.,iâ€™d like to hear cdprâ€™s take on it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
really wish they would just use that die space for p cores and get rid of the useless e-cores,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"> correlation isnâ€™t causation

the phrase ""correlation isn't causation"" is often used to caution against assuming that because two things are correlated, one must be causing the other.","this is a common logical fallacy known as post hoc ergo propter hoc, which translates to ""after this, therefore because of this.""","in some cases, it may be clear that the correlation between two things is not causal, but in other cases, the relationship may be more complex and require further investigation to determine if there is a causal connection.","one way that the phrase ""correlation isn't causation"" can be misused is by using it as a blanket statement to dismiss any potential causal relationship without considering the evidence and the specific context of the situation.",this can be problematic because it may lead to a lack of critical thinking and an unwillingness to consider the possibility of causation in situations where it may actually exist.,"another way that the phrase can be misused is by assuming that because two things are correlated, there must not be any causal relationship between them.","this is an example of the fallacy of denying the antecedent, which is the inverse of the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy.","in cases where an action demonstrates a fix, it is important to carefully consider the evidence and the specific context before determining if the relationship between the action and the fix is causal.","simply stating that ""correlation isn't causation"" without considering the evidence and the specific context of the situation can be a misuse of the phrase.","i cited a known fix, one which goes back to the introduction of e-cores as a wide ranging fix of 1% low problems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the e-cores are their only method of keeping up with amd right now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

windows 10 on a new system only if you have very specific software that runs on windows 10 better than on windows 11 you actually really need for you daily life.,"buying a new pc, in your case very high end, with windows 10 is basically bottlenecking yourself with software.","windows 10 wont even have updates after 2025, this is in just 2 years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
donâ€™t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
terrible idea.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
of course it is.,calling a game unoptimised because it's not utilising 24 cores fully is ludicrous.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this cpu has 24 cores.,realistically that's never going to be fully utilised by most games.,games would have to fundamentally stop being dependent on human interaction for that to happen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fsr helps in gpu bound scenarios.,best thing to do for stutters is to lock your framerate a little lower than the max it can do.,unlocked framerate isn't some magical thing some people think it is.,even frame pacing is so much more important.,"if you can hit 150, but it drops down to 90 regularly with stutters.",try locking it down to 120. gives the cpu a little more time to get frames ready.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

could you elaborate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>calling a game unoptimised because it's not utilising 24 cores fully is ludicrous.,then i guess it's a good thing that i didn't get even close to saying something like that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

anything that requires compute throughput.,which is pretty much anything that isn't dependent on latency on just a few threads.,on paper having lots of big cores makes very little sense because you can't actually run all of them very fast at the same time within reasonable power budget and they take a lot of space.,you get a lot more compute for same amount of silicon having more of the little ones.,implementation problems are another question of course.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

one other problem a lot of users are running into, you cannot do or fix this on b660 boards.","13th gen chips are fully incompatible with b660 as they run excessive voltage and heat, and for whatever reason undervolting doesn't work and hugely degrades performance compared to lite load adjustment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there are no 12th/13th gen motherboards with two 4.0 x16 slots.,"yeah, it looks like it visually, but the physical size of the slot does not determine its electrical connections.",z690/z790 only supports two x8 slots at best.,"the top x16 slot drops to x8 as soon as you install a card in the lower slot, as **there are only 16 total pcie lanes to be shared by both slots, regardless of what speed theyâ€™re running at**.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lanes are not merged or converted by the motherboardâ€™s pcie switch into a different pcie generation / lane count.,"they are simply switched like a train track, taking 8 from one physical location (slot 1) and rerouting them to another (slot 2).","if you plug a pcie 3.0 x16 card into a pcie 5.0 x8 slot, you now have a pcie 3.0 x8 connection.",itâ€™s that simple.,"itâ€™s not merging the x16 lanes of your 3.0 card into 8 lanes of 4.0.

just because a particular game doesnâ€™t utilize 95%+ of both cpu and gpu doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s a bottleneck.,"if both are hovering around 70%, then it sounds like something else is your limiting factor, not the cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"okay so there are already a couple of issues you can look into:   
cpu has no hyper threading, some games will really not like this even if it has the cores for it.",ram is slow and there have been issues using 4x vs 2x ram modules so you can look into what this could mean for you.,"u/karp3l actually has almost identical hardware and he is getting 40-70 fps, probably without dlss so that shows that the game just simply runs pretty poorly so if you are getting 80 fps or more, i think you should be pretty happy.",remember always check experience from similar hardware before thinking there is an issue.,looking at 50-80% hardware usage and saying there is an issue is only relevant if there are actually performance issues.,different software(games) will utilize your hardware differently.,"and sometimes, mostly badly optimized, games will simply never use all the power available.","could be the cpu being bottlenecked from lack of ht and gpu bottlenecked from the cpu bottleneck, meaning none of them will have 100% or close in usage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my upgrade with darktide : 8600k + gtx 3080 @1440p (40-70 fps with medium settings) to 13600k + gtx 3080 @1440p (90-130 fps with high settings).,it was a huge improvement !,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what kind of fps are you getting in your games?,is  your fps uncapped?,"disable vsync, max out graphics settings, try different games, is what i can think of to push your gpu to its limit and fully utilized, then check your cpu usage again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just a little fyi after playing some overwatch:

&#x200b;

it's worth noting that sometimes my cpu usage would skyrocket to 80% while the gpu still stays at 97% usage, while at times my cpu usage would dip to 40-50% gpu usage suddenly dips to 70-80%.",i'm really confused  lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm getting a very similar issue with icarus open world mode.,"i started with 80fps at 3440x1440 with 99% gpus usage and now after 50 hours in that world, i now get 20-35 fps.",cpu is at 85% and gpu is at 50-60%.,cores are hitting 90-95%.,9700k 5.0g/3200mhz/2080,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"another update:

i noticed not a single cpu core gets maxed out during the gpu dips so i ordered some 2x16gb 3600mhz ram.",fingers crossed that solves the issue,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i am no expert, but if it doesn't hit 100% cpu utilisation, that doesn't seem a bottleneck.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ofc, even now 13900k is bottlenecking my gpu so badly comparing with 18900k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
overall cpu usage doesn't mean much.,you have to look at each core.,"odds are, one core is being used above 95%.","if you have low gpu usage and no core is being used above 90%, then you have a ram speed bottleneck.",a 9700k and ddr2666 are both serious bottlenecks for a modern gpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what could that possibly be?,the ram?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dlss was on before and after the cpu upgrade.,rtx is off.,"cpu bottleneck is real and massive with this game, but not the only one... in hunt:showdown i also win 20-30 fps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"100 fps with not much going on with dlss quality
80-90 fps with the same scenario without dlss even though the gpu usage is higher",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"technically, if the game only uses like 75% of the cores, then it is still a cpu bottleneck, but in single core instead of multi core performance.","this guy seems to be getting good frame rates as is, so itâ€™s good that he ainâ€™t seeing 100% utilization.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ordered some 2x16gb 3600mhz ram.,really hope that solves the issue,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or the game itself has become the bottleneck.,"it is possible to run into the limitations of the engine on which the game runs, so the game can never use all the power of the hardware to the fullest.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your ram and cpu are too slow.,9700k is only eight cores and eight threads.,those cores are slow by modern standards.,ddr4 2666 is very slow today.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
damn guess ill count my lucky stars i play neither of them!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fps is uncapped right?,"it could be the game not proper optimized to utilize all cpu/gpu power, what about other games?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i7 9700k is 8cores and 8 threads and not six cores,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's uncapped yeah.,i played mw2 and with dlss quality it mostly stays between 80-96% gpu usage and anywhere between 50-80 cpu usage.,110 fps average.,i dunno how to feel about all that considering it never hits 100% cpu usage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"erm, you upgraded 2 generations, you're not getting extra performance from the cores, but from the generational improvement.",at 4k you would notice exactly zero difference between a 13600k and 13900k because you are gpu bound.,next generation a 14600k will outperform your 13900k at 4k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2.","**support intel arc graphics**_x000d_

than i thought, maybe this resolution i used from beginning on: [intels high power consumption on idle issue resolution](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000092564/graphics.html) is still active in bios and its causing some issues against the bios update that supports intels arc.","so i opened my bios, and put everything that belongs to the pci-e to ""auto""

after the restart i used 3dmark again.",the arc just hits only the 80â°c and the fan goes finally up until over 2000rpm.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think i ran into a similar issue here.,"just got an arc a770, fresh installed 4032 drivers, and realized that the moment i touched the performance options in arc, the fans would refuse to spin up past \~1200 rpm or so.","rebooting fixed the problem for me, but i guess overclocking is just not feasible for now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as of today, it has not been fixed.",only the le version of the graphics card will be affected by the performance tuning of the arc control center.,the current temporary solution is to restart the system to restore the default settings of arc and do not set any options in the performance tuning.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for the suggestion.,"i installed the beta driver, but the problem persists.","the card climbed to 90c and throttling kicked in, with fan speed still at 1000 rpm.","after running like that for 1 minute, i closed the game and saw fan speed immediately increased to 1200-1258 rpm, which persisted even minutes after the card had cooled back down to 50c.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, i'm considering it, but i'll have to wait until there's new cards in stock.",for now i'll just have to run it underclocked.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah i was gonna say to uninstall it as it might be interfering somehow.,one last go run duu have it shut down.,remove the gpu and install it back in (make sure itâ€™s seated all the way).,install the power cables (make sure theyâ€™re properly seated).,load into bios and ensure rebar is on.,load into windows and install beta drivers.,once installed restart immediately.,if this doesnâ€™t work it could potentially be a hardware issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

for having had my windows install on a sata ssd several years ago and now using optane as my primary drive i can tell you that optane gives you a snappier windows experience.,optane loads softwares and games much faster as it has higher random read throughput.,"unlike what most people think games use storage randomly, not sequentially.",nand flash drives whether they are sata or nvme will give you the same windows and game loading experience as they have the same level of random read throughput.,an improvement in random reads will assure that games load even faster.,that metric is also of great benefit in the data center space for data analytics workloads.,"optane never exceeds 45c in temperature under heavy load while heat is the constant concern for nand flash nvme drives, and will be even more so with pcie 5.0 drives.","a pcie 5.0 optane drive would have been ideal, temperature wise.",optane also offers you dram like endurance making it the perfect os drive.,it's a shame seeing it not being further developed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you could have got the 905p for example at 1tb for $1500 like i did.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

intel seems desperate to take attention away from amd's impending release of their new ryzen 7 x3d chips.,it's been non-stop intel leak/hype/pr articles since product details and release schedules started getting into the news two weeks ago.,the uptick has been really noticeable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
around 6 months depending how much volume they want for release.,two months is pretty much absolute minimum because you can't produce even a single cpu much faster than that.,edit: of course here we are talking about laptop cpus so add at least a month after the cpu launch for actual product launches.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its looking like q4 next year will still be raptor lake refresh.,"meteor lake will be 2024, what i'm more interested in is the base ram support going from 5600 ddr5 all the way to 7500 ddr5x, as my next upgrade will be when ddr5 reaches 9000+ on 2x32.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not even amd included 5800x3d in their marketing slides.,it's just too good lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because they are.,same for amd.,looking at the gaming graphs it doesn't seem like the 13900k is that big of a jump.,at least in gaming.,its likely gonna compete with amd's zen 4 and 5800x3d quite closely.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's so good it hurts both intel and amd in the high end.,"pair it with cheap mobos, memory and cooling.",the 5800x3d is the best buy imo right now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"at least they did include it at all, lol.","but the fact that it exists just throws kinda a wrench in sales of high end gaming cpus right now, i feel like.","since everyone saw what a massive difference it had over the 5950, while basically being a prototype part with shit like lower clocks and locked voltage.","now we have the 13th gen and zen 4 launch, and everyone just knows that there is going to be something coming soon that's a 20% improvement over these, because there is no reason for there not to be.","so unless you're doing an in-platform upgrade from like a 12400 to 13600k or something, why not just wait and see what happens with the new 3d part?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5800x3d is the new 1080ti,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
after watching zen 4 and raptor lake all i can say is that both presentations were low key an advertisement for people to go buy either a 5800x3d or 12700k.,this is really funny as a consumer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i bought a 5800x3d yesterday and nothing has made me feel as validated as intel's own marketing slides.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at least they acknowledge the existent of the 5800x3d.,for the amd marketing team the 5800x3d is a myth xd.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"kind of funny timing this month that both sides are comparing themselves to the other's last gen.

i have been convinced... to wait for 3d zen 4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 5800x3d bar is very small and the topline percentage gains are over the 5950x.,why even include the 5800x3d at all if you're gonna market like this?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>what's up with intel's marketing?,"seems like they're almost hiding the 5800x3d

what do you mean?",that's how it always has been.,it's marketing!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the worst thing is really that the benchmarked the 5950x using painfully slow ram, whilst benchmarking their own chips with some premium level kits",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13900k is better which it obviously should be being the price difference but 5800x3d is an insane value if you're still on the amd platform.,granted their are multiple factors at play depending on ddr5 speeds and such.,"also props to intel for even including it, amd didn't so there's that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
comedy gold.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 5800x3d is so good intel has to hide it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is like begging amd for 3dvcache zen4 cpus xd,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to be fair, that was basically what amd did on the zen4 reveal as well.",:),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"when you lost the game, you try to hide it.",clear and simple.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wow a benchmark that actually includes bannerlord, one of the most thread count heavy games right now.",question is did they max out the battle size to 1000 because that is the true cpu test of bannerlord.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thats how marketing works.,"try and make your product look favorable....


the marketing isnt aimed at people who know what they're looking at.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they were tasked with showing how intel is superior to amd in single core, frequency and cache bound games.... while also showing the 5800x3d.... 

though spot tbh...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the entire rpl and zen 4 are a bad value compared to 5800x3d lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
letâ€™s not forget they arenâ€™t even running the amd chips with their best config.,they are using 3200mhz ddr4 and not the preferred 3600mhz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"
and these are hand-picked games.","it looks like the 13900k is only going to be slightly better than the 12900k, and trade blows with the 5800x3d?","the 7600x is close to the 12900k in games benchmarks, are we just going to have a tight cluster near the top and no clear winner?",if that's the case then the 5800x3d will take it as it will be the cheapest (chip + mb + ram),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think that is quite common way to chart/show outliers... so in fact i think that slide gives the x3d credit.,otherwise four bars might have been too crowded that no one would understand.,"yet, i would agree with you in terms that the % increase is done versus the 5950x.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 5800x3d would be such a good pick for me if it didnt shit the bed in rpcs3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is there a  reason why intel isn't doing an intel gaming cpu?ditch the e-cores and increase cache/core.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel and terrible charts, what else is new?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel need to decide who they're marketing this towards.,"they're using gaming, but it's a 16 core productivity cpu that happens to be good at gaming (like the 5950x).","in that case, why mention the 5800x3d?","if the focus is gaming, the obvious point is that the 8 core gaming cpu is obviously much cheaper, so why not use a comparable i7?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because it is a bad gaming cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they aren't really hiding anything.,r9 5950x and i9 1x900k have the same target audiance which may also be interested in multi core perf.,r7 5800x3d has different target audiance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i guess.l its clear but some could say that.,should include 7950x.,i would skip this gen if you have a last gen cpu (or get 3d),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"doesn't really look like raptor lake offers much for gaming compared to alder lake, just a small and incremental improvement.","after zen 4 so far turned out to be somewhat disappointing for gaming, i figured that raptor lake surely will do much better, given that it supposedly features ipc improvements and a massive clock boost.","but it doesn't, really.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if its not that significant of a jump from 12900k, at the very least i hope they tuned it better in terms of power and heat output.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i mean 5800 3xd is only good in gaming,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the whole amd subreddit is waiting for 7000x3d.,hoping 30+% more gaming perf than 7950x.,this is not gonna happen.,the perf gains of 7000 are mainly from higher frequency and higher power=tsmc 5nm.,they can't run 3d version chips @ 5.4ghz & 90+c celsius.,it will be more like a 5950x3d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hmm, my initial impressions are that both ryzen 7000 and raptor lake aren't as exciting as i thought.",my i3 12100f lives on in budget glory.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol between this pathetic nonsense and them literally pre-announcing the i9-13900ks before regular 13th gen has even launched tells me that intel is obviously absolutely fucking terrified of 3d v cache!,(as they right well should be tbh.,the r7 5800x3d is making both vanilla zen 4 and raptor lake look fucking ridiculous for a pure gaming build).,"it's like the upcoming r7 7800x3d is constantly hovering over pat's back shoulder while regularly whispering in his ear ""6ghz or not you're still absolutely fucked in gaming performance this generation at the moment of lisa's choosing..."" ðÿ¤£",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it sort of makes sense because itâ€™s not really a competitor cpu to the 13900k outside of gaming.,the 13900k absolutely murders it for everything non-gaming and just has way more cores/threads.,but for gaming they kind of have to include it in order to claim top gaming performance so i guess they settled on this.,it does look funny but the full bars are what they feel are similar cpus while the 5800x3d is there to show that in gaming the 13900k can trade blows for the crown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

exactly!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's surprising, it has almost half as much cache as ps3 had ram, so you'd think that would affect performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wondered the same.,8c/16t with double or triple the cache.,"it obviously makes a difference, so how hard can it be to make a 13750k or something like that targeting gamers.","i wonâ€™t be upgrading until next fall probably, but hopefully by then iâ€™ll know if iâ€™m going back to intel or doing a 78/7900x3d build.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"costs, probably.",they can sell the 12900k chip in a many skus and in many markets.,"spending another $200m to get a separate chip just for gamers, might not be worth it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was really hoping to see the p-only cpu in 13th gen. but now 7950x will be my new baby.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"at least, 5800x3d was included, amd forgot it exists, just like i5...

also, 5800x3d was not in productivity slide so, i think intel marketing was actually very representative of the current cpu market.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they probably know if they market it solely as a productivity part, the 7950x will still trump it.",it probably has a slight edge over the 7950x in gaming so they have to market it as a good all-rounder.,â€œit might lose to the 7950x a bit in productivity but look at the gaming!â€,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
performance superiority when the x3d wins 2 out of 9 benchmarks lol?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then why not make the topline % gain vs the 5800x3d and not the 5950x?,since the 5800x3d is/was the best amd gaming chip they could compare to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i hope they make p-only cpu.,if not - bye bye intel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i mean that r7 is their only 3d cache cpu, and it was also stupidly good at gaming when it came out, and it still is.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's the point?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"according to some reviews, 7000 series gaming performance isn't affected even with 65w eco-mode.",we don't know how the next v-cache iteration will handle the voltages zen 4 uses (voltage limitation was the reason 5800x3d was locked to lower frequencies).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"amd wonâ€™t want to do it anyways, the x3d cache is super expensive to add so they donâ€™t make much money on the 5800x3d.",they only did it to hold off 12th gen intel until their am5 parts were ready.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they improved the 3d cache tecnology,

"cause zen4 just launched, and these slides were made before said launch.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am sure amd did not send press kits to intel â€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why would anyone buy a 13900k for msfs if they can run a much cheaper rig with a 5800x3d that probably has the same performance?,"and even if the 13900k outperforms the 5800x3d in msfs, the price tag of the 5800x3d with a cheap am4 board and cheap ddr4 ram is so much lower compared to a 13900k system that you get way more bang for the buck.",not even to mention that the high-end msfs simmer will probably have a vr headset and aim for stable 30 or 45fps with reprojection.,"so there is no reason to buy anything above the 5800x3d right now, especially as that cpu has a rock-solid fps output with nearly no fps drops.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

don't get your expectation up with the 7800x3d.,"it may well be better, but the caching solution may not give it any performance boost at all (above the 5800x3d).",you may have to rely on the raster improvements.,some folks seem to think they'll get a massive jump in performance but that remains to be seen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what was good about the 5775c?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it is clocked lower than the 5800x, which already has 105w tdp/142w max draw, which is for heavy all-core loads.",70-80w for poorly threaded games is about right.,the batshit performance comes from the massive amount of l3 cache greatly reducing memory-related delays.,"cpus spend a lot of time doing nothing, apparently.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's an 8 core cpu lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">  but nope, that cpu takes like 70-80w under gaming

the hilarious part for me is how it falls behind in multi-threaded applications when compared to the 5800x.",it's like amd created the perfect gaming cpu.,"""here is 8 cores and here is a slab of l3 cache.",so even the most frugal of gamers can run it with ddr4 2400 and get all the performance improvements.,make sure to lock out overclocking aswell and give it a tdp so low even the flimsiest of skylake stock coolers can handle.,"finally those gamers can shut up"" - lisa su probably",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i'm on the same boat, my i5 7400 needs to go but i can't justify am5 tbh.",i'll wait till next year once everything is out.,probably going to go with the 5800x3d but i wouldn't mind a 7600x3d tbh.,if mobos and ram are expensive then 13600k or 5800x3d it is.,"gpu side of things i'll probably go with amd as i use linux, hopefully rdna 3 will put nvidia back in it's place",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

how long term?,"amd have only committed to am5 until 2025 thatâ€™s 3 years from now, and thatâ€™s assuming they mean through the end of 2025. on top of that theyâ€™ve lied about this shit as little as 3 years ago with strx4, which is dead in the water now if you wanted to upgrade.",how many cpus do you plan on buying in the next 3 years?,iâ€™m not saying intels better in this regard but 3 years on a platform isnâ€™t shit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
x3d margins arenâ€™t as good because the 3d cache is expensive to make and theyâ€™d rather sell them as pricey server chips.,"thatâ€™s also why we probably wonâ€™t ever see 5950x3d, itâ€™d have awful margins vs the new am5 parts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5800x3d is only very good for gaming.,otherwise it's the same as any 5800x.,"and even it gaming it's not 10% better than the 12700k, it'd only be 10% in cpu bound games, and close to equal in any gpu bound game (gpu bound games are usually the more graphically demanding ones)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is a gaming oriented card with lots of extra cache.,"it likely won't be amazing for editing and animation, but you should look it up.","there are a few workload benchmarks that are cache sensitive, but not many.","newer gen cpus with greater clocks, ipc, and more cores will seriously outperform it in almost all workloads, but there are certain games that are heavily bound by cache size where it has incredible fps gains.",i would look up benchmarks with the 5800x3d for your specific editing/animating apps to make sure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the x3d is only worth buying if you're already on an am4 platform, since am4 is a dead platform now.","if you're building new, go with 12700k if you have a mid-range budget (only slightly less performance than the x3d), and you'll eventually wind up with 13900k as an upgrade (slightly better than x3d).","if you have a higher end budget, pay more now, and go with 7600x, and you'll be able to upgrade a couple more generations than the intel path, and possibly wind up with a future am5 x3d (maybe 9800x3d...?","), which would be competitive with possibly intel gen 15.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is the x3d a lot worse than a 5800x in production work loads?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i mean to be fair to both parties, these slides and proofs are probably prepared and rechecked many times well in advance, not like they couldâ€™ve turned all that around in a day.",sure theyâ€™re all prepping new material now but itâ€™s better to wait for the third party reviewers anyway.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">meanwhile, intel could've re-done benches with the 7950x and published the slides tomorrow, but they chose not to.","instead, they compared their unreleased i9-13900k to amd's 2-year-old 5950x, instead of their newly released 7950x.",do you actually not realize how unrealistic this is?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">did you expect amd to wait until they could buy raptor lake cpus at retail, before showing ""amd vs intel"" performance benchmarks?","no, its just funny how it timed out, and will be interesting to compare them in a few weeks.",note i mentioned both sides specifically; not everything is a big conspiracy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

unfortunately someone already tested it and found that it doesnâ€™t perform nearly as well as the 129000k with avx512,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is a productivity cpu.,it's a carthorse.,it's a competent gaming cpu but for the money it's insane to use for that unless you also want to software encode simultaneously.,the 5950x is also a carthorse.,comparing them makes sense.,"i think throwing in a gaming cpu that's half the price just confuses things because it introduces arguments of ""look how expensive this intel part is for the performance"" when those arguments can also be made of the 5950x, and intel themselves have similarly performing (in gaming) cheaper cpus.",there's such a thing as including too much data and losing focus of what you're trying to say with it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't care.,this isn't the graph to convey that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because they see the 5950x as the competitor to their highest sku.,"in order to not seem misleading, they had to add in the maximum gaming performance of what amd can offer.",i don't see the problem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why didn't amd do that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because st uplift doesnt translate to gaming uplift.,did they compare directly to 12900k?,i mean did they say how by much 13900k is faster in gaming compared to 12900k?,"cause going off of these plots, it doesnt look to be much better than the x3d.",you have to look at differences in comparison to the size of the bar.,"the way they have it, it looks like the 13900k will beat the x3d by like 5-10% but a closer look reveals its much closer.","also, what is arcadegeddegon?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

huge cache called edram that worked like an l3+ cache.,i think it was an experiment by intel.,not a halo product but more of a tech preview.,it had some interesting properties that the 5800x3d is showing with its huge cache.,"this idea isn't new, the silicon techniques have finally caught on to make it feasible, and it has some tangible real world benefits.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it was a chip with a very large (128mb) l4 cache intended to boost the igpu..  but it ended up boosting the cpu in games (with a regular gpu) a lot.,"so if you go look at a review like techreport - the 5775c was faster than 6700k at games, despite being an older architecture clocked 500-700 mhz lower.","when 6700k (and zen 1/zen+) reviews came out, no one included the 5775c in their numbers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not so.,"if you're building a new rig on a budget, going with 13th gen intel is slightly better, if you want to build on a dead platform.","if you're willing to spend a bit more, then absolutely the best path is am5.","7600x now, but you'll eventually wind up with a 9600x or even a 9600x3d, and be competitive with probably intel 15th gen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i wasn't asking questions.,"the 5800x3d is the best cpu you can get right now for msfs, dcs and x-plane.",period.,12900k and even the 12900ks already cost more money than the 5800x3d and deliver less performance and less stable frame rates.,"the 5800x3d is even less demanding on ram and mainboard, so you can get a cheap mainboard and cheap budget ram and still outperform a very expensive 12900ks and probably also a 13900k rig.","needless to say that msfs, dcs and x-plane can't even make full use of a 12900k/13900k due to how simulators work.",a huge l3 cache on the other hand is something that every simulator software loves as it reduces the number of roundtrips to ram.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

strange how even on a newer motherboard itâ€™s happening aswell.,iâ€™m assuming itâ€™s related to the cpu since we have the came cpu.,but i seriously canâ€™t tell what it is exactly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
after a few hours of troubleshooting i believe i've found the cause for this problem (at least for me).,"in the bios setting for ""discrete thunderbolt configuration"", there is an option for ""dtbt go2sx command"", and it is enabled by default, when it is enabled, i was getting power stage transition errors with the pcie root port #5. i have disabled it and now the problem is no longer present.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

does your thunderbolt work?,"when the issue happens for me, my thunderbolt controller doesn't work, and the thunderbolt software don't show any thunderbolt ports present.","for me the root port was directly related to thunderbolt, which is why a thunderbolt power stage setting fixed it for me.",maybe it's a different device for you?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"no because windows isn't showing you the number of 'cores', its showing each 'thread'.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is a laptop you are talking about right ?,"if so, they tend to be relatively warm.",50 degrees are completely normal as well as some spikes to the 60/70.,thats because laptops tend to have small cooling solutions and try to stay in low rpm so its not so loud.,you could ramp up the fan curve.,but you will probably hear a difference in noise.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, it's a laptop.","i ran the same test on an older version, and it didn't get that hot at all.",now it is 50-55 degrees.,"i am able to understand that, but over 70 degrees when i'm not doing anything at all.","when i run htop to show what i'm using system resources, it shows that i'm only using 2-5 percent of the cpu.","at 2-5 percent, it shouldn't get hot at all.",right now it feels like i have a bowl of boiling water on my lap.,does that mean it's normal?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok on complete idle 70 degrees is a completly different story.,that sounds more like a cooling problem.,i assume theres nothing blocking the fan in-and output ?,therefore my guess would be that there is something wrong with the contact of the heatsink/pipe and the cpu.,"of course, you can try to look up some rewievs of that exact laptop model and check if thats an overall thing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it seems you're very gpu bound at 3440x1440.,running ray tracing on ultra will have a huge impact on a amd 6000 card specially when no fsr is used.,which is why your avg fps was 38.also from what i've heard unless it's been fixed for intel 12th and 13th it's suggested to use windows 11 since it has the scheduler built for it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dont worry about it.,windows is misreporting to most software core utilization/cpu usage.,if you really want to see use afterburner as they updated to use another sensor to combat it until microsoft fixes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am running windows 11 22h2.,"my frames increase when i turn down settings to very high without ray tracing 
with a avarage of 107

yea it weirdly does say that.,"gou usage on low setting @3440x1440 is 90 %

pretty crazy 1 p core is doing so well as even with those settings that's almost still a gpu bottle neck.,if i had the game i'd give it a try on my amd system to see if it's just some intel scheduler bug or something,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there is now way some setting in xtu or the bios is wrong?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
updated yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
does the low cpu usage also happen in game?,i can't really find anyone else having single core cpu usage on a quick google.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm now playing @ rsr 1080p upscaled at very high settings with medium raytracing

hmm you could try download hwinfo and see what it reports.,from watch dogs 1 and 2 it would not surprise me if this game had similar wonky cpu usage.,both of those games for some people had normal cpu usage and others had similar one core.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if you are looking for gaming i would say its not that good, but if you want for some normal stuff say browsing, office work, watch some movies etc, its quite godd.",however there are many good processors out there.,maybe try those,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i've been on a i7-8700 with a 1080 ti for about 4 years now, running a 1440p 120hz monitor, only a couple games give any trouble and thats only if i put the settings to max as well.","it's windows 11 eligible, so it's still a useful functioning processor.","&#x200b;

but with that said, i also am going to upgrade to a 12700k system shortly, but thats mostly because i got bit by the upgrade bug.","&#x200b;

if you are currently on a i7-8700, you can choose to wait longer, if you are deciding between a 8700 and something else to upgrade to, the 12th gen intel cpu's have improved single thread performance, which is want games generally want the most of.","&#x200b;

you could also wait 2-4 months for 13th gen ""raptor lake"" to come out, which will push down prices on older cpus as a byproduct.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well since 2018 i have a i7-8700 non k and it's still holding strong (paired with a 3070ti) 

there is definnetly betters cpus but it's still oretty good",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just a little over 2 months ago i picked up a used  i7-8700 non k and asus rog strix z390-e motherboard for just $50 dollars locally.,before that i was using an amd fx8320 for nearly a decade.,once i got the i7-8700 non k up and running.,i ended up selling my old amd fx8320 and motherboard for $40 dollars.,"lol

so in the end the  i7-8700 non k and asus rog strix z390-e motherboard only costed me $10 dollars.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s not good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a 4770k can get you great performance, an 8700 is fine",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sorry i meant can you game on it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"im trying to find 8700 or 9700f used, but seems like no one has it in india (if available its overpriced like 250$+)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you on drugs?,the 8700k for browsing and movies?,it is still more than capable to handle 1440p with a good card.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"tf, how do u get it so cheap",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wouldn't call a 4770k performance in games great.,"i'm not saying its bad, but the word great i would limit to 5600x level of performance or better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my wife has an 8700 with rtx 3060 ti and it rocks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no it will explode,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well it really depends on the game and what performance you find acceptable, but an 8700 should be decent for gaming.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
alright thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes but even an i3-12100f will beat it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah you can game ez on it.,i just finally upgraded from i56600k.,i was playing cpu intensive games with multiple browsers/ discord and during big group raids and a lot of projected texture/ detail it was struggling and sometimes stuttering as iâ€™m guessing it was my 1% lows.,i just got 12600k and man i went from graphics setting 1 to about mid and will test more as itâ€™s definitely more capable.,i am running 1440p and 1080ti,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my 5820k oc'd performs very similar to a stock 8700. i game on it daily, with a 3070 ti.","this is about the limit of the cpu, as it bottlenecks a few games (whereas the gpu is usually the bottleneck, while gaming).","your 8700 should be fine, so long as it's not running at it's base clock the entire time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's not like there's a timer on it which will prevent you from running software you once had,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you can still game on a stock 8400... not as well as on a 12900k at 5.2ghz, but it still works...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on the gpu you have and the games you play.,"if you are pairing it with a 3070 or better, even at 1440p you should upgrade.","if you are playing at 1080p, play esports titles or sim games, you should upgrade.",there are monumental gains in 1% lows to be had moving to a modern cpu and decent avg fps gains.,moving from 8th gen to 12th gen is like +60% st and +150% mt.,there have also been vulnerabilities that have been fixed in hardware mitigations.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cause the person i bought it from.,disliked how hot it was running and they decided to go ryzen.,i offered them 50 bucks for cpu and motherboard at a as price.,they accepted it and i took it home.,got it running and it's been fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
let me also add that it completely depends on how cpu bound the game is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can't compare 12th gen to previous gens that's not fair.,i got to play around with a 12400kf in a friend's build and it felt quicker than my 9700k.,of course that's subjective and i didn't bench it or anything but still.,12th gen performance is awesome.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wouldn't recommend an i3!,thinking of getting an rtx 3070ti with an i9 eventually or i go with an rtx 4080 and just fully build a new pc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"holy sht, u got such a good deal, he/she will probably felt ""scammed"" when he knew the true price of this cpu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i wouldn't recommend the 3070 ti (literally just a 3070 but with extra power draw and slightly more performance for $100 more) or the i9 (whichever i9 it might be, older i9s are beaten by something like the i5-12600k and the i9-12900/13900 draw quite a lot of power and cost a lot + the i7-13700k and ryzen 7 7700x/ryzen 9 7900x exist)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they commented they will never build another intel system ever again.,i threw out the $50 dollar offer for both the cpu and mobo.,it was more or less a 'as is' type of a deal meaning if there was an issue with say the motherboard it would be on me at that point.,i was willing to take the gamble for $50 dollars and they took the offer.,i threw out the offer to see if it would stick and it did.,i been around computers my whole life been around them since commodore 64 days.,i'm capable of doing electronic repair and repaired a few motherboards in my lifetime.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i paid $140 for my 8700,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 7900 xtx is going to be a *way* better card than the 4080, z790 is a pointless chipset, the 980 pro is probably too expensive for what it offers, and the 13700k wonâ€™t get you noticeably more gaming performance over the 13600k, and will need much more cooling for heavy multi-core loads (the only loads in which it has a significant advantage).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"at that resolution you shouldn't really see any cpu bound scenario, such that both should game pretty identically 

gaming loads generally don't cause the highest cpu temperatures, so air is fine even at low res where things will be more cpu bound, but especially when gpu bound at high res, cpu utilization should be low.","13700k on air will be fine in games, but might struggle in production workloads.","there is nothing wrong with using it that way where it might throttle itself a little in those heavily multi-threaded loads, modern cpus handle that well.","or you can run a lower power limit like 180 or 200w, since that's near gaming peak draw in cpu bound games, and that will keep temps down in production workloads.",i run my 13700k with a 180w power limit even though i have an aio that can handle more.,temps stay lower in things like video processing and fans quieter.,cinebench r23 dropped from ~31k to ~27k.,"not the end of the world for me, i rarely use that kind of app anyway.","when i do, i hit go when i'm going to cook dinner or something.",i'm not sitting at the computer tapping my fingers on the desk.,i was perfectly fine with my old cpu in those workloads even though it took 3x longer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13700k is better.,"2 more p-cores, more cache, higher stock clocks.",cooling won't be an issue for either cpu during gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what did you go for in the end?,i am in the same position.,i have a silver arrow extreme cooler that i have been using for years and enjoy my silent gaming system.,i have a 13700k sitting here but in two minds to install it if it means my system is hot and loud.,i don't like the idea of power limiting the 13700k as then what was the point in buying it and not the 13600k?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13700k is noticeable better with high-end videocards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if money isnt an issue get the i7, the cooling shouldnt be a factor since it is not an i9.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""way better"" aka not better",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i haven't placed the order yet because i am waiting for the 7900xtx (the shop i am buying from does a 5% discount on everything but only for a complete build), but after a lot of research i have decided to settle for the 13600k.",there is no point to deal with air cooling the 13700k when at 1440p the difference in fps gain is less than 3% (and for half the games the reviewers use as benchmark it's 1% or no difference at all).,i would much rather have significantly lower temps for a negligible loss of performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, i got caught off guard here.","i still think the 7900 xtx is the better buy, but itâ€™s shocking how incomplete it is given its $999 price pointâ€¦ and really, every card so far this generation is a piece of shit, just like every card last generation.",how long will amd and nvidia get away with stagnation in the midrange?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

flip the front ones and the bottom to intake for better results,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
certainly not the lowest.,air needs a path through.,a setup like this will just suck air from the nearest crack instead of sucking from the other side of the case/intake,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can't just use that case as the baseline.,certainly no point setting the o11 like that anyway,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
flip the 3 vertical ones as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

check the bios to see if your motherboard is allowing unlimited power draw.,set pl1=pl2=250w should fix it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"its to do with the lite load setting in the bios, at stock mobo manufacturers are setting it too high.","msi boards set it to 12 while intel spec says it should be at 9.

on msi boards its called 'lite load' under advanced cpu configuration, on other brands its called ac_ll and dc_ll but i am unsure if its adjusted the same way.","on an msi board you can simply change it to 1, run cinebench to test for stability and performance degradation, if everything is fine leave it, if not try a higher value.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my 13900k hits 39.2k in cinebench.,i did replace the default ilm with a thermalright one and i'm using a corsair h170i aio and i've seen it's draw get as high as \~310w.,before i replaced the ilm the package was hitting 100 degrees right away now it takes about 1-2 minutes for 1 core to thermal throttle in cinebench.,doing a 10 min benchmark and about 1-2 cores throttle over the course of 10 minutes.,"replacing the default ilm has allowed the package temps to ""just"" stay below tjmax for me",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

its only drawing around 250w when it thermal throttles.,but i'll check it.,it's set to 253w,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it depends on the vrm quality and board.,for example my msi z790 carbon defaults to mode 9 but can run fine on mode 7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
set power plan to balanced.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is one click oc on in the bios?,make sure it's off.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
safe mode any different.,safe mode disables some programs.,look at settings > system > power & sleep > additional power settings > change plan settings > change advanced power settings > processor power management > minimum processor state,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you have any oc software installed that came with the board?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
isn't that the base clock for your chip?,"but, if you do want to go below 4.7ghz at idle, just undervolt.",and pick offset mode where you can pick your ghz to a lower speed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"tried, didn't change anything",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's disabled,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
minimum processor state is at 5%,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the board does have oc genie 4, but it's disabled",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
make sure something isn't actually utilizing the cpu.,it will only down clock at idle when there is no load.,"also, a lot of boards have factory overclocking enabled by default so it would be a good idea to check bios and make sure everything is set to intel default.",i'm not well versed in msi bios so i can't point you in the exact direction.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe power loss setting?,or memory training setting?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for some reason windows is misreporting cpu utilisation and so are most programs that use the same method.,msi afterburner is currently the only program iâ€™m aware of accurately reporting cpu usage in games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no it's not.,"windows (assuming you are looking at task manager) is giving the correct information, except it isn't giving you the details.",a 13700 has a total of 32 threads.,most games are not heavily multithreaded.,they will max out one or maybe a couple of cores (and usually not both threads of the same p core).,the others are mainly sitting idle.,"so when you compare the max cpu usage (all threads pegged at 100%) to what it uses for a game, then yes, the total cpu utilization will be what you see, around 10% or so.","if you really want to see what is going on, try using resource monitor or a 3rd party cpu monitor showing all the thread activity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok thatâ€™s a relief!,thank you for letting me know.,i also have a feeling that itâ€™s the latest windows 11 (22h2) update causing issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sorry but i dont believe you.,windows/programs are reporting 0-1% cpu usage in mw2 warzone.,which is cpu heavy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s why i suggested using msi afterburner because it shows all core usage correctly.,"if you use it along side hardware monitor or say hwinfo ( which i also run) and play a multi core title like cyberpunk, red dead 2 or plague tale requiem hwinfo and hardware monitor only show one core running under load but msi afterburner shows all the cores loading correctly and the correct total core load %

i found this out after i did a replay of cyberpunk almost a year later and didnâ€™t understand why hwinfo was suddenly telling me it was only using one core when in the past it used them all equally.",a quick google search pointed me toward the issue and that msi afterburner had been updated to utilize a different reporting method to resolve the issue,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think the advice you're getting here is nonsense.,low cpu usage when gpu bottlenecked is normal.,even more so when you have a lot of idle e cores that games don't use much of.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how would his 3070ti be a bottleneck?,the graphics card literally came out last year?,"i could see if he had a 12th gen or 13th gen intel chip with a 1080ti, but i'm confused on the use of the term of bottleneck .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

so can i ask a dumb question... will a 13th gen intel cpu that is alder lake (since 13600 and below are not actually raptor lake?),need a bios update also?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
msi b660 has support for 13 gen since july.,it just depends on your luck.,https://www.msi.com/motherboard/mag-b660m-mortar-wifi-ddr4/support,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am going through the same issue.,i found that the gigabyte aorus b660 master and pro ddr4 do support 13th gen and have the option of bios q-flash plus where you can update the bios without a cpu on board.,below is the manufacturer's cpu support list for your info.,it should be noted though that on pcpartpicker the mobo does not show up as compatible with 13th gen which may be due to an error on their side as the below list confirms the opposite.,hope this helps.,"https://www.gigabyte.com/motherboard/b660-aorus-master-ddr4-rev-10/support#support-cpu

edit: the 13th gen cpus show up in the list when viewing the above page in desktop view only.",mobile view is not updated yet it seems...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i recently bought an msi b660m mag mortar d4 wifi from amazon us, i contacted msi via e-mail providing them with the motherboard's serial number so they could tell me the bios version it came shipped with, it came with version .140, i had to take it to a shop to update the bios, the guy did 3 updates one by one until .170 which is where 13th gen is supported.","(i thought you could just update to the latest one in one go but apparently he said you have to do them one by one) but yeah, now it's ready for 13th gen.

my other option was the gigabyte b660m aorus pro ax ddr4 since it was matx too and had the q-flash option which allows you to flash bios without the need of having an older cpu, i just found the process finnicky and risky, especially since i live in the caribbean and rma or return/replacement is pretty much not an option right now due to very high ridiculous fees/prices for shipping to the us.",also if you search online there are not too many reviews of the gigabyte b660m matx compared to the msi b660m mag mortar which is considered by some as the best matx b660 board.,i still haven't build my upgrade pc with the i5-13600k but should be able to around the 10th of december when i get my new 850w psu that i ordered today.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
b660 might be on sale.,op might got a deal already.,there wonâ€™t be anything new for b760 worth paying premium for.,if you are looking for a 13600k or 13400 system b660 is enough,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when do you think b760 boards will come out?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice this is the board i am using now with a 12600k.,but i think i want a 13700k soon.,this 12600k is faster than my old 9700k but not as big a diff in fps as i was hoping for.,paired with a aorus waterforce xtreme wb 3080,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably same time non-k 13th gen comes out.,december if it copies the 2 months delay pattern of 12th gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
b760 is releasing in 2023 who's going to wait that long?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what version of driver are you using?,best solution in this case is to rollback to older version.,"or you can check if there is newer version that would fix this, there was new beta version released yesterday.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a core i5 1135g7 with intel iris xe graphics family with 8gb ram (7.8 usable),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i tried a rollback but the performance was terrible.,i suppose intel does it for it's users to update to newer versions.. driver version 27.20.100.8425 with rollback and version and the broken driver is 31.0.101.3959. and could i possibly have the link for the beta version i'm trying to find it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
after installing the broken version i also tried installing the ones recommended by the device manager display adapters and it just resets to the previous version.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can also use device manager to uninstall driver.,but this looks like more complicated issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tried that too..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a recommended driver 30.0.101.1404 but i can't seem to find it on the intel page,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok this is driver from march 2022. try to download from this url https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/19344/intel-graphics-windows-dch-drivers.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's the one i downloaded and was broken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"on the site you can download also older version, if 30.0.101.1404 is working try 30.0.101.1994",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
okay!,i'll give it a try,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"please take this with a grain of salt, hereâ€™s what fixed it for me.",this happened to me and i read in some forums that if you have a gpu and install the gpu graphics driver first then it can cause this.,doing ddu and then installing this is what made it work for me.,idk if itâ€™s some glitch or something,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you have a dedicated gpu?,is multi monitor enabled in bios?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because the install failed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
similar thing happened with my arc driver install yesterday.,"doing a ddu in safe mode fixed all my issues in one attempt, so i'd recommend starting with that.",just type ddu into google if you don't know what it is.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

was your cpu previously overclocked?,"that b365 board is fairly basic, and the chipset does not support overclocking.",that may account for some of the difference.,what speed is your memory?,was xmp previously enabled?,"this is another area where z390 allows xmp above the official rated speed for your cpu, if a fast kit is used - on the b365 board, your 8600k will be set to 2133mt by default, with xmp available up to the 8600k's officially rated speed of 2666mt (and no higher).",you can check your memory settings with cpu-z.,is the gpu in the slot nearest the cpu?,use a utility like gpu-z to verify that the rx580 is running at a full gen3x16.,"lastly, in your bios, take a look for any power limit fields that may be set lower than typical.","similarly, if you see that the cpu is manually set to, say, 3ghz, you can set it back to defaults (or auto).",use cpu-z to monitor the cpu speed or run a quick benchmark.,"as ahmedasah mentions, checking for the latest bios is also a good idea.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
update the bios ofc if that doesnt help just get a new motherboard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that motherboard they gave you is quite horrible.,it's possible you are running into power limits and or vrm thermal throttling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is your monitor plugged into your motherboard or the graphics card?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"also make sure monitor is wired to gpu, not igp.",just in case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's a low quality board but i doubt it would throttle an 8600k.,the stock clocks are basically a 10400 minus the hyper threading.,the chipset does limit its full potential but even the best vrms wouldn't help if it's arbitrarily locked.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
graphics card,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yep, great call.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the board has no vrm heatsinks there's a good chance it's either quite power limited or thermally.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"considering the price of motherboards and looking at it from an upgradability standpoint, i'd say an am4 cpu.","the older ones are pretty budget friendly to begin with, even more so if you buy used, that includes the 5000 series.",and the motherboards are plentiful and fairly cheap themselves.,"it all depends on your gpu really, look for a cpu in your comfortable budget, and then pair it to an equivalent gpu and see how well it can handle it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

how much are you looking to spend on a motherboard + cpu?,i ask because you could grab the ryzen 5500 for like $100 bucks right now (or a 5600x for $130) and a am4 mb for less than $100 (as low as $50 bucks).,either cpu would hold her over for a few years with the rx590 playing @ 1080/60.,that 590 is going to show its age and my advice would be to sell it (or keep it as a spare) and upgrade her to a rx 6600 (\~$225 for entry level ray tracing) and she'd be set for several years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on what is on your used market.,"old cpus donâ€™t stay in production, so itâ€™s not like you can go on amazon and pick up an 8th gen or something for cheap.",however if thereâ€™s used stuff or a thrift shop nearbyâ€¦ then you should see what they have and then do some research on the ones you see within your budget.,thereâ€™s no point in us listing cpus if we donâ€™t know what you have access to.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7700k.,"has avx2, competitive clock rate/great overclockers, ya more ipc than haswell and sandy bridge in practice.",itâ€™ll really help keep minimum frame rates & dropped frames down.,i7-8700k / 8086k would be more ideal now a days tho.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
v3 xeon's do really well plus you can buy a really cheap motherboard with it.,combined should all be under 100 i think.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have a rx590 from my old build so i am just trying to build a second working computer around it as cheap as possible for my wife.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am looking for an average 60fps medium settings at 1080p.,i think it shouldnt be too costly to achieve.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would love to splash out on all of that but as it stands right now we don't have a ton of time for gaming so i'd rather not spend a ton on it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wanted it to be 100$ or less.,i will save money for a new rig probably 5 or 6 years from now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean i have ebay and other online second hand stuff.,"i can get a i52500k, ram , and mobo combo for like 50 bucks but i don't really know if it's worth it realistically",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i guess what i am looking for is a starting point to start researching whats available.,there's  13 generations.,so basically whats the earliest viable generation for 2022 in 1080p.,i figured someone in this sub would still be running some older hardware and be able to enlighten me with their experiences.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's what i like to see !,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maaan my i7 7700k is crying in the corner rn.,i'm upgrading next year!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a 9700k and 3080 and the 9700k runs super well.,i think 9700k would be overkill for their purposes and more so even a 9900k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™d say itâ€™s the cut off almost,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"amd am4 motherboards as i mentioned are usually cheaper, and based on userbenchmark, taken with a grain of salt, the rx590 is about on par if a little worse than an rtx 3050, i would suggest a ryzen 5 5500, 5600g, or 5600, doesn't have to be x. the 5550 is just a lower binned 5600g with a disabled igpu, only about $100 brand new and should handle stuff just fine

edit) doesn't have to be one of the newer gen cpus, i just figure at that price point might as well",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sure but 1080p / 60 is very different on something like lol or overwatch compared to like cyberpunk or far cry 6.

https://www.techspot.com/review/2409-intel-core-i3-12100f/

check 10100f... r6 and f1 it's well over 100fps 1% lows, but cyberpunk and far cry 6 are struggling to maintain 1% low over 60.  so people are asking what kinds of games.","if it's competitive games that run on a potato (r6, cs:go, lol, etc...) you can probably get an old 4770k or something and be alright.","if it's modern console port style single player games like assassin's creed games or showcase aaa pc games, well a 4770k probably doesn't cut it and you'll have to step up to a 10100f, r5 3600 or 12100f.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would just do the ryzen 5500 + mb then... it'll run you about 150 bucks and you can always upgrade the video card later.,:),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you'll have to get atleast a hyper threaded i7.,smth like 2600k with fast ddr3 kit.,goodoldgamer and icebergtech have recent and good quality videos about older platforms.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
really depends on the game too how much it stresses the cpu.,something like deep rock galactic is easy to run.,i wouldn't go lower than 4770k if possible to guarantee larger amount of games that will run well.,maybe some am4 mobo would make sense if you drop a much newer cpu in it later?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that was my last cpu/gpu combo.,ran it at 5.1ghz all core on a 360 aio.,"when i started playing warzone two years ago, i noticed almost constant stutters when running disco and warzone.",upgraded to a 5900x and stutters went away.,"warzone is quite cpu intensive though, so ymmv depending on the titles you play.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hmm if i go that route i might as well upgrade my current build further and use even more left over parts for the new build.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"never use userbenchmark site, it is so biased towards intel and put amd down regardless if amd cpu/gpu are faster than nvidia/intel (cpu).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

trueeee but what resolution and frame rate were you playing at?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as long as you have the money to spare and want/need an upgrade that wouldn't hurt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rocket league runs on a potato and should be fine on a 4770/90k.,"warzone is pretty cpu dependent, but older cpu like 4770/90k may be okay for 60 fps 1% lows.","may not too, i'd think that would be close.","i'd shoot for a 4770k used or a 10100f new, perhaps with a used mobo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1440p at 130 to 150.  dlss set to quality, everything else maxed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah had pretty much the same too but then i did some research and apparently one of the youtubers who test settings basically showed dlss doesnâ€™t really boost your frames and thereâ€™s no point in using at all.,i got some settings that stayed steady from 155-165 fps ish.,a newer cpu though would definitely be better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

get the msi pro z690-a as others have said.,by far the best ddr4 board considering its price point and its capabilities.,as long as your cpu has decent imc it can easily do 4000-4133 cl15 (given you have b-die memory sticks) but even if you don't plan to oc your ram it's still the best bang for your buck board you can get.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"12600k would be fine with the z690-a from msi 

z690-p from asus would be good too

if theyâ€™re just gonna be running stock yeah the 12700k would be fine as well",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that msi board is the cheapest z690 board and it does pretty much everything most users actually use.,you can see the prices on asus tuf gaming board too.,that goes on sale too and it becomes close in price but not regularly.,msi z690 pro is cheaper than a lot of b boards.,"if you want to spend more for more i/o, there is tomahawk but its not worth it imo when its not much cheaper than mpg force which is pretty much a high end board maxing out the platform.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have my msi pro z690-a ddr4 since february and haven't gotten any issues whatsoever.,"i bought it for just under 200â‚¬

go ahead, buy the msi, you won't regret anything",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends of course on money but in the end i went with the asus strix-d4 and more than impressed with the performance and connectivity options.,vrms are great and pushes my 12700k to 5.2ghz with a low vcore...but it is a bit pricey.,luckily i got a rebate offer at launch.,the msi z690-a is also a great cost effective option and the asus tuf model is not bad either...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have the msi and it the best bang for the buck and is recommended everywhere.,it was even recommended by gamerâ€™s nexus and it is rock stable.,iâ€™ve seen tests where they use for a 12900k without any overheating issues,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hey!,thanks for letting me know.,i didn't get my processors received just yet.,will definitely do this the way you mentioned here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

further (and evenly!!!),tighten contact frame.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the contact frames can definitely cause issues with the cpu contact in the socket.,i'd pull it back off and do a careful crisscross tightening pattern.,turn the screws just 1/4 turn each time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don't over tighten the contact frame.,too tight can cause issues.,want to stop when the pins stop bending and you touch the mainboard.,it's a sudden wall of resistance.,so not tight just snug?,tight you crush stuff.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you all for you help.,it was a mounting problem.,but i'm most certain that not from the thermaright frame.,"that thing is almost fool proof, as tested by igor labs.",and i did not over tighten it.,the ek lga 1700 frame was the culprit.,there are many  air or aio coolers that you can tight the screws till the end.,not this one.,and also i did not over tighten it ( that's what i thought ).,i had to try by trial and error the best tension.,"that's not the best approach for a cooling mounting system ....

now you are also making me think about this tighten contact frame of the aio as another possible reason... could be it in my case?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
old kits or just a bad/mid-tier bin.,3600cl14 is high bin.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"that's a pretty low end cooler, you could easily swap it out to a single tower cooler for not much money.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you forgot to remove the foil on the cpu cooler?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the lazy way to fix this is simply go into the asus bios and enable multicore enhancement.,this is enabled by default on their maximus line but i guess not on the strix?,also are you on the latest bios?,if not update to that then enabled multicore enhancement and xmp i. set your fans and you should be good to go.,all multicore enhancement does today is set long and short term power limits to 4095. you can also do this manually if you wish.,i would also max out the cpu current limit.,all of this can be found in the extreme tweaker tab.,also get rid of intel xtu or any other overclocking software.,do your long term overclocks in the bios.,if you want to do a bit of real time tweaking then get the latest version of turbov.,can probably find this on overclockers.net forums under intel motherboards â€” z790 posts for asus should have software links to 13th gen compatible software.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yes, 11th gen is comparatively weak and hot vs 12&13 gen cpus.","i have a feeling that prebuilt companies are trying to dump stock, but i havenâ€™t checked the prices theyâ€™re asking yet.","the absolute minimum you should think of is a 12400f on the current socket, which i think is lga1700?","only 12th and 13th gen cpus will work on those motherboards/sockets, but the performance jump is worth it alone.","also, anyway you can work your way up to like a 3060 ti?","better value, if you can find it at msrp",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

optane ran for years though.,ultimately it could die off but if they follow in the same footsteps of optane it will be years until it's dead.,but optane was killed off by lower prices by the competition for a superior product.,if the next gen amd and nvidia gpu's are that much better and the supply can be met then intel may have some issues.,when intel fixes their drivers i believe it will hit the competition a bit and we have to see where it goes from there.,i will say the arc a380 for rendering out av1 codec video it spanks my 3070ti for a fraction of the cost and is competitive for performance of h.264/265 and way cheaper than the competition.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what are you smoking?,don't tell me this is some nonsense linus came up with.,">up until recently, intel marketed optane, kept showing off new reasons why optane is going to be awesome in the future.",the marketing didn't stop until the day they announced the cancellation publicly.,optane was effectively dead when they stopped working on a next generation.,they were very clear on canceling products since their consumer effort failed a few years back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we just have to wait and see.,they just released oem workstation cards so why bother if they gave up already?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we do just have to wait and see how it plays out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if the drivers were stable and it worked with my oculus i probably would have kept it installed instead of my 3070ti as i do a lot of video editing and it's way faster using av1.,we will have to wait and see what next gen gpu's will be able to do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"used mining gpu from nvidia and amd, plus unsold ampere stocks will stop arc cold.",and new gpu from amd and nvidia will take attention away from intel arc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for certain markets, probably but for video editing and production of the next gen competition doesn't step up their game then intel is the only one with the product that many will buy.",think about it if it was $599 for an intel gpu that was faster at video editing than a competitor who charges $1200+ for similar performance editing studios would exclusively use intel arc.,"they could spend more on disk subsystems, networking, ram and even processors.","also for servers netflix, hulu, etc.",would also upgrade to intel cards if they outperformed the existing nvidia gpu's.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for professional environment, stability and familiarity is important, some place might try testing out intel arc, but they won't make full commitment.","this will take years for a place to switch over, if intel arc was clearly the better product, and i highly doubt nvidia/amd would give up competing in this segment.","(for example, just look at how many year for amd to gain 20% server marketshare, when they clearly had vastly better server cpu since zen 2 rome)

&#x200b;

for you average user, they can always pick up used cards.",and you are making an assumption nvidia/amd doesn't make productivity improvement for their next gen product that could surpass intel arc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

did not appear to be using hardware decoding & hevc does seem to be decoded in hardware on vlc.,there is no option to toggle hardware decoding but hevc was using hardware decoder but av1 was not it appeared as the windows task manager showed decoder activity only on hevc.,av1 does show some gpu usage but no decoder activity.,it does show decoder activity with hevc though so if it had the av1 decode capability i am sure it would use it but it doesn't.,hand brake has option for hardware decoding.,i turned it on & still no hardware decoding of av1 video.,correction setting for hardware decoding av1 working now with hand brake now.,just had to find correct setting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i was using a very high compression setting shrinking it down from over 53gb to just over 3.8gb.,"this is a 13.9 times reduction while maintaining same resolution & for most part looks identical to original, even on my 4k hdr600 monitor.",at that compression it takes a lot to reconstruct image on cpu but the igpu handles it beautifully when using gp-gpu decoding.,very little cpu usage compared to close to 50% cpu usage when performed mostly on cpu.,av1 is known to have huge cpu software decoding/encoding stress.,my cpu did handle the cpu software encode ok as the file played great on the 11700k when using the igpu gp-gpu software decoding found to be available in new vlc 4.0 beta program.,still not hardware decoding but much better than cpu software decoding.,note that on my samsung galaxy a53 the movie played but it was so stuttery with dropped frames it was unwatchable on vlc for android.,1080p av1-10bit worked ok on phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm surprised you're even getting 50% cpu usage in the 1st place decoding a 4k24 av1 4:2:0 10-bit file that i assume doesn't have grain synthesis.,can i know what encoder you used as well?,"aomenc-av1, aom-av1-psy(a fork of aomenc-av1), svt-av1 or rav1e?","furthermore, vlc 4.0 does not have any gpu compute accelerated decode path.","if you were to use git vlc 4.0 with libplacebo or mpv gpu-next, you could get gpu accelerated grain synthesis, but it wouldn't accelerate anything else otherwise.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 i was using av1-svt 10 bit.,the evidence appears that gpu acceleration of decode was indeed present as 3d gpu usage went up at same time cpu usage went way down.,"i downloaded latest version of vlc beta 4.0. on vlc 3.18 the cpu usage was much higher & gpu usage much lower suggesting gpu accelerated decoding on vlc 4.0 & not on 3.18. that combined with now near perfect playback without evidence of lost frames or stutters i was getting on vlc 3.18.

av1-svt is a upposed to be the fastest av1 encoder capable of real time encoding speed or better & i can say for most part that is true except where high motion can bog speeds down slightly lower than real-time.",for most part remained around 30 fps which is faster than the original 24 fps.,"encoding was done on latest version nightly build of hand brake which offers av1-svt & av1-svt 10 bit which i used for my transcoding experiments

on further examination i found a graph that displays gpu compute usage & you are correct in that vlc 4.0 does not support gpu compute as there is no activity on that graph but the gpu is still heavily involved in the decoding process with vlc 4.0. not sure what api is being used as such but performance is drastically improved in vlc 4.0 for av1 playback.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

soo ?,"i guess i donâ€™t know how to read temps

also .,thanks for being a dbag man .,appreciate it .,â€œnot knowing how to interpret dataâ€.. â€œnothingâ€ .. yah well cpus arenâ€™t suppose to run at 92c with 3% load .. instead of helping me find a solution or asking probing questions about the temp spikes or informing me that all that data is normal or abnormal .,what a great guy .,kinda sad people up voted you .,donâ€™t worry tho .,we got it figured out .. simple bios setting change,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

delete icue trash and download hwinfo64.,your temps are high because motherboards set the lite load too high at stock.,"first thing you need is an accurate reading of vcore, nothing you can do to confirm unless you use hwinfo64.",then check load voltage at 'stock bios'.,then look for 'lite load' option in bios (non msi boards might have a different name).,reduce that value to 1 then go look at your vcore under load again.,"yes this is all dumb and confusing for pc newbs, blame asus / msi / gigatrash for running out of spec excessive voltage at 'stock' settings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

secondly, all the 13th gen k chips use the same chip, with various parts fused off for the core counts.","generally intel bin the chips, so ones with weak or dysfunctional cores have those disabled for the lower ones, also any chip that can't do 13900k spec becomes 13700k, and chips that can't do that become a 13600k.","but now if a chip has a faulty igpu, it automatically becomes a kf, regardless of how good the cores are, so with kf there is a small extra chance of getting magic cores on a chip that simply had a faulty igpu so it might not have been core binned.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

but 13500 have c0 stepping so it is alder?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just to correct a few thingsâ€¦on desktop at least, all of the 13xxx cpus are raptor lake and the 12xxx cpus are alder lake.","(eg 13th gen and 12th gen, respectively.)","the stepping of a chip (b0, c0) is a revision of a given chip and doesnâ€™t show which cpu generation it is.","later, once the 13400k, etc are added to intelâ€™s ark.intel.com website, people can look for the string â€œproducts formerly alder lakeâ€ or â€œâ€¦raptor lakeâ€ for another indication which cpu generation it is.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh i am still incredibly happy with it!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12600k was also â‚¬100 cheaper.,"i didnt felt confortable with it, in games was not even close to 150w and was at 80-90 degrees, meanwhile the 12600k sits at 60-65 leaving room for oc if i want.","all of this with the same cooler (fuma 2)

also, unless you have a rtx 4090 i bet you couldnt tell any difference between 13600k and 12600k.","for people who use rtx 3070 or 3080 at 1440p144hz, there will be zero difference.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then it is of little importance if its raptor lake or alder lake for you then.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your post would have corrected something if it at least mentioned the real difference in nomenclature which is raptor cove vs golden cove p cores.,"so when a person like the original poster is asking ""is 13400 raptor lake or alder lake?""",they refer to this specifically.,"yes, intel can ship netburst cores in lga1700 and call it raptor lake, no, most of  us will still call those cores netburst.","people are using the generation name as a shortcut to refer to these 2 names, because we cant bother remembering the 3957 different names intel gives to their products.","people want just to know if their cpu will be a rehash of a previous one or not, which was what was asked.","and yes, c0 vs b0 matters because we know for certain c0 stepping is a 6p/4e die using golden cove cores as p cores (the same die used in 12600k and some 12400s).","b0 is the 6p/8e die using raptor cove cores for p cores, and the one consumers should teally look for when checking what stepping 13400/13500 are.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is but 13400 if it was raptor lake i'd definitely pick that.,just not interested in anything higher.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"since the tested chip the article refers to is apparently a c0, with the last sentence do you mean that 13400 cpus that will hit the market could still be b0?",(i'm pretty ignorant on this topic),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hi there.,i just got mine from corsair direct site.,i ordered 2 sets on 2 different occasions.,it usually takes about 3-4 days to arrive as they ship from holland.,you can find them on ebay from time to time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
corsair site currently out of stock and ebay all ships from china unfortunately.,killer thing at the moment is its the last thing i need for my build to be complete and the wait time could be 2-4 weeks just for screws!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
funny you should say that i had to buy two sets for the h150i as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i was going to snag one for a 13600k but have been reading interesting reports when using noctua air coolers.,"with their convex base they seem to make better contact, thus not resulting in big differences frame vs no frame.",any thoughts?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is this contact frame thing for aio or for air coolers too?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
anyone have thoughts on thermal grizzly vs thermalright?,iâ€™ve been trying to find any evidence to justify thermal grizzlyâ€™s price but i canâ€™t find any to suggest itâ€™s better than thermalright.,thoughts?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i installed the thermalright bracket for my 13700k today.,temp dropped between 7-10c.,hovering from 90-92c to 80-83c.,using nh-d15.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, because i shouldn't have to... though i might at some point.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

can someone link directly to the two contact frame options for 13th gen?,"thanks

edit: nm found it on amazon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i use thermal grizzly contact frame with my 13700k, i saw about 7-9c difference.","as i said in another post, if you are not pairing your 13th gen processor with a contact frame then you are failing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 no contact frame but i am using a metal back-plate brace typically used for water cooling setups and previously used by intel in the past for other sockets with arm retention mechanisms.,it's not a part shipped these days with a motherboard but they are obtainable just like a contact frame and preform the same function in reality.,"i have a thermal grizzly contact frame i purchased w/ kryo paste but when switching over to the 13700k from 12700k i noted the back-plate was keeping everything aligned and without bends or torquing so i decided not to mess with it and keep it as it is..

yes i'm using thermalright's contact frame for 13900k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
does anyone know if the thermalright fits onto the acrylic lapping guide derbauer sells?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

wait you guys use contact frames?,"i have neither, just the aio tight down over the cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™m using the grizzly contact frame on 13900k and it was a little rough getting all the screws, but itâ€™s all intact and giving me good temps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, using the thermalright contact frame with a 13900k.",there was no drop in temperatures for me from using the stock solution with a msi 360 aio.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
curious if anyone has tried the more complex ones?,"like the elecgear on amazon, it has additional parts like the gasket and wonder if this makes any more difference",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got the thermalright for a 13700k.,"installed it with the cpu, so not sure of the benefit, but it was 10$ and the cpu is running pretty cool so i'd recommend.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you need a contact frame if your cooler had a lga1700 mounting bracket?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
unfortunately with a 13900k/liquid freezer ii 360 i saw no improvement.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can you install the thermaltake frame with the motherboard installed?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s not needed on the 13900k and z790 boards.,does nothing.,they fixed the issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
100% it's basically a required upgrade for any k cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i appreciate all the responses.,i have ordered the tg frame and will go for it.,one final question though.,has anyone had issues mounting your coolers backplate and ultimately the cooler itself while using a contact frame?,i found a couple of users reporting this problem while scouring the net for info about the frame.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my problem is that i could only get the screws opposite to each other to screw in!,idk why?,but my temps are still better then before,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for response.,yes 8 degrees is worth it.,iâ€™m thinking i should prob get one ordered.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how was the installation of the contact frame for you?,"i tried to install it today on my 13900kf, asus z790 maximus hero, and eventually gave up.",i found the frame rocked back and forward lengthwise which prevented it from actually screwing into the backplate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what mobo?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what mobo?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah i'm getting the deepcool ak620 which also has a convex base, iirc jesus steve mentioned something along the lines of the frame at least not being as relevant",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™m running a 13600k and an ak620, which also has a convex plate.",i actually saw temps drop anywhere from  4-6 degrees when using the tg contact frame.,edit: will most likely vary from mobo to mobo though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
both.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the stock contact frame is that tension rod thingy, the reason why people use these new ones is because the stock configuration doesnâ€™t apply even pressure, so either cooler doesnâ€™t work as well as it would if the cpu was flat.",seems to be worth it to lower your cpu temps a few degrees,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the contact frame is a replacement for the stock ilm (the thing on the motherboard that holds your cpu in the socket that has the little lever).,"the reason people use it instead is the stock ilm doesn't apply even pressure to the cpu, so your cooler's cold plate gets less direct contact due to the imperfect pressure by the ilm.",these contact frames amend it by having pressure on all sides of the cpu heatspreader.,it works for both air and aio coolers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tg is made in germany with high labor costs.,tr is made in china.,i'd have gone tg if i could have found one for normal price just to support them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"interesting, i've seen people who say that for noctua coolers it won't be much of a difference because of their convex base.",do you think the nh-u12a will also get similar results?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well shit, my 13900k with unlimited power setting (+300w), gets 40500 points from cinebench, it hits max 94c with 360m aio, without using contact frame.",so contact frame isnt a must for every scenario..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
today i learned iâ€™m a frameless failure with my 13900k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have this combo and have uneven temp â€¦ 4-8 p core high temps 1-3 low and good, iâ€™m pretty sure i dident install perfect straight due to installation issues .. i have ek-quantum magnitude and tg contact frame â€¦ problem was the stud for the cooler in the corner where the vrm is i couldnâ€™t tighten it with fingers enough and rest 3 were tighten more than the 1 faster , so iâ€™m gonna reseat it iâ€™m the coming days with premium paste but basically half cpu high temps t",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that one looks like a total nightmare - if it's the one i'm thinking of it uses liquid metal and aims to create a seal, a bit like the ps5 cooling solution.",seemed way too risky/complex to me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the frame is a totally different thing.,whether or not you need it is up to you.,go to youtube and watch gamerznexus video on the frames and youâ€™ll get a better picture of what they do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,although probably possible you could very easily damage something like your socket pins if you try and install the frame on a mounted mobo.,"the frame should be installed when you are first building your pc and are ready to install
your cpu and cooler.",way easier.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you have evidence of this?,i've got a z790 board and a 13900k and have been debating installing one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,intel released a statement that doesnâ€™t actually acknowledge the issue and says their procs are running within spec on z790 boards.,they did not fix the issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have the cheaper thermalright, and that is very straightforward as it makes direct contact with the mobo.","the tg version however does not, hence it is possible to overtighten and damage the pins.","gn has a great segment on both frames, incl.",installation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i used one for the first time while installing the block for a custom loop - only real advice is to have the cpu installed using the stock ilm, remove the stock ilm, and install the contact frame.","using the thermalright one, had no (more) issues that normal, with an ek magnitude block.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the plate moves around.,you're supposed to drop it fully in place and then secure all 4. starting diagonally.,otherwise there's no point in using it as it'll be uneven.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you watch the gamersnexus video on it, theres a section where someone shows you how to install it correctly because the instructions it comes with is really vague.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you have experience with some high end cpu or full monoblocks with the easy mount backplate for a simple example, then this will make sense, but it's not difficult, but likely there is that ah ha moment.","i have 13900k and for sure i need to get one of these plates asap, i also plan to go with delid and direct-die liquid metal as i managed to score a killer sample on my 1st try!","back to the subject though, i have changed many contact plates on servers low end to super high end boards, though never for this reason, so i'm confident this will apply...

ok so what most people do even if they know you must do it diagnol to screw it in, its not quite that simple.. although i do own a .06nm torque driver which will be helpful but same as with backplates, just because you place screws in diagnol does not mean you can do it in 2 tries per screw... patience... get it on there and do not come close to your final tightening until the very end, i make about 10-15 rounds on each screw like 1 revolution or a half of one diagnol, repeat.","this way it will be even and you can adjust it on its way down and will be loose at first but when you get to that final point and its lined up properly you simply tighten the first one to the fullest and diagnol with the torque driver its like slight movement and then click, across, slight 1/5 turn click, and so forth, this method takes an extra 4 minutes and saves hours of unneeded headaches or potential damage..

when i swap cpu's or add a block for a build for a customer or my own pretty much monthly i learned from my neighbor who is electrical engeneer and super smart, he doesn't do much with computers but still knows all about them, and his friends all play with ln2 and even liquid helium.. they work at a nucluear plant so im sure tools and space is easy to come by as supplies!","the best tip i got from him though on mounting blocks was that his friends use a dental mirror, a two man job and apply super light amounts of paste on ihs when they use them, but they mount the blocks so even by using the dental mirror and some kind of borescope or something endoscope maybe, but they go around all sides and carefully view how high off the block each side is and also where the thermal paste is moving to first to counteract it.. they claim that alone makes an 8-10c minimum difference just on an aio over most peoples mounting... the magnification wouldnot  be needed but the mirror could also probably assist in this procedure!","i am about to order mine today and i can report better and shorter results...

that said, given i have experience should i go with the thermal grizzly or no?","i use their products proudly, but not too proud to find a plate that does the same job for much less money... no offense to steve from gn, i appreciate the fact he leaves nothing in the wind, and is very thourough just really tests things to their absolute fullest possible extent and i just have a hard time watching all that sometimes id like to see jay do a video on it, but hey, ill still check out steves videos  too... idk.. any input is appreciated if none i understand and i will manage, just thought id ask while tossing in my 9 cents.. lol.. sorry for the tldr..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i had no issues installing at all, following the gamers nexus video, there are multiple steps to making sure youâ€™re applying the right amount of force and applying it correctly.",did you install it with the mount for your water cooler or aio screwed in to hold the backplate stable while you installed the contact frame?,that was a huge help for me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had this same exact issue.,couldn't figure out the problem.,was never able to get more than 1 screw in.,"however, after pulling the cpu bracket screws out of my old z690 motherboard and swapping, all four screws seated on the first try.",i have absolutely no idea why this is.,"i compared the two different screws side-by-side under a magnifying glass, and theyvare the exact same size, length and pitch.","physics is just wack sometimes i guess

the silver plate behind the mobo ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you were paranoid of ruining the cpu like you said why wouldn't you get the thermal right?,it's way more user friendly to install and more safe than the thermal grizzly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i ended up getting the elecgear carbon 17xx contact frame.,absolutely works as expected as well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i didn't install with the aio backplate in place but realized that would help keep things in place.,it was all a bit nerve racking at the point at which it rocked as i didn't want to damage any equipment.,i'll try again in a few weeks once i snag an arctic lf ii and swap out my current corsair h150i.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i didn't install mine in the end, but what it came down to was the asus motherboard being a few microns thicker thus preventing the screws from grabbing the frame.","i'm wondering if the z690 screws are those few microns bigger, although you did say you'd inspected that.",how did it adjust your temps in the end?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

my temps dropped a fair bit too.,was able to run cinebench with a cold loop on my 360 aio with no thermal throttling.,"once my loop heated up though, was still hitting 100. i'm happy though.",that's a big improvement.,my temps were hitting high 70s when i was unlocking my fps limit in games like overwatch.,now they might peak there for a second but mostly stayed in the 60s.,big improvement to noise with less fan action as well.,could probably be even less aggressive with my fan curve now too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

so i re-did it today also the tg contact frame.,the screws are very short and can barely make contact and tighten.,but i used romans guide with two fingers and a quarter at the end.,then i used deluxe paste.,the tg red hydranaut or kryonaut i donâ€™t remember the name but the best under lm.,and the water block is a ek quantum magnitude d rgb so that so be top end combo.,this time iâ€™m sure it was mounted properly because the standoff was tight from first time.,i did notice that around 1/4 at the top cpu was not in contact and mostly only contact in the middle cpu where the die would be.,kind of like a â€œbarâ€ or line if you understand.,i know this water block is convex/concave?,(sorry my english) but i honestly donâ€™t know how itâ€™s supposed to cover the ihs.,anyway after redoing with voltage tweaks and enforce limits.,it has temps in check.,after 10 min cinebench r23 the max package was 94c.,but it still has uneven core temp.,the first 3 cores low and others higher and p core 5 highest 10c higher than p core 1 which is lowest.,i donâ€™t know if this is normal behavior or still bad contact?,3 p cores with 5 in lead kind of â€œruinâ€ overall temp.,they are still not red in hwinfo and under 95c.,i am considering trying the oem ilm.,i cannot find any info online with this water block and or contact frame with this cpu neither how the spread or â€œcoverageâ€œ is supposed to be with the water block.,in games the core temps are more or less the same.,i donâ€™t know if i should redo again â€¦ :-/ very expensive parts and annoying to take a part.,i really would like some feedback from other 13900k and water block owners and or tg contact frame on z790 hero,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

your data proves intel is super credible actually.","that is, once you make the same comparison that intel is claiming.",intel is claiming that an e-core has the same 1t ipc as skylake (10th gen).,"from your data, we don't want ht/2t, but rather the 1p comparison 1.85x, or **54.1%**.","i've grabbed some easily accessible public gb5 results to compare with:

**how would two threads running in smt on one p-core compare with the same two threads running on two e cores?","**

disregard cases where specific instruction sets like avx are supported differently between them.","i know there's really no such thing as ""generic"" code, but bear with me on this.","imagine that there is typical run-of-the-mill code in normal programs or games or what have you, and you can either run 8 threads of this on 4 p cores or those same 8 threads on 8 e cores.",what wins?,"what's got me thinking about this it something like amd with 12 p cores vs. intel with 8 p cores and 8 e cores, so both can run 24 threads at once.","the first 16 threads are running on p cores in both cases, but the remaining 8 threads would either be running on 4 p cores or 8 e cores.",it's that particular case that interests me the most in thinking about e cores vs. p cores.,"there are enough differences between amd and intel parts of current generations to make this less meaningful, so imagine instead something like a 13700k with its 8p/8e vs. a hypothetical 13750k with 12 p and no e cores.","assuming this hypothetical chip were possible, which would win?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

nope both are skylake.,"the 6th, 7, 8, 9th and 10th gen desktop processors are all literally skylake.",they are all the exact same uarch with the exact same ipc.,intel likes to overload their naming of uarch and product.,6th gen was skylake the uarch and skylake the product/code name.,7th gen was skylake uarch but kaby lake.,the naming convention made a lot more sense when intel was doing tick-tock.,"the uarch is sandy bridge, but two products sandybridge and ivybridge, with the later â€œtickâ€ being little more than a die shrink of the same cpu uarch.","the wells (haswell, broadwell), bridges (sandybridge, ivybridge, and lakes (skylake, kabyâ€¦) are the same uarch and core names respectively.","with the death of tick-tock, this naming convention has since changed, core uarchs are all â€œcovesâ€ and products names are now all â€œlakesâ€ and donâ€™t match starting with icelake 10th gen.

anyhow, this is why the e-cores are compared to â€œskylakeâ€ ipc as thatâ€™s the last desktop uarch intel sold (ignoring rocketlake which was terrible).",[intel roadmap source](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_intel_cpu_microarchitectures#roadmap),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>how would two threads running in smt on one p-core compare with the same two threads running on two e cores?,which is why i asked about the performance of two threads running on **two** e cores.,what i'd like to know is if one p core running two threads in smt will outperform the same two threads running on two e cores.,we all know that a single thread will run faster on the p core than that same thread will run on an e core.,"i'm asking because i'm assuming that the scheduler will attempt to run threads on p cores first, and only ""spill over"" into running threads on the e cores if the p cores are all busy.","i don't know this is the case, it's just an assumption.","if you've got a 13700k, for example, with 8 p cores and 8 e cores, if 8 busy threads are currently running on the p cores, what will be the performance difference if a 9th thread is scheduled onto a p core so that it's running two threads via smt, as opposed to if that 9th thread gets assigned to an e core instead, keeping the eight p cores running only one thread each?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"first of all, gaming temperature at 75-80c is nothing to be worried about, the 13600k is hot and a 240 aio will struggle to keep it under control.","for fine-tuning though:

1. yes, do play with lite load and not have it at default (mode 12) at least, start with mode 9 which seems to be intels recommendation, i have mine running mode 1 since i got it and it has been stable.","(from my observation, all lite load does is undervolting the vcore voltage, at mode 1 my cpu vcore is set to 1.225v)
2. under oc -> cpu cooler tuning: set to tower air cooling, this basically msi's easy way to change tdp, the default  ""water cooling"" has tdp at 4096w for some reason.","edit: changing lite load/undervolting will not decrease performance but it may cause instability and have you run into crashes, check out this video for some guidelines:

dumb question: is only z690 mother boards have the option to lower the tdp or other motherboard like the b660 can also lower the tdp setting?,i am planning to get a 13600k or 13700k but i am not interested in oc but would like the option to lower tdp if the cpu temp get too high constantly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
