awesome upgrade.,give that soldier a proper send off or second life in a second pc or donate to a family member?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
supposedly 13900ks hits 6ghz?,it would be kinda cool to go from a 4770k (4.0ghz) to a 9900k (5.0ghz) to a 13900ks (6.0ghz),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

nah i just went from 1080 ti to 4090 but still on my same 7700k build for now and honestly the 1080 ti was already being maxed out for me.,you would only maybe see gains in the 0.1% lows if you play these modern games that artificially inflate cpu usage with poor scaling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also considering the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"give it a couple of months, 13th gen will fall in price .",it is a much better choice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a 6700k (4.8 mhz oc) and do not plan to upgrade.,i just paired it with 3080ti and it is doing well.,just put the grunt work to gpu by gaming in 4k and you are good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
may i ask why only 110?,looking to upgrade with 3070ti and i5 9600k because of mw2.,goal is 140. are you cpu or gpu bound?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok thats crazy.,:d i am also on 8600k looking for an upgrade.,i bought 3070 ti on sale and i am feeling the system doesnt deliver as it should.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i used an asus z390 prime board with it.,i can't think of any problems i encountered off the top of my head though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so how big was the jump?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
even a 13900k doesn't heat up when idle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'd say that is a great upgrade for sure, one of the best options right now for performance/price but if you know how to do basic overclocking, a cheap z690 like the msi pro z690-a one would take you far",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah i had one and if overclocked to just 4.7 ghz on all cores (with delid for comfy temps), it was literally exactly the same performance as my 9900k while gaming !","so i wouldn't feel bad at all to use that even today for like, for like 1080p multiplayer gaming at 144 hz

this + 1080 ti was the best combo ever",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"> i just went from a 4670k to a 12600k

i picked up my 13900k yesterday, but still rocking the 4670k until the motherboard arrives.",is it everything you hoped it would be and more?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

is it really worth if you arenâ€™t also upgrading gpu?,iâ€™m still on my 4790k but donâ€™t want to upgrade now if i canâ€™t also get a deal on a gpu much better than my 1070,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
damn looking to go from devils canyon to 13600k myself soon.,can't wait to revitalize my 1080 gpu and see how much better it will run with a new cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm also thinking of switching from a 6700k to 13700k!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had a 1080 with the 6700k.,got a 3070 and saw very minimal gains as my cpu was at 100% constantly.,decided it was time to build a new system around the 3070. mw2 was the game that made me finally give in.,went from barely 50 fps in the beta at medium settings 1440p to maxed settings 1440p 110 fps consistently.,same gpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as a 6700k owner who just bought a 13700k the 6700k held up great until a couple years ago if you just play 1080p games and have a mid tier gpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™m still on ivy bridge i5, why replace what ainâ€™t broken, it opens browser just fine",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there's nothing wrong with the 6700k.,i've also got one and see no point in upgrading for at least a few years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you play at higher resolutions itâ€™s not a big deal.,played at 1440p with a 1080 so the cpu didnâ€™t have to work as hard at 1080p.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nothing wrong with it, iâ€™m still using a 4790k myself and though i will be upgrading soon to a 13700k or amd 7700x/7900x it is still powerful enough for most games and apps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea the 7700k era definitely did not last long.,"however as someone on the 7700k still, i feel it's held up great for gaming specifically despite being destroyed by these newer chips.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just got my z790 board today; cpu arrives in a few days.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
850w should be fine.,you might need to power limit your cpu just a little bit if you feel like you're going to use both it and your gpu at max load.,i got ddr5 because i'm going all out this build but from what i can tell it doesn't really affect performance that much.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you don't oc i think you'll be ok.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i do play at 4k, but i don't really have any benchmarks.","i got the 13900k for vrchat which is an extremely demanding game on everything, but especially cpu.",when in an instance with a lot of people your frames will tank with all the ik data and security checks.,so cpu does alot of heavy lifting.,"but no i haven't played dota 2 before, so i don't really have any benchmarks there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it was a huge up lift just to 12th gen for me man.,1% lows and frames rate better.,over all snappiness.,came from i79700f to i712700k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you play at 1440p+?,"if so, then it shouldn't matter much.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nah 9700 is still a beast, i would use it longer esp the fact that newer intel cpus in future will be mostly likely using a new mobo and you play at 1440p+ which is a lot more gpu limited.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is there a big difference 12 vs 13 (i7)?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
must have been my gigabytes board.. don't remember the exact model lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
haven't even built the system yet lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
overclocking stopped to be fun when the k cpu came.,"s939 was fun, 775 too, pinncle war s1366.","i donâ´t really see a point in pushing even more energy into the cpu as it allready uses, so i am more interrested in some voltage optimizing aka undervolting",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you win.,thatâ€™s a massive upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you won't know yourself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you will be amazed.,i hope your gpu is able to take it cause that's the bottlenecker now.,went from 6700k to 12900k.,my man it is a whole new world up here.,you will not regret anything,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm doing the same upgrade soon!,"4670k to 13600k, can't wait!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7700k?,to expensive to be worth it i guess?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i was pretty stubborn with it kind of hoping something major would go wrong with it so i could justify upgrading.,have given my brother the old setup now and hopefully it serves him well for abit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"games using less threads than you have, but pegging a single thread to 100%, will bottleneck you but something like msi afterburner is reporting total cpu usage, so it'll reflect something lower than 100%.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">4770k

if you see your cpu stuck at 12.5% usage it means you have 1 core 100% usage.",(100% divided by 8 cores = 12.5% per core.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean.... if u can't get a good deal on both at once no point passing up on one of them.,you definitely won't loose performance in the meantime till u upgrade both.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don't wait.,i upgraded the 3570k to a 12600k rocking the same 1070 gtx.,it transformed vr.,it's very nice always using 100% gpu.,finally the 10 series unleashed.,plus it's not just games.,"everything else is such a pleasure to use now, i open shit without thinking, lightroom minimize open a game who cares.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my original build was a 770 which died and i replaced with a 1660s 3 years ago or so.,i'm still at 1080p so it's doing the job for now.,will go for a 3080 and 1440p 144hz  when the prices are better here (aus).,your cpu might not be as much of a bottleneck as mine was but it's a night and day difference in normal use and gives me room to upgrade the gpu and make a nice and hopefully long lasting machine.,think i got nearly 8 years out the last setup bar the graphics card and a power supply.,"if i get the same out of the new build, i'll be stoked.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at some point it's definitely worth it.,with some games my cpu is bottlenecking my gpu like 40%.,having a better gpu wouldn't do you any good i that case.,i5 6400 and gtx 970 btw,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm still on a 4790k and 1070ti.,my plan is to upgrade my platform to 13600k in the next month then upgrade the gpu in the spring.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, it is worth upgrading.","especially from 4790k, you will see a noticeable difference going to 13th gen, even 12th or 11th i think.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, depending on the game.",when i upgraded from.,"4770 to a ryzen 1700, there was a big uplift in civ 4 and 6 turn times for example.",any games with single core or low threads can benefit.,flight simulator is another one.,iâ€™m now on a ryzen 3950x and can find single thread scenarios that bottleneck even with that.,also may benefit other uses.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i found a good deal on a used 3070 a few weeks ago.,saw minimal gains over my 1080 as even that was bottlenecked in some games by my cpu.,even at 1440p.,so now i have the full potential of the 3070 with my cpu barely getting to 40% utilization in most games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i am upgrading from a 7700k right now, but honestly it hardly feels like a must even with a 3080.
yes i know the limitations and whatnot, but it still doesn't feel like a big compromise.",it is in a stark contrast to how 4-core cpus are ridiculed as obsolete.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the world is a magical place full of people waiting to be offended by something.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"same boat as well, got everything at home except the freakin aio cooler :/",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea my thoughts too.,i can't think of any scenarios that will push my cpu and gpu to their max simultaneously.,i think i'll see how it goes and if i detect any instability i might throttle the cpu or get a new psu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i suare my audio sounds better codec?,and graphics looks cleaner?,idk call me crazy.,maybe placebo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m at 1440p yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13th gen is as good as 12900k .,"they have the same msrp (12700k and 13700k) so you are better off waiting, retailers are just profitting hard at the moment but it will pass",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"""why cant i hold all these frames?!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yep, there are cpu's with twice the performance for the same price.",doesn't make sense to buy it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what chip are you planning on going with?,i'm not decided yet as i plan to upgrade sometime early next year.,i was leaning 7700x personally but it's hard to recommend that at current prices when the 13600k is around now.,"i don't nitpick between benchmarks myself, i feel like most people will barely tell the difference between these chips as any of current gen chips will destroy the 7700k and would be a significant upgrade.",i feel like the 7700x will be dropping to 300$ when the 3dvcache models drop next year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you know some people might cringe at your love of electronics, but people capable of not being toxic af to anyone who dares to actually give a fuck about something in this world just sit back and say:

""fuck yeah that guy loves electronics.","nice.""","if only the dictators of the world obsessed more about cool-looking electronics than imposing their shitty vampiric power system on others, the world would hum merrily along into a cool sci-fi future instead of the bs we've gotta deal with.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think limiting power draw to max tdp on both is just the right way to go anyway.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hmmm if you need to upgrade i would go for  12600k instead.,you will save at least $300 on mobo and cpu.,since you game at 1440p.,between 12600k vs 13600k is about 15% at best difference at 1440p.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you have the patience of a god.,i couldn't wait if i was in that situation.,even w the old gpu (i'd oc if not already done) your pc will just move a lot faster.,gpu is really only noticeable during gaming or other professional things that i don't do.,godspeed to you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah you could probably buy a 12400f and a cheap ddr4 board for the same price as the 7700k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hwinfo or afterburner if you want to see a screen full of thread info in a game, itâ€™s too much for normal use but you can see",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to me it was an easy call to go with a 13600k.,"i can carry over my ddr4 kit and buy a dirt cheap b660 board that allows memory oc - it will be just fine for the next two years or so, later on i can upgrade to a by-then discounted z-board and far better (value) ddr5 ram vs current offerings to unlock extra performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the world is a magical place full of people waiting to be offended by something.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
will this mitigate overpowering without any cost to performance?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
?,they would need new mobo no matter what.,12600k vs 13600k isn't $300,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm running raptor lake now with my existing gpu.,you did not undersell this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's what i did.,came from 9th gen i7 to 12th gen i7 bring my ddr4 and may go ddr5 later.,may even get 13th gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sounds like a solid plan.,the 13600k is a monster for the price.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

limiting a 13700k or 13900k to about 150w pl1 and 125w pl2 (13900k) or 125w pl1 95w pl2 (13700k) will cap power at 150w or below without any performance cost to gaming.,gaming is almost entirely desensitized to power limits because you only need to power 30% of your cpu before amdahls law kicks in - gaming just isn't a very parallel task at heart - it's all about running a small part of your cpu at full power which can easily be done on a power budget.,"multithreaded performance is different because by default you actually do want to power all the silicon you have, but running the suggested settings would only drop performance by about 10%.","that last bit of performance, if your want it, is where you spend 150w more and power draw becomes ridiculous.",i don't think that's worth it.,"with a 150w power limit on the cpu, you have 700w left to power a 4090 and the rest of the system.","power limiting the 4090 to 80% would make it draw less than 350w at the cost of like 7,5% performance.","the only annoying part about power limiting the 4090 is that msi afterburner doesn't seem to auto apply my profile at startup, but it's probably a setting somewhere.",at this point your pc is completely quiet and at less than 500w for cpu+gpu.,i literally have zero worries about my 850w psu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think his point was that the older mobos are cheaper,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well the older mobos are compatible with 13th gen too.,although might have to update bios on them as i don't think they're pre updated yet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

just got this a few weeks ago havent changed mine yet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is that during heavy duty like benchmarking?,"because for mine, after switching, the idle temperature didnâ€™t change (well, considering i had 34c, it was already decent iâ€™d say?)",but it went down probably 7-8c at peak temperature during fpu stress,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what temps are we talking about now?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"same here, i have the same board.",i see no difference using the contact frame but since i already installed it i kept it anyway.,"still the same 85-88c max running r23 at 5.5ghz/4.3ghz with the frame, ambient is 25/27c.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think the flatness of your coldplate/heatsink could have something to do with it.,"many are not flat but convex, which may work with a standard ilm, but the contact plate changes the flatness of the cpu, making it flatter, so them convex coldplates now have poor contact.",i checked my new corsairs h170i's coldplate and could see daylight when i laid a razors edge on it.,definitely not flat and perhaps the cause of the problem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"me too, but given what happens to jay2cents chip over a few months or whatever, its just peace of mind (his temps got worse over time after being fine at first).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that thing is â€œaiâ€ in name only.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no you wonâ€™t need the underside at all.,you unscrew the ilm from the top side and then screw in the contact frame.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have corsairâ€™s h150i elite 360mm rad, and my cpu temps were slightly higher.",i guess this simple solution somehow solved the thermal issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yup,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"why not, as 13700k runs very hot, too especially if you decide to oc it.","i have even seen people complaining about i5 13600kâ€™s temps, that on stock configuration (5.1ghz), it runs very hot.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

sure thing.,it even lowered my puny i5-12600 non-k by 5 to 6c.,now i wonder if i can delid this thing and apply liquid metal between the core and ihs for even lower temps.,"not that i need it, but tinkering with pc and its components is a hobby of mine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" no, i have applied the thermal grizzly kryonaut thermal paste, as i had that available.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you are right.,my previous delidded cpu was i7-6700k and i gave it to a friend in need of a semi-decent cpu.,it's still happily running basic stuff the last time i heard.,i'm always thinking about upgrading.,"but since i'm using lg 42"" oled tv (4k120hz, g-sync compatible), i'm afraid the performance boost would be quite small.",maybe i will get a new cpu when most new games need 8 real cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yes, but you cant keep performance with 130w pl :) it should work with all vendors, because new intel microcode arrived on ~october/november, and first bios versions for 13th gen were available as early as july/august",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not sure what you mean.,but none of that matters if you have ia cep kicking in which cannot be disabled.,"default ac for me was 70, setting it at 60 results in 10w less wattage, setting it at 50 results in around 20w less, but you already start loosing performance in multicore bench.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

but you cant always roll back bios versions after you update.,thats the part you're missing.,"many vendors will be like ""and after this bios, no more rollbacks"".",and i capped mine at 140w pl1 and pl2 and like i said.. a whopping 400 points on r23.,which means real world performance in games or anything most people do wouldnt be affected at all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">another option is to adjust ac/dc loadline, which helps, but is nowhere near as effective as adaptive offset.","i was replying to the ""another option is to adjust ac/dc loadline, which helps, but is nowhere near as effective as adaptive offset.""","statement - you use ac/dc ll with adaptive/offset, changing the setting wont matter unless you have some form of dynamic voltage.","and as i said, this might all depend on who makes your mobo (the behavior might alter), but regardless, saying x is not as effective as y when you can and should use both together tripped me up.","maybe it's just the wording - like maybe you meant ""using ac/dc alone is not as effective as with offset""- which, would be no surprise as a lot of these boards are rather overgenerous with current/etc at default settings (like, i dont think i have ever had a mobo that didn't grossly overestimate vcore on auto or offset +0.000).","&#x200b;

also, that bit about the mc update is interesting, i have a post-update bios on my z690 aorus ultra and have not had problems with negative offsets and going well below defaults (well, i had to set ac/dc to ""power saving"" or it bottomed out too high and with too high temp - but the particulars of what is happening behind the scenes on giga boards can scramble your brains).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh also, i have both cep settings turned on, so that certianly is not in the way.",perhaps this is all b660 based and doesn't affect other board?,not sure why they would pull this crap on that chipset - but intel sometimes be inte.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thats because you are not using b660 board and you dont have ia cep enabled.,"with it, performance would be shit with 140w.","and i checked, you can rollback msi, gigabyte, asus, asrock.",so atleast most of them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well the default setting is dynamic voltage, so yes i was using adaptive when changing llc.","and yes, using ac/dc alone is not as effective as using undervolting alone.","and no, i dont need to use both.",llc basically adjusts vdrop.,"my llc is correctly set on default settings, because my vcore doesnt drop below 1.08 under heavy load, and doesnt go above 1.1. so its stable and good.","by not using fixed vcore like you do, i have idle wattage of 3-6w which is ridiculously low.","for purely undervolting, fixed vcore is only useful to understand the limits of your cpu and lowest voltages.",i think adaptive offset is much more efficient way.,people usually only use fixed vcore when overclocking.,and that bit about micro code is only relevant to b series motherboard users.,it doesnt effect z boards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hmmm, otoh, something unrelated to vcore (or seemingly so) might be from cep.",to the testing labs once again!!,!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
having cep turned on doesnt allow voltage to drop.,ia cep is supposed to be off.,"if you crash with it off, it means your setup is unstable",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what does that mean?,https://imgur.com/a/ycbj26p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yup, i read more around about it - higher teirs have it turned off by default, but people with b6-whatever or otherwise have options to, beyond older bios (throttle stop and of the such).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"interesting, if i turn off ia cep, my system locks upon doing a p95 test - reenable it and all is fine again, going as low as i like, generally speaking with volts.",some other voltage i have on auto likely needs a boost.,"well, that was something new to look into.",shall the fun never end.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, i can very easily drop my vcore rather low with it on, so its not limited the vcore, or only is a purely relatively fashion, but the vdrop and vdroop are rather consistent with other people, like buildzoid using the same or similar-enough board (the pro and ultra are almost entirely the same) and similar bios/os/droop results with it off - so clearly something is overriding it in terms of that measure.","i assume an auto setting somewhere else is being kept from going below a certain point with my negative offset, and blah blah blah.","if it were simpler, it wouldn't be any fun.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that you cannot go back and install older bios after you flash this one.,probably gonna disable undervolting lol.,if you dont have issues dont update,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if the chip throttles at all, your scores can be pretty different.",it's possible installing the new 4090 is dumping heat into the case which is causing your 13900k to throttle more often or at different times.,"with the 4090 you may need to settle on mew undervolt settings (less undervolt) or less clock speed(or less e-cores speed, or less caxhe speed if they are not default).",anyway i am guessing not degradation but more heat us going on with new hardware.,"13900k is lots of ""fun"" to keep cool and or oc or undervolt.",i'd say just work from scratch again undervoltng the 13900k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think a reason is that the 4090 is also making your cpu work harder.,"it's a huge performance delta from your previous 2080, meaning your cpu now has to keep up with many more frames due to the higher fps.",i think that extra workload more so than the additional heat load of the 4090 is what's causing your cpu instability due to the undervolt.,what may have worked before isn't working now under the higher workload.,"this also aligns with why your cinebench score didn't drop too much but your time spy score did, since the former isolates the cpu but the latter uses both in conjunction.","if you revert your cpu to stock and try time spy again, does your cpu score increase back to around the 22k mark?","if so, you can rule out temperatures being the issue.","and in that case, it'd more likely be an unstable undervolt.",it could just be bad silicon lottery with your cpu limiting how well it can undervolt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i hear you and i'm not trying to overclock.,i was trying to undervolt.,i was mentioning i didn't understand how other get 5.7 with such low voltage and i can't lower voltage really at all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the ks version has a different v/f curve that draws significantly lower power if run at speeds equivalent to the standard 13900k.,basically it is a higher binned part with lower voltages programed into vid.,whether it is worth the extra cost for a couple hundred mhz or the lower power draw at standard 13900k speeds is debatable.,it can allow it to last longer if not clocking above 13900k speeds due to lower power & heat.,that extra 200 mhz if used increases power draw a lot if utilized.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the temperature of the gpu die isnâ€™t a good indicator of the actual heat being produced, just how well the gpu cooler transfers heat.",your 2080 probably ran between 250-300w and your 4090 is putting out significantly more than that under a full load.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i use ic diamond or microsi for long term high heat applications.,"microsi breaks down after a while at 100c+, though, but slowly.",ic diamond just gets better when subjected to that heat.,"microsi is what dell uses, it basically turns to concrete after a while, but it does offer long term consistent performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
technically speaking you want as little thermal paste as possible since it's only there to fill in the micro imperfections in the metal surfaces.,another thing to note is that the ihs and the cold plate are not perfectly flat unless you have lapped both to be perfectly flat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"looking at the first picture, i'm wondering if you're actually better served by not using the stock ilm.",the contact patch between the cooler and ihs seems very small,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i find nt-h1 to be way too thin and pump out on a lot of use cases.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this has been known; the thicker the paste is the better  the longevity.,additional factors is the breakdown temperature of the paste.,the nth1 has a low breakdown temperature so hotspots on dice will accelerate its degradation.,tfx and coolermaster master gel maker have the consistency of clay and they have the best longevity of pastes ive personally used.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s not how you apply your thermal paste is it?,"if so itâ€™s a terrible job, and isnâ€™t surprising you have gaps in its coverage",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
try different pastes.,iirc e.g.,hydronaut was specifically designed for long term applications.,personally i havenâ€™t had an issue with 13700k and kryonaut either though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
could try corsair xtm70.,a bit pricey at $25 ish for 3g.,"but itâ€™s pretty dang thick and one of, if not the best performing pastes out there.",kind of surprising coming from corsair.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've lapped my 9-ish year old nh d14 with a medium size bathroom mirror and got a 2-3c drop on all cores.,i would try another paste and rule out every other possibility then lap just the cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i will say this as many times as it takes for people to understand.,i have purchased 3 nt-h1 and 2 nt-h2 tubes in the past.,100% of them have some crappy water build up in the tube somewhere.,just went arctic mx-6 and i will never look back.,edit: noctua pastes are watery by default and will eventually spread out to the ring on every die like you see here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

core voltage in bios is set to fixed at 1.30 volt load line calibration 1 using asrock z690 aqua oc.,the fivr core voltage is set to adaptive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you have to measure real voltage from the vrm anyways.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah under load vehicle goes down to the voltage i set which is 1.3 volt.,i just don't understand why there's two voltage settings for the cpu v core in the bios.,one is the fivr which you can set to override or adaptive and the other one is the standard vcore voltage in the vrm settings.,so the voltage regulator module has its own folder of power settings and then there's another folder that's fivr for adaptive voltage curves and i really don't want that to run.,so i can set adaptive in the fivr setting to override and then set the voltage to 1.3 and maybe try setting the vcore in the vrm setting to auto and maybe the fivr will be like the master voltage setting.,all i know is this motherboard blurs the lines between intel stock power limits and what the board does .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and with that being said when both of the vcore voltages settings are set to auto and adaptive my idol vcore voltages will hit 1.6 without even touching it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"on b660 boards, specifically asus, disabling mce leads to higher idle and load voltage lmao.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah this is the first asrock board i've ever purchased and largely because of the monoblock.,but i'm not happy with the things that this board does right out of the box with no explanation.,every time i change the voltage the board sets both load line calibrations to one.,coming from an asus motherboard one was the lowest setting were eight being the highest it's completely opposite with the asrock boards.,with that being said i manually switched the low line calibrations to level four and the cpu is still asking for that higher voltage so i just reset everything to until stock power limits..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how do i find your ac/dc load line calibration guide.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no i was looking at the vid which is a voltage reading that shows what the cpu was asking for.,the actual vcore was reading what it was supposed to.,amongst all the confusion with these motherboards and blurring the lines between the intel stock power limits and whatever they set them to i tend to forget these things.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is that the most aggressive llc?,yah don't use that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is hwinfo64..  lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i measured the voltage on the motherboard i was looking at the wrong voltage still the vcore is what i should have been looking at and that was reading correctly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah these 12th and 13th gen cpus have endless motherboard settings that can be tweaked.,"the old standard method of static overclocks is still possible but its largely considered obsolete now since the adaptive boosting method is more efficient but also creates thermal headroom space for higher boosts in short workloads, etc, etc.",there are reams of text in overclocker.net forums or skatterbench on different techniques that can be used to undervolt/overclock the cpus.,"iâ€™m on an asus board and even though its one of the better bioss for overclocking out there, it does take a long time to find and understand all the different settings one needsâ€¦ endless menu diving.","good luck, and enjoy.","itâ€™s a great cpu, very powerful.",will stress just about any cooler if you let it go wild.,i keep mine power and temperature limited for [minimal performance loss](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/10bna5r/13900k_power_scaling_analysis/).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes in asrock motherboards it is the most aggressive i believe except for off.,the thing is when you go to set a static voltage in the motherboard it automatically puts load line calibration to one if i change it to four and change the static vcore again it changes it back to one so i just went ahead and went with it.,but with that being said i measured the vcore at the board and it was reading 1.29 volts it was reading 1.29 volts in cpu-z but 1.7 volts in info hardware and 1.7 volts and intel xtu tuning software.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i guess its important to measure vcore now, while it shows 1.7v in software.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
svid isnâ€™t the same as voltage.,the svid value is basically what the cpu is requesting from the vrm.,the vcore voltage should be listed somewhere else in hwinfo.,but still itâ€™s odd itâ€™s showing soo high svid.,you can probably ignore that with static voltage.,but itâ€™s still strange that itâ€™s showing such high svids.,probably some weird going on with your motherboard settings.,the thing is llc that is very aggressive is getting tons of undershoot.,"when you get interrupts, even at 100% cpu load.",all these tools wonâ€™t show that as itâ€™s happening in the scale of a few microseconds.,watch this video for a good explanation using an oscilloscope.,https://youtu.be/-l3mnj9kvxk,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it depends on your workload but ive done some messing around with the 13600k myself and compared comprehensivley against 13700k (and some non k) numbers.,"if you need the extra multithreaded performance either of the i7s will be nice, but otherwise the 13600k is a cooler, more fun package.",the 13700 draws aout 219w under full load compared to only 181w on the 13600k at stock settings.,if you overclock the 13600k with a large voltage increase it can quicky reach about 230w draw.,"however, with my 13600k with no power settings or core voltage change i achieved an overclock to 5.4 ghz p-core and 4.0 ghz e core, giving better single core performance than the 5.2ghz on the 13700 non k (with no little to no meaningful temp increase).","( i did nothing more than change the max turbo ratios in the bios, this overclcok was also tested with linpack for 1.5 hours and passed)

it comes down to what makes a bigger difference for you, single thread oriented workloads like gaming that would benefit from being able to push higher clocks on the 13600k or multithreaded workloads that would benefit from 2 extra multithreaded cores.","to aid in your decision, with my current stock power overclock my cinebench r23 multithreaded scores are around 25500 +-200 points

"not only did you try to air cool a 13700k, but you picked an old, insufficient cooler to boot.",repasting it won't change that fact.,"most review sites say to not even bother trying to air cool it, and this is assuming you're buying a top tier air cooler.","if you are insisting on air cooling it, then you need a top tier cooler and to set some pretty strict power limits.",what you really need is a good aio if you really want to get the most out of your cpu.,"if your case can handle a 360mm radiator, then look at the arctic liquid freezer ii 360 or the ls720.","if you can only handle a 240mm radiator, then the only aio that could keep up without any power limits is the ls520.",ls520 can be had for about $100,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

in bios settings:

1)  manually limiting your pl1 and pl2 to 150w (this will severely throttle your cpu to meet your current cooler's specs, you will lose performance but it should still be good enough for gaming)  
2) set a custom tjmax  temperature to whatever you feel safe, the cpu will automatically throttle itself when it reaches the set temperature.","3) underclock, undervolt, disabling cores, etc to lower the power draw but requires some trial and error to avoid instability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you're using cpu only for games - you can limit pl1/pl2 to 100w.,this will help you out in this situation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

another great way to look at it.,"that's another reason why i said to each their own, after all this is a heavily contentious subject (as it's always been).","for someone like myself, i prioritize longevity, versatility, and cost vs an all-in-one package that can deliver incredible performance for content creation/editing and has a small footprint with both its size and power draw, but lacks any substantial upgradability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'm confused 34-35-34-32 shouldn't that be like  34-35-34-69 unless i missed some magic the tras should be about 69-70 and not lower then cl.,unless you meant something different then how it's normally typed for the 4th timing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i've always heard tras lower then trcd+tcl doesn't help performance at all and may add negative impacts.,did you test bandwidth before and after and notice any changes by dropping tras well below normal?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with am4 i didn't get gains going sub 30 (some people do 21).,"with intel, since trc can't be set, we rely on just lowering the tras.",it's mostly for dropping the latency slightly.,programs that are used to test this quickly are aida64/intel imc gui/winrar and dota2.,i'd be down to test tomorrow once i receive my 13700kf.,"also ring ratio with intel matters with dropping latency, as well as the p-core ghz value.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'm not really an expert on the history of ultrabooks.","but my understanding, was that these listed cpus were just about all a consumer had to choose from (if they wanted thin+light+<$1,500).","so, i'd assume that something like a core increase, and benchmark improvement, would be applauded.","i'm trying to understand why the paper specs may not translate to the real world (or maybe they do, and my premise is wrong).",i'm also uninformed about how/why the change in ram to lpddr5x (or w/e) effects irl performance.,i know almost nothing about apple products.,"i see they have 1 16"" laptop at $2,600.","i know (some) of the grams have 80wh batteries, which afaik is about as big as it gets in laptops(?).","i don't really understand laptop market share (i guess it goes: hp, dell, apple, acer, lenovo, samsung.",i have no idea if/how many of those are chromebooks).,"apple's m2 cpu gets @ 22,000-26,500 on cpubenchmark, which is on par with the 1370p.","(again, maybe benchmarks don't translate to real world, or whatever, idk.","i assumed ""normal"" adults who wanted a fairly nice (fullsize) laptop, would buy something thin+light + affordable (like a u, g7, or p processor).","i thought the other option was like hx models, for gaming laptops.","or, whatever ""junk"" gets put into chromebooks.","i'm not familiar with the market- it just seems like an lg gram is a good standard of price:power:portability (still a bit pricey for what it is, but maybe more tolerable when on sale)

"good point, although for some reason the aorus elite boards the z690 is slightly more than the z790",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ek nucleus 240, probably not a huge amount of headroom there.",cant fit anything bigger in the case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was thinking about this as i already have a 32gb 3200mhz ddr4 kit.,actually saves a good â‚¬200 not buying a ddr5 kit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks :), will also be using a 240 ek aio.",so youre not seeing any issues with the huge power draw others were saying?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am thinking about doing exactly this set up but with the id cooling dash flow 240 because the ek is discontinued.,is it possible to undervolt with this mobo?,the alternative is the asrock z690 which i have seen a lot of complaints about.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is exactly why i'm asking!,thank you :).,i indeed noticed the z boards had better power delivery but the b skus already had 8+4pins on the cpu so i wasnt sure.,coming from a b550 board and before that was a 6600k.,and gieaaimg because the b boards are locked down you cant set a power limit?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i've also been seeing a lot of 13600k paired w z boards suffering from overheating, so seems like oversupplied voltage isn't a problem limited to non-z boards?",i'm also curious as to why you said b boards cause rapid instability compared to z boards?,thank you for your insights!,:),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i cant fit anything more than a 240 aio so not sure if i can really oc the chip.,"there arent any 13600s avaioable here yet so didnt see it, indeed a good option :) thanks!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i do check used, and theres an msi meg board available for about the same price you just mentioned, but seems excessive for an i5 ðÿ˜„.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yup.,no issues at all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can confirm that it is possible to undervollt with this mobo.,currently running a negative offset of .075,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for whatever reason that nobody knows why undervolting 13th gens on the b660 at least causes rapid instability compared to on z series boards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
undervolting / lite load adjustment works on z boards.,it doesn't work on b boards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the msi.,unify is so awesome,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

dude you would be far better off building a new system.,you can build a cheap 12600k/z690 setup for like ~$300 and have exponentially better performance.,or if you're really trying to spend as little as possible you can go with a 12100f and it'll still be miles ahead in performance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thanks a lot.,much appreciated.,finally someone who understands.,all the other people here we just saying how shitty the cpu is.,but what i really wanted to know is how good it is from the i5.,i too wanna max out my system.,then move slowly towards upgrades.,because i currently donâ€™t have the budget to move on to the newer i5â€™s as that would require the whole platform change including mobo and ram.,which i currently donâ€™t have the money for.,iâ€™ll be seeing how this i7 works.,thanks again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

whatever performance you might stand to gain is completely situational.,"some games benefit quite a lot from the extra threads hyperthreading provides, and some donâ€™t.","in the best case scenario youâ€™d probably gain about 30% performance, and in a bad case no performance gain.",temper your expectations accordingly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30$ is all i would consider especially if it's not a k version,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wanted to go from an i5 4690k to an i7 4790k or 4770k only for the extra threads.,but the chips aren't worth slight gains.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how much of a budget do you have?,"i got an i7 6700 a few years ago complete with 16 gb ram, a 180 gb ssd and a 1 tb hdd for 200 bucks.",nowadays you can find 7700s,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you will be able to _measure_ the gain in performance, but i bet you will not _feel_ it.",save the money and buy a 8th generation or newer intel system in some time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no more than 50 bucks, personally but i guess that's up to you and how much you want to stick with that platform.",a current gen build would get you far more value down the line with vastly better performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""killing it"" is a quite a bit much to say :d but anyhow, the i7 is better than the i5 so if you want to make a cheap upgrade you can do that.","if you have a z-variant motherboard and get the k-variant cpu, then you can get some decent gains from overclocking.",that was still the cpu gen that benefited a lot from overclocking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

imagine you asking for performance upgrade in upgrading your processor and you get replies like thatâ€™s an old processor and it canâ€™t game and everything but the answer you were looking for.,youâ€™d get irritated too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
true.,it really is nice that you try to find upgrade paths on your current platform and i gave you some tips (besides hardware) on how to proceed.,most of the cautioning comments here are more directed towards you spending real money on upgrading that platform.,"if you can the the new part for almost free, then go for it, but if you need to spend some real non-insignificant money, then we are immediately in the discussion on whether you could have gotten a cheap ryzen 5 5500/5600 or i3-12100 or 13100 instead for hugely more powerful system.",many times the price for old hardware is very inflated contrary to what it can do compared to the cheapest stuff that is available on modern or 1 gen behind hardware.,"all that being said: if you can get it very cheaply, then an upgrade is an upgrade and go for it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because then iâ€™d have to upgrade the entire setup including mobo and ram.,"originally had a 1050ti, but then got 3060 as a gift.","i5 was staying at 100 all the damn time, so i thought iâ€™d upgrade to i7.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

np.,thanks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then save for new cpu mobo and ram.,don't waste your money on an old chip that's going to give you nothing performance wise,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no.,that is fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
highest temp i ever had with mine while gaming was 62c.,usually it stays around 53-58c depending on the game.,(i'm playing on 3440x1440p) using a 360mm aio kraken z73.,undervolted the cpu.,make sure to disable multicore enhancement in bios (might be named a bit different in your bios),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 13900k is just like that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s not good with that voltage.,check the cooler and the thermal paste again,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"check if the thermal plate seated properly, you may need the lga1700 frame mod.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

disable asus muliticore enhancement.,temps will go down.,in this case itâ€™s caused by asus bios by default which chosen by asus which still allowed by intel provided spec range of operation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nah those are bad temps for gaming and using a 360mm aio, probably some dumb ""feature"" pre-activated from bios.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is all core voltage.,thats normal lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,that is fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not really.,"the throttle when benchmarking this cpu comes from it getting unlimited power from the mainboard, 330w+, no aio can handle that much.","by disabling multicore enhancement and undervolting it alone i'm sitting at 53-62c while gaming with mine, also using a 360mm aio.",further capping pl1 & pl2 to a value your cooling solution can handle also prevents it from throttling while benchmarking.,i have mine capped at 253w and still getting 40k in c23 for example.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nope.,not true at all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that is far from fine.,"his gaming temps should sit between 45-65c depending on the game, especially @1.27v.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no.,it aint worth 100 dollars more for 13400. go with 12500 cuz the difference is minimal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don't buy new cpus ever.,atleast not within 3 month of launch.,12600k will cost same as 13400.  maybe look into it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i was just looking on newegg & 13500 was only about $30 more than 12500.,13500 is much better cpu.,the 13500 is a 14 core cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

unfortunately the 12600k is a bit more expensive than 13400 as of right now where i live,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i still don't know it's like 100 dollars more,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was too fricking unfortunate and i was born in middle east so no amazon newegg ebay and the other stuff you guys have,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 12600k is still selling for $315 in my country  :'),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s unfortunate but you should consider the 13500 or a 12600k since they are 10 core cpus unlike the 12500 which is a 6 core cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sorry to hear that.,hopefully you can find a less expensive option near you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i mean you're splitting hairs at a certain point.,depends what your use cases are as to which is better.,the 13900k and 7950x are both stupid halo products 90% of the people buying them don't need.,they are also stupid in that they aren't very good for the people that are buying them that do need them.,gamers don't need to have 16 cores or 8+16 like the 7950x/13900k have.,"the people who do need that many cores also would benefit from things like ecc ram, quad channel (or even octa channel) memory, and additional pci-e lanes.",the 7950x and 13900k becoming effectively replacements for the threadripper/x299 platforms is really not fitting actual needs of most users.,"anyways, my point is instead of arguing about which one is better we need to get rightly pissed that neither is what they should be.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'm afraid that the psu used in that inwin case would not be enough even for a system based on a mobile core i9 cpu.,"besides, the psu bundled in that case has a non-standard form-factor, so if it fails you won't find a replacement for it.","if you haven't bought the parts already and want a really, really small pc, take a look at prebuilt mini-pcs with powerful mobile cpu, like minisforum nad9 (it has i9-12900h).",i wouldn't personally care about the memory type used - both ddr4 and ddr5 perform almost equally in most scenarios.,"if you really want a system based on a desktop core i9, you will need probably at least a 600w psu (gold, platinum or titanium certified) and a beefy air cooler or a 360-mm aio.","and a larger case to fit all this, obviously.",:),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is a joke right?,iâ€™ve seen my i9 pull around 300. maybe if you under volt the crap out of it.,but why risk that?,a psu that can handle more will only draw what it needs.,lots of good answers here.,i9 is definitely not the right choice for your purpose.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
850w or higher at least for that processor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"echoing what everyone else is saying here, the 200w psu might be able to power your ram.",i would suggest that you go through partpicker.,this will tell you how much your expected power rating should be for the average production pc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
where did you even find a 200w psu that wasnâ€™t repurposed from some junk prebuilt machine and why would you even want to use it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if it's power limited, then you might technically be able to, but uh

yeahnooo.",.,.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not even close, and an i9 would be way overkill for your use case.","just get an i5, or hell even a modern i3 would probably be plenty.",most people don't need more than 4 cores for general computing could look into the non x line of amd cpus as well since they have lower power draw.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would get 1000w psu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you trolling or you are just incredibly dumb?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wtf kinda joke is this?,also who tf sells 200w psus anymore?,i swear if i wanted too i couldn't find one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this misinformation needs to stop.,the i9 will not draw over 253w at intel specs.,"if your is, its because your mobo manufacturer turned whatever their equivalent of asusâ€™ multicore enhancement on by default.","however, that is still well above what the b1â€˜s built in psu can handle.",even the non-k chip will hit 220w at pl2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whatâ€™s wrong with the deepcool ak620?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you wanted to go with the i9, youll need to go with a bigger case (but you could still go sff, just bigger than the b1, which is admittedly tiny).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

>is 200w psu enough for an i9?,"all it says here is ""is 200w psu enough for an i9?",""",   so no 200w is not enough for an i9, not to mention a gpu and mb.","so you need 300 watts for i9, gpu is 300 watts, plus motherboard, i would definitely go with 1000 w.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

> this misinformation needs to stop.,the i9 will not draw over 253w at intel specs.,"this comment is basically misinformation, because while it is true that intel *recommended* spec has a 253w pl2 - very few motherboards enforce power limits by default (and they're usually the cheaper models)

"no there's no mention about  a pc case, it should says "" is 200w psu enough for an i9"", so the answer is, if this is an i9-13900k for example, the gpu alone would require over 300 watts, so 200w won't even be close.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if you don't care about overclocking then yes.,(who would overclock  this anyway?),"it runs at slightly lower clock speeds but it is probably still the fastest cpu for gaming you can get, lower tdp means you can use a less expensive cooler to tame it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at stock speeds a 13900 is better than a 13700k (5.6 vs 5.4 thermal boost).,if you aren't going to overclock its a brilliant option.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

download hwinfo and check what is being limited.,"there should be something under ""ia limit reasons"", look for entries that has ""yes"" as its value.",pl1=125 should be what's limiting your cinebench r23 score to 22k.,you're never going to get a higher score if you keep pl1=125.,"pl1 should be equal to pl2 (181w) if your cooler can handle it, that's how you get 24k on cinebench.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hmm got it.,was following this build by optimum tech [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbux-lb4s3u) where he recommended the part list i went with.,got a really good deal on the case.,prob not the end of the world since he's not doing heavy/intense cpu processing items.,just driving me insane trying to figure it out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my mobo limit for pl1 is fixed at 125w so i can't change that.,i have my pl2 at 165now and some offsets to lower the core voltage.,i've posted some screenshots below.,i'm not sure why it's thermal throttling at 90c and i guess i should do some research on ia limit reasons as i'm unfamiliar with some of those items.,anything you see here that could help?,i'm getting 22k now on cinebench with current settings.,[https://imgur.com/a/s7iwwao](https://imgur.com/a/s7iwwao),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" that pl1 limit is unfortunate but it's pretty expected for an itx board, it may be that the board's vrm cannot handle sustained loads higher than 125w so it might be fixed there to stop you from frying it.","ia limit reasons shows that you only got thermal limited and pl1/pl2 limited, so it doesn't seem like there are any other problems.","the max cpu package temperature shows 90c, maybe you can try to change the max temp somewhere in the bios to 100c (intel's spec) to eek out a little bit more performance, if the motherboard allows that.",you could also try a better cooling system to stop the thermal limiting.,"however, if you aren't reaching 90c anymore after the pl1 limit kicks in, you wouldn't see performance improvements from a better cooler or a higher thermal limit (except for the few seconds you get under pl2, before pl1 kicks in), since the pl1 limit will stop you from thermal throttling anyway.",it looks like the main limiting factor is just the pl1 limit so you'd have to get a new motherboard if you wanted to change that.,"other than that, you can only try to undervolt as much as possible to get the maximum performance out of 125w.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"apparently there is a hidden option to increase pl1 to 150w, in the bios at ""oc tweaker - base frequency boost - 150w"", i found it in this thread with people who own the same motherboard:

"sorry, i just saw your request on one of my other posts...

&#x200b;

as another user has already posted, go to oc tweaker menu and right near the top is base frequency boost, set that to 150, then at the bottom of  oc tweaker, set pl1 to 150w, time to 224s, pl2 to 241w.","&#x200b;

go to fivr.","set p-core undervolt to ""legacy all core undervolt, -100mv"".",set e-core same: these will reduce your peak load vcore...  set cache undervolt to -70mv.,"set uncore/sa undervolt to -70mv:  these will reduce your low load vcore... (because vcore is actually set by whatever the highest requested is between pcores, ecores, cache, sa, and igpu)

somewhere is vcore compensation with values of auto, lvl 1,2,3,4,5.  i left this on auto.",somewhere else is load line calibration with the same potential values.,i set this to level 5.,(this allows vcore to droop at higher loads.,"&#x200b;

these settings work for my 12700k on this board (in fact i can use -105 to -110mv on p-cores and e-cores with stock settings, but i overclock too, so i pulled them back a bit for stability)  with my cpu at stock frequencies, -105mv on cores and llc level 5, i went from 190w out of the box to 145w (in cinebench r23).","no throttling **at all** for power or thermals, as it was persistently below that limiting pl1, and my scores in r23 went up noticably.","&#x200b;

is the pump actually running?","at idle workload, set the fans to 0%, and set the pump to 100%.",can you hear it?,"if yes, set the pump to 45-60% (wherever it just starts being audible), and set the fans to 100%, then run r23 and see what the temperature is... with your 125w limit it really shouldn't be over 70c, even with a 140mm rad.... if it is, take the cpu waterblock off and firstly check that you haven't accidentally left a plastic film protector on the waterblock (it is easily done).","if that's not the case, check what the leftover thermal paste looks like on the cpu.","if it hasn't spread to cover the whole cpu and has left a nice circle shap behind from the factory fitted thermal compound on the waterblock, then that factory fitted compound had dried up, and you need to clean it off with proper tim cleaning solution, and re-fit the waterblock with a fresh application of grizzly kryonaut thermal compound.","if that second one wasn't the case eiter, look at the pattern the thermal compound actually did leave on the cpu...  if it looks thick in a line across the middle of the cpu and there is very little on the top and bottom edges of the cpu, then your cpu is being bent in the middle by the motherboard mounting hardware and you need a mounting plate or washer mod.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is one of those things where i recommend putting the current system on facebook marketplace as a flip and building new.,"first off, your system is a dell.",they are a pain in the ass to deal with.,don't bother.,"instead, get a cheap used gpu like a gtx 1650 or 1050ti and put it in there.","make sure it has like a $12 120gb boot drive, upgrade it to 16gb ram for like $10 just because it looks better in the listing than 12gb.","sell the pc as ""1080p gaming pc"" for like $300-400.","then, go get yourself a regular pc.",what do you currently have system wise?,you might find a 4080 is probably overkill for your needs if the goal is gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my 6700k is not bottlenecked with 3080ti if i go 4k.,"so at 4k with 4080, your cpu could be hitting its limits.","at 1440p, cpu bottlenecking will rear its ugly head.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah so do you really need more performance or do you just want a quieter desktop instead?,i mean you could go for more performance but the gap between say a 6700xt and a rtx 4080 is around $850 alone and depending on your standards you might not even care that much about the difference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i want a quieter desktop, right now i only have a 1080p 75hz display.",so i would have to upgrade to take advantage of more graphics horsepower,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i upgraded to 12700k pretty soon after i grabbed 3080. this was well before 13th gen was out.,stuck with ddr4 board since i have 64gb of ddr4 that would go to waste otherwise (cities:skylines eats memory like no other).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"depending on ambient temps, and case, 40-50 is what you could get idling.",manually set the fans to max and test.,"you can try remounting the cooler, but 1st, remove the door, and test.","if that fixes it, it's airflow issue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your mounting paste not good or cooler given what you are saying but check the voltage under load if it's too high day 1.5 volts nothing can cool it!,if to high bios and management engine update or offset voltage it till 1.3 volts under load 1.35 idle max,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"turn on c states in your bios will lower power draw when your idle, and the cpu will go all the way to 100 degrees.",thats just how they are now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
something is going on with your aio.,either you installed it incorrectly or it's defective.,usually it's the former.,post a pic of the inside of your pc so we can see how you installed it.,"for info, i have the 13700k on a 240mm aio (deep cool ls520) overclocked to 5.6/4.4 with absolutely no power limits or voltage offset in place, pulling the full 253w and i literally never get above 90â°c, even in back to back benchmarks.",i think my r23 score was in the high 31k range.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
im already at stage 1 and im nowhere near those scores/temps,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"did try all except remount , sent it back for the company to check it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most likely paste or pump even in games its 100c sent it back so they cant check it under warranty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the problem is tho it doesnt even draw that much power to begin with , it barely passes 110w and still throttles",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wasnt the one who built it , the aio is mounted top with vrm fan facing vrms so its fine .","interesting choice they made tho is make all fans except rear be intakes , doubts its what holding it back since it even throttles in games (warframe) shoots to 100 in like 10s",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"set it to 2, the mode 1 has ac/dc to 1/1, it donâ€™t allow the cpu to clock down in idle",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your top mounted aio has the fans set up as intakes?,it's literally fighting the laws of thermodynamics.,flip those around.,"depending on how many other fans you have set up as intake and their size, you may need to flip the rear fan to intake so you can maintain positive pressure

either way i'd still rma that aio.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"tried still no go , i guess its the pump cuz even in warframe i get 100c",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
prob solved dude forgot to put thermal paste .,"and switched the fans orientation

also its 3x120 top , 2x 140 + 1 x 120 front , 1 x 120 rear",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
try to set the pump to max rpm and listen if you hear noise or not,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
glad you got it sorted.,how are your temps now at idle and gaming?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"pump def works , also prob was fixed with repaste",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cpu is finally free to breath .,went ahead and updated bios to water cooling pl and set lite load 9 and can actually see the cpu spread its wings in cb23 getting 29.5k tho it does reach 100c with like 300w  on hw but doesnt throttle speeds anymore .,imma prob drop it to load 6 since i dont really care for benchmarks and id rather have lower consumption at gaming .,getting idles 30-40 and gaming goes to like 60-75 depending on game set the fan to pmw instead of dc and its silent honeslty impressed .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you using hw info or hw monitor?,the latter often gives bad sensor readings.,"also, i wasn't aware the 13700k could draw 300w.",maxing mine out in every way i've only ever seen it pull the advertised 253w maximum.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"have both usually use hw monitor , hwm is the one that showed 300w so might just be as you said bad sensor reading but here it is https://imgur.com/a/ob5y8sn",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah 323w definitely isn't right.,i don't think even a 13900ks can use that much power.,i'd rerun the r23 bench with hw info up and see what you're looking at.,you can probably increase your score even more if you find out whats holding you back.,"its probably the cooling solution, but you can still set a voltage offset to lower temps while also getting better scores.",i'm in the high 31k range with my 13700k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"depends, do you want a cheap board, midrange board, or high end?","for high end i would get a msi ace, asus apex, or evga kingpin.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"from my extensive research prior to building my new pc, the 13700k and 13900k's sweet spot on the ram is 6400mhz with good timings (at least good for ddr5).","my choice was the g.skill trident z5 6400 cl32 2x16gb set, part number f5-6400j3239g16gx2-tz5rk.","this ended up being hynix a die, which is pretty much the best you can buy at this time.",should overclock extremely well beyond the xmp rating as well.,all for $200.,what a steal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
exactly what i was gonna recommend.,get anything 6000 or more.,i got a 6000 but runs at 5600. eventually xmp will be updated on the bios to get to 6000. but the higher the better.,based on my tests on gaming i get between 0.5 to 1 fps more per each additional 100mhz.,"it tends to get to 0.5 instead of 1 the higher you go but between 4800 to 6000, you should see a fps jump of around 12fps more.","then from 6000 to 8000, it won't be 20fps more but around 10fps to 15fps more.",this is on gaming.,on other tasks like excel or databases the speed helps a lot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i use an msi z690-a pro ddr5 wifi and it's been solid.,has usb flashback so no issues running 13th gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what motherboard are you using?,it's a bit concerning if its a z790 and can't run 6000 xmp.,mine worked with 8000 xmp.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"xmp will not work out of the box even on xoc boards, you usually need to tune voltages to get proper stability.","vddq tx, vccsa, and vdd2 are set by the board and usually are not even close to what your exact memory controller and board need.","my manually tuned 6800 kit oced to 7800 cl36 is using 1.15v vccsa, 1.26v cpu vddq, and 1.56v vdd2.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is that a hynix a die set?,what are the last 4 numbers on the sticker that's on the ram?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is the z790 hero.,the memory is not on the tested list of memory kits but it does get to 6000 without any problems..... with 2 ram sticks.,that's right boys and girls.,i got 4 sticks of ram lol.,"so, for now i can not get to 6000 but asus is making progress towards 4 sticks at the xmp value.",the last bios update introduced the first 4 stick layout in their site.,not mine of course but that is something.,"xmp works perfectly again with 2 slots, with 4 that's just being a pushy bastard on my end.","here are the videos if you ever wanna check out my experiments

"go forth my son, and let me know how it went with settings and all in case it is stable.",that would help in the overclocking world since the ddr5 changes some rules on how to overclock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah never had issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

itâ€™s seems stable for gaming at least.,i sometimes game for 3-4 hours at a time and i donâ€™t notice any issues.,previous cpus would crash/freeze the computer after 15-30 minutes of gaming at xmp 1.not sure about fully threaded loads for long periods of time.,"and really all i use it for is gaming anyway, so as long as itâ€™s stable for that.",i have another pc for work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"manually put your cooler at 100% fans and pump, then see what your temps are.","that's the most you'll get out of the cooler with the current mounting, paste spread, case airflow, cpu ihs flatness, cpu voltage.","then you know your baseline, you can start investigating, rebuilding and so on

edit: none of your cores have reached 100c, the 100c on the screenshot is your tjmax.",that's the temp at which the bios will tell the cpu to throttle.,"still your temps could be better, but you are not throttling yet",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the answer as discussed in alot of posts is the voltage being set too high in bios.,if you look at the vid its pulling (at leats it thinks so) 1.3243v ... this is way above what it needs.,if you have an msi board go into oc > advanced cpu configuration > msi lite load    its most likely at 12 by default.,set it to 5 or even lower and check if the performance is the same.,me personally i have the same setup but overclocked to 5.4 on p cores and 4.2 on e cores and my max temp during stress testing is about 75 c. i maxed it out at  1.17 volts and could probably go lower.,edit: if you dont have an msi motherboard you can try changing the cpu core voltage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
aggressive power profile by msi probably.,"refer this : https://youtu.be/dnfgswztvyc

adjust accordingly.",most likely it's bad cooler contact.,also that's tj max 100c.,you didn't reach 100c.,so your cpu is not reaching 100c friend.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

check your mobo settings is there any auto oc feature thats activated?,on asus its called multicore enhancement.,"if set to auto, mine would enable auto oc and remove all limits and i would hit 100c also on my 13900k",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hey stratoocs, it looks like you are having a cooling problem.",first - dont be afraid of 100c.,its normal for laptops.,"if youre running a high tdp load with a desktop i9 cpu, this is inevitable.",if youre hitting 100c in things like gaming and lighter tasks - then we have a problem.,"if thats the case, the first thing you want to do is to repaste the cooler.",taking it apart and putting it back together will solve the problem more often than you might believe.,"double check and make sure youre using the proper mounting equipment - using lga1200 mounts on a lga 1700 system might work, but performance wont be ideal.",make sure to test the cooler under power limited conditions before assuming its not working right.,"most non-sff coolers can handle loads of 200w, so test with a 200w power limit.","if youre still experiencing hot temperatures after checking all of the above, then its time to return the cooler or file a rma for repair.","*i am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.",please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/intel) if you have any questions or concerns.,*,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there has been plenty reports about this issue.myself also had this issue.,what really fixed it for me was using a contact frame.,there's plenty youtube videos and also written guides that's talking about the lga1700 socket and explaining why this socket is so bad.,"for example gamer's nexus: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyu1oskby-q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyu1oskby-q) (i recommend watching this video to also see how to apply the contact frame... it's not hard or anything, but you really don't have to tighten it a lot...)

here's a very good article for instance: [https://www.igorslab.de/en/german-engineered-bend-aids-for-intels-lga1700-thermal-grizzly-cpu-contact-frame-and-alphacool-apex-backplate-thermal-testing/](https://www.igorslab.de/en/german-engineered-bend-aids-for-intels-lga1700-thermal-grizzly-cpu-contact-frame-and-alphacool-apex-backplate-thermal-testing/)

you can either buy the more expensive contact frame from thermalgrizzly (the inventor of those) or take the thermalright, like i did: [https://www.amazon.de/thermalright-anti-biege-schnalle-cpu-befestigungsschnalle-cpu-biegekorrekturfixierer-spureninstallation/dp/b0b64xq96x/](https://www.amazon.de/thermalright-anti-biege-schnalle-cpu-befestigungsschnalle-cpu-biegekorrekturfixierer-spureninstallation/dp/b0b64xq96x/)

i'm very certain that you will improve your temps with that by a huge margin... i went from thermalthrottling 100â°c (also having the i5 13600k with a noctua dh15 cooler) to 82â°c max during 2 hours prime.",using cinebench i'm hitting 78â°c max.and my fancurve isn't agressive at all... my fan is basically sitting at 50% all the time.,[https://i.imgur.com/g1qbq3t.png](https://i.imgur.com/g1qbq3t.png),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

wow this was really the answer!,in bios it was set to cpu lite 12 i changed it to cpu lite 6 and now the problem is gone!,"thanks to everyone that knew that, it was a default msi bad config in bios : [https://postimg.cc/n2bmk0nt](https://postimg.cc/n2bmk0nt) !",[gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|surprise),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 it then iâ€™ll have to upgrade the entire path including ram and mobo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its a meh because the i3 is faster of course but there wont be much of a difference from a 7 4770. but if you want better upgrads or faster ram than the i3 12100. but its a choose your own poison.,(a phrase that means to choose someing better and worse or worse and better),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

its not about cores and threads its about ipc(instructions per clock) and cache as well as speed.,these can couse a performance increase.,the 12th gen is a big step up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"with my jasper lake n5100, the gaming situation really depends on the game and resolution.",usually at anything over 720p the gpu is the limiting factor though.,these are obviously not gaming chips but the n200 with more eus and ddr5 could be pretty damn good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

from the review it seemed that it's similar to my n5100.,it *can* go over 6w in like cinebench but in normal usage the max is around 7w or so.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if the chip throttles at all, your scores can be pretty different.",it's possible installing the new 4090 is dumping heat into the case which is causing your 13900k to throttle more often or at different times.,"with the 4090 you may need to settle on mew undervolt settings (less undervolt) or less clock speed(or less e-cores speed, or less caxhe speed if they are not default).",anyway i am guessing not degradation but more heat us going on with new hardware.,"13900k is lots of ""fun"" to keep cool and or oc or undervolt.",i'd say just work from scratch again undervoltng the 13900k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think a reason is that the 4090 is also making your cpu work harder.,"it's a huge performance delta from your previous 2080, meaning your cpu now has to keep up with many more frames due to the higher fps.",i think that extra workload more so than the additional heat load of the 4090 is what's causing your cpu instability due to the undervolt.,what may have worked before isn't working now under the higher workload.,"this also aligns with why your cinebench score didn't drop too much but your time spy score did, since the former isolates the cpu but the latter uses both in conjunction.","if you revert your cpu to stock and try time spy again, does your cpu score increase back to around the 22k mark?","if so, you can rule out temperatures being the issue.","and in that case, it'd more likely be an unstable undervolt.",it could just be bad silicon lottery with your cpu limiting how well it can undervolt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

just enjoy your computer :) 5.5/4.3 all core at pl1/pl2 unlimited.,the extra 200mhz of 5.7 doesn't make any real difference.,the chip is going to throttle!,":)

i can get to 5.9 and maybe 6 on my i13900k but what's the damn point?","it runs hot, takes more voltage and it's not that big of a difference performance wise.",it's why the ks isn't worth it.,it's going to throttle!,it's fun if you drag race and are using exotic cooling but if you're using your computer for anything important like creative work or even just gaming... 5.5/4.3 is fine 24-7 and the chip likes to be there.,"the 13900k can not run over 5.6/4.3 on all core loads without throttling, unless you use exotic cooling.",but then you're not using your computer.,the computer is using you to stay alive for minutes while you feed it ln2 for some benchmark record.,anything more than 5.5/4.3 is diminishing returns.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i hear you  but he 4090 never exceeds 57 degrees.,during hours of bf2042 it sits about 46c.,i think the time spy score dropping 4k literally overnight is really throwing me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i hear you and i'm not trying to overclock.,i was trying to undervolt.,i was mentioning i didn't understand how other get 5.7 with such low voltage and i can't lower voltage really at all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the ks version has a different v/f curve that draws significantly lower power if run at speeds equivalent to the standard 13900k.,basically it is a higher binned part with lower voltages programed into vid.,whether it is worth the extra cost for a couple hundred mhz or the lower power draw at standard 13900k speeds is debatable.,it can allow it to last longer if not clocking above 13900k speeds due to lower power & heat.,that extra 200 mhz if used increases power draw a lot if utilized.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the temperature of the gpu die isnâ€™t a good indicator of the actual heat being produced, just how well the gpu cooler transfers heat.",your 2080 probably ran between 250-300w and your 4090 is putting out significantly more than that under a full load.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just a setting off iâ€™m sure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if you could check yourself using hwinfo64 as is shown in the link

"yeah, there's usually no one size fits all guide, even if you're trying to follow along specifically with someone using the exact same motherboard and ram you're using it won't turn out exactly the same way, just like overclocking.","you can push some hardware further than others  


differences in ram, the specifications of the gpu you're using, the quality of the controllers on your cpu will all change how well or poorly your computer can handle the undervolting  


you're best off looking into guides/information and the tools you need to go about validating your undervolting than trying to get specific help from people who do not have direct access to your hardware (not that you want to give anyone on reddit or pretty much any online forum that.","definitely, absolutely, do not.)","this is a tedious process and having to communicate via text on each and every step dissuades many from even bothering

i'd recommend using overclocking forums (such as 

* r/overclocking
* [https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/](https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/)
* [https://forum.level1techs.com/](https://forum.level1techs.com/)

and perhaps a well known enthusiast who builds these types of computers like [optimum tech](https://www.youtube.com/@optimumtech) 

&#x200b;

not as direct guides but to find resources to learn how to do it yourself  


it'll take some time, but you'll learn a lot along the way and you'll be better off than anyone who is trying to find a ""can i copy your homework"" type of undervolt",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i made a full post in direct reply (check it out) but the short version is you can get the same results by just power limiting the pl1 and pl2 boost values.,"and its not about asus or gigabyte, its a microcode change to the cpu itself which wont let undervolting work on b660.","i can assure you, you cant undervolt on asus b660 either.",i tried on my b660i and even a .01v offset cut performance in half.,but limiting pl1 and pl2 values to 145w lost me almost no performance and kept the cpu nice and cool.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

wondering why you didn't get the 13600k for $50 more especially considering you bought a 700 series motherboard instead of 600.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
64gb ram?,return that cpu if you can and at least get a 13600k with that high end board.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13600k is on par with 12900k in benchmarks right now just saying ..it will slap right in that z790,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no way you got a strix z790 mobo with only ddr4 support lol.,what a bad deal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"good upgrade, enjoy!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice mobo but z690 for an i5?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i went from a 4770k to a 12700k i had the 4770k for 10 years and still really didn't need to up grade except for high end games.,i will have this 12700k for another 5 to 10 years and never need to to upgrade.,it is amazing.,4770k only has 4 cores going from that to a 12 core cpu more than enough go get by for a long long time.,i could still upgrade to the 13700k but no need.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's a pretty nice upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is a z690 version of that board for a 12600k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that motherboard is gorgeous,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i did the same with a 12600k about a year ago.,super happy with it.,congrats!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just make sure you stay away from that armory crate from asus.,just a mess of bloatware.,also for a z790 board.,you may want to return that 12 and get a 13600k at least.,the 13600k far outperforms the the 12600kf and still for a amazing price per performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for people saying he wasted money on a z790 over a z690 - youâ€™re right.,"but, the people who say that the 13600k is way more worth it might be wrong as thr 12600k and kf are heavily discounted in some countries right now, like here in canada",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have the same board paired with my 13700k.,"primary use is gaming, so ddr5 did me no good.",enjoy!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"itâ€™s way better a z690 with a 13600k than this combo, it makes no senseâ€¦",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
def should return the cpu and get the 13600k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
stupid combo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
should have gotten a 13600k with that mobo tbh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 7700k was fine in my opinion but ok,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ngl lots of weird build choices.,"as long as you enjoy it, though.",that's all that matters.,but what was the thought behind buying an expensive $350 13th gen board that also supports ddr5 and then getting neither?,13600k is like maybe $50 bucks more.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pro tip - when downloading chipset drivers from asus' website be sure to expand the box.,by default it only shows the latest one and doesn't show the intel drivers.,took me an hour to figure that out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great processor!,why cause iâ€™ve got same one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"overpays for motherboard, underpays for cpu.",i did that for about 15 years until i learned to buy better.,z690/13700kf for me!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wtf guys you act like the 13600k is double the performance of 12600k, are you even serious?","if the 12600kf was seriously discounted, it's a better buy than 13600k.",lets not mention the cooling you need for 13600k and the many threads of people complaining aboit getting 80+ degrees in games.,"if you read this and can get a 12600k/f at â‚¬200, just grab it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to those questioning the board and cpu combo, maybe op just wanted a white mobo, and wasnâ€™t really concerned about which chipset and got what was available to them?",or maybe they expect to upgrade 3 years down the road to a 13700k from ebay or something?,"to me the keys are: can op afford it, did they do some research to ensure compatibility, and are they happy with their choices?","if so, then good for them!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice i just got a 12700k and upgraded from a 7700k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and you got an expensive motherboard instead of a better cpu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

happy for you mate.,:),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good upgrade but why not 13600k and a z690??,iâ€™m confused,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i donâ€™t understand that parts choice here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
please please please get a 13600k instead you will love it so much more,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah the 13600k is way better tbh, but hey how will intel ever sell out of old stock if everyone was an educated consumers?",lul,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
isn't the 12600k like half the tpd and half the temps of the 13600k?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the use of ddr5?,maybe i dunno just guessing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes it does so long as the bios version supports it.,i have an asrock z690 board about to accept a 13600k next week :d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when it works it definitely works according to those that have used it.,but its also a major resource hog and it has been widely known to affect performance in games.,"granted i haven't used armory crate but i have seen many others use it and seen how much resources it takes on their screens, how buggy it is, negative performance with games, it being a absolute nightmare to uninstall.",i do alot of research on these company owned software because i want my new build to be as clean of bloatware as possible.,i seen and spoken to many owners of asus rog products and asus makes amazing hardware but has always suffered in the software department.,and this has been going on since 2018 apparently.,"when there is too many people saying the same thing, when there is too many people actually showing with video and screenshots of how much of a resource hog ac is.",i think ill believe that.,besides even if it does work fine with everything there is many other kinds of software that can handle rgb.,now it's entirely possible that everything can be fine for me but i do not want to even take that chance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

they were both on sale.,the board supports 12th and 13th gen with ddr4.,i didn't have the extra cash to splurge on ddr5 ram.,took the 12600k for now until i can pick up a 13900k that won't cost an arm and a leg.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the only situation where it would make sense is if you use rpcs3 (ps3 emulator).",the intel 12th gen and above will give 60fps in demanding ps3 games while older cpus can't because single core speed is too slow.,if you don't do that just keep the 10980xe.. it wont limit you in 4k until maybe the rtx 6090 or 7090 comes out.,i'm talking native 4k btw.. with dlss the answer changes if you want high refresh (like 240fps+).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

are you rendering with cpu or gpu?,cause if you are using gpu for rendering then this cpu will do absolutely fine.,tbh even if you are rendering with cpu - any cpu will do the job.,the question is - how patient you are?,!,[gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grin),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if you are earning money from it then i highly suggest investing more into 13600k to 13700k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what software do you use?,something with some e-cores is probably a better option.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
since you are saying you have no experience.,i would advise start learning as close to free as possible and grow from there.,high end = more core&thread and higher frequency.,"so base on industry standards of today 2023 on enterprise, no i5 13400 is not considered for high end rendering and video editing since your comparing it to a xeon or threadripper.",it all depends on what is being compared too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for video editing get the 13500 instead of the 13400 it has twice the quicksync engines.,"especially important for h.265 4:2:2 footage 

also the 3/4 extra e-cores are relatively cheap",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably better to go with the 13700 or the i9 12900k.,undervolt it for more efficiency.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"iâ€™m sorry, i was confused.","the 13400 actually does have 4 e-cores, which makes it an interesting option.",itâ€™s basically a binned-down 12600k though so if you have a z-series mobo maybe go that route instead.,gamersnexus just published a great review of this cpu you should go watch.,"also, check out tech yes city in general he is a proponent for budget builds but said he uses final cut pro for video editing and it demands the highest possible cpu, 64gb ram and highest end video card possible because it is so unoptimized for pc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

those are pretty average scores so you're right on target for all stock settings.,if you really want to push for a higher score you could overclock it to 5.6 all core on p cores and 4.4 all core on e cores as long as your cooler can keep up.,"i'm getting like 31.7k r23 scores on mine, but i'm able to pump it up without hitting throttling because i have a great aio.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the stock coolers have always been garbage, what's new?",also it won't have any performance penalty when gaming (other than perhaps louder fans).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so the 13500 is bad because the stock cooler is bad?,ok dude.,because spending couple dozen bucks on a budget tower cooler is out of the question.,?,?,?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you simply throw out the stock cooler, the 13500 is still ~$100 cheaper than the 13600k.",and anyone who has no problem paying $100 more should get the 13600k anyways!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's a rebranded and locked alder lake cpu.,it does not have the enhanced raptor cove cores,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that 13500 would be fine if you buy a decent cooler for it.,the bundled intel cooler has been junk for years.,and probably not helped by the lga1700 socket mechanism not holding the cpu flat in the socket.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12400f could have been a better choice given the right mobo for overclocking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
...why would you use a stock cooler???,nothing wrong with the chip its the cooling solution,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
people saying the stock coolers suck and always have are not correct.,"i built a haswell system with a celeron and ran stock cooler until last year when i took that cooler (at that point 8-9 years old) and put it on an i7-4790, where it runs now and stably at 100% cpu.","no idea what the temp is but anyway ;) it's possible these days the coolers suck, although i know they are fine at least on the i3s.",the benefit of the i5-13500 is only recognized if you're saving a cooler cost.,"right now on newegg the i5-13600k is $309 and a i5-13500 is $290, so in theory at least $60 cheaper (13600k+a $40 air cooler).",if the stock cooler is no good for that chip anyway the chip makes no sense.,"just spend a few more bucks for the 600, so i agree with op on that!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 13500 is not supposed to be good for gaming.,itâ€™s barely faster than a ryzen 5600x.,itâ€™s meant to be a productivity powerhouse with a low cost of entry.,if you want gaming performance get the 13600k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all i read here is that you don't understand computers.,"intel's stock coolers won't run their chips at full power, neither will amd's one, although they have much better performance in low wattages application (aka gaming).",you also need to pair the 13500 with ddr5 to get performance in line with the 7600/x for gaming.,"but at that point, just buy a 13400 if you don't care about multicore performance and save even more money.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"good points, op.","the stock coolers are always trash and should be replaced, but that's just adding to the cost.","the most noteworthy thing is the 13500 uses last gens alder lake p cores, so really you're just getting a refreshed alder lake, not a raptor lake cpu.","to get that, the minimum price of entry is the 13600k.","with the recent lowering of msrp, i don't see any reason to buy anything below a 13600k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"13400 and 13600 makes the 13500 too awkward tbh, it's not cheap as 13400 but ot doesn't act good as 13600k",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, intel stock coolers have always been garbage.","amd's have ranged from ""at least it's not an intel stock cooler"" to ""hey you can actually overclock a bit with this thing"".",i threw together a system with spare parts and managed to get 3.9ghz out of a ryzen 1700 on a wraith spire rgb.,"legitimately, the spire and above are solid for what they are.",the only one that kind of sucks is the wraith stealth.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

actually 7600 non x is faily great for stock coolers.,also it has eco mode.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, msrp wise the 13500 is $232 and the 13600k $319.",so i guess more $87ish.,"but the 13500 might be overpriced since itâ€™s new, and the 13600k more discounted.",i still feel the 13500 is the best value model - although in some performance/cost calculations i did the 13600 is also worth the extra cost.,"but if you can afford it, the 13600k is the better cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"itâ€™s fairly behind the curve with affordable options like 5800x3d, 7600/x and 13600k being much faster",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

anyone should be worrying about temps above 100c.,those asrock default settings are utterly unacceptable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
before i even read your message i knew you had an asrock motherboard.,the cpu will turn the system off before it gets to the point of physical damage.,asrock made a totally boneheaded and cpu-warranty-voiding move by setting tjmax to 115 degrees.,make sure you have set tjmax from â€œautoâ€ to â€œ100â€ in bios or this can happen again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

those temps are not alright.,"i used the h150i and saw temps as low as 30. the highest was 80. i swapped to the arctic lf to remove the sata power cable requirement, temps lows haven't changed.",averages are a bit better.,"make sure

3. the pump is connected securely to the backplate and cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
okay so here's what you can do.,"go into the bios and where it says ai overclock mode, choose enforce all limits.","then navigate down to where it says core voltage offset and change this from auto to -0.05

turn off multi core enhancment or mce for short.",make sure both eps 12v plugs are in.,fire into windows and download and install a prgram called intel extreme tuning ultility.,fire it up and set the power limit to 90w.,when you are gaming that;s all you will be using at most.,you can also work on getting your core voltage off set lower.,"so for example mine is at -0.09 but other peeps on here have their's at -0.1

no way that cpu should be hitting those temps in game.,especially mw2.,iâ€™m assuming the highest temps are when the game is loading but stillâ€¦.average temps look ok-ish i guess.,iâ€™d definitely try a contact frame as aios have a flatter cold plate than most air coolers and the ihs bend affects aio temps more.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thx for the feedback.,i've seen mixed feedbacks about the a750 so i was quite hesitant between it and rx 6600. a750 is about 12% cheaper than an rx 6600 here.,"usage wise, mine is not much different from yours, mainly esports title and possibly some non 3a title (my current laptop cant handle it).",often uses davinci resolve for 1080p videos too.,"from your pov, do you think the 12% price difference worth the purchase?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it'll make the cpu faster.,if you're cpu limited that will make a big difference.,if you aren't it wont make a difference.,xmp does not have a large effect on power consumption regardless.,i think i measured 3w at the wall plug with 128gb of ddr4 3200 at light load.,probably more if you hammer the memory but that isn't so common.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well according to this at 1080p in some games it can give like +30fps but in some there's no difference (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjbnhchwlbo),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"from what i have researched, yes and no.","ddr4 runs at 1.2v, ddr5 runs at 1.1v, but it's more complicated than that.",ddr5 is still in it's infancy.,and similar to previous generations there is a period of time where the previous ddr version outperforms at the same frequency.,so like ddr4 3000 = ddr 5000 or something like that in terms of performance.,"so even though voltage is lower with ddr5, i would have to run it at a higher frequency to get the same performance, so in practice i don't think it's saving any power at all until ddr5 has a couple more years to improve.","it's also true that you can get dual channel with 1 stick of ddr5, however those channels aren't as large as single channels in ddr4, so you can't really get away with 1 stick unless you don't care about the impact on framerate lows.","by the way, i'm running ddr3 right now, so i'll still feel an improvement with ddr4.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my bad, seeing how you do not mind turning off xmp to lower your power consumption, i simply assumed you do not care about the performance hit.","i mean, if your main concern is energy efficiency, using corsair vengeance ram's specs as examples, ddr4 at stock speed 2133(no xmp) uses 1.2v, vs ddr5 4800 1.1v.","even with xmp, it is ddr4 3200 1.35v vs ddr5 6000 1.25v.","at these speeds both ddr4 and ddr5 perform very similarly but ddr5 has a clear advantage in power consumption, whether or not this is justifiable for the extra cost is for you to decide.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i mean, you might save a degree or two with some less old paste, but that doesn't sound too far off for all-core loads

also, by default, it will probably be using more voltage than what it needs, so at stock boost speeds you should be able to bring temps doen somewhat if you dial in the voltage a bit

but also, all-core loads are generally much hotter than what you'll ever see unless you are actually doing domething that's going to load your pc like, because games sure as hell don't

it replaces the default ilm (independent loading mechanism) which has been shown to provide uneven pressure on the cpu.,"here's a video explaining it more thoroughly

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysb25vsnbqi",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's a replacement for the lga1700 integrated loading mechanism (ilm).,the stock ilm applies uneven pressure that bends the cpu making cooler contact worse.,the contact frame holds the cpu in place while applying more even pressure to avoid bending the cpu.,the cpu cooler is installed on top like normal and then you get a good flat surface to flat surface contact.,it was very easy to install and reduced my temps by between 5c and 10c.,i was thermal throttling at 220 watts before and now i'm using 260 watts without any problems.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the 13700k is great (actually a bit overkill for gaming but who cares), nothing limited, i have an h100i 240mm elite capellix, 100c was only a cinebench thing tho, gaming was around 60-80c and now itâ€™s dropped like 6-8 degrees",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's not about the board.,some of the 12-13th gen cpu's ihs surfaces are bending in the middle when using the stock bracket.,due to that there is not enough contact between the cpu and heatsink.,manufacturing problem.,"you was lucky, just like me - my 13700k works perfectly fine without the contact frame aswell.","but there is a lot of people with cpus that are instantly throttling at 100c during the stress test, or just having temps way higher than it should be.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's part of the solution.,the temp drop is still noticeable and useful.,"i've tested this across i5 and i9, and several z690 mobos.","you still need the undervolt/lite load, but the frame also really helps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it changes a lot, first of all it prevents everything from getting dirty with thermal paste, it offers greater contact with the aio, it avoids blending and reduces the temperatures in idle and active.",even the rapidity with which the temperature drops after a stress test seems accelerated.,i'm also using the thermal paste of the same brand combined and i must say that it's very good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
possibly?,so unconfirmed whether it voids the warranty or intel invents a reason?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you're not modifying or causing damage to the cpu in away way, so how could it possibly cause a warranty issue?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not unless you donâ€™t screw it down properly.,how would you even get worse temperatures from it?,especially seeing that that stock bracket was causing the cpu to bend and not actually get cooled properly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"how's your mounting pressure, too?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you definitely have a mounting error or cooler just isnâ€™t working.,coming from someone that installed their artic 360 wrong two times.,make sure your pump mounting screws are tightened all the way.,on the pump and on the mother board.,one of my motherboard screws wasnâ€™t tightened all the way,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if you go into the bios and turn off multicore enhancement it should help a ton.,i had to do that as well.,for some reason these new boards have the power boost on max out the box.,i didnâ€™t notice any change in performance but my temps dropped like 20-30 celsius,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"this wonâ€™t fix the issue of temps being way higher, the maximum improvement from a contact frame is like 10c.",overvolting can make more than 20c of difference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it wonâ€™t fix the issue?,but it literally does.,"undervolting helps with temps (always did), but contact frame fixes overheating issue in the first place.","also contact frame improves temps by up to ~11c on paper, but in reality the difference can be much higher.","you canâ€™t see the real temp difference, because cpu is not going above ~100c due to throttling.",if it didnâ€™t throttle - temps would have been much higher.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it fixed it for me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
definitely not worth it if you are not overclocking and/or doing any heavy workloads.,messing with contact frame can cause some issues.,"those issues can be fixed, but it requires a lot of time.","you can't overtighten the screws, also they can't be too loose - if something is wrong, then you might not be able to boot, or it could cause some ram instabilities etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"maybe you are right, but you donâ€™t have any proof.","in any case, iâ€™ve never seen anyone with an improvement of over ~10c.",so thatâ€™s what iâ€™m going to believe for now.,you are just guessing that itâ€™s much higher.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

itâ€™s simple logic.,do you know what throttling is?,when cpu is reaching ~100c - it starts throttling itself a.k.a.,reducing the clocks/voltage in order to not exceed 100c.,that exists to prevent cpu damage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had an improvement of like 15c in max temps using y-cruncher.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the undervolt alone makes it run about 10c cooler, so definitely try it out and check how much lower voltage your chip can take!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if it doesn't throttle itself, it could end up at whatever number above that.",so it could stabilize at 101c.,it doesn't have to shoot up to 120c or whatever you are thinking it will.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"dude.. i will give you an example:

supposedly you have a good cpu and everything works as intended.",run cinebench or any stresstest --> lets say your temps are at 80c.,"leave it for 30-60min, temps are gonna spike to 85-90c or even more (depending on the cooler).",now we have a whole bunch of people with 12-13th gen intels who get to 100c instantly just after pressing cinebench/stress test start button - thermal throttling right away.,"so you are telling it is gonna ""stabilize"" at 101c?",literally unreal scenario.,"i've seen so many cases on reddit and forums, where people are insta throttling on stock settings and after installing the contact frame their temps normalized in 88-90c range.",idk why you are trying to defend it so hard.,it is a well known intel manufacturing problem.,"some cpus have this issue, some do not.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the temperature is not going to keep going up forever.,"once the heat being created is equal to the heat being removed by the cooler, the temperature will stay exactly the same no matter how long you run the stress test.",">so you are telling it is gonna ""stabilize"" at 101c?",literally unreal scenario.,"i'm not saying it will, i'm saying it's possible.",my point is that just because it's throttling at 100c doesn't mean it will shoot up much higher if you removed the thermal limit.,">i've seen so many cases on reddit and forums, where people are insta throttling on stock settings and after installing the contact frame their temps normalized in 88-90c range.","well it's not what i've seen, i saw people adjusting loadline calibration/""lite load"" settings to fix the instant throttling, because many motherboards are overvolting those cpus out of the box.",contact frames helped but the main fix is to adjust those settings.,"if your motherboard is overvolting your cpu so much that it wants to stabilize at 120c, installing the contact frame and getting a 10c improvement will still mean that your cpu wants to stay at 110c.","the contact frame is not the main fix for the thermal throttling problem, from what i've seen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
prob not.,"even if you play at 1080p, i wouldn't.",just not worth spending the money imo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you'd see some performance uplift but not enough to make it worthwhile unless you can find a buyer for your 12700k to offset some of the cost.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">6950xt or 4070ti)

how is this equal?",4070 ti is way more useful,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s a poor upgrade choice.,if you need more multi core performance you should be looking at the 13700k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nope.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not worth it from a 12700k.,"similar multi-threaded performance (stock vs stock), and if you oc that 12700k you can get within 5% of the 13600k's gaming performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

without e cores do you see higher idle temps.,i'm not even sure if that's how that works i assume the p cores will have to run the background programs so idle might be little more toasty.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

before i even read your message i knew you had an asrock motherboard.,the cpu will turn the system off before it gets to the point of physical damage.,asrock made a totally boneheaded and cpu-warranty-voiding move by setting tjmax to 115 degrees.,make sure you have set tjmax from â€œautoâ€ to â€œ100â€ in bios or this can happen again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you didn't crash, you likely didn't encounter any damage.","however, you'll want to lower the tjmax in the future to avoid any potential problems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it will be fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> the cpu will turn the system off before it gets to the point of physical damage.,not if the tjmax is raised.,"one time i had a cheap cooler and started a rendering job and walked off and i didn't realize the mobo had a tjmax of 125c

came back ~30 minutes later to a crashed/frozen system and afterwards i had to downclock my cpu (only by 100mhz, but still) or it would crash.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what does it idle at?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it should never run above 100c on any cooler.,should throttle before that.,"let me guess, asrock motherboard?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hey lhuerta6, it looks like you are having a cooling problem.",first - dont be afraid of 100c.,its normal for laptops.,"if youre running a high tdp load with a desktop i9 cpu, this is inevitable.",if youre hitting 100c in things like gaming and lighter tasks - then we have a problem.,"if thats the case, the first thing you want to do is to repaste the cooler.",taking it apart and putting it back together will solve the problem more often than you might believe.,"double check and make sure youre using the proper mounting equipment - using lga1200 mounts on a lga 1700 system might work, but performance wont be ideal.",make sure to test the cooler under power limited conditions before assuming its not working right.,"most non-sff coolers can handle loads of 200w, so test with a 200w power limit.","if youre still experiencing hot temperatures after checking all of the above, then its time to return the cooler or file a rma for repair.","*i am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.",please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/intel) if you have any questions or concerns.,*,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you have to limit pl2 to 181w and the thermal limit at 100c.,asrock for some reason unlocks everything.,!,[gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok so yeah the issue was the asrock motherboard who unlocked everything right off the bat.,it was allowing my cpu to hit way above 100 celsius without a thermal throttle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just running intel xu to see the temp it was in the 40's,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah!,[gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|dizzy_face) dont tell me thats known for being bad...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why is that?,181w is not a simple one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well.. yes.,"you should go to bios, and find tjmax setting(might be called different, its a max working temperature for cpu setting), and set it to 100c, so cpu starts to throttle at 100c as its supposed to.",running it above 100c can easily damage it.,"then easiest way to keep temperatures in check, is to adjust ac/dc loadline values.","lowering ac values lowers voltage boost under load, resulting in much lower temperatures.","its similar to undervolting, but usually much easier to do with less testing required.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because official tjmax of this cpu is 100c.,anything over and it should throttle to lower temperature.,its only with shitty asrock boards that it goes above 100c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i ran it through cinebench for 6-8 minutes, when i checked the temp it was at 113. should i return the cpu for a new one, so far i don't see any issue but im worried it will randomly die in a couple of months.","i think i have fixed the issue now, (found the tjmax value when looking through the bios for anything that could help and some fan settings)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
on asrock motherboards i think it's the opposite.,higher llc reduces voltage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh, i misread above.",i agree.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no it should be fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can you state your question more clearly?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
128 gb,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the systems which you find t cpu's in tend to have 2 sodimm slots, which allow a max of 2 32gb sodimm or 64gb total.","servethehome has a bunch of teardowns and reviews of these systems under their project ""tinyminimicro"".","if 64gb individual sodimms ever exist for ddr4 (unlikely at this point), they may or may not work.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
up to 4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the intel website states that the core i5 8500t can run with 128gb of ddr4.,"however, every other source states max ddr4 as 32gb.",would it be able to cope with 64gb  or even 128gb?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes the chip can handle up to 128gb but his board  has 2 slots.,so question is who sells 64gb so-dimm?,for op the correct answer is 64gb.,"(2x32gb)

op's question is answered until 64gb modules of ddr4 are readily available to public.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is your correct answer most likely.,yet some can only take up to 16gb sticks x2 and is most economic.,32gb  is a good amount for today's time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes it's a dell optiplex micro,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4 what?,ðÿ˜€,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you need to be more specific on what the 8500t is going into.,thatâ€™s whatâ€™s going to dictate maximum memory capability.,"whether the motherboard has 1, 2 or 4 modules.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was just being cheeky lol but good on you for providing relevant information,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the only ones that take 16gb sodimm *only* are atom based or the small core atom/pentium thin clients.,every big core cpu supports 32gb dimm as long as its 6th gen and up.,"(6th and 7th being unofficial support, but my 6500t runs them fine)

rather you can use the amount is up to what you do with it.",i max it out regularly but it's an esxi box.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sorry, 2 modules",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your intentions are noted and rewarded ðÿ˜‚,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6th/7th gen can be used ddr3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"6th and 7th gen are ddr4 platforms wrt sodimm

some laptops used soldered ddr3l, but no socketed ddr3 systems exist above 4th gen.

the only ddr3l you'll find on 6th or 7th is in said laptops or some nuc's that are limited to the dual core u series chips.",nucs and laptops in that generation with sodimm slots used ddr4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
im assuming this is a driver issue.,make sure you updated intel me firmware and me interface drivers.,then update bios,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
activate performance power mode in windows and see if that helps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what does the cpu temperature look like?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think this kinda fixed the issue!,"i still cant achieve full boosting performance of 5.8ghz after opening the league client, but now the p-cores run at 5.6 ghz which is a lot better than 3.  
thank you!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they get up to 95 degrees when stress testing with prime, when idle they sit around 20 - 30 degrees.","since the error already occurs when i open the league launcher, they still pretty much run on idle temps so i dont think it is thermal throttling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're welcome.,"iirc only the 2 prefered p cores hit 5.8ghz and that only when they are the only active cores, so usually you'll sit at 5.5 or 5.6 ghz when using more than 2 cores",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is odd.,does the same behavior happen in other games?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your power supply should come with 2 cpu cables.,one of them should have 2 seperate 4 pin connectors on the end.,i would go ahead and connect it since the 13900k draws a lot of power.,if you are only gaming it probably won't make any difference.,i think each 8 pin can supply like 225 watts or something like that.,so if you need more power than that you definitely want to add that extra 4 pin.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you dont need it unless heavy overclocking, mine has two 8 pins i believe and i only use one of them",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wow i love how the connections are hidden on the backside of the pc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for your feedback.,"oddly, i did not see the 4 pin connector cable in the box.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's very clean for sure.,"the issue i see with this case, other than the shit airflow, is the lack of space in the backside of the motherboard where all the wires have to go, it's very busy and i don't even have my drives installed yet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's going to be an 8 pin on the end that goes in the power supply and the other side will have 8 total pins but they will be split in half.,it might be labeled eps or cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thats not whats gonna happen unless ur completely cpu bottlenecked to 100fps...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, but just noticeable.","there's a bit of research into this, the smallest rate difference is about 20% for even experienced gamers.",what matters more is frametime consistency.,"a 24% faster cpu won't just be delivering frames faster, it will be more consistent as the bottleneck will move more often to the gpu.",when you account for frametime consistency it's really hard to notice 20% higher fps in a vacuum.,but it becomes absolutely obvious by 25%.,"this is the science behind how console games can feel smooth, fluid, and responsive at just 30fps and movies at 24fps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

>because they are testing cpus not gpus.,in lower resolutions the gpu won't bottleneck the cpu.,in some scenarios they're actually just testing the gpus ability to render at high framer ates.,"some games scale based on the cpus ability to submit work to the gpu, lowering the resolution reduces the amount of work the cpu has to do.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">  in what real world scenario is a 7900x3d going to be of any benefit

"grand strategy games, but then again unless you are doing some multicore stuff literally best to grab a 13600k or 7800x3d",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i know... just not really a realistic (or at least very rare) scenario imo.,like a good example of cpu bottleneck would be star citizen (and thats actually a game that benefits massively from x3d) in that game u might actually see the 20% improvement as fps.,almost no other game is gna show that i think,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's not a contradiction, the top cpu for gaming might be better by 1%, that doesn't mean it makes sense to buy over one that's 10% slower but 20% cheaper, that's an entirely different matter.","people don't always buy the best, by whatever metric used to make that judgement.","if your gaming upgrade is only providing a 20% boost it's probably not worth doing, it's just not particularly worth it for a barely noticeable gain.",i should state as well that the exact burden for noticeable difference depends more on the monitor than anything else.,a 60hz monitor can feel dramatically better with a 60fps game than a 55fps game due to the interval between frames.,a 120hz to 144hz change can be noticed in certain regions of frame interval timing because you're missing the window too often on one and not the other.,"a 60fps game feels better on a 120hz display than a 144hz one, for example.","try it out sometime, you might be surprised.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

try going into the easy mode and look there that's where mine is it says enable or disable intel stock power limits.,there's a good chance maybe you're bored is stock at the intel power limits.,but from what i'm hearing all of these manufacturers are using the so-called guidelines from intel and pushing these chips to the max out of the box.,that's why you're hearing all these scary stories about high temps for the intel 13th gen chips they run perfectly fine at intel stock power limits.,keep searching it might be in the cpu power management or the digi tab in the oc tab.,also in the advanced tab there are more cpu options.,the asrock boards break all these categories down in the folders for the dram the cpu the vrm.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you have a bigger aio so your temps should be even lower than mine and even without the contact frame (which i just installed 2 days ago) my temps were pretty much the same, i mainly installed the contact frame due to cpu bending worries not because of temps, it did drop my temps by like 2-3c nothing too significant",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
while your idle temps are worrying.,probably poor contact with your cooler.,or there is something running in hte background and it is making your cpu not idle.,the line of thinking is outdated for 12-13th gen. intel themselves say that high temps are normal and will not damage the cpu in anyway as long as its doesnt go over 115c.,i personally asked intel support.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the 212 is only rated for ~150 watts, so i don't think you can expect too much better without replacing your cooler (which you should absolutely do so you can get the performance you paid for out the 13700k f).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not only did you try to air cool a 13700k, but you picked an old, insufficient cooler to boot.",repasting it won't change that fact.,"most review sites say to not even bother trying to air cool it, and this is assuming you're buying a top tier air cooler.","if you are insisting on air cooling it, then you need a top tier cooler and to set some pretty strict power limits.",what you really need is a good aio if you really want to get the most out of your cpu.,"if your case can handle a 360mm radiator, then look at the arctic liquid freezer ii 360 or the ls720.","if you can only handle a 240mm radiator, then the only aio that could keep up without any power limits is the ls520.",ls520 can be had for about $100,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"as it has been said, the hyper 212 is rated for 150w tdp but the cpu can draw 253w or more, the cooler is clearly not up for the task.","but there are ways to mitigate this temporarily at least until you get a better cooler:

in bios settings:

1)  manually limiting your pl1 and pl2 to 150w (this will severely throttle your cpu to meet your current cooler's specs, you will lose performance but it should still be good enough for gaming)  
2) set a custom tjmax  temperature to whatever you feel safe, the cpu will automatically throttle itself when it reaches the set temperature.","3) underclock, undervolt, disabling cores, etc to lower the power draw but requires some trial and error to avoid instability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you're using cpu only for games - you can limit pl1/pl2 to 100w.,this will help you out in this situation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
actually at 150w pl you shouldn't be losing any gaming performance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the mechanical design of the socket 1700 retention mechanism sucks and can create a concave shape in the cpu ihs that causes poor cpu/cooler contact.,"start with one of these:  [https://www.amazon.com/thermalright-intel12th13th-generation-anti-bending-installation/dp/b0b5q5zwnq](https://www.amazon.com/thermalright-intel12th13th-generation-anti-bending-installation/dp/b0b5q5zwnq)

i'd also disable mce / multi-core-enhancement (asus), enhanced turbo (msi), enhanced multi-core performance (gigabyte), etc...   in the bios.. and watch this video: [https://youtu.be/dnfgswztvyc](https://youtu.be/dnfgswztvyc)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's normal considering that 253w is a lot of heat and you're on air cooler.,the case cooling is also important there.,personally i have a 13700k with a noctua nh-u12a and it usually doesn't hit 100âºc on a single run but it does if i use the 10 minute run (stock settings).,what you can do if this bothers you is either lower the power limit to something below the stock 253w reference or apply a negative voltage offset (something like -0.050 is a safe starting point).,or both things.,your idle temps are alright so it doesn't look like there is something wrong in the installation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that is because the a770 is not exactly the best graphics card for use with davinci resolve.,take a look at [these benchmarks](https://www.pugetsystems.com/solutions/video-editing-workstations/davinci-resolve/hardware-recommendations/#gpu) from puget systems.,nvidia cards leads the pack and intel comes in dead last.,even your 3060 ti posts almost double the score that the a770 does.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the intel uhd 770 has twice the quicksync engines compared to the uhd 730 i think.,"(this should also be true compared to the uhd 750)

"50% top video decode, vram constant around 70% - with igpu turned off.",igpu turned on then arc would idle and not decode at all (likely resolve's fault not knowing to give arc work).,i'm also running 11th gen so no deep link maybe they just forgot about us.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ironically resolve is one of the poster application when they highlight deep link.,and when apple silicon was first introduced hw encode decode was supported from day 1 blackmagic even released parallel m1 version softwares for quite some time until they merged.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i saw the pudget article and still pulled the trigger because their score is the aggregate of many different codecs (264/265/raw) resolve is extremely cuda friendly overall for sure.,but nv 20/30/40 also doesnâ€™t have hevc 10bit 422 hw decode at all - so i was hoping a770 would be the magical pill for my particular use case.,maybe it isnâ€™t.,it does feel like a missed opportunity for arc - most pro cameras can shoot hevc now and it will take years for sony and canon to adopt av1.,apple silicon does remarkably well up to 10bit 420 but 422 its media decoder starts to fall apart too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that's exactly where my question is going with - are all quicksync equal?,igpu alone can decode however it stutters for playback.,would upgrading to 13th gen help?,is there a way to benchmark quicksync performance?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nv 30/40 all have the same decoder (or the lack of, for hevc) so i'm not going to bother with a nv gpu upgrade since i'm not bottlenecked by vram anyway.",if i'm running atx i would definitely keep the a770 - but my build is itx upgrading the mb just for the encoder feels silly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

valid points here.,"will agree to disagree on undervolting in specific applications eg for work from home business use, the questionable stability over time from an undervolt would push me more towards power limiting over undervolting in those scenarios.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the contact frame is insurance against a known issue with deflection of the cpu's ihs due to the design of the mounting bracket on all socket 1700 motherboards.,it can improve temperatures by improving contact between the cooling solution and the top of the cpu by providing a flatter contact surface as well as potentially improve memory compatibility and timings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if the testing methodology is so inconsistent that a 13900k is running slower than a 13700k at clock speed parity, what's to say that the 1% lows he's getting on the 13600k isn't a result of shader compilation, background processes, or simply misconfiguration?","the memory speed is different, and we don't know anything about the timings which actually affect performance: rcd, ras, rrd, refi, and tertiary subtimings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the 13900k/13700k hitting similar benchmark numbers (within margin of error) at the point that the game is gpu bottlenecked is absolutely normal...  the tester even called this fact out in his video.,he's actually giving the 13600k the benefit of the doubt with faster memory timings than the other cpu's to reflect a scenario where someone may be overclocking to maximize their performance.,"certainly sub timings matter, but the impact it has on system performance should generally be reflected in higher/lower gb/s throughput values which, in his test, clearly give the 13600k a 1.5 gb/s advantage.",if anything normalizing at xmp/docp or jdec values would likely make the results for the 13600k look even worse.,"your assertion that the 13600k is just as ""futureproof"" as the other i7/i9 processors simply doesn't make sense... it might if we were talking about am5 where there will be at least another generation or two of cpu's on the same socket... with the 13600k you are buying a processor that is already a bottleneck for current generation gpu's (the 4080/90+) but can only be upgraded to another faster raptor lake cpu.","spending the $80 now to go with a 13700k over a 13600k is not a bad ""futureproofing"" option, imho.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"his testing started actually attempting to prove that the ""6 core cpu was dead""... but through testing and process of elimination he made the discovery that his originally hypothesis was incorrect, and the differences were in cache vs core related.","he did not set out to ""prove"" what he believed, he admitted that what he set out to prove originally was wrong, and then followed the data to a logical explanation which led him to the cache explanation.","here is the original video..

i don't know?,"it can technically reach high speeds but not while mantaining gear 1 mode (which afaik sinchronyzes the imc to the memory frequency, while gear 2 cuts it in half increasing latency significantly, a bit like what happens with amd).",why they chose to do this is unknown to me.,"12th/13th gen actually needs to run in gear 2 for ddr5 (but it doesn't impact latency as much because ddr5 freuqency is much higher), so maybe the reason is to have a memory controller that works both with ddr4 and ddr5.",although this doesn't explain why 11th gen adopted this system too (it only supports ddr4).,also skylake had an hybrid imc too since it works with ddr3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ddr4 will be ancient tech by the time games are recommending 64gb.,this would be like attempting to future-proof with ddr3 back in 2016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
games recommended specs are questionable at best most of the times.,"16gb is still enough for (almost) everything, 32gb is already overkill but reasonable for futureproofing.",64gb is just wasted money for only gaming.,and even in the remote possibility 64gb actually becomes necessary you can just add another 2 sticks at any time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

heat honestly isn't going to kill a cpu **but...**  cpu manufactures (especially intel) push cpu's *way*  past efficiency these days.,cpu's have an efficiency curve that drops off *really* fast.,"*(ex, that last 10% of performance cost you as much wattage as the first 90%)*

it is only common for cpu that is using very high voltage.,i recently run into an issue where a z690 motherboard gave my 13700k 1.37v of power by default at the default clock speed.,which is very high.,the processor only needs 1.17v to be stable at default.,i recommend checking and seeing what voltage your cpu is using underload by installing cpu-z.,most cooler really shouldn't have a problem handling 200 - 250w.,so unless your processor is using a lot more it shouldn't need to throttle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

in my opinion throttling is acceptable in a laptop but absolutely not in a workstation where your time is money.,buy a better cooler so that you aren't throttling down in performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have a custom loop running the 13900k at nearly 400w.,all core 5.8ghz (4.4ghz for the e-cores).,"it throttles under stress testing after a few seconds because my water block canâ€™t keep up, down to about 350w (5.7ghz all core).",it doesnâ€™t throttle at all at stock clocks.,cinebench and blender are the only things that keep it at 100â°c.,"a 32-thread contrived gcc build (on linux) keeps the package at about 80â°c, when it can make use of all of the threads.","most of my real builds simply donâ€™t have enough parallelizable tasks, so in those cases (when only 50-70% of the cores are in use most of the time) the package sits around 60â°c.","unless your builds are very very nicely set up, and you can max out every core for the entire build, you have absolutely nothing to worry about if you go for a custom loop (aside from power draw).","even with constant 100% load youâ€™re likely still fine, since compilers usually arenâ€™t as stressful as something like cinebench or prime95.","i would imagine youâ€™d be fine with a large aio, but would stay away from an air cooler, since it will likely heat soak before your builds finish.",stress tests arenâ€™t a useful temperature indicator for anything other than identical workloads.,"also everything (except, for instance, rendering) will be less stressful than cinebench.",these tests are most useful for stability tests and bragging rights.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"power draw directly influences temperatures, so if you're scared to keep it at 100c everything that contributes to lowering power draw will help.","even then, 100c won't cause the cpu to die in a couple years if that's what you're wondering.","it's also worth noting that temperature isn't the only thing that can damage a cpu, current and voltage matter just as much.","if you want to maximize performance, you'll always end up running the cpu as close to 100c as possible without throttling.","if you want temps to be as low possible you can get a contact frame and delid and replace the ihs, or even go direct die.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah, i did a bit more investigation, some tests etc and found that it hits 100c not so often, even with bad cooling.",in singlecore tests it reaches around 60-70c (and cpu cooler isn't at full speed) and running 5.8ghz clock speed.,"futhermore, when it reach 100c degrees - it continue maintaining stable 4.7ghz for me, without going down or some other spikes, so i think i can keep turbo boost on, despite i use not so good cooling solution right now",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thanks for the reply.,my issue with cinebench is thatâ€™s itâ€™s relatively short.,rendering sometimes takes hours.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it could be because the 90c throttling limit is in effect which downclock your cpu during cinabench r23 run resulting in lower score.,you can improve score by setting temp throttle limit to 100c and above in the bios.,though i must say doing that wont net you any extra performance outside of cinabench unless you also do a lot of heavy rendering workload since normal applications and games dont stress your cpu that much.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thanks a lot.,much appreciated.,finally someone who understands.,all the other people here we just saying how shitty the cpu is.,but what i really wanted to know is how good it is from the i5.,i too wanna max out my system.,then move slowly towards upgrades.,because i currently donâ€™t have the budget to move on to the newer i5â€™s as that would require the whole platform change including mobo and ram.,which i currently donâ€™t have the money for.,iâ€™ll be seeing how this i7 works.,thanks again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

whatever performance you might stand to gain is completely situational.,"some games benefit quite a lot from the extra threads hyperthreading provides, and some donâ€™t.","in the best case scenario youâ€™d probably gain about 30% performance, and in a bad case no performance gain.",temper your expectations accordingly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30$ is all i would consider especially if it's not a k version,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wanted to go from an i5 4690k to an i7 4790k or 4770k only for the extra threads.,but the chips aren't worth slight gains.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how much of a budget do you have?,"i got an i7 6700 a few years ago complete with 16 gb ram, a 180 gb ssd and a 1 tb hdd for 200 bucks.",nowadays you can find 7700s,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"""killing it"" is a quite a bit much to say :d but anyhow, the i7 is better than the i5 so if you want to make a cheap upgrade you can do that.","if you have a z-variant motherboard and get the k-variant cpu, then you can get some decent gains from overclocking.",that was still the cpu gen that benefited a lot from overclocking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

imagine you asking for performance upgrade in upgrading your processor and you get replies like thatâ€™s an old processor and it canâ€™t game and everything but the answer you were looking for.,youâ€™d get irritated too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
true.,it really is nice that you try to find upgrade paths on your current platform and i gave you some tips (besides hardware) on how to proceed.,most of the cautioning comments here are more directed towards you spending real money on upgrading that platform.,"if you can the the new part for almost free, then go for it, but if you need to spend some real non-insignificant money, then we are immediately in the discussion on whether you could have gotten a cheap ryzen 5 5500/5600 or i3-12100 or 13100 instead for hugely more powerful system.",many times the price for old hardware is very inflated contrary to what it can do compared to the cheapest stuff that is available on modern or 1 gen behind hardware.,"all that being said: if you can get it very cheaply, then an upgrade is an upgrade and go for it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because then iâ€™d have to upgrade the entire setup including mobo and ram.,"originally had a 1050ti, but then got 3060 as a gift.","i5 was staying at 100 all the damn time, so i thought iâ€™d upgrade to i7.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

np.,thanks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then save for new cpu mobo and ram.,don't waste your money on an old chip that's going to give you nothing performance wise,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
im just comparing.,meaning to say itâ€™s not complete shit if itâ€™s old.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if the cpu is still working in the system then you probably didnâ€™t damage anything.,if you did you would have issues like memory channels not working or the system not posting at all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i hope you are right.,hope i didn't break anything.,thanks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i've got comparison results with 13 coolers here:

i think that all sounds normal for an unrestrained 13900k.,"you could try putting a power limit at 150w and then seeing your max temps after 10 min cinebench, if it is scaling down p, then probably all is well.",i canâ€™t say from experience but i think a bad mount or faulty cooler will be very obvious right away.,"like high idle temps, throttling at low load, that sort of thing.","i had a 45w xeon that was overheating once, i couldnâ€™t even post.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

kinda low score due to thermal throttling.,but i had the same with stock settings.,now i'm getting around 40k with capped pl1 and pl2 @ 253w.,also max temps of around 85-88c after 10 mins of c23.,"using the following settings in bios:

ac/dc: power saving

llc: standard

adaptive vcore with an offset of -0.065v (more resulted in unstable c23 runs but was fine in games, so try around with what your silicon tolerates) c23 runs with \~1.170v - 1.185v.","while gaming peaks up to \~1.275v but averages at around 1.23. temps around 55c, some games push it to 60c.",(\~20c ambient),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have the same cooler and the same processor.,"a single pass of c23 for me nets 40100 or there abouts with unlocked power and boost, no overclock.","and temps hit 90c in a single pass

i am not using a contact frame.",couple of simple things you might check.,1. what are the pump and fans settings in icue?,"2. how is the radiator mounted
3. what is the coolant temp after running for a while (should help see if you are getting good thermal transfer, ie: mount is good)
4. what are your ambient temps like?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the reply.,i'm just wondering if i'm getting proper cooling out of my h150i as my results seem to be more in line with air coolers.,"i don't know a lot about this stuff though, so i'm wondering if i've been setting up the tests and interpreting the results correctly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not the case for me with an ek basic aio and thermal grizzly contact frame and thermal grizzly kryonaut i get 90 c at sustained load of 295 watts (power limits disabled).,it does sound like a jet fighter preparing to take off thoðÿ˜…,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you!,that's kind of what i was thinking based on what i've read.,"i can run cinebench for half an hour on unlimited power without much of a difference in the score, so i think my cooler will be fine for what i'm doing.",the performance just seems a little worse than what i'm seeing in some places.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
agreed that these are normal temps for unrestrained 13900k under stress-test type loads,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

performance at the very top end is a mix of cooler capacity but also silicon lottery.,the 13th have a self-reported voltage/frequency curve in the bios.,those that hit their top frequencies at lower voltages will get higher scores because they can sustain higher clocks within power/thermal limits.,so some variation is normal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what numbers do you mean?,i capped them at 253w.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
those all sound good.,my radiator is also at the top.,the only difference is i run the fans and pump at 'extreme'.,it isn't loud in my opinion.,i guess i did change the fans that came with the cooler to 120ll rgb fans so that might be different too.,sounds like your coolant is heating up which mean there shouldn't be a mounting issue.,overall sounds alright to me.,cooling isn't ever going to be exactly the same.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my motherboard for some reason disables power limits by default.,so the only thing i change in the bios is the fan curve and i enable xmp.,"that's it, i don't touch anything else like voltage, ratios, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm getting a similar score with even lower temps.,"no contact frame, mx4 paste and a 360mm kraken z73 aio.",see my post above.,with an offset of like -0.050v or more you can get the power draw and temps even lower than mine with the same benchmark result.,got around 40k with capped 253w power draw.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh okay, sorry i'm new to this and i was thinking there was a way to set the p1 and p2 to specific values and the 253w was a separate setting haha but i figured it out now!",thank you!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"when you run cinebench, the cpu clock will drop and you will have average core clock in task manager,

to what speed it drops?",you mind sharing some bios pictures of your settings for clocks?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no worries, 253w is what intel themselves recommends, so i set both pl to this number.","most i've ever seen the cpu take in was around 160w anyway while gaming, usually way lower at like 80-130w.",guess that really depends on the game and resolution ur playing at.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just ran a 10-minute test and watched the cpu clock in task manager the whole time.,the readings ranged from the mid 4.5 ghz range to the low 4.7 ghz range.,"toward the end of the test, the clock mostly stayed in the mid 4.5 ghz range.",which bios settings would you like to see?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i tried setting both values to 253w and ran a cinebench score but i still hit 100c.,running same cooler as op so i lowered it down to 241w and now i get a max of 90c with a 10 min cinebench test.,while gaming i barley scratch 75c running at 4k!,before i would hit 100c within 5 min with the default settings in bios.,it's insane how hot intel wants these new cpus to run right out of the box.,this has been my first ever experience with over/under clocking a cpu and it's been a headache to say the least,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's about same as mine, i am running 4.82 ghz with 253 pl1/2 and adaptive negative offset of 0.05 (10min test).","love to see a picture of the clocks, is it running on stock auto, turbo, etc for p and e cores.","llc mode, cpu lite load, ac/dc and if you disabled/enabled  eist and intel turbo boost.",what motherboard you using?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"they get up to 95 degrees when stress testing with prime, when idle they sit around 20 - 30 degrees.","since the error already occurs when i open the league launcher, they still pretty much run on idle temps so i dont think it is thermal throttling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're welcome.,"iirc only the 2 prefered p cores hit 5.8ghz and that only when they are the only active cores, so usually you'll sit at 5.5 or 5.6 ghz when using more than 2 cores",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"seeing as there is at least a 15 cm air gap between the cooler and the cpu's heatsink, i would say that is pretty bad contact.",air is a great insulator by the way.,"anyhow, that being said.",its fine as long as the pressure is even.,the ihs does not seem to be totally even (its a bit curved) but there is most contact in the center where the die is.,you will see in temps if you have a problem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you need flattener.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what cooler are you using?,does it have an lga 1700 bracket?,pressure looks mostly in the centre?,if it works it works.,temperature tests ok?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seems ok..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the ihs cold plate flatness from cpu to cpu seems to vary widely.,"for my last two builds i have lapped my ihs, i have been buying cheap broken motherboards from ebay and then i [cut out the cpu socket](https://imgur.com/a/vqkwzcx) with a dremel and use it as a lapping tool to lap the ihs in its clamped condition.",i have been getting really good results doing this.,"so far i've made lapping tools for lga 1200 and lga 1700.  i will give the lga 1200 version away to anyone who wants it, dm me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it looks okay, but i suggest buying a contact frame regardless.","you get better performance but more importantly, your cpu wont warp over time.",the thermalright frame is only $5-$10 and  i have used it on 3 builds with noticeable drops in temps with even contact.,"your contact area may be good now, but months down the line it will lean to one side and slowly and progressively get worse.",cheers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pretty typical for lga1700,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we can't really tell either as its a really bad photo and the cpu is out of focus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's ok-ish, nothing too fancy, but entire middle lane has a good pressure, i'd say 6c drop would be the most you may expect with a contact frame.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you want it to be touching the cpu heatplate or else it's not going to work man.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"bad, install frame",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
decent contact.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you need a thermal paste applicator,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bad.,you're about 15cm away from the cpu at this point,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's bad, needs to be touching the cpu and then screwed in place for it to be effective.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's good enough, but you can tell the cpu is flexing/bending a bit where it is held down by the bracket.",hence the hour glass look of paste.,a contact frame helps with the bending a bit and temps but once it flexes it seems to stay that way.,it's a flaw of intel cpu's being more rectangle  now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you definitely put too much paste on it bro.,lol.,"the point of using thermal paste is not to cover the entire cpu really, itâ€™s to fill in micro scratches that exist between the cpu plate and the heat sink plate.",you do want thorough coverage across the top of the cpu but you want it to be very thin.,i highly recommend you use a cpu contact frame.,it will get you a much better connection to the cpu which will give you lower temps and they only cost like $10.,i recommend the thermal grizzly contact frame.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's definitely bad, would recommend wiping it all off and applying the thermal paste directly on the cpu, and spreading it so it's completely covered.",i never liked using the thermal paste that came with aio's,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's bad ðÿ˜¬ i would recommend you a contac frame, but after being so bended already idk if it can make a difference

not enough thermal paste.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's okay, with that much paste it wasn't making contact before that either :p",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is a flattener?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i 100% agree with this.,by looking at your spread.,the heatsink is slightly (sub .2mm) higher than the avg rpl/adl.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

all you can do is get a different laptop and make sure it says it has a dedicated gpu.,"the i5 460 is also very old at this point, over 12 years old.",this wouldnâ€™t be a good laptop for gaming either way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i came to the same realization when i got my 13700k + z690 mobo.,was hoping to keep my corsair hx650.,but ended up getting an used rm850x from fb marketplace.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's fine.,unless you're going extreme overclocked.,doubt there will be any issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've never once connected anything to the extra 4 pin.,i don't do anything crazy with my cpu either.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

im not using the extra 4 pins with my 13600k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dont need it.,but the extra 4 pins is for overclocking.,one 8pin is enough to supply around 300 watts itself fine with airflow.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most of the more expensive motherboards include more vrm cooling and capacity for overclocking so its nothing b760 can't do unless intel has gone and changed that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

every week people ask this question even though the answer is always provided in the motherboard manual.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in my experience it's needed if your mobo does automatic all-core oc.,sometimes called enhanced turbo or something.,otherwise it won't be stable.,so either plug it in or disable all-core overclocking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

253 is the bare minimum half decent cables will do almost 400. the extra connector is basically needed only for sub zero overclock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
always.,no harm having more redundancy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
235 watts for one 8 pin so can overclock too especially on 13600k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i run my 12900ks on a single 8pin cable and it pulls up to 300w in cb r20.,"i'd say it's fine, especially with a 13600k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nah, the motherboard manuals are almost always obscure about it.","gigabyte has a manual that says ""plug in the 12v or the computer will not  boot"", asus has a motherboard manual that says ""ensure the 12v is connected"".","and neither of those two manuals (among a bunch of others i've glanced over) says ""no need for both unless you overclock"".","just this week for the first time i saw a manual that said ""no need"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"uuuuuuuuuuuuh, no, they're not, rotfl.",where'd you get that number from xd.,"8-pin can handle just a shy from 400w before it starts getting really warm, but are rated well below that.",it will be long melted before it even reaches 800w.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yup, you don't need a second 8 pin or 4 pin unless your doing extreme overclocking with ln2 or dry ice.",a single 8 pin is all you need regardless of which cpu your running.,my current system has a 16 core 5950x and i'm only using a single 8 pin...my new am5 system will have a 7950x but also only needs a single 8 pin.m.you can overclock it too with no problem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
check your motherboard manual.,that might be for additional pcie power.,"in which case, its necessity would depend on your video card.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you sure it doesn't?,some psu will have a split 8 pin that can be used as a 4 pin for cou.,double check the manual and labeling on the cables.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it probably has it.,the 8 pin connectors break into two 4 pins.,they are clipped to each other.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am quite certain that your psu just wasnt packaged with the cable.,you should be able to use a cpu port from your psu with the proper cable.,"(i am being downvoted for the right answer, that is so very reddit.)","there are 8pin to 4pin cables

go for the z board.,b boards are known to be quirky and broken when paired with 13th gen especially related to undervolting which is a must for most if not all systems with 13th gen chips.,the reason is the stock bios settings are way too agressive which leads to temps reaching 100 c almost instantly under load.,i ran mine with a b board at first but temps were horrendous.,"when ""undervolting"" the undervolt protection kicked in hard and led to massive performance drops.",it cant be disabled either.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you can just manually limit the pl1 and pl2 voltages though.,"i capped mine at 145w (for both) and lost a whopping 500ish points on r23 (from 23,100 or so to 22,550 or therabouts) and it still boosts to 5.1ghz on all six p-cores.",there was no real world or gaming performance loss,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

how to do that?,is it in the bios?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the experience i had was that i could get it down to around 90ish.,"would still occasionally throttle on two individual cores and drop the clocks to under 4. 
with a z series board i can overclock to 5.5 and keep it under 80. 
not much point in spending the extra for a k series if you can't mess around with the clocks.","be as well just get a non k. 
i'm on itx which might not help with temps though.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, asus 760i",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it is on my asus b660i, and id assume your board would have it as well, but im not 100% sure where in the bios it would be.",in the b660i bios its under a heading called â€œinternal cpu power managementâ€.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the stock coolers have always been garbage, what's new?",also it won't have any performance penalty when gaming (other than perhaps louder fans).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if you simply throw out the stock cooler, the 13500 is still ~$100 cheaper than the 13600k.",and anyone who has no problem paying $100 more should get the 13600k anyways!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's a rebranded and locked alder lake cpu.,it does not have the enhanced raptor cove cores,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that 13500 would be fine if you buy a decent cooler for it.,the bundled intel cooler has been junk for years.,and probably not helped by the lga1700 socket mechanism not holding the cpu flat in the socket.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12400f could have been a better choice given the right mobo for overclocking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
...why would you use a stock cooler???,nothing wrong with the chip its the cooling solution,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
people saying the stock coolers suck and always have are not correct.,"i built a haswell system with a celeron and ran stock cooler until last year when i took that cooler (at that point 8-9 years old) and put it on an i7-4790, where it runs now and stably at 100% cpu.","no idea what the temp is but anyway ;) it's possible these days the coolers suck, although i know they are fine at least on the i3s.",the benefit of the i5-13500 is only recognized if you're saving a cooler cost.,"right now on newegg the i5-13600k is $309 and a i5-13500 is $290, so in theory at least $60 cheaper (13600k+a $40 air cooler).",if the stock cooler is no good for that chip anyway the chip makes no sense.,"just spend a few more bucks for the 600, so i agree with op on that!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 13500 is not supposed to be good for gaming.,itâ€™s barely faster than a ryzen 5600x.,itâ€™s meant to be a productivity powerhouse with a low cost of entry.,if you want gaming performance get the 13600k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all i read here is that you don't understand computers.,"intel's stock coolers won't run their chips at full power, neither will amd's one, although they have much better performance in low wattages application (aka gaming).",you also need to pair the 13500 with ddr5 to get performance in line with the 7600/x for gaming.,"but at that point, just buy a 13400 if you don't care about multicore performance and save even more money.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"good points, op.","the stock coolers are always trash and should be replaced, but that's just adding to the cost.","the most noteworthy thing is the 13500 uses last gens alder lake p cores, so really you're just getting a refreshed alder lake, not a raptor lake cpu.","to get that, the minimum price of entry is the 13600k.","with the recent lowering of msrp, i don't see any reason to buy anything below a 13600k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"13400 and 13600 makes the 13500 too awkward tbh, it's not cheap as 13400 but ot doesn't act good as 13600k",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, intel stock coolers have always been garbage.","amd's have ranged from ""at least it's not an intel stock cooler"" to ""hey you can actually overclock a bit with this thing"".",i threw together a system with spare parts and managed to get 3.9ghz out of a ryzen 1700 on a wraith spire rgb.,"legitimately, the spire and above are solid for what they are.",the only one that kind of sucks is the wraith stealth.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i can't see an i5-13500 for more than like $20 cheaper right now...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol it's not fine in gaming.,it's significantly weaker than 13600kf .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"cut half compared to 13600kf, it performs closer to 12600kf than 13600kf in gaming.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> the 13500 is not supposed to be good for gaming.,itâ€™s barely faster than a ryzen 5600x.,sounds pretty good for gaming,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
actually 7600 non x is faily great for stock coolers.,also it has eco mode.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, msrp wise the 13500 is $232 and the 13600k $319.",so i guess more $87ish.,"but the 13500 might be overpriced since itâ€™s new, and the 13600k more discounted.",i still feel the 13500 is the best value model - although in some performance/cost calculations i did the 13600 is also worth the extra cost.,"but if you can afford it, the 13600k is the better cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"itâ€™s fairly behind the curve with affordable options like 5800x3d, 7600/x and 13600k being much faster",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"true, i forgot right now they are inflating well over msrp on the 13500.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

let me tell you this.. my 690 edge(cheap) and my z790 tachyon have same r23 score at 42450k.,my z790 can run 8000+ ram and i love it.,if you have ddr4 buy edge.,easy oc for 13900k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a msi pro z790-a wifi and it's held up excellently with my 13700k and has no issues at all with my 32gb of ddr5 6000 cl30.,unless you really need certain features on those motherboards you probably don't need to spend much on z790 motherboards.,which cpu are you planning to get?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it should be 5.5 all core.,5.8 happens briefly on 2 cores at a time and itâ€™s so brief you wonâ€™t really notice it.,5.6 on all cores is an overclock.,the fact that 3 e cores are stuck at 3ghz maybe a sign that you are overclocking and may not be aware.,13900 should be 5.5ghz all p core and 4.3 all e cores.,perhaps your bios has been set to keep 3 e cores running lower speeds to allow for the 5.6 all p core oc?,5.6 all p core oc is easy enough to do but it does seem like youâ€™re running oc and thatâ€™s the reason for these oddities,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yes, but just noticeable.","there's a bit of research into this, the smallest rate difference is about 20% for even experienced gamers.",what matters more is frametime consistency.,"a 24% faster cpu won't just be delivering frames faster, it will be more consistent as the bottleneck will move more often to the gpu.",when you account for frametime consistency it's really hard to notice 20% higher fps in a vacuum.,but it becomes absolutely obvious by 25%.,"this is the science behind how console games can feel smooth, fluid, and responsive at just 30fps and movies at 24fps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i know... just not really a realistic (or at least very rare) scenario imo.,like a good example of cpu bottleneck would be star citizen (and thats actually a game that benefits massively from x3d) in that game u might actually see the 20% improvement as fps.,almost no other game is gna show that i think,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's not a contradiction, the top cpu for gaming might be better by 1%, that doesn't mean it makes sense to buy over one that's 10% slower but 20% cheaper, that's an entirely different matter.","people don't always buy the best, by whatever metric used to make that judgement.","if your gaming upgrade is only providing a 20% boost it's probably not worth doing, it's just not particularly worth it for a barely noticeable gain.",i should state as well that the exact burden for noticeable difference depends more on the monitor than anything else.,a 60hz monitor can feel dramatically better with a 60fps game than a 55fps game due to the interval between frames.,a 120hz to 144hz change can be noticed in certain regions of frame interval timing because you're missing the window too often on one and not the other.,"a 60fps game feels better on a 120hz display than a 144hz one, for example.","try it out sometime, you might be surprised.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes the chip can handle up to 128gb but his board  has 2 slots.,so question is who sells 64gb so-dimm?,for op the correct answer is 64gb.,"(2x32gb)

op's question is answered until 64gb modules of ddr4 are readily available to public.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is your correct answer most likely.,yet some can only take up to 16gb sticks x2 and is most economic.,32gb  is a good amount for today's time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes it's a dell optiplex micro,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i was just being cheeky lol but good on you for providing relevant information,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the only ones that take 16gb sodimm *only* are atom based or the small core atom/pentium thin clients.,every big core cpu supports 32gb dimm as long as its 6th gen and up.,"(6th and 7th being unofficial support, but my 6500t runs them fine)

the ambient temp is 20c.,the idle temp is 45 to 55. if i start playing something  like league of legends it goes to the 73 but if i play something like start citizen  just for being in the menu it goes to 90 to 95 if i activate the full speed of the fans i have 5 fans attached to the aio and 1 in the back of the desktop without counting the ones that the gpu have that is a 3070,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the 75 is still kinda high for a gaming load.,i would think mid 60s is more normal.,"hell, i screwed up mounting my gpu block and half of it was making contact.",i was at the same temps as you while playing apex.,then i remounted it and dropped down to 38 idle.,it really sounds like itâ€™s a bad mount or the pump is dying.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes you are able to remove the top and front panels i don't recommend taking the top one because  i dint see any improvement but taking the front one helps a little,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is the solid version,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it was the thermal paste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"your fine, you donâ€™t have to be too concerned unless your in the high 80s and low 90s.","but as always, the lower the better",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it'll make the cpu faster.,if you're cpu limited that will make a big difference.,if you aren't it wont make a difference.,xmp does not have a large effect on power consumption regardless.,i think i measured 3w at the wall plug with 128gb of ddr4 3200 at light load.,probably more if you hammer the memory but that isn't so common.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well according to this at 1080p in some games it can give like +30fps but in some there's no difference (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjbnhchwlbo),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's probably a bit too late but worth a mention, ddr5 is more power efficient than ddr4 and if that is what you want you might wanna consider exchanging your purchases.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"from what i have researched, yes and no.","ddr4 runs at 1.2v, ddr5 runs at 1.1v, but it's more complicated than that.",ddr5 is still in it's infancy.,and similar to previous generations there is a period of time where the previous ddr version outperforms at the same frequency.,so like ddr4 3000 = ddr 5000 or something like that in terms of performance.,"so even though voltage is lower with ddr5, i would have to run it at a higher frequency to get the same performance, so in practice i don't think it's saving any power at all until ddr5 has a couple more years to improve.","it's also true that you can get dual channel with 1 stick of ddr5, however those channels aren't as large as single channels in ddr4, so you can't really get away with 1 stick unless you don't care about the impact on framerate lows.","by the way, i'm running ddr3 right now, so i'll still feel an improvement with ddr4.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my bad, seeing how you do not mind turning off xmp to lower your power consumption, i simply assumed you do not care about the performance hit.","i mean, if your main concern is energy efficiency, using corsair vengeance ram's specs as examples, ddr4 at stock speed 2133(no xmp) uses 1.2v, vs ddr5 4800 1.1v.","even with xmp, it is ddr4 3200 1.35v vs ddr5 6000 1.25v.","at these speeds both ddr4 and ddr5 perform very similarly but ddr5 has a clear advantage in power consumption, whether or not this is justifiable for the extra cost is for you to decide.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

your power supply should come with 2 cpu cables.,one of them should have 2 seperate 4 pin connectors on the end.,i would go ahead and connect it since the 13900k draws a lot of power.,if you are only gaming it probably won't make any difference.,i think each 8 pin can supply like 225 watts or something like that.,so if you need more power than that you definitely want to add that extra 4 pin.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's very clean for sure.,"the issue i see with this case, other than the shit airflow, is the lack of space in the backside of the motherboard where all the wires have to go, it's very busy and i don't even have my drives installed yet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's going to be an 8 pin on the end that goes in the power supply and the other side will have 8 total pins but they will be split in half.,it might be labeled eps or cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ok so yeah the issue was the asrock motherboard who unlocked everything right off the bat.,it was allowing my cpu to hit way above 100 celsius without a thermal throttle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why is that?,181w is not a simple one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well.. yes.,"you should go to bios, and find tjmax setting(might be called different, its a max working temperature for cpu setting), and set it to 100c, so cpu starts to throttle at 100c as its supposed to.",running it above 100c can easily damage it.,"then easiest way to keep temperatures in check, is to adjust ac/dc loadline values.","lowering ac values lowers voltage boost under load, resulting in much lower temperatures.","its similar to undervolting, but usually much easier to do with less testing required.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because official tjmax of this cpu is 100c.,anything over and it should throttle to lower temperature.,its only with shitty asrock boards that it goes above 100c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i ran it through cinebench for 6-8 minutes, when i checked the temp it was at 113. should i return the cpu for a new one, so far i don't see any issue but im worried it will randomly die in a couple of months.","i think i have fixed the issue now, (found the tjmax value when looking through the bios for anything that could help and some fan settings)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is what is disappointing.,they need to really get the software right before releasing.,there should be no reason why it fails at basic tasks like that.,why i purchased a 6700xt for 369 usd for my nuc 13 extreme i7.,everything runs and lightroom etc.. accelerates fine.,maybe next year they will get it.,if they want to break into a new market you have to put your best foot forward.,better to delay and hit a home run and get good press/word of mouth vs rolling out buggy software.,it would have been to build a full intel system but decided not after reports of issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if the issue persists when you put the stock intel frame back on then the problem is with the backplate or the screw.,"takes some pictures front and back of the motherboard and makes sure the screws are going in on the back, it might have been dislocated/misaligned.",the allen key provided is correct.,unless you turn it incorrectly or the screw isn't aligned with the screw hole there's no reason it would come back out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there might be an issue where the thermal grizzly requires longer screws on some mainboard/13 gen cpus.,the frame should screw into the backplate that came with the mainboard.,so not the cooler back plate but the backplate that came with the mainboard.,basically the cooler backplate holds on the mainboards backplate then you screw in the cpu frame to the mainboard backplate.,should be installation videos on youtube.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i totally get what the op is explaining here after reading all of this and tbh, no 2 cpus are alike.",i have played around with so many high end boards and i always get a killer bin cpu as i build and sell many high end pcs and buy dozens of cpus at once and bin them all accordingly and match the bins to customer usage.,that said i nailed an sp 110 13900k day one first one opened!,"the truth about these cpus is that while even an ai oc alone actually boost my 13900k to 6.3ghz out of the box, it doesn't mean my cinebench score is ridiculous high.. 43500ish, but that's in a custom loop by itself with its own copper 360mm and a nice ek block and the thing i don't see any mention of is a thermal plate to replace the stock one!","you will have temp issues regardless without one of these plates.. 
all in all, a 13900k will game just as good if not better at 5.5-5.7 and if you are lucky and can keep voltage under 1.32v max at that 5.7 then heat will be stable depending on your cooling and as we all know this goes along with lower heat lower voltage = lower wattage.","you can go for 6ghz + as many 13900k will do that but belive me when i say minus de lidding and direct die cooling even dry ice cannot tame these things and your sweet spot for performance is close to this op settings.. 
i managed to get 40.6k at 250w and 72c 1.29v 5.6ghz, but that's due to the lottery winning and experience and probably hundreds of bsods and clear cmoss.. 
i strongly recommend anyone not using a plate to get one the thermalright are great and shave 10c easy off your temps.","congrats to op i don't think you've been given enough credit as to achieving this while not being an expert but recognizing you don't have to go gung ho to get a few pts in cinebench, cinebench is not going to make you game faster.. oc a 13900k will get you a few good benchmark scores but as long as you have semi decent ram, and preferably a good nvme drive, decent cooling and i don't recommend air cooling these for oc, but whatever works your gaming experience now lays in the hands of your gpu.. i must say also a liquid cooled 4090 paired with a killer 13900k is the best gaming experience i've ever had!","that said also, my gaming experience benchmarks aside, is no worse on a 13600k, literally.. i experienced the same thing with 12th generation where a better binned i5 with less cores made me sell my 12900k and keep the 12600kf bc it performed better for gaming.. 
things are not always as they appear on paper, sometimes you gotta get in there and see for yourself.. if your not sure of something, ask, research, try different things, if you have a good bin cpu then the sky is your limit , if not then your silicon is your limit, atheist for now!",best luck to all!,!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6.3 ghz out the box sounds crazy.,i definitely need to invest in a thermal plate as i do want to further lower temps.,and not to mention iâ€™m using an air cooler which further limits my cooling capabilities.,itâ€™s honestly impressive how much you can lower power consumption on these chips without lowering performance.,imo the chips are overvolted (is that a word?),at factory settings and there really is no need to completely disable power limits.,also the 13900ks will be fun.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you tried lowering the voltage?,at 100c your cpu starts throttling which isnâ€™t good.,you can def get low 80s with an aio like that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msi llc is the opposite of asus.,my all core 100% load voltage in cb23 is 1.15-1.155v.,kinda fluctuates around that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i am not sure, i have only tried it on my 13900k and i get 36.5k in cinebench but it sits at 85 c on an aio whilst pulling 280 watts.",this also gives you more overclocking/undervolting headroom.,"i don't see a reason why you shouldn't try it tho, just benchmark before and after disabling hyperthreading and see for yourself",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also no hyperthreading means lower latency so you can expect better 1% and 0.1% lows but i can't quantify how much as it is game dependent.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

mode 8?,"on msi, i get not liking the vdroop, but there is absolutely no need to run such a high llc, you are if i'm not mistaken getting waaay too much heat and running at a high voltage, i could be backwards though i forget which way msi does llc, regardless it does not take nearly the voltage you would think to run high frequencies unless you got a bad silicon lottery ticket.. you should play around with your llc and take note of your voltage at idle and at load, the lower the vdroop without crashing the better temps you will run and so forth.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, you are very correct.",they come overvolted due to passing guarantee of even the lowest bin cpus which will require more voltage to be stable at the same frequencies.,though i have never not gotten more performance simply by lowering the voltage even stock.,everything scores better and runs cooler.,"now the 13900ks, that is something totally different to me, i had the chance to snag one a couple days early in trading even for my 13900k, and all the ks is is a guarantee to hit 6ghz with a slight boost on the clocks.","i held out because i knew my bin was likely better than a ks on average, and i alerady knew i could hit 6.3 out of the box, so i saw no need to risk losing an sp 110 to likely a lower binned ks, which i now see people are upset bc they thought they would get a better cpu, and some did, but looking at the v/f curves of stock ks with the plus 200 price range, i would say especially in your case where it seems you have a good bin, theres a good chance you might be paying more for less.","its not like a non ti vs a ti gpu, obviously there are more upgrades, these ks are just the same wafer and hand picked towards the top of the sku pile.. id do some research before spending any money on a ks.. just my opinion,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that's absolutely fine if you wanna go for the highest benchmark score.. but around 40k with capped power limit @ 253w is a great score!,":d maybe op is gaming most of the time and thus not really needing oc, i rather have it a bit quiter and cooler for gaming.","but yeah, if you wanna achieve new personal benchmark highscores probably get a contact frame and play around with oc.","(and better cooler)

"tbh i have no idea what they mean by latency in a cpu, as the cpu cache/ring/uncore whatever floats your boat to call it is the most influential critical component that's purpose is directly reflecting latency among a couple other things to do with timings and so forth.",if you want less latency you increase your cache multiplier within reason of course and along with that comes voltage as well.,"it could be how my setup is or what works for me best, but i find that disabling hyperthreading actually causes my 13900k to stutter almost, it acts up and i find it to be counterproductive for very minimal heat reduction and a noticeable performance hit.",i can see how this technically should lower latency but if you run aida64 cache and memory latency test you'll see it does very poorly with ht disabled..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

well.. i am not sure why is everyone on this post afraid to keep it at full power and get great temps at the same time.,that is amateur work.,debauer made video on msi board 12900k and i believe 13900k long time ago.,"my previous build: 

z690 edge

oc setting: 13900k

4.5 e all core

cpu core voltage mode override
voltage 1.3 

ring 43

installed frame and 360 asus top mount push pull lancool 3 case.",score was 42340 easy on r23.,"max temp was 89.

i was running ddr4 4300 cl 15.

currently z790 tachyon with same r23 score but 8000+ ddr5 oc with same cpu lower temp 84 max r23 score 42700 maxed when all programs off

msi is one of the easiest bios ever.",only thing i do not like is vccsa voltage they use.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i just set my core voltage mode to offset + adaptive and set my offset at first to -1.0v then further lower values each time by -0.1. if it does crash iâ€™ll lower by -0.005. i also noticed that atleast on my setup offset + adaptive causes my temps to go higher, but produces a better score on cinebench, but iâ€™m not exactly sure if thatâ€™s the cause.",i then went and set llc on mode 8. idk how it works on asus boards but iâ€™m sure theres discussions online regarding that.,these are my main uv settings.,i did mess with my fan curve a bit to lower idle temps and change when the fan kicks in.,"i tried changing lite load from auto (mode 9) to say mode 5 at first, but it doesnâ€™t like it at all and crashes.",mode 7 is stable however i just decided to keep it on auto.,"something to keep in mind is you can also directly set your voltage to a constant number rather than just setting an offset, for example starting at 1.3, and lowering temps from there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"found this from another thread, might help:

fix:core offset voltage in xtu is ""core svid voltage"" in a asus z790 bios, if you set that to lets say -0.10000 in the bios with ""intel boost - enabled"" then it will show in xtu on next boot up that you set core voltage offset to -0.10000 since xtu reverts settings to default on reboot, you now know you got the right setting.","now to get the same performance as i did in xtu after undervolting i set my oc profile in the bios from ""keep current settings"" to ""oc tuner ii"" and ""intel boost = enabled"" then setting my core svid voltage to -0.10000, let it restart and bam even better performance and temps then an xtu undervolt at same settings.",credits to u/monsurot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i haven't seeen problems with my 13900k although tbf i haven't run intel's mlc to see the difference, just a few benchmarks on some games.",and i was strictly comparing on a stable all core clock (5.7 on all p cores and 4.5 on all e cores and the cache at 5.0).,cinebench goes from 42500 to 36600 which is a 14% reduction and doesn't seem like a lot to me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i actually did not think of changing llc modes in order to further lower my offset, i didn't even know that was a thing lol.",i will def try that and see if i can reach -1.4v.,also my psu is a corsair rm1000x gold.,"i would love to oc the 13900k to see how far i can take it, but sadly i'm limited due to using an air cooler.",i will invest in a 360 aio in the future for sure though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the 13900k throttles at 100c, so anything below that won't really change much in terms of scores.",i can get temps of 80 by lowering wattage but i don't really see the need to since while gaming i'm not hitting even 80c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"sorry, i couldâ€™ve worded it better.",i meant what were your voltage and power settings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, especially not on an air cooled set up.",there are tons of videos of people with an aio still struggling to keep temps below 100c at stock settings.,"simply put, default settings on most boards remove the power limit, and as a result the chip just uses unnecessary amounts of power resulting in high temps and thus throttling.",setting intelâ€™s recommended power limit and undervolting results in basically no loss in performance while lowering temps significantly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"it's going to depend a lot on what games you want to play, and what level of performance you're willing to accept.","i'd say at a minimum, anything sandy bridge or newer with at least 4 cores.","realistically, probably whatever you can get your hands on for cheap.",a bit newer might be better since it'll have things like m2 slots for ssds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"considering the price of motherboards and looking at it from an upgradability standpoint, i'd say an am4 cpu.","the older ones are pretty budget friendly to begin with, even more so if you buy used, that includes the 5000 series.",and the motherboards are plentiful and fairly cheap themselves.,"it all depends on your gpu really, look for a cpu in your comfortable budget, and then pair it to an equivalent gpu and see how well it can handle it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"get a $60 i3 10100f, it will better than most of old cpus in gaming and it will be brand new so you don't have to worry about all of the problems of buying used cpu, motherboard..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how much are you looking to spend on a motherboard + cpu?,i ask because you could grab the ryzen 5500 for like $100 bucks right now (or a 5600x for $130) and a am4 mb for less than $100 (as low as $50 bucks).,either cpu would hold her over for a few years with the rx590 playing @ 1080/60.,that 590 is going to show its age and my advice would be to sell it (or keep it as a spare) and upgrade her to a rx 6600 (\~$225 for entry level ray tracing) and she'd be set for several years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on what is on your used market.,"old cpus donâ€™t stay in production, so itâ€™s not like you can go on amazon and pick up an 8th gen or something for cheap.",however if thereâ€™s used stuff or a thrift shop nearbyâ€¦ then you should see what they have and then do some research on the ones you see within your budget.,thereâ€™s no point in us listing cpus if we donâ€™t know what you have access to.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7700k.,"has avx2, competitive clock rate/great overclockers, ya more ipc than haswell and sandy bridge in practice.",itâ€™ll really help keep minimum frame rates & dropped frames down.,i7-8700k / 8086k would be more ideal now a days tho.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
v3 xeon's do really well plus you can buy a really cheap motherboard with it.,combined should all be under 100 i think.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for rx590 at 60fps 1080p, it is going to be anything with a quad core with ht, something like a used ryzen quad core or i3 10000 series.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4790k is still ok.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4770k or 4590,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would sell you my old i5-750 but i think the shipping is more than the combo is worth.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how about i5 3rd gen +?,i personally find they comfortably handle 1080p gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am looking for an average 60fps medium settings at 1080p.,i think it shouldnt be too costly to achieve.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a rx590 from my old build so i am just trying to build a second working computer around it as cheap as possible for my wife.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would love to splash out on all of that but as it stands right now we don't have a ton of time for gaming so i'd rather not spend a ton on it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wanted it to be 100$ or less.,i will save money for a new rig probably 5 or 6 years from now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean i have ebay and other online second hand stuff.,"i can get a i52500k, ram , and mobo combo for like 50 bucks but i don't really know if it's worth it realistically",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i guess what i am looking for is a starting point to start researching whats available.,there's  13 generations.,so basically whats the earliest viable generation for 2022 in 1080p.,i figured someone in this sub would still be running some older hardware and be able to enlighten me with their experiences.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's what i like to see !,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maaan my i7 7700k is crying in the corner rn.,i'm upgrading next year!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a 9700k and 3080 and the 9700k runs super well.,i think 9700k would be overkill for their purposes and more so even a 9900k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™d say itâ€™s the cut off almost,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it doesnâ€™t support avx2 which some games require,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sure but 1080p / 60 is very different on something like lol or overwatch compared to like cyberpunk or far cry 6.

https://www.techspot.com/review/2409-intel-core-i3-12100f/

check 10100f... r6 and f1 it's well over 100fps 1% lows, but cyberpunk and far cry 6 are struggling to maintain 1% low over 60.  so people are asking what kinds of games.","if it's competitive games that run on a potato (r6, cs:go, lol, etc...) you can probably get an old 4770k or something and be alright.","if it's modern console port style single player games like assassin's creed games or showcase aaa pc games, well a 4770k probably doesn't cut it and you'll have to step up to a 10100f, r5 3600 or 12100f.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"amd am4 motherboards as i mentioned are usually cheaper, and based on userbenchmark, taken with a grain of salt, the rx590 is about on par if a little worse than an rtx 3050, i would suggest a ryzen 5 5500, 5600g, or 5600, doesn't have to be x. the 5550 is just a lower binned 5600g with a disabled igpu, only about $100 brand new and should handle stuff just fine

edit) doesn't have to be one of the newer gen cpus, i just figure at that price point might as well",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would just do the ryzen 5500 + mb then... it'll run you about 150 bucks and you can always upgrade the video card later.,:),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you'll have to get atleast a hyper threaded i7.,smth like 2600k with fast ddr3 kit.,goodoldgamer and icebergtech have recent and good quality videos about older platforms.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
really depends on the game too how much it stresses the cpu.,something like deep rock galactic is easy to run.,i wouldn't go lower than 4770k if possible to guarantee larger amount of games that will run well.,maybe some am4 mobo would make sense if you drop a much newer cpu in it later?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that was my last cpu/gpu combo.,ran it at 5.1ghz all core on a 360 aio.,"when i started playing warzone two years ago, i noticed almost constant stutters when running disco and warzone.",upgraded to a 5900x and stutters went away.,"warzone is quite cpu intensive though, so ymmv depending on the titles you play.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mostly aa coop games.,i have nothing of the top of my head.,we haven't figured out what games she likes yet other than rocket league and warzone.,(she has odd tastes lol),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hmm if i go that route i might as well upgrade my current build further and use even more left over parts for the new build.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"never use userbenchmark site, it is so biased towards intel and put amd down regardless if amd cpu/gpu are faster than nvidia/intel (cpu).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

trueeee but what resolution and frame rate were you playing at?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rocket league runs on a potato and should be fine on a 4770/90k.,"warzone is pretty cpu dependent, but older cpu like 4770/90k may be okay for 60 fps 1% lows.","may not too, i'd think that would be close.","i'd shoot for a 4770k used or a 10100f new, perhaps with a used mobo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

using what cooler?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
see what the power draw is.,"you can undervolt or set a power limit etc......

as another poster said it depends on the cooler.",it also depends on the case cooling and the cpu usage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that sounds about right.,iâ€™m seeing high 70s on the 13900k with a 360 aio cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at stock settings those temps aren't surprising.,it's not your cooler it's the power consumption.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm looking at slightly lower temps in a hyte y60 with a deepcool castle 360ex and 7 case fans.,today i was from mid 70s and high 60s on a normal gaming load and mostly low 80s on a stressed load.,it's a warm chip and will definitely be hot most of the time unless you are running custom loops or top notch cooling options.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yea i am sitting sitting around 89 degrees while gaming.,i am using the h150i elite lcd cpu cooler.,i think they just run hot...i first tried the msi mag coreliquid c240 but the temo of my cpu was high (like it is now) so i switched to the h150i for more cooling and it seems to behave the same way...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm a little late to the party but anyway heres my experience: im using the h150i elite 360mm cooler form corsair.,games like mw2 or apex run at around 60-65c.,"hottest game i ran so far was battlefield 2042, hitting an average of about 75c, sometimes hitting the 80's.",cpu running on stock settings btw.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"undervolting is better, after that on top you may or not want to add power limiting.","with undervolting you can run same or higher clocks even at lower temps, with less voltage delivered to chip.","while power limiting is usually limiting power delivered to get lower temps, it can better your performance, but not always.","for example in auto a chip can run 5ghz at 1.2v, with maunaul setting the voltige you can potentially lower it.","so rhe chip runs 5ghz at 1.1v, that lower the temps and makes the clocks more stable, potentially increasing boost time frame or even it could run 5.1ghz at 1.1v.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2 44m 360s,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at first i was pretty unsure if my temps are normal as well since the cpu runs really hot compared to my older ones.,iâ€˜ve also watched some reviews and i think the raptor lake generation is just a really hot one as most of the videos have similar temps to mine.,so far my cooling hasnâ€™t really improved a lot but i heard that undervolting the 13th gen chips can bring some pretty big temp improvements and only decreses performance by a few percent.,might have to try that out once as my case has pretty good airflow (corsair 5000d airflow) and iâ€™m still reaching those temps.,performance whise im really happy tho and it doesnâ€™t seem to thermal throttle as fast as some other chips.,let me know if you find something else that could help cooling!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

could be load line calibration as i have no idea what vcore compensation means either but llc does change the votlage behavior under full load and op has an asrock board which i'm not familiar at all and that might just be asrocks naming for llc.,"so the auto-llc is probably too low, so at full load, because the default voltage is already low on a 12400 it causes clock stretching(so it still reports normal clcok speed, but it's not actually running at that, but not crashing either) and setting it higher causes the voltage to drop less when under full load hence fixing the issue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why exactly a 12100f with z690?,why not go for something more reasonable like a 12400f with b660?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

maybe he wants to upgrade to 13th gen  in the future.,going with 12100f leaves him with a nice upgrade path.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is what iâ€™m hoping to do.,just a lot of other irl stuff going on so i couldnâ€™t justify spending more right now and the pc i got is a rapidly aging pre built,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
considering the recent price stratagy of intel they should have very good pricing.,"if not, i dont see them selling at all.",threadripper has such a vast variaty of platform options.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what's the cheapest xeon a normal consumer can buy?,we used to have the popular 1231v3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looking forward to these cpus and what they can do.,they carry the xeon name so not expecting them to be cheap.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its been 6 years but i'm hoping we may finally get a 7820x successor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i wouldn't say vast, in the wrx80 lineup for threadripper 5000 theres like 5 boards total?",and considering the enormous price hike of threadripper 5000 vs 3000 it's a hard pill to swallow.,"intel does need to nail pricing on this, and if they do it can get them inroads back into this high end part of the market.","but hell, if they mess it up and no one buys it i'll buy one when it's all discounted anyway so its a win.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it will be priced higher than threadripper, as it has been in the past.",but generally each core tends to be more powerful than its amd equivalents,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's not like there needs to be much variation in boards for threadripper pro - there's so much pcie and memory expansion that boards can just have 7x 16-lane pcie slots (like the almost identical epyc platform) and you just add whatever hardware need if it doesn't come with it already.,"that's very hard to achieve with mainstream platforms when you have a measly 20 (intel) or 24 (amd) pcie lanes from the cpu and 8 from the chipset, and on intel bifurcation support is terrible - which is why they have to carve-up the pcie lanes in weird and wonderful ways, share bandwidth over the dmi/chipset connection with usb/sata/nvme/ethernet, have strategic spacing between slots to take account of gpu sizing, put m.2 sockets on non-standard riser brackets, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
leaks have shown both 4 and 8 channel parts.,"the 8 channel one is the tr pro competitor, while the 4 channel looks more interesting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"honestly it's just pricing intel needs to nail, and hopefully this new platform has better bifurcation support.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thx for the feedback.,i've seen mixed feedbacks about the a750 so i was quite hesitant between it and rx 6600. a750 is about 12% cheaper than an rx 6600 here.,"usage wise, mine is not much different from yours, mainly esports title and possibly some non 3a title (my current laptop cant handle it).",often uses davinci resolve for 1080p videos too.,"from your pov, do you think the 12% price difference worth the purchase?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"sorry you got down voted, it's a valid question.",i'm going to give this one to my nephew when he's ready to install it himself.,for now it's a decoration.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes because its their property and they can do whatever the fuck they want to with it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm still so happy with my 9700k that i'm getting a new case and cooler for it to keep it going for a while as my backup for my drafting job.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™ve got a 8600k and a 3070. often thought about buying a second hand 8700k for some extra power,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5800x on a b550.,very snappy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8700k oced to 5.2 ghz with 2080ti is what i rock,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mine could only do 4.8ghz all core reliably.,after that the voltage i needed felt unsafe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice!,i have that exact cpu in a little mini dell pc that i use for a media center.,no lag decoding of anything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"clock for clock, i think the 3000 series was faster than 8th gen but at lower clock speeds like the 3600, it really didn't feel like it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"try bf2042, sometimes it hits 100%, most of the time it sits around high up in the 90%

just bought me a i7 13700k, and i see a big jump from my 8700k in games.","bf2042 was sometimes a little big laggy but no more, runs smooth as butter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
agreed for most games.,"i mostly play modded mc, rimworld and some dwarf fortress.",they all suffer from tick lag eventually.,the 5800x seems to keep the insanity going longer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i play elden ring almost exclusively this past year.,"with my old 8700k i was never bottlenecked but i was getting quite a bit of stuttering, hitching, etc.",upgraded to 13600k and pooof everything is smooth as butter now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the current cpu you have is more than enough for more than a dozen services running on one server.,it would be best to get a cpu of nearing performance if you have a lotttt of services experiencing performance issues or because of multiple clients.,best to do this with proxmox.,edit: words,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
slowing down the first layer would make sense here.,i commented elsewhere that this was printed on a very warped build plate with some 4 year old pla as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not really.,it will play most things just fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not at all, but the stuff i have here is faster.",5800x in the gaming pc and a 3700x in the server.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i went 5800x.,"at stock speeds, it was the only thing faster than the 8700k when i was doing irresponsible voltage level overclocks.","13th is faster than the zen3 stuff, so it makes sense that would work too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i replaced my 4790k with the 8700k :)   i feel like i had 2 of the best cpus intel ever made.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it should be fine for anything you want to do.,h means it's the high performance model.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14th gen is coming...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
getting ready to retire mine soon as i get a lga 1700 backplate from ekwb.,delidded an oc to 4.9. had a hard time deciding to let it go.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
going 13th gen or zen4?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>the cpu that marked the end of the quad core era for intel.,cries in 6700k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it takes on humidity and extrudes unevenly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you store it in a drybox it shouldn't be a problem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
after my current pla went to shit i will be switching to full petg soon.,harder to recycle but with less wastage i think it should even out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i only bought this thing earlier in the year.,"had an original haswell motherboard with a celeron, which in fact was still fine for surfing the net when on my ssd.",but now i do fortnite.,"the 4790 does okay (100+ fps on average), but i do get frame reductions sometimes bad enough that i am looking to upgrade soon.","this still kicks butt for roblox, though, so my daughter will keep it for that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the only problem with coffee was the lack of ht on the i5s.,8700 had one so all good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on the rest of the system and the games that people are running.,"in most cases, a 12th or 13th gen i3 will run circles around the 8700k.","it was a great chip, but modern games have come a long way with taking advantage of better cpus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well... when i see that an i5 12th gen cpu gets a waay higher waay higher score than the 8700k on some benchmarking sites, i can't help but feel a little envious.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
raichu?,the pokemon?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
havenâ€™t even overclocked mine yet so iâ€™m sure iâ€™ll get even more use out of it when i do!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"even if sold for fairly cheap, as long as someone who needs it gets it, you're reducing e-waste and keeping things lighter on the environment while also getting some money back.","the 8700k is old, but definitely not that old that it can't be sold (and used).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's even worse, mine is warped at this point.",it's a very old printer that needs some fixes.,i use a glass bed now and first layer is much more accurate.,this might have been the last print i did on the aluminum bed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ah, just level it.","it's quite easy, watch a youtube video",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh sorry, thought you were op",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm tired,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it also appears to be underextruding but it's somewhat difficult to determine without seeing it from other angles.,it could also be both.,i'd start by leveling and then printing a first layer calibration square.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it seems okay to me, i was going to get a 13th gen i9 but going to wait another generation i think",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
go 9900k for extra power if you want to stick with the same mobo.,8700k is not much of an upgrade to an 8600k.,you wouldn't notice much.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
exactly!,"for tasks not that much demanding, it holds up pretty well actually.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a friend with 8700 non-k until these days.,i had ryzen 3600 in the past and we had the same gpu card at the time (3060 and after 3070).,"he always had a little more performance than me playing warzone, pubg and other games.","not much, something like 10% and a better 1% low.",but clearly faster.,not to mention that he was using 2666mhz memory (oc) and i was using 3200mhz.,"8700 it's a very impressive cpu, performance is in between ryzen 3600 and ryzen 5600 (non-x).","i think it's the most impressive core i7 made until now, even more impressive than core i7 3770 or 2600.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'll give it a try.,only game that gets close for me is hunt showdown it gets to 90% on a single core but over all nothing above 57% total,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well the way rimworld ticks work is based on the host system.,so if the host has a better cpu then you do by a far measure.,it will always cause you to fall behind in ticks in the later game.,we have the same issue with a friend of mine on an older cpu.,i'm being the host and running 8700k while he is on like 4 gens older i5 cpu.,game runs fine until about 4 hours in then he starts falling behind in ticks and mine remain current.,its all based on who is host and if the people connected have hardware good enough to keep up with the host.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what resolution do you play on and what gpu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4 years old will do it indeed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice !,[gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|heart_eyes),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ohh okayy .. thankss:3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there will always be another generation.,the cycle never ends :/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that might just do it for me, yeah!",this really is a great chip.,"i ran an e8500 for a while, then a 2600k for a *long* time before bumping up to a 7700k, then finally an 8700k, which is where i got stuck it seems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it was a tough choice, but ultimately went for the 7700x because of the upgrade path going forward.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"*cries in 7700k*

seriously, still salty i bought it in early 2017 after amd showed their hand and then intel just decided to release a second series of cpus that same year, this one blowing the last gen away.","still using the thing, and now that i upgraded my gpu, im bottlenecking half the time.","to be fair ive owned it for like 6 years by now, and i couldnt upgrade it until i upgraded my gpu anyway because i wouldnt see many performance differences on the old 1060. 

hoping to go for an i5 13500 next christmas, or whatever the best deal is for the money by then.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
naive question: could you use a hair dryer to rid it of the water before printing?,should be well below the 60 degrees it takes to deform.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i see.,but what about putting it into a cardboard box and all?,so that as little air as possible gets to it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to be fair the 8600k was better than the 7700k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
every game i run on my 8700k + 2080ti at 1440p tops the cpu at 60-70% max.,i've yet to see a game bottleneck on my cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it depends on the number of frames - my 7700k was fine until i was using a 75hz monitor, very few games and scenarios made it a bottleneck.",even cyberpunk maintained 60ish with ray tracing (3080).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah mine's still running strong for all the things i currently play (not much), but i want to try vr flight simulator and i'm starting to feel the itch.",this might be the year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"leaker on twitter, very reliable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"when i first started printing, bed leveling was my bane.",even with a printer that has abl.,damn glass was warped from the start.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ah, ok. what printer?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah.,same here.,will just save up for a whole new system.,the 3070 should last a good while as well.,perfect still for 1440p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good call on the 9900k.,yeah that might be a good shout actually ðÿ˜œ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're right!,i guess it depends what you're happy with.,"i spend my money elsewhere, so i typically hang onto the hardware for a long time.","sitting on 64gb of ddr4 ram right now and a recently acquired 3080 ti, feels like the cpu is the last thing holding me back from another 6-8 happy years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if it works like am4 you should be able to put 3 more gens in there.,not a bad move.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i bought a 6600k around the same time, probably without enough research to know that the 7000 series was coming right around then.",got a good deal on it but dealt with the same issues until i recently upgraded to a 12700k with the microcenter deal.,"can't complain about something that lasts 6 years though, they were good quality cpus, just lacked the cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the worst thing is, if you would have bought that awful ryzen first gen instead, you could have upgraded all the way to the 5800x3d today.","the 7700k was a great cpu, but the timing was so bad.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just retired my 7700k for a 13700k.,going from 4 cores to 16 feels ridiculous.,my only complaint is the heat.,even with a 100mv undervolt it still thermal throttles in cinebench.,79c in full load gaming tho and thatâ€™s good enough for me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can just put it in the oven.,dries out perfectly.,i got a little heated chamber that dries it automatically from amazon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you intend to stand over the filament roll and blast air on it for solid 5 hours... you could.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"theoretically yes, but companies do sell dedicated filament dryers for exactly this, and they're rather cheap",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there's little ovens you can get to remove the humidity, but no biggie.","filament is cheap, you just buy more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i keep mine in a sealed rubber-made style bin with lots of silica gel granules that keep mine suuuuuper dry and ready to go.,"bin has pla,  pla+, petg, and abs rolls in it..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they probably wouldn't work either.,it may be better than just leaving it out in the open but you could seal it in a tupperware container and it would last longer.,most people just buy a food dehydrator or a filament dehydrator box.,several companies make them and they arent very expensive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
jsut because you aren't seeing 100% cpu use does not mean you are not cpu bottlenecked.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"warzone 2 will, unfortunately.",i had to go from a 9700k @ 5ghz all core to a 13700k in order to improve my frametimes.,"bf2042 was *unplayable* without restricting the game to 70 fps, since it was rendering my keyboard unusable with all 8 threads at 100%.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i had a warped z-plate, a warped build plate and the springs had uneven tension.",the frame is also wiggly.,anything that sticks to the bed is a miracle at this point.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
monoprice maker select (not the mini).,i don't believe they make it anymore.,prussia i3 clone with some cheaper parts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yer thats what im on is 1440p aswell, mind i would like 4k next",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's the plan!,getting the zen 5 3d next year should be glorious.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
eh the 7600k never really lasted very long.,by the time bf5 came out like 1.5 years later it was already showing its age.,"i knew with zen coming out that the market would soon change, and i originally waited for zen and wanted to upgrade to a zen processor with 6-8 cores.","but then amd pulled an amd, the performance was very lackluster and underwhelming in gaming, and the cpus punched well under their weight class otherwise.",it was a common problem with amd cpus up until around 2020 or so.,"amd would offer more cores but their cores would be worse, often a generation or several generations behind intel's, and often would do well on synthetic benchmarks, but fall apart in gaming for whatever reason.","having come off of a phenom ii and putting up with crap performance for years as a result, i just went intel.",but i knew thw 7600k wasnt gonna last long so i jumped on the 7700k on a microcenter deal.,it was the best move i had at the time and felt like i bit the bullet on that.,seeing intel come out with coffee lake like half a year later made me salty as hell.,because i couldve waited a little longer and jumped on that.,i prefer jumping on upgrades when getting massive price/performance jumps and i ended up biting the bullet on the last of the quad core generations with the next generation coming out prematurely.,"with gpus, i always seem to luck out and score big.","i bought the 1060, i had a 760 before that, a 5850 before that, just upgraded to a 6650 xt a few weeks ago.",with cpus?,i always seem to buy at the worst times.,"i always miss those ""legendary"" upgrades by less than a year and end up dealing with crap performance relatively speaking as a result.",i bought an athlon xp in 2005 just months before dual cores were a thing.,i bought my phenom ii the year before sandy bridge came out.,and i bought kaby lake before coffee lake came out.,i always seem to get screwed and miss the best processor deals by not much.,only thing that really saved me this time was going for the 7700k but if i had the 8700k i wouldnt be upgrading probably for another couple years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the only difference between 6th and 7th gen intel was a few hundred mhz clock speed increase.,"6600k and 7600k are the same cpu, basically.","i had a 6600k for a long time and it was a decent gaming cpu for its day, but it did not age well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the problem is there was no guarantee of that, ryzen was expensive, twitchy, and the performance in its day was underwhelming.",the 7700k was the safe option.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i'd like something that runs a bit cooler when i upgrade.,"i won't be doing so until the end of this year (so next christmas), but yeah, idk what i'll buy.","candidates right now are 13400, 13500, 13600k, 5800 x3d, or 7600 (am5).","not in the market for an i7, too expensive these days (seriously 13600k costs as much as my 7700k did) and platform costs are insane these days too.","really, depends on what price/performance i can get by then.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
awesome thanks!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can probably rig it to your spool holder haha!,or put it in the oven before.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is the smart thing to do.,i just pull my rolls off and stick them in drawers.,i have like 5 rolls of pla that are 4-5 years old that are probably even worse than this white roll i used.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as i don't have a 3d printer (yet) i had no idea about that all.,i am interested but i don't really have the usecase for one.,thank you for the information.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think i've seen it before.,"it definitely shouldn't be printing like that, you should probably buy a new heated bed or sell it and get an ender 5 pro or ender 3 v2",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

erm no ray tracing on cyberpunk.,just ultra settings with dlss set to quality and it hovers around 60,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all you have to do is update to a current bios and update the me firmware (thatâ€™s a separate process).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i donâ€™t know what you mean by risky.,just go to your motherboard page and see if there is a bios update for 13th.,if there is then yea it supports it and like the comment above me update internet me firmware and update bios,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"personally i havenâ€™t, iâ€™m still rocking an i7 11th gen. i believe is should work as itâ€™s on the intel z790 chipset.","personally, its a hard call to make.",you could lose a lot of money if it goes south.,"p.s, if you do try it, update me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i use a 13900k with an asus z690 motherboard.,i did the me update first and then the bios update.,if you don;t do the me update then sometimes it won't see your boot drive.,as for how it runs.,"just like any other chip, i have a 12900k and 12700k and so far i have not seen any stability issues or compatiability issues so far.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™ve used my z690 board (ddr4) with 13900k and 13600k, both work flawlessly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do u update the internet me firmware before i update the bios or does the order in which it is done not matter?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so you would update the bios (in my case asus flashback) without the cpu in, and just the 24 pin.",then after booting into windows update the me firmware?,or is the me stuff required to post like the bios,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
where exactly can you find the correct me firmware?,i have some trouble finding it on intel website,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for that!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
update: successfully installed my 13700k and its working perfectly!,tad bit warmer than previous gen but the performance improvements are there!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s good to hear!,i just updated the bios and me firmware and so far so good.,"had to follow a few extra steps to get the me done right so i hope itâ€™s ok. in regards to the firmware section on the asus page, i have downloaded the relevant file and followed the steps.",i am just not sure if its done anything.,how can i confirm its been done?,is the firmware update necessary for intel 13th gen?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i am using an asus strix z690-a which is ddr4 and had no issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
without update?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i donâ€™t think it strictly matters, like if you do it in the wrong order it will break anythingâ€¦ however i would do bios first, then me drivers in windows, and then me firmware.","i know me firmware updates are a relatively new concept for most users, but iâ€™m also not aware of a previous generation where an me update was essential to new model cpus functioning correctly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the situationâ€™s a bit trickier for a brand new system.,as far as i know you can only flash me firmware from within windows; there are no available standalone tools.,"a compatible bios (via flashback)* and incompatible me should still boot enough to get the me firmware updater to work, but the system may be a bit wonky until this is done (like broken xmp support, missing bios features, and poor performance).",so donâ€™t bother setting anything up for real until after this is done.,"the biggest catch is that some users have experienced cpu-attached m.2 slots being non-functional until after the me update, meaning itâ€™s possible you will have to temporarily install the ssd in a chipset-attached slot, install windows, and then move it to the more desirable cpu-attached slot.","iâ€™m not sure if this is motherboard brand or me-version specific, as i donâ€™t think everyone experiences this.",if you have any issues be sure to post back.,should be easily fixable.,*remember that flashback is done with the system off.,"so it doesnâ€™t really matter if you have it fully wired with all power cords or not, because it wonâ€™t make a difference to the process.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you have to get it from your motherboard makerâ€™s support site for your specific model.,there is no â€œgenericâ€ download.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
awesome!,glad to hear it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what was involved with the flash?,"i'm about to build my pc, i have i7 13700kf and not mobo yet.",wondering to go z690 and flash it or go right to z790,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the me firmware update is done in windows.,as far as i know you need the me firmware update as well as the bios update for your motherboard.,"i have not yet seen any post on any forum where a z690 user dropped a 13900k, 13700k etc without the me firmware update.",although i am happy to be proven wrong.,but once everything is done i am sure you will be happy with the way it runs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just load the latest bios from mfgr and you should b good to go.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok thank you for that!,how do you update the me drivers in windows?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
biostar required an me update to enable 11th gen compatibility on z490.,even required you to update me firmware separately.,guess they were ahead of the times.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hmm ok im missing a cpu bracket (coming in early next week) so i cant test for a few days.,"so far ive flashed via flashback, and have 2 pcie ssds in.","so hopefully ill be able to hop in the bios and update it

ill post back when i can test",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had z690 and now i have z790.,i had no problems flashing the bios.,just followed the steps on your motherboard manufacturers website on how to correctly download and install the latest bios :) also make sure that your me and chipset drivers are up to date.,this can all also be found from the manufacturers website!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for all your advice!,i have followed all the steps as best i could so letâ€™s see how it works out!,will keep you updated!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm in the process of building a new pc (waiting on last few components) and will be using an asus z690 mobo and 13th gen chip.,i won't be able to do the me firmware update prior to the bios flash since it's a new build and i don't have any 12th gen cpu's lying around :( would i be able to get the pc to boot/post with just the bios update?,then from there install windows and get all the me stuff sorted?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the reply!,"my z690 is arriving today, will try it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just updated the bios, so far so good but the boot times are much much longer.",not sure why thatâ€™s happening.,do you reckon the me firmware not being updated is the cause of this?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sorry, note typo in prior message.",me is done from within windows.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i look forward to your update let us know how you get on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can update the bios without the cpu being present.,so prior you need to get the right bios and burn it usb  and then sling it in the bios update usb slot.,the right bios to let the 13th gen run on the z690 platform usually comes with the right me update.,once you do that pop the cpu in and then do the me update when you boot into version as there are two parts.,one for bios and one for windows.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i use an msi pro z690-a wi-fi ddr4 mb.,"i did an update from a 12600k cpu though, just before installing 13600k.",but i tried 13600k and 13900k in this me and they both worked flawlessly (after bios flash).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is me firmware?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ah either way, we will see what happens.",ill just try to get windows up and running when i can,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
update: successfully updated my me firmware and bios and installed my new chip!,works great so far :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for me itâ€™s gonna be clean install bcs i didnâ€™t have 12 gen cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
management engine firmware.,just google it and itâ€™ll provide a far better explanation than i can!,:),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's great news.,now get off reddit and go enjoy your setup!!!!!,!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you need to flash it with a usb kind of update?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks.,so bios update using usb and a bios enable z690 board.,then install windows and do the me update?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
will do!!,thank you for your advice!,hope your setup runs flawlessly!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i already have a 12th gen chip laying around so i am not too sure in your case but this was my process: 
1. download and install new bios on my z690 board 
2. update the intel me firmware (had to follow a few extra steps because it was being weird) 
3. install new chip and hope that it boots :) (i am still waiting for my 13700k so iâ€™ll let you know once i have got it!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"rule of thumb for performance vs power:

if you give up 20% performance by giving up 20% clock and 20% voltage you cut power in half.","power/heat is basically v^2 * c (voltage squared times clockspeed)

thanks for the reply.,my issue with cinebench is thatâ€™s itâ€™s relatively short.,rendering sometimes takes hours.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it could be because the 90c throttling limit is in effect which downclock your cpu during cinabench r23 run resulting in lower score.,you can improve score by setting temp throttle limit to 100c and above in the bios.,though i must say doing that wont net you any extra performance outside of cinabench unless you also do a lot of heavy rendering workload since normal applications and games dont stress your cpu that much.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ah well steady state time for an aio is like 5 minutes anyway so i donâ€™t think youâ€™ve got an issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"default throttling limit for me is 100c, but do you mean thereâ€™s a secondary limit lowering clocks?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, internet is wonderful.",there is almost always someone out there that has had almost the exact same situation you are wondering.,"if you see his comments under that video, you see that he is commenting how his install of the cooler/something was a bit faulty and he gets better temps later on also.",it seems like a pretty safe choice.,"not optimal: i personally would try to get 360mm aio for rendering tasks (and good air cooling for everything else), but you get almost the full performance.",**do some manual tuning of the cpu (undervolting) to get the best results.,**,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, if you are getting 38k with a 100c throttle limit at 253w pl then it is lower than expected i would say.",it could also be your cpu silicon is not great and some cores requires more voltage to sustain higher boost during load which canâ€™t happen as often as other 13900k/kf due to your 253w pl.,this is just my hypothesis though i donâ€™t know for sure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

guaranteed bottleneck.,"however, you can upgrade the cpu up to a i9-9900k, and improve your cpu performance greatly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"my 8700k oc'd to 5ghz was bottlenecking my 3080 gaming at 1440p/165hz, so...probably enough it's time to upgrade.",it'll be most notable on 1% lows and stuttering with higher resource background tasks while gaming etc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is one of those things where i recommend putting the current system on facebook marketplace as a flip and building new.,"first off, your system is a dell.",they are a pain in the ass to deal with.,don't bother.,"instead, get a cheap used gpu like a gtx 1650 or 1050ti and put it in there.","make sure it has like a $12 120gb boot drive, upgrade it to 16gb ram for like $10 just because it looks better in the listing than 12gb.","sell the pc as ""1080p gaming pc"" for like $300-400.","then, go get yourself a regular pc.",what do you currently have system wise?,you might find a 4080 is probably overkill for your needs if the goal is gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah so do you really need more performance or do you just want a quieter desktop instead?,i mean you could go for more performance but the gap between say a 6700xt and a rtx 4080 is around $850 alone and depending on your standards you might not even care that much about the difference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"lol, sorry.",whats your cpu now?,im using a 8700k with a 6900xt at 3440x1440.,not sure if its worth to upgrade.,"most games run still good, besides tarkov pretty expensive atm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i want a quieter desktop, right now i only have a 1080p 75hz display.",so i would have to upgrade to take advantage of more graphics horsepower,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i upgraded to 12700k pretty soon after i grabbed 3080. this was well before 13th gen was out.,stuck with ddr4 board since i have 64gb of ddr4 that would go to waste otherwise (cities:skylines eats memory like no other).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"afaik the 12th/13th gen ddr4 memory controller can't achieve frequency as high as older intel cpus (skylake), and 4 16gb sticks aren't easy to run, so you might encounter issues, but i'm not sure tbh.",ask on r/overclocking too.,anyway you need all that ram for what exactly?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you look for 64gb and high performance, then ddr4 is a bad choice, unless you pair it with 2x32gb hynix kits.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm running 4x16 gb ddr4-3600 corsair vengeance lpx 4000 mhz with a 13700k on a msi b660 mag.,"so it's possible, though it took me awhile to get it reasonably dialed in with the right voltages and stable.",going with a 2x kit would be easier if you can.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm using my ram (4x8gb)  as 3600mhz 14-14-14-14-14-28.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just get 32gb of ddr5-5600, itâ€™s faster (yes, even with the increased latency) and cheaper.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nope.,should be good to go.,depends more on your specific mobo really,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not 100% sure but i think its was said mem controller will have problems to run them at same speed as 2 sticks.,i had problems running 4 on 8700k stable at same speed as 2. and had to put cr2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did intel screw up memory controller or why is that the case?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the info.,"that's kind of what i was afraid of, since this ram is rated to run at such high speed, the cpu's imc might not like it.","i'm getting this much ram for future proofing pretty much, newer games like forspoken is recommending 32gb of ram, so in a year or 2 the recommended ram for games will probably be 64gb.",by that time new high speed ddr4 ram might be harder to find.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm looking at ddr4 with high capacity.,if this doesn't work well then i'll probably just get 2 sticks of ddr4-3600 (2x32gb).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the mag line is higher end than the pro line i think.,"i'm going with a 2x32gb kit instead, just to avoid any issues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a lot of people are saying 4 sticks are hard to run at 4000mhz.,"i'm going to be using the msi pro z690-a, so it's a fairly low-end z690 mobo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't know?,"it can technically reach high speeds but not while mantaining gear 1 mode (which afaik sinchronyzes the imc to the memory frequency, while gear 2 cuts it in half increasing latency significantly, a bit like what happens with amd).",why they chose to do this is unknown to me.,"12th/13th gen actually needs to run in gear 2 for ddr5 (but it doesn't impact latency as much because ddr5 freuqency is much higher), so maybe the reason is to have a memory controller that works both with ddr4 and ddr5.",although this doesn't explain why 11th gen adopted this system too (it only supports ddr4).,also skylake had an hybrid imc too since it works with ddr3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ddr4 will be ancient tech by the time games are recommending 64gb.,this would be like attempting to future-proof with ddr3 back in 2016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
games recommended specs are questionable at best most of the times.,"16gb is still enough for (almost) everything, 32gb is already overkill but reasonable for futureproofing.",64gb is just wasted money for only gaming.,and even in the remote possibility 64gb actually becomes necessary you can just add another 2 sticks at any time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well i have never a game use more then 12gb of ram, even very badly coded ones.","so for gaming you wont need more then 16gb, maybe 32 gb if you are future proofing for 20 years ahead.","but on the other hand, only reason it takes that mutch ram is windows, and in 10 years most people will not be gaming on windows anymore.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just get ddr5 instead.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this mobo is low end, but itâ€™s very damn good.",it can 100% max out the platform without any issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it can be an issue because it places more strain on the imc of the processor.,but this has been an issue primarily using 4 dimms of ddr5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am using 4x8 ddr4 at xmp 4000.  i have the msi z790 tomahawk mag board and its running great.,"my ram is the corsair rgb pro 18.22.22.42

32gb is more than enough imo and im getting great fps in warzone.",cpu is 13600k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had 16gb of ddr3 back then with an i7 2600k where most games were probably fine with 8gb.,i always get a bit more than the current recommended.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
who is saying about games?,open few browser tabs and check memory usage lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"while that's true, it'll be hard to find these high speed ram new by in 1-2 years because ram productions (for the high end anyways) would've moved on to ddr5.","i'm getting a lot of feed backs that 4 sticks are not recommended, so i'm going to look for some 64gb ddr4-3600 kits instead.",i want to keep that 64gb capacity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that's good to know.,i'm hoping to just get maybe 100-200mhz more out of the cpu and run the ram at 4000mhz.,i decided to get the neo forza mars 2x32gb ddr4-4000 kit.,"so hopefully i can run it at the stated spec, that should be good enough.","my gpu is a rtx 3090, so i don't think ddr4-4000 ram would bottleneck it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yea, i've decided to go with a 2x32gb ddr4-4000 kit (neo forza mars), so i can avoid this potential issue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the info.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have 64gb on my desktop and 32gb on my laptop.,i very much doubt that games will be needing 64gb in a few years as it is so far removed from what most people have or will have at that point.,"anyhow, 32gb is minimum that i would consider for new systems at the moment so if you want to be just 1 step above that, then 64gb is a the logical choice.",more ram can hurt a bit though by being somewhat hard to run for the cpu/motherboard.,i for example cannot run my ram at the speeds that i could run 2 sticks: that is why i have the 3200cl14 stats on my profile.,the zen 3 imc is pretty shit compared to intel ones though.,"anyhow, not a biggie.",go for it if you like it.,more than enough ram can be pretty nice on some applications and at least you just about never have to worry of running out of ram.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"straight up get ddr5 then when you want to future proof urself, no point in getting ddr4 imo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 memory allocated is not memory used.,windows doesnt dump stuff from memory until it needs to.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you find a different stick it will still work, not at the same frequency but the performance impact will be negligible.",imho you should stick with 32gb but do as you wish.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"from the replies i've gotten on here and another forum so far, it seems like if it's different ram chips it'll be even harder for 4 sticks of them to run stably at the rated speed, so adding 2 stick of ram later is probably not a good idea.",i'm going to be looking for a 64gb ddr4 ram kit that's only 2 sticks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my cooling will definitely be limiting.,"i have a corsair aio 240mm water cooler, i'm reading that people are going with 360 rads.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yea, i always ran 2 stick of ram on my main pcs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes but even with different chips you should still be able to do at least 3000/3200 which is still a decent speed and won't lose that much performance compared to 4000 especially if you manually tune subtimings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had a similar issue and needed to rma my nuc to resolve it.,intel made the process very easy and it was as simple as swapping the ram and ssd to get the new machine online.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fixed it by connecting it to a 1 gigabit ethernet router and the attached cable was detected.,it did not like a 100 mbit connection.,first device in 6 years that had problems with this router/100mbit for me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hardware unboxed found it to be a few % faster than the 12400/5600 and slightly below a 5700x in gaming (all using ddr4).,"as this is a 12600k rebrand, the same processor can be had for $12 more in the 12600kf which can be overclocked.","otherwise, the 5700x at $190, 12400 at $165 and 5600 at $140 all offer very similar gaming performance for significantly less.",the cheapest 7600+b650 combo lands at $30 more ($390) than the cheapest 13400f+b6/760 combo ($360) while offering a bunch more gaming performance.,the only redeeming factor is a slightly cheaper entry into productivity workloads.,this cpu should drop in price to compete.,"since it's basically a 12600k, i don't think it can drop much lower than its current price point, sadly.","at $160-180 this one would be fantastic, at $200 the previous gen just offers better value.",all prices mentioned are from pcpartpicker.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the 13400f is the chip of concern, it is $196 and therefore cheaper than the 12600k, which comes without a cooler while the 13400f has one.",the 5700x is significantly behind the 13400 in the gaming tests here.,"also, the 12400f is still not a better value because it is much slower than the 13400f.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why do you say that?,the rocket lake series was just really inefficient and power hungry to get its performance and was the last of the lga 1200 socket.,the moment to worry would be if they replace lga 1700 with something else in the next generation of cpus but even then you should be good for quite a while with a high end chip like that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have msi pro z790-a ddr-5 + 13900kf in stock+ nzxtz73 liquid cooler (performance mode).,and it hits about 91-100c  degrees during short-term load peaks in unreal engene tasks (idle \~35-40 â°).,processor is hot is hell.,i'd doubt in this thermals anybody wants to overclock it!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"better to buy gigabyte z790 + 13700k  
you dont need those 8 extra e cores and gigabyte is better with ddr5 oc",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
look up the differences between the two boards and see if the tomahawk offers anything extra that you would want.,"the difference is mainly better vrm, better usb connectivity, clear cmos button and a subjectively better look.",both will handle the 13900k and 4090 just fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
without e cores do you see higher idle temps.,i'm not even sure if that's how that works i assume the p cores will have to run the background programs so idle might be little more toasty.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at my old job we had some intel product with packaging like this.,i ended up removing the part that makes the sound.,itâ€™s triggered when a light sensor detects light.,i put it in our mini fridge so it made that noise every time someone opened it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i scrambled to mute the stupid music... and then i realized.,(tiktok clips on reddit and yt have trained me),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
theyâ€™ve had this feature for nearly 10 years for the nuc packaging.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not every nuc.,only certain ones.,i was using nucâ€™s all over the place in my old org for like 8 years.,i still have 10th genâ€™s in original packaging that donâ€™t do this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

good card for the price.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that title lol you ask like it was released in 2014 or somethin

anyways i'm joking but yes it's a fine card for the right price, though you will have to be aware of comparable cards and the limitations of intel graphics cards, like apis n such",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i view the arc a770 as somewhat of an investment because theyâ€™re more than likely going to be collectorâ€™s pieces in 5-10 years.,especially the 16gb model.,"other than that, i think itâ€™s a safe purchase if youâ€™re patient.","intel supports their products for a long time, unlike amd that has dropped support for gpus after only ~5 years (rip fury x, rip r9 390).",performance and vram amount is pretty good at the $350 the 16gb model is currently priced at.,"this is coming from someone than ran amd gpus from 2011-2017 though, so iâ€™m more used to dealing with dog shit drivers and other bugs lol.",remember to take care of yourself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's a good card, i have one in an older system, intel 9900ks (undervolted) z370 mb, one that supports resizable bar and it works just fine.","i use it mostly for picture and video editing, topaz video ai and handbrake/makemkv, and it also doubles up as a plex server but i have gamed on it.",it gets about 75ish% the performance of my amd 5800x3d/nvidia 3080 system.,'\*edit.,"based on 3dmark score and not actual gameplay\*'

there's a few quirks though that i hope will be sorted in the future, it idles at 48â° and draws 35 watts which compared to nvidia cards is probably double the temp and power draw, for idle at least.",msi afterburner doesn't support it yet so i hope that changes in the near future too.,"on a plus side running 3dmark timespy it never exceeds 71â° and while gaming it's usually much lower, it's also a pity you have the 'f' skew of the 12400 processor as the arc utilises the cpu gpu in some scenarios.",overall i am very happy with the arc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a770 preforms pretty well imo, obviously far off from high-end nvidia/amd but yea; i play in 4k and most games are 60+ fps at mid-high settings, including mw2



i got it like 1-2 months ago iirc, drivers have (seemingly) improved substantially in that period, went from super buggy for me to rarely encountering a driver issue",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a770 is a good gpu that is slowly getting better over time.,however either get a 6650xt/6700/xt for better performance and drivers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i replaced my 1080ti that i had bought new as a nvidia fe preorder that was dying slowly with an a770 16gb.,itâ€™s more than enough for 1440 gaming (a bit quicker than a 1080ti) for me and the only game i have had real issues with is darktide where it basically just doesnâ€™t work.,drivers have come a long way since launch so the real question is if you are ok with itâ€™s level of performance with maybe some bugs here and there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you could do worse for the price.,"it's terrible with older titles (dx10 or under), but does okay with dx11 and dx12.","drivers are still quite unfinished, so the card is very much still a work in progress.","some stuff will run fine, other things will run like ass, or have lot of graphical glitches or issues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
personally i think your money could be better spent .,intel is forsure going to crack into the gpu market .,itâ€™s not gonna be with this card though .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's alright i suppose, most of the time it's performance is comparable to a 3060.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
compared to the competition?,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a770 plays really well on games with dx12 and vulkan from what i read.,"like, 50% increased fps over a 3060. however, on dx11 and lower there's a fps penalty.",buy from a place that'll let you return it if you don't like it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on what youâ€™re trying to do with it.,my dad bought one to replace his rtx 2060 (rtx 2060 is now a hand me down part) and with davinci resolve it didnâ€™t want to render properly.,it rendered â€œproperlyâ€ but was constantly flickering and would give someone a seizure iâ€™m sure.,"could be fixed with a driver update and most likely will, but who knows how long or short of a wait that could be.",but gaming performance was amazing.,so it depends on what youâ€™re using it for.,"may have some other hitches as well, being the first public gpu intel has released.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a lot of the major deal breaking issues are gone now, so itâ€™s not as bad of a pick as it was at launch.","the being said, itâ€™s performance per dollar ratio still is lacking compared to the 6600xt and 6650xt.","so unless youâ€™re willing to put up with the caveats with the hope that it might reach 3070 like performance in the future, probably go amd.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you run aaa titles on dx12 or vulkan, itâ€™ll be a really good card (equivalent to 3060 ti in raster & 3070 in rt performance).","if you run a lot of older or niche titles that run dx9, dx10 or dx11 youâ€™re not going to have a great experience.","also a cpu that supports rebar is basically a requirement, without that donâ€™t bother.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"itâ€™s an interesting product, but itâ€™s unfinished and so underperforms.","just get an rx 6650 xt, youâ€™ll get better performance across the board, peaking at 15-20% in 1080p and declining as resolution increases.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's got some minor stuttering issues but overall it's okay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"worse fps than my old radeon vii in dx 11. basically, don't buy for old games, sold mine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are better off going with nvidia or amd.,arc is simply not ready for prime time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
battlemage is rumored to be coming in 2023...so my answer is no assuming the rumors are true.,"i think it's fine for 1080p gaming, but you'll want to wait for battlemage for proper 1440 from intel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it is serviceable but if you are wanting absolute best for the money at that price, the 6650xt is the way to go.",i am using one and it has done ok in most titles but have had titles it does worse than a gtx 970(mostly older stuff),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
of cource not,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"itll be a sweet card, but as its fairly new so dont expect very game to work perfectly.",this will be fixed in driver updates and performance will also improve to varying degrees throughout the driver updates.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would go with a rx 6650 xt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think its a fantastic little gpu.,i would buy it again if i had to shop for another build.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i will personally add that intel arc is pretty lit if you use it on linux thanks to that it's the same driver as in the integrated graphics which is open source, so community adds to the efforts of patching it (plus what has been patched in the past already).",i haven't played many games on it (a770) yet as what i play is mainly risk of rain 2. worked better than on rx580 for me personally.,"on the older side of stuff i played a few levels in painkiller, no problems either.",i leave this here just so you know it's an option though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the hardware is good, especially the 16gb vram.","for gaming only, performance is solid and it's good value, apart from some crashes still.","however for any sort of professional work, arc is unusable.","driver bugs make it crash all the time in opencl workloads, taking the entire pc and unsaved files down with it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"still driver issues, it's getting better but i wouldn't recommend it yet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it is a good card, but you have to have in mind ""it is new product"" it is the first intel's attempt to create dedicated gpu for gaming.",at this time there are some instability problems in some games.,but intel updating his driver literally every week and game creators also creating patches to improve stability.,this card have really good price/performance in directx 12 games and also have avi1 encoder/decoder which is ideal for recording.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe card is good ... but there are some problems with games as card is new.,some games crashes.,i assume we need to wait some time until game developers will test this card.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for what i've seen it performs really good in a handful of new games, while exponentially worse in older games.","if you only play dx12 titles i wouldn't be too worried, however if you wanted more consistentcy a 6600xt/6650xt would probably be a better pick",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
supporting intel gpu with a good price  - its very smart choice.,nvidia/amd with its gpus are out of the reality these days.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not really.,its very inconsistent.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"u got rebar, it's like... buying an equivalent at rtx 3060 by 300$",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"good card, but still have some bug need to fix.","especially when using third-party overlay for games(for example r6 tracker) it will cause flickering, or blue screen sometime.","the only reason i bought it is because it come with mwii, otherwise go 3060.  same price, more stable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

one final thing.",it appears that ram speed doesn't seem to have a major impact on overall frame rates.,this youtube video shows the difference between 8000 and 6000 ram.,"looks like, on average, 5 to maybe 10 fps.",and that is running on a 4090 at 4k and a 13900k.,[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq0-d4oudg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paq0-d4oudg),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2 sticks (2x32) much easier on memory controller for overclocking,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the short explanation is:

1. changing the memory speed will impact the fps.","by a bit for each 100mhz which5os explained here https://youtu.be/rq1hiowenim

2. enabling xmp on 4 slots is hell.",i have 128gb divided into 4x 32gb.,i mention that in the channel but xmp runs perfect with 2x.,3. the list of confirmed ddr5 for xmp only guarantees that those memories tested will work with xmp but does not say anything about others not yet tested.,"my trident z5 does not show on the list but i can get it to 6000mhz if i use 2 rams instead of 4. if i use 4 rams, the  point between stability and performance is between 400mhz to 600mhz less of what is advertised.","4. to answer your question, get the 2 sticks of ram, not the 4 ones.",i have been testing the z790 hero with a 4090 and 13900k for 3 months and wayyy too many tests and benchmarks.,watch the channel for other tips and if you have any questions let me know.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would really get the asus apex.,it will give you the best shot of getting 2x32 working at a high speed.,"however, if you want 128 gb total, you will need a 4 slot board like the hero.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"do you want more stability right now, or do you want easier upgradability down the line?","if you want more stability, 4x16.",easier upgradability?,2x32,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i can only go by past experience with ddr4.,generally if you can get 4 sticks to run at same speed as 2 sticke there is an increase in performance due to the ability to have more pages of memory open.,this usually yields one memory speed grade faster at same actual clock speed.,often however getting 4 sticks to run at high speeds is more difficult as the memory controller loading can become overwhelming & indeed there is maximum speeds for a given number of memory sticks & even number of ranks per stick of memory at super high speeds.,also 4 sticks of ram are harder to cool as they tend to be very close to each other.,6000 ddr5 i think would be doable though.,"there are many things about ddr5 that are supposed to make them more stable than previous ddr versions so i think 4 sticks would be ok.

i am currently running 64gb ddr4 2400hz ram at 2400 on a z590 chipset motherboard.",due to market segmentation this ram will not run on gear 1 100:100 ratio at any setting other than auto which puts it at 2400mhz but does allow me to push very low latency & as a result performs very well with a few minor tweaks.,i think only core i9 11900k is only one that allows using gear 1 100:100 ratio at speeds other than auto at least on this motherboard.,alder lake & rapter lake doesn't seem to have such limitation on memory.,not even on the b760 motherboards.,it runs fine at gear1 100:100 ratio at speed settings other than auto.,i will be replacing my z590 board with a z790 board & an intel core i5 13600k replacing my core i7 11700k processor.,will report back on reddit once i get these parts in mail.,the cpu is coming from china.,not sure where motherboard is coming from.,darn newegg doesn't tell you before hand.,i should be able to run ddr4 3000 gear 1 100:100 ratio on the new z790 motherboard with the i5 13600k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">i don't think it will change much on a case with sufficient airflow

to get sufficient airflow for this to be true, the case fans would have to be way louder than using a single fan strapped directly to the heatsink",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as far as i know theyâ€™re also still working on the color white.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"less moving parts = less problems and less vibrations, noise, i currently use nofan on ivy bridge and itâ€™s a bless to not know when pc is on.","i used to sleep in the same room as pc, so it was bit of a must before.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am guessing you could go pretty low and not take much of a hit in games.,i played sotr at 150w limit but i donâ€™t think it ever came close and was still pushing 90-120 frames.,ive done some pretty detailed power scaling analysis of the chip (on noctua air tower).,you can see my recent post history for details,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you were right, adding a fan increased cooling capacity by 50w",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah fans are honestly amazing, i added a tiny 40mm fan in front of my motherboard's vrm heatsink (it's a very cheap motherboard) and the temps dropped like a rock.","easily 20c cooler under load, i was very surprised by it.","there's surely some detailed scientific explanation for it but i guess the point is that having a heatsink alone without good direct airflow over it is a huge waste of cooling potential, even a tiny fan at low rpm can make a massive difference.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

at stock and for gaming workloads it will be fine but if pushed with heavy loads or when overclocking the nhu14s won't cut it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just installed my 13700k tonight (replaced 12700k) and iâ€™m using a deepcool ak620 for comparison.,"it will run ~255 watts just under thermal throttling, so the cooler is barely keeping up with the fans at full tilt.","if you want it quiet, youâ€™ll need to lower the power limits.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

probably no air cooler will be sufficient.,[13600k](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/intel-core-i5-13600k/23.html) is a better option if you want to stick to one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"this is nonsense advice, but i'm not surprised.",there's a lot of people that have been bamboozled into thinking that water-cooling is essentially magic that spirits heat away into the shadow dimension or some such baloney.,air coolers can and do outperform liquid coolers given the right conditions (e.g.,optimal case airflow).,don't believe me?,"cool... have a chat to my friend linus cause he's got the receipts: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23vjwtupitk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23vjwtupitk)

just watch the reviews.,they show how hot these cpus get.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you are correct, to an extent.","i have used my trusty old nh-u14s since 2013. first with the fx 8350, then intel 6700k oc:d, and now i want to see if it is sufficient for the 13600k.","so trust me, i am far from a water cooling fanboy.","&#x200b;

the hard truth is that the best watercooler is better than the best aircooler, simply because of transmission abilities.",you can quickly transfer all the heat from the cpu to however many radiators you want.,"with aircoolers, the tranfer speed and efficiency of metal and heat-pipes will limit them.",especially when you consider the weight.,"&#x200b;

in terms of reliability, thats a pretty moot point.","a fan failure on an aircooler is not as bad as a pump failure, but you won't damage anything anyway, and the risk is extremely small.","&#x200b;

you can make an argument for pump noise though.. 

&#x200b;

the u14s is pretty much as large as you can go.","the d14 is great, but is a bit too big tbh.","the weight of the u14s made me worry for my 6700k because of images popping up of bent pcbs, and people warning you not to ever move a skylake-gen computer with the cooler attached.","a water cooler is thus great at giving you a ton of cooling performance without taking much space, and still being easy to install.","&#x200b;

telling people to please use a dual radiator water cooler at the minimum for the 13th gen cpus is pretty good actually, as that is a safe way to go.",air coolers vary massively in performance even at the same 120mm or 140mm sizes.,"noctua just happens to be freaking awesome air coolers that can beat a lot of water coolers, but you don't tell people to buy a noctua air cooler for 13th gen.. you tell them ""at least a 140mm air cooler for 13th gen"", and that can end up with really bad results.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i jumped into a quick cod mw game this morning and the 13700k was running about 95-100 watts, 70c average on a low fan curve (quiet).",this was run on a oc 3080 at 4k max settings.,i have the cpu set with a 255w limit and all other cpu power settings at auto (haven't had time to tinker yet).,"so i'd guess as long as your case has decent airflow, your u14s will be fine.",you can always undervolt or lower the power limits as well to further reduce heat without losing much performance.,another option that might be a better fit is the 13600k.,"that has a 181 watt max turbo power limit, so you'd have no issues keeping it cool enough at max load.",reviews of it sound like it's a perfect gaming cpu.,"i went with a 13700k for other work reasons (rendering, etc.","), but it's overkill as a gaming cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

>remember a lot of people would think the cooler master 212 would suffice if the 120mm noctua cooler handles it so well.,fair point.,people need to do their research regarding cooling though just like research is needed regarding other parts of building a computer.,even the best air coolers suck (or don't suck enough to be more accurate?),when the case itself has poor airflow.,"ideally you want a case with enough of a gap between the front of the case and the fans for them to draw in maximum air (mesh helps but a mesh case is not necessarily good just by itself, check the clearance on the front intake fans, you'd be surprised how many case manufacturers of 'airflow' cases smother the hell out of them so they can jam the fans as close to the front as possible to blind you with their rgb trash) and you want definitely 2-3 strong intake fans as well as 2-3 strong exhaust fans.","heck i've even seen some extremely dumb stuff like people mounting their cpu cooler backwards and exhausting to the front of the case, into the intake fans (to be fair, for a newbie fan orientation is counter-intuitive, you would think that the pretty side of the fan would face towards the front of the case) or even shoving the back of the computer with the single exhaust up against a wall providing no clearance.","this is not even getting into negative/positive pressure which can effect cooling performance via dust buildup if not factored in for or maintained properly (probably the one area i screwed up, i think the case has slight negative pressure due to slightly better quality exhaust fans).",cooling is a lot more complicated than just slapping a few more $5 fans in.,"quality, orientation and clearance all matter.","however if you factor in for all of this then air cooling is better than all but the beefiest and most expensive aios (custom blocks/loops are in another league obviously) with the advantage of being way, way, way more durable (and if they ever do fail... the fans at least because if your metal tower fails then what the heck exactly did you do?",much cheaper to replace).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it replaces the default ilm (independent loading mechanism) which has been shown to provide uneven pressure on the cpu.,"here's a video explaining it more thoroughly

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysb25vsnbqi",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's a replacement for the lga1700 integrated loading mechanism (ilm).,the stock ilm applies uneven pressure that bends the cpu making cooler contact worse.,the contact frame holds the cpu in place while applying more even pressure to avoid bending the cpu.,the cpu cooler is installed on top like normal and then you get a good flat surface to flat surface contact.,it was very easy to install and reduced my temps by between 5c and 10c.,i was thermal throttling at 220 watts before and now i'm using 260 watts without any problems.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my before idle/gaming temps were on avg 39/85 - after: 33/79,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

wow that's something.,thanks!,did you undervolt also?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 13700k is great (actually a bit overkill for gaming but who cares), nothing limited, i have an h100i 240mm elite capellix, 100c was only a cinebench thing tho, gaming was around 60-80c and now itâ€™s dropped like 6-8 degrees",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's not about the board.,some of the 12-13th gen cpu's ihs surfaces are bending in the middle when using the stock bracket.,due to that there is not enough contact between the cpu and heatsink.,manufacturing problem.,"you was lucky, just like me - my 13700k works perfectly fine without the contact frame aswell.","but there is a lot of people with cpus that are instantly throttling at 100c during the stress test, or just having temps way higher than it should be.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's part of the solution.,the temp drop is still noticeable and useful.,"i've tested this across i5 and i9, and several z690 mobos.","you still need the undervolt/lite load, but the frame also really helps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it changes a lot, first of all it prevents everything from getting dirty with thermal paste, it offers greater contact with the aio, it avoids blending and reduces the temperatures in idle and active.",even the rapidity with which the temperature drops after a stress test seems accelerated.,i'm also using the thermal paste of the same brand combined and i must say that it's very good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

do you have unlimited pl1 & pl2?",i capped those to 254w since i'm gaming 90% of the time.,still getting 40k in c23 with nice temps.,i played around with ac/dc and llc in the bios and undervolted.,is yours at stock bios settings or did you play around with some settings in the bios?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
possibly?,so unconfirmed whether it voids the warranty or intel invents a reason?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you're not modifying or causing damage to the cpu in away way, so how could it possibly cause a warranty issue?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not unless you donâ€™t screw it down properly.,how would you even get worse temperatures from it?,especially seeing that that stock bracket was causing the cpu to bend and not actually get cooled properly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"how's your mounting pressure, too?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you definitely have a mounting error or cooler just isnâ€™t working.,coming from someone that installed their artic 360 wrong two times.,make sure your pump mounting screws are tightened all the way.,on the pump and on the mother board.,one of my motherboard screws wasnâ€™t tightened all the way,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"kind of like opening 3dmark actually causes 80c temp very briefly but running the benchmark only runs it about 65c

make me chuckle.",whatâ€™s your cooler and thermal paste?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you go into the bios and turn off multicore enhancement it should help a ton.,i had to do that as well.,for some reason these new boards have the power boost on max out the box.,i didnâ€™t notice any change in performance but my temps dropped like 20-30 celsius,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i havenâ€™t yet, but plan on trying soon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thats the issueâ€¦ i was going to use it for rendering so temperatures a great concern.,"i was thinking of buying liquid freezer ii 280, power limiting it to 253w, undercoating 0,05 and using a contact frame.",but with that much precautions i might asselvajo get the 13900kâ€¦ miss plug and play cpus :d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this wonâ€™t fix the issue of temps being way higher, the maximum improvement from a contact frame is like 10c.",overvolting can make more than 20c of difference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
two of my performance cores throttle in the fifth or sixth cycle of cinebench but i canâ€™t be bothered to buy the frame and reassemble everything for a benchmark.,it works well in regular use so thatâ€™s fine for me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"but i dont use an aio, only a air cooler ðÿ˜¶
because i read that the heat plate of the u12a is already a little bit convex to help cooling the lga1700 cpus and i think it will not change that much with a frame, where it is a bit of a struggle to install regarding the force of the screws ðÿ«",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"oh.. it shouldnâ€™t be a problem tho, 280mm and 253w with a slight undervolt should do the job.","iâ€™d say if you have the possibility get it from amazon and try it out, if thereâ€™s problems just return it ðÿ˜…",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it wonâ€™t fix the issue?,but it literally does.,"undervolting helps with temps (always did), but contact frame fixes overheating issue in the first place.","also contact frame improves temps by up to ~11c on paper, but in reality the difference can be much higher.","you canâ€™t see the real temp difference, because cpu is not going above ~100c due to throttling.",if it didnâ€™t throttle - temps would have been much higher.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it fixed it for me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
definitely not worth it if you are not overclocking and/or doing any heavy workloads.,messing with contact frame can cause some issues.,"those issues can be fixed, but it requires a lot of time.","you can't overtighten the screws, also they can't be too loose - if something is wrong, then you might not be able to boot, or it could cause some ram instabilities etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"looking at the stock lga 1700 cpu locking system it is evident that the support becomes unbalanced and can cause bending in the long run, while when you use the frame the support becomes perfectly balanced from all sides.","there are absolutely no slight creases, with the frame it is perfectly straight, bending a cpu does not improve dissipation, it does exactly the opposite, unfortunately it bends without using the frame.",my 12600k is perfectly all straight without the slightest crease aligned to the bezel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

itâ€™s simple logic.,do you know what throttling is?,when cpu is reaching ~100c - it starts throttling itself a.k.a.,reducing the clocks/voltage in order to not exceed 100c.,that exists to prevent cpu damage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had an improvement of like 15c in max temps using y-cruncher.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the undervolt alone makes it run about 10c cooler, so definitely try it out and check how much lower voltage your chip can take!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if it doesn't throttle itself, it could end up at whatever number above that.",so it could stabilize at 101c.,it doesn't have to shoot up to 120c or whatever you are thinking it will.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"dude.. i will give you an example:

supposedly you have a good cpu and everything works as intended.",run cinebench or any stresstest --> lets say your temps are at 80c.,"leave it for 30-60min, temps are gonna spike to 85-90c or even more (depending on the cooler).",now we have a whole bunch of people with 12-13th gen intels who get to 100c instantly just after pressing cinebench/stress test start button - thermal throttling right away.,"so you are telling it is gonna ""stabilize"" at 101c?",literally unreal scenario.,"i've seen so many cases on reddit and forums, where people are insta throttling on stock settings and after installing the contact frame their temps normalized in 88-90c range.",idk why you are trying to defend it so hard.,it is a well known intel manufacturing problem.,"some cpus have this issue, some do not.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the temperature is not going to keep going up forever.,"once the heat being created is equal to the heat being removed by the cooler, the temperature will stay exactly the same no matter how long you run the stress test.",">so you are telling it is gonna ""stabilize"" at 101c?",literally unreal scenario.,"i'm not saying it will, i'm saying it's possible.",my point is that just because it's throttling at 100c doesn't mean it will shoot up much higher if you removed the thermal limit.,">i've seen so many cases on reddit and forums, where people are insta throttling on stock settings and after installing the contact frame their temps normalized in 88-90c range.","well it's not what i've seen, i saw people adjusting loadline calibration/""lite load"" settings to fix the instant throttling, because many motherboards are overvolting those cpus out of the box.",contact frames helped but the main fix is to adjust those settings.,"if your motherboard is overvolting your cpu so much that it wants to stabilize at 120c, installing the contact frame and getting a 10c improvement will still mean that your cpu wants to stay at 110c.","the contact frame is not the main fix for the thermal throttling problem, from what i've seen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

give me more cores you blue bastards.,i say that with love.,right now there's no sweet spot for a workhorse dream build until those xeon w's come out... or i guess threadripper 7xxx.,could go threadripper 5995 pro but that's ddr4.,epyc 9xxx exist but no.,"all i want is a 32p 32e version of a 13900k, that's all.","i wish, i wish, i wish, i wish dual socket 13900k were possible.",or some kind of 4x 13900k on fabric make-believe interposer.,"i been 3d modeling waterblocks for lost wax casting based around the supermicro w790 motherboard, as my own form of anticipatory edging.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"very positive news, i'd be fine with no performance uplift from current gen alerlake and 100% focus on performance per watt gain, less heat = more performance in actual real work load scenarios anyway, thats a good focus i think because their current lineup of cpus are getting way to hot to actually use for anything except gaming.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think this will be mobile cpu only.,intel 15th gen will be for desktop.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so do i wait for 14th gen or get 15th gen from my 11th gen i9 ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
right but are they just going to be mobile only?,i need desktop.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh god, now everyone that posted their 13900ks builds are going to be asking about upgrading to this lol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

these articles are just a reproduction of a tweet from [raichu](https://twitter.com/oneraichu/status/1622430910477131777).,he has been fairly reliable previously.,that said another person is saying its bullshit and so i would want to wait until we get some benchmarks.,these things leak early and for mtl i expect them sometime in next few months.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

because intel has done it before.,"new-gen doesn't always mean new desktop gen. 

remember gen 5th?",it could be something like that.,just very few sku are on desktop side.,or maybe even none at all.,it is not the first time intel made a new gen more specific to desktops or laptop.,"since this is mostly for power efficiency, which doesn't really benefit the desktop all that much.",there are some likelihood that might do something similar again and delay desktop until next gen. considering the desktop side is doing okay already.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

stay with 11th gen. you should only upgrade to high-na euv intel skews.,intel 20a processes.,if you had 10th gen intel chip (like me) i will be jumping onto intel 4 (euv process).,4 years is a good time to upgrade.,if you can stretch to 5 or 6 years that will be good use of your money.,3 years is too fast.,[https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/saxowk6binq6mamlbealvi-970-80.png.webp](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/saxowk6binq6mamlbealvi-970-80.png.webp) \- from tom's hardware cpu hierarchy.,from looking at this chart (purely for gaming) i would say if you had an i7 8700k (highest end intel chip for 8th gen) getting 125 fps avg and jumping to 12700k or even 13900k will be a good upgrade.,about roughly 6 year upgrade cycle.,[multi-thread performance](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hxcztqtaclquqxudfcadm9-970-80.png.webp) \- and you can see similar jumps in terms of productivity suites.,so from intel 9th gen upgrading to 13th gen would be a good upgrade.,but your i9 11900k is still at the top of the pack.,especially if you decide to overclock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

temperature/heat output has very little to do with the efficiency of cpus/gpus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you usually need to tinker with bios settings and so.,my 13600k can run with stock speed at 110-120watts in cinebench r23 after tinkering with ia ac dc.,now it pulls 190w at 5.6pcores 4.4ecores and 5.0ring.,so i'm gonna say it is darn efficient imo for the level of performance i'm getting from it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

14th gen is generally referring to meteor lake.,"however, the plan to have raptor lake refresh later this year, if not officially referred to as 14th gen (which i donâ€™t think it would be as it would probably just be a minor speed bump and not a silicon change), would then just be a continuation of 13th gen. maybe 13.5th gen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

> a 100% efficient gpu just means that all the heat produced was used to perform computation.,this theoretically perfect gpu would still require power and produce heat proportional to the # of computations it performed.,"transistors are generally very very close to 100% efficient, so power draw is always the main component when it comes to heat.",your cpu or gpu is basically just as good at turning electricity into heat as an electric furnace would be.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"even if you don't care about the cost, the noise, or the heat dumped into your room, temperature has become a limiting factor behind performance.",are you being deliberately obtuse?,performance can't be pushed further than the 13900k with current technology without reducing energy consumption because it is already at the limits of what can reasonably be dissipated.,the only people who would vocally claim to not care about a reduction in energy consumption are blatantly ignorant.,less heat means more headroom for performance.all you are doing with this post is very publicly looking like a fool.,you don't seem to understand that performance and energy efficiency are intrinsically linked.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

a bad cpu will crash the system.,it will not reduce fps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you undervolt your cpu?,that can cause stuttering in games,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"cpu gone bad, from my experiences its was like this  


\- bsod a lot even at default voltage and setting

\- apps crash a lot without reason",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"voltage is stock, other than enforcing all limits and activating d.o.c.p no changes were made.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ok so, reinstalled the graphic drivers and whatnot, still having fps drop issues.",i'm at a loss here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"what is your gpu, and are you running the latest drivers for everything",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no your cpu is not bad.,mw2 is extremely not optimized and no matter what cpu you have some stutters and drops will happen.,witcher 3 update is not perfect either.,they are hotfixing it.,but either way your fine.,if your not having serious problems then its not your cpu.,probably the games,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, cpu is stock, other than enforcing all limits, though i'm not sure, i think the nvidia driver had issues downloading, i will reinstalling it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, it really is just weird fps all over the place, only in games, did some benchmarks, other than high temps (so a bit lower scores) nothing wrong, no lags or anything like that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"asus rog strix 4080, yep, latest drivers, didn't have any problems last week until friday",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i am getting fps drops in final fantasy 15 as well, tho i had that happen in my old system, now mw 2019 is saying directx has encoutered an issue and won't boot, black ops cold war has some fps drops when i spawn but is otherwise stable.","mw2 a couple of weeks ago i was pushing 225 fps constantly but now not anymore, and there are weird flashes when the drops happen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep that happens to me too.,both final fantasy 15 and mw2 are unoptimized and the game is the issue.,although i never had issues with cold war,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"cold is working ok now, not sure what happened with that one, hogwarts legacy is running smooth at 160 fps everything at ultra except rtx at 1440p so, i gues it really is the game, just weird it happened outta nowhere",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"actually, do you get weird like ambient flashes before the drops happen?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
idk if i say flashes but i wouldnâ€™t worry about it if it doesnâ€™t happen in other games.,warzone should hopefully fixing performance issues,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh, i get like weird flashes before drops on mw2 witcher 3 and ff15.",hopefully warzone does.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

doubt it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think lga 1700 will continue into early 2024 with raptor lake refresh until it's finally replaced with arrow lake.,meteor lake will probably only be available in laptops and possibly nucs with the desktop skipping it altogether.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

rocket lake did work on many z490 boards.,"so a 500 board wasnâ€™t a â€œhardâ€ requirement - and i doubt there would be any significant technology differences with a raptor lake refresh, like rocket lake adding pcie 4.0 and extra pcie lanes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">i would not put it past them for a potential rpl-r cpu to use a random arbitrary new motherboard, just like how rocket lake did.","probably thinking of the 8th gen, where they required the z370, which was actually a z270 with a firmware update that enabled newer processors and locked out older ones.",that's why you could flash a z170/270 board (6/7 gen) to make it work with 8 and 9th gen processors.,i wouldn't be shocked if we see something similar here.,"leading up to the 8th gen launch the leaks suggested it would be compatible, then intel added the firmware lock out at the last minute.",they really like to stick to two generations per platform.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's the only thing keeping from switching to intel, my options right now are, 1 stay with am4 and upgrade to a 5600x(currently have a r5 2600) or 2.go with am5, since i can upgrade in the future, with intel, i'd have to buy a new mobo each upgrade, and they're mobos are not that cheap, especially the z boards",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i saw the slides from intel's investor presentation and there were meteor lake desktop cpu's included.,"in that same presentation it also said that meteor lake was almost ready for mass producing, so imo its likely we see the new socket.",intel did create a lot of confusion throwing the raptor lake refresh idea out there.,i think it was during the time when they weren't sure the new process would be ready.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that article states it as a possibility still though?,it's just stating what is being discussed here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they already did that.,13th gen non k was the refresh for the last profits.,"if 14th gen remains on 1700, it'll be because they are having issues with what was supposed to be 14th gen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"manually put your cooler at 100% fans and pump, then see what your temps are.","that's the most you'll get out of the cooler with the current mounting, paste spread, case airflow, cpu ihs flatness, cpu voltage.","then you know your baseline, you can start investigating, rebuilding and so on

edit: none of your cores have reached 100c, the 100c on the screenshot is your tjmax.",that's the temp at which the bios will tell the cpu to throttle.,"still your temps could be better, but you are not throttling yet",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the answer as discussed in alot of posts is the voltage being set too high in bios.,if you look at the vid its pulling (at leats it thinks so) 1.3243v ... this is way above what it needs.,if you have an msi board go into oc > advanced cpu configuration > msi lite load    its most likely at 12 by default.,set it to 5 or even lower and check if the performance is the same.,me personally i have the same setup but overclocked to 5.4 on p cores and 4.2 on e cores and my max temp during stress testing is about 75 c. i maxed it out at  1.17 volts and could probably go lower.,edit: if you dont have an msi motherboard you can try changing the cpu core voltage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there has been plenty reports about this issue.myself also had this issue.,what really fixed it for me was using a contact frame.,there's plenty youtube videos and also written guides that's talking about the lga1700 socket and explaining why this socket is so bad.,"for example gamer's nexus: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyu1oskby-q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyu1oskby-q) (i recommend watching this video to also see how to apply the contact frame... it's not hard or anything, but you really don't have to tighten it a lot...)

here's a very good article for instance: [https://www.igorslab.de/en/german-engineered-bend-aids-for-intels-lga1700-thermal-grizzly-cpu-contact-frame-and-alphacool-apex-backplate-thermal-testing/](https://www.igorslab.de/en/german-engineered-bend-aids-for-intels-lga1700-thermal-grizzly-cpu-contact-frame-and-alphacool-apex-backplate-thermal-testing/)

you can either buy the more expensive contact frame from thermalgrizzly (the inventor of those) or take the thermalright, like i did: [https://www.amazon.de/thermalright-anti-biege-schnalle-cpu-befestigungsschnalle-cpu-biegekorrekturfixierer-spureninstallation/dp/b0b64xq96x/](https://www.amazon.de/thermalright-anti-biege-schnalle-cpu-befestigungsschnalle-cpu-biegekorrekturfixierer-spureninstallation/dp/b0b64xq96x/)

i'm very certain that you will improve your temps with that by a huge margin... i went from thermalthrottling 100â°c (also having the i5 13600k with a noctua dh15 cooler) to 82â°c max during 2 hours prime.",using cinebench i'm hitting 78â°c max.and my fancurve isn't agressive at all... my fan is basically sitting at 50% all the time.,[https://i.imgur.com/g1qbq3t.png](https://i.imgur.com/g1qbq3t.png),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it replaces the default ilm (independent loading mechanism) which has been shown to provide uneven pressure on the cpu.,"here's a video explaining it more thoroughly

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysb25vsnbqi",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's a replacement for the lga1700 integrated loading mechanism (ilm).,the stock ilm applies uneven pressure that bends the cpu making cooler contact worse.,the contact frame holds the cpu in place while applying more even pressure to avoid bending the cpu.,the cpu cooler is installed on top like normal and then you get a good flat surface to flat surface contact.,it was very easy to install and reduced my temps by between 5c and 10c.,i was thermal throttling at 220 watts before and now i'm using 260 watts without any problems.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my before idle/gaming temps were on avg 39/85 - after: 33/79,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

does it worth it on a 13600k?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

its because the game pre-compiles all the shaders during the first launch in the menu...shader compilation stretches cpu to its limit in doing so.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think itâ€™s the asus rog z790 e gaming,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wow that's something.,thanks!,did you undervolt also?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 13700k is great (actually a bit overkill for gaming but who cares), nothing limited, i have an h100i 240mm elite capellix, 100c was only a cinebench thing tho, gaming was around 60-80c and now itâ€™s dropped like 6-8 degrees",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's not about the board.,some of the 12-13th gen cpu's ihs surfaces are bending in the middle when using the stock bracket.,due to that there is not enough contact between the cpu and heatsink.,manufacturing problem.,"you was lucky, just like me - my 13700k works perfectly fine without the contact frame aswell.","but there is a lot of people with cpus that are instantly throttling at 100c during the stress test, or just having temps way higher than it should be.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's part of the solution.,the temp drop is still noticeable and useful.,"i've tested this across i5 and i9, and several z690 mobos.","you still need the undervolt/lite load, but the frame also really helps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it changes a lot, first of all it prevents everything from getting dirty with thermal paste, it offers greater contact with the aio, it avoids blending and reduces the temperatures in idle and active.",even the rapidity with which the temperature drops after a stress test seems accelerated.,i'm also using the thermal paste of the same brand combined and i must say that it's very good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

do you have unlimited pl1 & pl2?",i capped those to 254w since i'm gaming 90% of the time.,still getting 40k in c23 with nice temps.,i played around with ac/dc and llc in the bios and undervolted.,is yours at stock bios settings or did you play around with some settings in the bios?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
possibly?,so unconfirmed whether it voids the warranty or intel invents a reason?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you're not modifying or causing damage to the cpu in away way, so how could it possibly cause a warranty issue?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not unless you donâ€™t screw it down properly.,how would you even get worse temperatures from it?,especially seeing that that stock bracket was causing the cpu to bend and not actually get cooled properly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"how's your mounting pressure, too?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you definitely have a mounting error or cooler just isnâ€™t working.,coming from someone that installed their artic 360 wrong two times.,make sure your pump mounting screws are tightened all the way.,on the pump and on the mother board.,one of my motherboard screws wasnâ€™t tightened all the way,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"kind of like opening 3dmark actually causes 80c temp very briefly but running the benchmark only runs it about 65c

make me chuckle.",whatâ€™s your cooler and thermal paste?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you go into the bios and turn off multicore enhancement it should help a ton.,i had to do that as well.,for some reason these new boards have the power boost on max out the box.,i didnâ€™t notice any change in performance but my temps dropped like 20-30 celsius,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i havenâ€™t yet, but plan on trying soon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thats the issueâ€¦ i was going to use it for rendering so temperatures a great concern.,"i was thinking of buying liquid freezer ii 280, power limiting it to 253w, undercoating 0,05 and using a contact frame.",but with that much precautions i might asselvajo get the 13900kâ€¦ miss plug and play cpus :d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this wonâ€™t fix the issue of temps being way higher, the maximum improvement from a contact frame is like 10c.",overvolting can make more than 20c of difference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
two of my performance cores throttle in the fifth or sixth cycle of cinebench but i canâ€™t be bothered to buy the frame and reassemble everything for a benchmark.,it works well in regular use so thatâ€™s fine for me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"but i dont use an aio, only a air cooler ðÿ˜¶
because i read that the heat plate of the u12a is already a little bit convex to help cooling the lga1700 cpus and i think it will not change that much with a frame, where it is a bit of a struggle to install regarding the force of the screws ðÿ«",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"oh.. it shouldnâ€™t be a problem tho, 280mm and 253w with a slight undervolt should do the job.","iâ€™d say if you have the possibility get it from amazon and try it out, if thereâ€™s problems just return it ðÿ˜…",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it wonâ€™t fix the issue?,but it literally does.,"undervolting helps with temps (always did), but contact frame fixes overheating issue in the first place.","also contact frame improves temps by up to ~11c on paper, but in reality the difference can be much higher.","you canâ€™t see the real temp difference, because cpu is not going above ~100c due to throttling.",if it didnâ€™t throttle - temps would have been much higher.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it fixed it for me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
definitely not worth it if you are not overclocking and/or doing any heavy workloads.,messing with contact frame can cause some issues.,"those issues can be fixed, but it requires a lot of time.","you can't overtighten the screws, also they can't be too loose - if something is wrong, then you might not be able to boot, or it could cause some ram instabilities etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"looking at the stock lga 1700 cpu locking system it is evident that the support becomes unbalanced and can cause bending in the long run, while when you use the frame the support becomes perfectly balanced from all sides.","there are absolutely no slight creases, with the frame it is perfectly straight, bending a cpu does not improve dissipation, it does exactly the opposite, unfortunately it bends without using the frame.",my 12600k is perfectly all straight without the slightest crease aligned to the bezel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

itâ€™s simple logic.,do you know what throttling is?,when cpu is reaching ~100c - it starts throttling itself a.k.a.,reducing the clocks/voltage in order to not exceed 100c.,that exists to prevent cpu damage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had an improvement of like 15c in max temps using y-cruncher.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the undervolt alone makes it run about 10c cooler, so definitely try it out and check how much lower voltage your chip can take!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if it doesn't throttle itself, it could end up at whatever number above that.",so it could stabilize at 101c.,it doesn't have to shoot up to 120c or whatever you are thinking it will.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"dude.. i will give you an example:

supposedly you have a good cpu and everything works as intended.",run cinebench or any stresstest --> lets say your temps are at 80c.,"leave it for 30-60min, temps are gonna spike to 85-90c or even more (depending on the cooler).",now we have a whole bunch of people with 12-13th gen intels who get to 100c instantly just after pressing cinebench/stress test start button - thermal throttling right away.,"so you are telling it is gonna ""stabilize"" at 101c?",literally unreal scenario.,"i've seen so many cases on reddit and forums, where people are insta throttling on stock settings and after installing the contact frame their temps normalized in 88-90c range.",idk why you are trying to defend it so hard.,it is a well known intel manufacturing problem.,"some cpus have this issue, some do not.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the temperature is not going to keep going up forever.,"once the heat being created is equal to the heat being removed by the cooler, the temperature will stay exactly the same no matter how long you run the stress test.",">so you are telling it is gonna ""stabilize"" at 101c?",literally unreal scenario.,"i'm not saying it will, i'm saying it's possible.",my point is that just because it's throttling at 100c doesn't mean it will shoot up much higher if you removed the thermal limit.,">i've seen so many cases on reddit and forums, where people are insta throttling on stock settings and after installing the contact frame their temps normalized in 88-90c range.","well it's not what i've seen, i saw people adjusting loadline calibration/""lite load"" settings to fix the instant throttling, because many motherboards are overvolting those cpus out of the box.",contact frames helped but the main fix is to adjust those settings.,"if your motherboard is overvolting your cpu so much that it wants to stabilize at 120c, installing the contact frame and getting a 10c improvement will still mean that your cpu wants to stay at 110c.","the contact frame is not the main fix for the thermal throttling problem, from what i've seen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

use hwinfo and not hardware monitor.,and also check your mount of your cpu cooler.,unless you have no power limits you should be able to keep the temps down a little better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not out of the ordinary at 300w.",you can mitigate it by lowering load line drive strength or undervolting slightly.,they're hot chips at full tilt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the cpu is running at 300w, so you need some good cooling.",what cooler do you have?,"also use hwinfo64 instead, more reliable and no trail.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
try running it at intel spec?,you are at 300w and we couldnt tell how much throttling is happening without its current clock speed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what is that lite load.,im not aware if my asus z790 hero mobo has that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how long of cinebench?,single pass?,multiple passes?,10min?,i have the same cooler.,make sure pump and fans are extreme in icue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what speed do the fans get to?,under load you need to set them quite high for the cooler to do it's job properly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have on balanced on icue software",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its at 2500rpm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pretty normal unless you change things.,i have power unlocked like you and with fans and pump set at extreme i hit 90-92c on a single pass with a max of 335w.,as long as you aren't seeing temps like this gaming enjoy unlocked power and know you could always limit power if you're worried about temps.,could try undervolting too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i turn off the mce on bios and the temp get lower to 93 degrees maybe i can try with mce on and raise the fan speed on icue software to extreme and try like that and see what happen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sounds worth trying.,if you limit power limits to 253w you can get fairly similar cinebench scores and not have to worry about temps as much also.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
where i can do the undervolting im new on pc that why jajaj,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can undervolt in the bios.,you can download intel xtu and do it there also.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the only 2 use-cases where i really notice dpc latency problems are in vr and in real-time audio  (like playing guitar through ableton with some vsts and an asio soundcard).,"otherwise, your pc could have some slight dpc latency spikes every now and then but you'll probably never even notice it and you can't even tell if its truly 'buttery smooth' or not.","and no, latencymon spikes do correlate with crackled sound in ableton for me.",dpc latency check v1.4.0 is also a good tool.,this is my virtual machine https://i.imgur.com/dwrwg0p.png which i use for ableton.,works better than the dual-boot (bare metal) windows 11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there are few situations where latencymons numbers can be a little bit distorted but none of those situations give numbers that prove to be actual ""problems"" with a computer, if latencymon says you have high latency it's not lying.",just because you perceive your pc to be buttery smooth doesn't mean latencymon is giving you false numbers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"not sure about the battery life stuff, however i do have a 4k display and itâ€™s always on high power, so is the fan profile but thatâ€™s really good to know, thanks!",!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i get a good 6 hours tbhðÿ˜­,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
high power plan?,"personal option: that's stupid, especially on laptops, because the idle wattage goes way up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the battery life of my xps with i7 1185g7 is like less than half of my xps with a i5-8250u.,i expected less battery life but not going from 9-10 down to 3-4.. both are the 1080p models btw.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's mainly because i do a lot of things at once on the laptop, so its under load a lot.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh shitðÿ’€, ion know why that happens but i get 4-6 hours when my power and fan modes are set to performance, so iâ€™m kinda happy with it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""high power"" wont give you more computing power as ""balanced"" afaik.",maybe thats not true anymore?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i suspect partially dells design with the 9310 and the linux drivers for tigerlake and xe not being optimized as well as the older kaby lake refresh and intel uhd graphics.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™m not sure, itâ€™s because i edit stuff, do
coding and have music apps running, sometimes all at once so high power/ performance is more convenient for me",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ah, i have an asus zenbook and theree very good for battery life",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">temps at idle are 60 c for 50w

the mount is bad.",take a photo the paste imprint.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"something is wrong, did you carry any of the spacers or other hardware from your am4 install forward or use exclusively the new hardware?","guessing if the screws were hard to get in you've either cross threaded or were cut wrong in the kit you were sent, them leading to insufficient mounting pressure.",otherwise you've mixed hardware with spacers designed for two different cpu sockets which is also a major issue.,honestly i'd contact becool and see about a new mounting kit and follow the instructions explicitly.,that cooler is more than capable of dealing with a 13600k.,a thermalright mounting frame isn't a terrible idea if the cooler has a flat vs convex surface but it's not going to solve the bigger issue with temps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you remove the plastic from the cooler?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've had 12700k tdp is the same as 13600k.,using noctua d15 i had 35c in idle and 75-80c in cb23 multi.,but in idle cooler fan didn't work and i use termaright device for cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"get contact frame and it should be fine, though idle temps are exceptionally horrible.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
those are the temps for 13600k on air coolers.,it is hot as hell and without a 360 aio you would not have decent temps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
def not normal.,take the cooler off and post a picture of the cpu.,you might need a contact frame or you might have installed it wrong.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
check the hardware canucks video about raptor lake power settings and how to set it so it wont reach 100c.,if the problem persist check the cooler installation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"cpu: i5 13600k, 
mobo: msi pro z690-a ddr4 & 
aio cooler: corsair h100i v2

i managed to reduce my temps from 88-100c while in game (mw2) to now 62-70c with the following:

1. i reset my mobo bios to default (bios > f6)
2. changed the following under oc / advanced cpu configuration:
- cpu cooler tuning: boxed cooler
- cpu lite mode: mode 2 (default is 9/12)
- enhanced turbo: disabled

note: dropping the cpu lite load can cause instability (crashing, bsod) so if you experience this turn it back up +1 and retry until you no longer crash.","i did not test this personally, but i didn't see a massive performance loss overall.",maybe around ~20 fps in mw2; i still typically get 160+ on a 144hz monitor so that loss isn't big for me.,you can see the performance tests for various cpu lite modes at 3:20 on this video: https://youtu.be/-mkavitzoly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i had the same problem, open intel overclock software and look at the tdp, set a limit at whatever the cooler is rated for.","i use a noctua d9l with 3 fans, had to limit to  185w power draw.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you really need an aio for intel this gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>i used new mounting kiit with new screws.,i will try remounting it with more paset and see how it goes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there was no plastic since i used this cooler for 2 years in my previous build.,"it was working fine with ryzen 3700x, so i doubt i didn't remove it, plus i would notice plastic when i was cleaning old paste.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"its not my idles are in 30s, 13600k + deepcool ak420",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you really dont with 13600k..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't think this is a paste issue.,if you've used this cooler before with an amd processor i'm going to assume you got the protective plastic film off of the coldplate.,you mentioned that getting the screws in was tough so i'm guessing this is a mechanical issue with the way you are mounting it or the mounting kit itself.,are you sure that the heatsink is not hitting a vrm heatsink on the mainboard which is preventing the cold plate from making complete contact with the cpu ihs?,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dh9gcfndek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dh9gcfndek)

start with the backplate and make sure you are in the outer / s1700 position for all 4 of the screws that pass through, and make sure that the doughnut bumper/washers are flush and locked into the channel on the screw at all 4 corners before proceeding.","once the backplate is on the board, make sure you turn the mounting nuts on the motherboard counter clockwise until you feel the ""click"" when the threads align, then loosely hand tighten clockwise normally... do the same for all 4 to start out the standoff nuts but leave them ""loose"" so you can tighten them down evenly later.",go back and hand tighten opposing corners just until you meet resistance on all corners.,then go opposite corner to opposite corner and add one turn each one at a time with a screwdriver until they are hand tight.,"mount the two crossbars with the heatsink mounting studs, again loosely in each corner and then follow up one turn each corner to corner until it's screwdriver tight.",apply heatsink compound in a thin layer (i like to put a small pea side dab and then put my finger through a plastic bag and use it to spread the compound evenly across the surface.,"place the heatsink on the processor and move it around slightly to ensure it's making good contact (it should ""slide"" on the heatsink compound).","then engage the threads + one turn on each side to start the mounting screws and then drive them in 4 turns at a time until you meet resistance, then switch to one turn each until both are tight.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what does your temps spike to under gaming or load?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is aio a must for i5 13600k?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i remounted cooler and now my temps are much better.,check edited post.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
idk about spikes but my cpu tems are around 60 degrees,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
let me tell you this.. my 690 edge(cheap) and my z790 tachyon have same r23 score at 42450k.,my z790 can run 8000+ ram and i love it.,if you have ddr4 buy edge.,easy oc for 13900k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a msi pro z790-a wifi and it's held up excellently with my 13700k and has no issues at all with my 32gb of ddr5 6000 cl30.,unless you really need certain features on those motherboards you probably don't need to spend much on z790 motherboards.,which cpu are you planning to get?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you're not looking to overclock, any boards good.",manufacturers have been polishing their bios since the z690 release.,"if overclocking, both the msi edge and asus strix e have pretty overkill vrms.",go with what you like.,"im currently using a strix-e, rams are undervolted from the xmp profile but overclocked to 7400mhz.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you go to amazon and newegg usa you can read reviews.,you can probably get a much cheaper and more reliable mainboard?,ddr5 is still progressing and getting cheaper.,next gen intel better?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
z790 edge for sure i use it with 13900k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got a z790-e & love it.,"that being said, you could get away with an f if you aren't planning on doing a bunch of oc.","i asked the same question to asus & they said this about the e & f:

> e has slightly increased vrm, more rear high speed ports, debug display and other items are noted in the overview but for many the -f is a great balance of features, functions and specifications and would make for a great foundation for a build.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

seriously this processor will outlast longer than you would ever want to use it.,besides what are you doing that you are hitting 100c all day long?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i mean you're splitting hairs at a certain point.,depends what your use cases are as to which is better.,the 13900k and 7950x are both stupid halo products 90% of the people buying them don't need.,they are also stupid in that they aren't very good for the people that are buying them that do need them.,gamers don't need to have 16 cores or 8+16 like the 7950x/13900k have.,"the people who do need that many cores also would benefit from things like ecc ram, quad channel (or even octa channel) memory, and additional pci-e lanes.",the 7950x and 13900k becoming effectively replacements for the threadripper/x299 platforms is really not fitting actual needs of most users.,"anyways, my point is instead of arguing about which one is better we need to get rightly pissed that neither is what they should be.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hows it run?,id consider using an intel gpu as my next card in a few years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just got mine and ordered a vertical gpu mount.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
these are honestly getting better and better every day.,already faster than my 3070 which is a great gpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love the competition that intel brought to the table.,would expect them to be more competitive as the years go by but so far the only card that would consider and recommend buying is the a750.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my thoughts are as follows..man bump you i want one let me borrow 5 dollars..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's nice that the us got a price cut.,"the a750 in france is over 320 euros, which is well above 250 usd....",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love the simplicity in the design :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just got mine the other day.,ordered a 750 from newegg and received the 770 16gb by mistake.,absolutely great looking card.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hmm so they didnâ€™t go bust yet then.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

wow wait what it is?,how so exactly?,i was under the impression that an a770 would compete with a 3060?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but in tech power up says the 3070 is faster by 46%,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i don't really play roblox, but my favorite game (monster hunter) has been running great at max settings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why even make the comment?,these are good cards and the price fairly reflects the performance gap between this and flagship nvidia / amd products.,it's a solid mid range choice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thatâ€™s pretty cool!,"if youâ€™re up to it, report back with some of your findings.",these cards greatly fascinate me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™ve been impressed by their achievements.,the timespy results show a beast card.,so itâ€™s weird that it benches slightly below a 3060 right now.,they have some fiddling to do still but the market needs these.,i think i will pick one up.,but i want to wait for a really cool looking one first.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i owned one when they came out, i have gone through the updates for them, i have an rtx 3080 ti for my main card, i just used this as my main card for months just to test it thoroughly, intel is doing everything correct in my eyes, of course we expect growing pains but for the price to performance no other card on the market competes, it very easily keeps up with an rtx 3070, easily overpowering an rtx 2080ti.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they need more designs for sure.,more board partners would be nice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it absolutely does not perform under a 3060, it performs almost as well as my 3080 ti which is immensely surprising, i didn't overclock it.",i would say its on par with a 3070.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at what resolution and which games?,this has me genuinely curious..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i guess at raw performance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we can't hear you over the sound of your coil whine and stock cpu cooler.,speak louder.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what graphics driver?,"for integrated graphics, or for arc?",which cpu or gpu exactly?,windows 10 or 11?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel core i3 350m i know its old the intel website doesnt have the latest diver,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

try to rollback the driver and manually install the new one.,also you might want to disable searching for new drivers in windows update,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hm.,are you sure the driver is the problem?,if your laptop was reset it could also be that the ram is clocked down or the igpu has less ram allocation.,this can also affect igpu performance.,if windows says its the newest driver it should not perform super bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this isnt the latest unforntinlty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
didnt work i had it downloaded i cant install it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
okay how do you know that?,when was this latest driver released / what does it add support for?,if you have more information it might help people help you find that new driver,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because before my idiotic brother reseted the laptop it was running fine and no bsod whatsoever and it had better opengl than this shithole and it could hold better memory and not this shit sorry im just pissed brother i had a bad day,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"maybe you find one here depending on what operating system you are running [see here](https://www.runonpc.com/intel-core-i3-cpu-m-350-2-27ghz-driver-download-for-windows/) ngl, this thing is not gonna put up good opengl performance even with better drivers.",a reset should actually help by removing all of the bloat.,"maybe try running some lightweight linux distro, but you won't want to use something this slow for a long time",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's pretty obvious imo.,even a 13900k has to be powered 100% to beat it i believe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's because it's not an absolute, arm varies just like any other soc or architecture.","it depends on which chip you are comparing, what cores, generation etc.","if you were to ask what's faster a tegra x1+ or a 1255u the answer is the intel overwhelmingly, and they are both 15w chips.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no womder people are pissed about 14nm as it has multiple board gen despite using the same node.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

are people still seriously fearmongering about aio leaks?,that is absolutely ridiculous.,like... stop.,plz.,13600k can work just fine with either a high end air cooler or 240mm+ aio.,it comes down to a matter of preference and your spatial limitations.,"on my 13600kf, i personally use a 360mm corsair (front side mounted on o11d) and get great temperatures.",if you plan to oc go aio for sure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you dislike the size of the d15 then the u12a is definitely one to take a look at.,that and the ak620 or the peerless assassin.,i use a u12a on my 13700k and my cpu idles at 32c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have a thermalright pa120 on  13600k with pl1 set to 125w, and hit about 80â° c under load.",i'm getting an lga 1700 contact plate to see if that would further improve thermals.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i water cooling is gonna give better performance for the size, but modern air coolers are pretty damn good.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

op are you still figuring it out?,"if it helps, less than a week ago i changed platforms to the 13600kf and am currently using a very aesthetically pleasing air cooler, the deepcool ak620.","in terms of how it looks, i find it pretty high up there, and it comes in three colors, the regular silver and black, a blacked out version and a whited out one (the regular options for mid to high end air coolers).",i'd be glad to share any temp test you might be curious about to find out about performance.,"also, if you can get it in your area (i couldn't), check out the id-cooling se-207-xt advanced.","it was the twin tower air cooler i was originally searching for, and seen a few reviews of.",seems like absolutely insane value and looks phenomenal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the recommendation.,i always used stock cooler with my cpus and was ok but i want to buy i5-13600k and i was looking for a cooler.,"i checked on youtube and seams that both ak620 and pa120 are perfect for 13600k, pa120 is not available in my country but ak620 is perfect.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
somewhat a unrelated question: i am planning to get the 13700k sometimes soon.,i am going to pair it with a air cooler and i am not going to oc it.,"if any, i might undervolt it and i read something about setting tdp to a lower level to keep the temperature cooler.",do i require a z690 motherboard in order to set the tdp to a lower level?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's some serious fear mongering right there.,if you want to say that then you can say a defective fan pin can short circuit a motherboard when your away.,if for some reason a leak does happen guess what?,everything will be replaced by the company.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fan speed and noise?,"i'd bet the 80c is not anywhere near silent when running at 100%, even without avx.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13600k is great with undervolting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
even older air coolers are still good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how are the cpu temps under load with ak620?,i have the same non-f cpu and i'm doing some research before buying the ak620.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"b660 will do if you don't care about oc, z690 is not required but do make sure the board you are buying support bios flashback, else you will need a 12th gen cpu to update the bios before you can run a 13th gen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i said ""for peace of mind"", and i especially stated the chance of aio leaking is rare, how is that fearmongering?","my point is with air cooler, it is an install-and-forget solution, especially if you run your pc 24/7 and often unattended.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah it's hitting north of 1400rpm with stock fans, so not particularly quiet, but it's a $40 cooler.",i might replace the stock fans with noctua's to see how much that'll do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can do that with an aioâ€¦ if your that paranoid about it then donâ€™t buy one but donâ€™t try and spread fear of it when itâ€™s a better cooling solution especially for these hot chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm simply stating facts, both air and aio has their pros and cons.",you might wanna reread the op about him having no intention of overclocking so an air cooler is perfectly fine for his usage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so its a fact that if you leave your pc on your aio will fail?,no thats speculation.,hell your cpu fan could stop spinning or your motherboard can short out.,"but hey, only stating facts.",its a really dumb thing to bring up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
an aio will fail at some point.,"depending on materials, the pump may get gunned up, it could lose fluid, thaw pump can just fail, etc.",the risk of fan failure is constant between the two.,as far as performance i swapped from a be quiet 240mm aio to a noctua and got better performance and no annoying pump sound.,my other pc is a custom loop and i can assure you that aio coolers are overrated,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, the fact is there is no guarantee that the aio will never leak.",is it rare and uncommon?,yes.,can it happen?,yes.,"unlike a failed fan or pump, a leak is catastrophic.","i did not say anything about one solution being better than the other, again, they both have pros and cons.","hence, i said ""avoid for peace of mind"" not ""avoid at all cost.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that geekbench score is better than my old i5-4570.,if only the platform is available in normal matx size.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
he mentions that it's single-channel but according to ark all alder lake-n cpus will be single channel only.,this is probably fine for the really low end and could be offset with lpddr5 later or in slightly fancier machines.,it looks like power consumption is similar to my n5100 while being up to 50% faster singe core and about 40% multi-core.,there's supposed to be an [n305 8-core acer laptop](https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/19980555) but i haven't seen it reviewed yet.,edit: some comments on the video are saying that the n6005 is still faster.,that's not the case at least based on geekbech ([774/2536](https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/20267533) vs [960/2658](https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/20326618)) or [cinebench](https://youtu.be/il00ymctv0g?t=327).,games might be different as it has fewer eus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that review shows that it's faster in most games despite being single channel.,"the reason is because the frames are high enough and because the cpu is drastically faster, it makes up for whatever deficiency there is.",the e core development is very exciting.,they are one of the few bright spots within intel.,"clustered decode, pre decode cache, they are all new ideas to continue to advance x86.",the gap per clock compared to p cores are around 50% now without accounting for ht.,i think the long term goal is 30%.,"that means:

"to maximize your chances of never throttling,

1. buy a contact frame for your cpu to maximize contact area with your cooler.",2. have good thermal paste contact between cpu and cooler.,3. have a case with good airflow.,4. undervolt your cpu to minimize power dissipation while maximizing performance.,i use intels xtu and cinebench r23.,"start at -0.05,v.",my score went from 37k @ 330w(stock) to 39k @270w at -0.055v.,p cores run at 5500mhz.,e cores run at 4400mhz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i guess my next question would be what 360mm will fit on my z690-e and will a 240mm work?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this the problem either aois...  will they fit ?,sometimes a 360 can be fitted top or front but may interfere with gpu or hard drive cage.,you need to check dimensions.,and a noctua dh15 is 185mm ...  do check your case it wide enough.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
w680 for sure if you can find one that doesnâ€™t cost you more than the rest of the build.,but honestly the only feature you should be interested in w680 is ecc support.,almost none of the z790 features vs b660 or other cheaper boards are in any way useful for a media and storage server.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
w680 is basically z690 plus ecc support.,z790 is basically z690 with 4 chipset lanes of pcie 3.0 upgraded to 4.0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the insight.,i really am considering the w680 boards because of the ecc memory.,"the ddr5 memory is a plus, if i can find it.","and because i'm planning on the igpu of the 13600k for plex transcoding, i really am not planning on running a separate gpu as of right now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
revision 3 does still have issues.,and there are several.,"the disconnect issue (â€œa network cable is unpluggedâ€) can be related to driver power management, a poor quality cable, or the intel adapter simply not liking to communicate with whatever is at the other end of the line - and apparently there are a lot of devices it doesnâ€™t like communicating with.","a lot of people have success by changing what it communicates with, by inserting a different switch into the middle of the line.","iâ€™m using an i225-v r3 in a z690 board and it has no problem communicating with my hp gigabit switch, and used to have an issue where it would stop working during a reboot or after being in bios (â€œcannot start code 10â€) but that hasnâ€™t happened for some months now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

try using cru (custom resolution utility).,you can find a guide online.,"it is generally used for refresh rate overclocking on laptops, but it can also be used to set a custom refresh rate and lower it to 59 as you require.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

going for the kf it is faster than the f,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the k is better if your doing basically all sorts of things with your pc, such as productivity, rendering, gaming, uploading, etc.","if your just gaming, you can save a couple bucks and go with the kf because your using your dgpu for gaming.",people also often buy the a non-f version of a cpu in case their dgpu dies/acts weird/they have to boot with it uninstalled.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you'd have to put the gpu into x8 mode or just run the ssd on a 2.0 lane.,"usually the point of optane is low latency, not bandwidth (otherwise just get a normal ssd), so not a huge loss.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

oh it sucks big time.,i'm an hourly employee at ra and nobody is happy in our section.,the recognition system was a pretty decent hit to us along with no raises this year.,the funny thing is that our group is desperately understaffed and they were telling us that decent sized crop of new employees would be added in march before this news hit.,it also hits when our section is making a push for hazard pay due to our constant exposure to the chemical byproducts of chip manufacturing.,doesn't help that portland's cost of living is starting to get california crazy either.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

iâ€™m approaching my 2 year anniversary as a tech at intel and feel like iâ€™ve just lost all incentive to do anything but the bare minimum to not get fired.,"no opportunity for raises, and significant cut backs to benefits and bonuses.",really feels like they just wanted to do mass layoffs and instead chose to give all their employees their employees the finger instead and hope they get the same results from attrition.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i mean, i know what i'm doing from now on instead of busting my butt... working slow, because there's now no incentive to work hard.","i put 110% into the company for 9 years with minimal raises, no promotions, told it's a ""meritocracy"" company, and this year i was supposed to see something returned for that hard work.",today i'm just mass applying everywhere i can.,9 years of loyalty for nothing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

as early as last year they were having an incredibly poor retention rate largely in part due to compensation.,raises since i've been here have been completely laughable.,"1.5%, 2.5%, 3%... these were the raises i got my first 3 years working as a technician.","now,  that being said i was also hired in at higher base pay than my peers,  but that's absolutely no excuse to not increase my salary according to my performance among my peers.",just last year there was a reevaluation of everyone's pay.,we were having technicians that were there for 3 years making 15k less on base pay than the associates they were just hiring.,"they did a pretty good job of bringing a lot of people up to a more competitive rate,  but management was celebrating that some people were getting 10%, 15% raises,  but completely miss the mark of the fact that we shouldn't have been that low to begin with.",now that the very next year they are taking away that same raise that so many people were long overdue for is just laughable.,"how can you make such a drastic move to level out pay across the org and bring everyone to a more competitive rate because you're hemorrhaging talent and the very next year say, ha just kidding we need that back.",they are going to find out that for a lot of people this was their last straw.,the first week i got there i was sitting with some engineers at lunch and one of them was talking about a peer that was going on sabbatical and never coming back.,"they were using that month of as a vacation,  but also a time to find a better job.","after 4 years of working here, i now see why that option is so popular.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

good bot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the retirement cut is what gets me.,i got in at intel when they had a pension.,then 2 years in they do away with for 401k cause it has the benefit of more money.,now you just cut that out.,sure it's only hopefully one year but that's 2.5% that would compound for the next 20ys,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you considered the many employees hired during the good times in the last two years that werenâ€™t eligible for good bonuses last year?,those that are now having their pay and benefits reduced?,"some of us joined too late for the boom, but in time for the bust.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would much rather get rid of 10% of my team and do more work than take a paycut.,they now need to increase headcount because no one is going to be working.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

* ceo by 25%
* elt by 15%
* g12+ by 10%
* g7-11 by 5%

just utterly insane if you want to retain and motivate people to turn things around.",i'm sure everyone is very excited to work harder for less now!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if intel is gonna get out of this theyâ€™ll need to retain a good chunk of their people, not fire them, then in a year and a half from now try to hire them all back when they need to ramp gnr/sierra forest/lunar lake.","i can understand the move, but to do all of this just so they can not touch the dividendâ€¦.",i donâ€™t get it.,hurt operations just so the stock is a bit more appealing to some boomers looking for cashflow??,lmao.,"you want yield buy treasuries, buy a reit, or best yet buy a rental property.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's way more than a 5% minimum.,the bonuses are easily 10% of t.comp plus 5+% in pay for salaried folks plus 2.5% match on the 401k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ceo made 178 million last year.,the c suits makes most of their money outside of salary anyway so a 25% salary cut isnâ€™t as bad as it sounds.,in comparison lisa siu made 29.5 million.,standard employees lose qpb worth an additional 5% of their pay and 2.5% on 401k matching.,to me it seems like rather than cutting the fat or dropping the dividend they took the cash from employees.,hurt the everyday man but save the stock and avoid bad press of layoffs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think this has the biggest impact in reducing cost.,"intel has very large manpower resource 131,900 employees.","in terms of revenue per capita (employee), amd is usd1.5 million/employee while intel is only usd 0.5 million per employee.","also, intel is too burdened with interest payments on big debts/loans and depreciation costs on too much assets that impact profitability.","when the market has low demand on products and hence low revenues, profit is impacted as you cannot just magically reduce fixed costs of the company.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"it is better than layoffs, those would require cutting projects, etc, if we did.",which would hurt us more in the future.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"mi guessing management is trying to keep stock price up, via the dividend and just waiting it out for a 2024 resurgence when granite, and sierra forest launch, maybe they think cutting the dividend or massive layoffs will tank the stock.",they may feel that the damage to the stock might be irreversible.,"shitty situation all around as employes are the scape goat, i think pat might be genuine in trying to make things right, but i don't know if the board and shareholders will allow him to.",situation is just fucked all around.,id rather just pause and resume the dividend after some time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

but i don't want to work on glued together chips...lol...jk.,that whole back and forth on that is hilarious inter-corporate politics :p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sounds like layoffs are happening in addition to the pay cuts.,i donâ€™t know of anyone in my former team  (salaried) who didnâ€™t work insane hours.,meetings with employees in one country at 7 am.,meetings with employees in another country at 7 pm was a norm for many.,one of my former coworkers was laid off and said my former team was decimated.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"honestly, as much as i don't want it, they should just pause dividends for the next year for two, that would literally put them above water until they get their stuff together",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
after what?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my friend, bk is the reason intel is in this mess.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's because intel is cutting pay and laying off people.,https://www.kcra.com/article/intel-warns-officials-it-plans-343-layoffs-at-its-folsom-campus/42713826,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's also because they are still paying out to shareholders.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
everything those companies are doing + network + leftovers of ssd/optane stuff?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
exactly this.,for them to finally realize that they aren't retaining people due to compensation and attempt to make it right by substantial raises across the board to only take it away a year later.... wtf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i don't think he got that 178 mil those were merit-based, which i'm sure he didn't meet.",they should cut dividends for 2 years..... thats an instant 12 billion for the books,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that includes the one time $110m hiring package, which will pay out in 3-5 years if the company hits its targets.","currently $80m of that is trending to zero, and is practically impossible for him to get unless some absolute miracle happens to the share price.","also $10m of it was a match for a $10m intel share purchase that he made with his own money, which has now lost 50% of its value.","his actual yearly compensation for 2023 is about $26m, 90% of it shares.","obviously not bad, but he is also not making hundreds of millions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the vast majority of that compensation is incentive pay he did not obtain.,"media trying to make it out like he received 9 figures in 2022, when he only received 7. that's a big difference.","in 2023, i imagine that will fall to 6 figures unless the market cap doubles or triples.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in salary, yes.","it's 1.1m/year, the rest is in stock, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well thatâ€™s why all these tech companies are timing their layoffs and sharing notes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that would require a level of both cunning and competency which i doubt exists.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i believe that someone asked that question and the rsu are still available for the performance review,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

and the eu too (billions) :d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah but it comes from cash flow which is also an indicator of how healthy a company is.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i donâ€™t disagree with the reality of it and that itâ€™s part of current life.,"in fact, thatâ€™s the actual point.",you are just looking at it from the perspective of the group trying to take advantage of the workers.,iâ€™m looking at it from the worker perspective and wall street forcing corporations to take advantage of the workers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
better they have a good way of locating high performers and provide better deals for them otherwise those high performers will leave for the competition and they will be left with useless people.,i think it is normal for companies to have good and bad years but it can just makes things go south very quickly.,i would definitely prefer layoffs or shutting down branches that doesn't make them money but this.. i am not so sure of... at least the bags i am holding probably not as heavy as many other people.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you're right, it has destroyed motivation.",senior high performers are already looking around.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
welp.,i don't think compensation is great at amd but at least they're not doing layoffs and pay cuts yet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for entry to mid level engineers it is significantly lower than the competition.,when i started at intel as an entry level engineer 4 years ago my salary was the same as the starting salary in 2008. other semiconductor companies in phoenix are offering at least 30% more than what iâ€™m making now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"itâ€™s not bad for engineers (but is much behind for software, compared to big tech at least).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they are spending 20 billion on ramping up the new manufacturing with euv lithography.,amd already paid those costs so itâ€™s not going to be a fair comparison between the two for at least a few years.,but unfortunately that nuance is lost on wall street.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
recognition at least for my team is huge.,i probably got 4k+ from recognitions last year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what are benefits of rule of 75 other than rsu vesting?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don't forget they paid $1.5 billion in dividends *just last quarter*.,nearly $6 billion throughout the whole year.,paying that amount in a single quarter while heavily reducing pay of basically everyone is a slap in the face to all employees.,edit: they announced a $1.5 billion dividend payout 6 days ago.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> ridiculous lack of foresight from upper-levels imo.,upper management is probably afraid of pissing off investors.,it's gonna take a while to get the company running on all cylinders again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"believe me, the pay is nowhere close to enough given how many hours you might end up working as a process engineer.","after spending 50% of your day in meetings and the other 50% preparing to report out in meetings, plus constant firefighting of issues and getting stuck with 24/7 on call every few weeks and being unlucky enough to be in a level 2 or even level 1 task force (weekend meetings), you definitely rack up 50+ hours a week and it can become 60+ in some weeks.",and i know people doing this all on a grade 5 or 6 salary while being gaslit by their managers that they should be grateful that they're getting all these useful learning opportunities.,like the only thing you learn is that this is a toxic industry that wouldn't survive without companies using the h1b to chain people to their jobs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you think cutting pay is better than layoffs?,"i think pay cuts might be better than mass layoffs (with the biggest cuts coming to the ceo/evp's) but have to be justified,and with intel still paying the dividend i don't think its justified.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
any existing employee that falls in those categories are going to get a pay cut starting march 1st.,"the new hires... i doubt they'll see the same treatment,  but who knows.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"theyâ€™re doing paycuts to virtue signal to investors that they are serious about their stock price and cutting back in the face of economic headwinds, without laying off 10% of their workforce.","on the face of this, this looks like a much worse story then google and microsoft and meta cutting headcount, but if you really think about it, intel is actually being more pragmatic and trying to save more peopleâ€™s overall livelihoods then any of these other companies doing layoffs.","ultimately this is still about intel making the most money it possibly can for shareholders, but its just doing it differently then a blanket 7-10% employee layoff across the company.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"lol what do people have to gain by lying about this , such weird behavior by people that think there is some grand conspiracy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the apb formula and basis aren't changing.,grants will still happen with the delayed rewards cycle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>you won't get rsus either.,"they didn't explicitly say it, but they said there's no annual rewards; rewards is when you get your performance rating and rsu grants.",i think that's kinda what they want you leave on your own no severance....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

three months ago we were getting all we could eat free food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"definitely regret at least not entertaining the severance package during ""volunteer layoffs"".",could have taken that and went to work somewhere else and that would have been better than a year of no raise and no bonuses.,as an hourly employee this is probably a  close to 7k loss.,although... if the company was going to continue to be in the shitter our bonuses would have been shit anyways,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think this makes a lot of sense on the intel side.,in past downturns intel offered people voluntary separation or early retirement.,this helped intel reduce headcount and money for pay.,but it was always bad publicity.,now intel just cuts off bonus and other spending programs and cuts higher up pay.,now if people want to leave they will in theory quit.,now intel saves that money from them quiting.,they don't have to pay out that sum of money that people got with early retirement or separation.,plus if the quit and not get terminated.,intel doesn't have to pay out the unemployment money either,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
broadcom is hiring.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they did not anticipate the slump during the time of massive investments (double whammy for them - increased interest payments on loans and depreciation) and recruitment years ago.,it was a gamble.,"if the market continued upwards, their profits will be enormous.",unfortunately it went south and now they are burdened with increased fixed cost while the revenue continues downhill.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think there will still be series of lay-offs in companies specially those that deal with technology specially in the micro-chip related businesses.,the ones that could possibly remain steady are those that deal with food and agricultural products - basic consumption requirement for people.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it really depends on specialization.,senior graphics/gamdev people are not having a hard time right now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
unbelievable they cut 401k match but no cuts to the dividend.,401k should be the last thing that gets cut.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

disagree.,most analysts believed the covid upgrade cycle was specifically businesses upgrading earlier to provide for work from home.,intel was the only company expecting that to become the new normal at 350m units a year.,amd forecasted \~300m at the time.,"then intel lowered to 300-325 while the rest of the industry was at 270-295. last year came in at 270.

that's exactly my point.,at intel's last conference the presenter told a story about his daughter wanting 2 laptops to justify the 300m numbers instead of data.,assuming other consumers will approach this way which sounds unreasonable.,"intel's official number is 270-295m units, and optimistic of 300m from pat's own words on the call in q&a.",amd's official number currently is 10% below last year.,"last year was 250-270m units, so roughly 225-250m units (depending on if you use idc or other).","december's sell-through was equivalent to a 200m unit year, which could be gigantic miss if purchases don't pick up.","and i agree, that people and businesses who upgraded earlier during covid because of work-from-home and other factors of lockdowns won't be purchasing again anytime soon, so being optimistic of a return to 300m units is naive if you ask me.","there aren't even many/any programs that need extra horsepower these days unless your doing rendering or other heavy workloads, and those aren't the majority of notebook purchases.","so i think intel is going to over-estimate again with their 270-295, and 300 is just outrageous.","q1 may suggest otherwise but consensus is roughly 250m units this year currently, 270 best case.","at this point, q1 is trending roughly equal to q4, and q2 not much better.",but there is hope of a big resurgence in 2h which i don't see happening.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"eh, the problem is they don't give technicians enough responsibility or ownership.",my module is split between development and ramp and the development side of things has the most work and unfortunately the overwhelming majority of tasks are engineer owned because they are creating the experiments for us to run.,now let's think about the hours engineers work.,8-5 with on call after 5. typically most of the work orders are wrapped up before 10pm because they stop putting them in when they go home and the night shift is only there to make sure the place doesn't burn down.,the other problem is at least in the 4 years ive worked there ive noticed that intel hasn't really fostered an environment that encourages going above and beyond to learn and excel in your technician role.,when one of your most knowledgeable technicians who's also on the safety committee and covering for the shift group leader when they are off is still making less than people that get hired on now... it's demoralizing.,why would or should that technician care about the efficiency of an organization that doesn't care about their efforts?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm in operations so there's always something for us to look at, but a tech on the pm side just flat out might not be assigned to something for the day.","if there's no tools that need work, then they likely are just going to sit in cafe or in your case... sit at home and wait for them to trigger a pm.",again... night shift is interesting because if engineers aren't actively triggering things on night shift then all they have to do is continue working on a pm day shift didn't finish or just stay on standby.,i haven't worked nights long enough to fully understand how it all looks yet though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not saying that they shouldnt fix it.",thats probably their thought process.,they can chalk it up as its not opening because its not supported.,unless more people with supported platforms speak up about an issue like this they arent going to do anything about it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
time for upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not true many 8th gen z370 and up boards have bios updates for resizeable bar.,i have an asrock z370 taichi with rebar enabled and the a770 runs fine along with arc control.,only glitch on 10th gen or below is you have to leave the igpu disabled or wonky things happen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"seeing as there is at least a 15 cm air gap between the cooler and the cpu's heatsink, i would say that is pretty bad contact.",air is a great insulator by the way.,"anyhow, that being said.",its fine as long as the pressure is even.,the ihs does not seem to be totally even (its a bit curved) but there is most contact in the center where the die is.,you will see in temps if you have a problem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you need flattener.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what cooler are you using?,does it have an lga 1700 bracket?,pressure looks mostly in the centre?,if it works it works.,temperature tests ok?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seems ok..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the ihs cold plate flatness from cpu to cpu seems to vary widely.,"for my last two builds i have lapped my ihs, i have been buying cheap broken motherboards from ebay and then i [cut out the cpu socket](https://imgur.com/a/vqkwzcx) with a dremel and use it as a lapping tool to lap the ihs in its clamped condition.",i have been getting really good results doing this.,"so far i've made lapping tools for lga 1200 and lga 1700.  i will give the lga 1200 version away to anyone who wants it, dm me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it looks okay, but i suggest buying a contact frame regardless.","you get better performance but more importantly, your cpu wont warp over time.",the thermalright frame is only $5-$10 and  i have used it on 3 builds with noticeable drops in temps with even contact.,"your contact area may be good now, but months down the line it will lean to one side and slowly and progressively get worse.",cheers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pretty typical for lga1700,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we can't really tell either as its a really bad photo and the cpu is out of focus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's ok-ish, nothing too fancy, but entire middle lane has a good pressure, i'd say 6c drop would be the most you may expect with a contact frame.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you want it to be touching the cpu heatplate or else it's not going to work man.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"bad, install frame",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
decent contact.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you need a thermal paste applicator,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bad.,you're about 15cm away from the cpu at this point,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's bad, needs to be touching the cpu and then screwed in place for it to be effective.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's good enough, but you can tell the cpu is flexing/bending a bit where it is held down by the bracket.",hence the hour glass look of paste.,a contact frame helps with the bending a bit and temps but once it flexes it seems to stay that way.,it's a flaw of intel cpu's being more rectangle  now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you definitely put too much paste on it bro.,lol.,"the point of using thermal paste is not to cover the entire cpu really, itâ€™s to fill in micro scratches that exist between the cpu plate and the heat sink plate.",you do want thorough coverage across the top of the cpu but you want it to be very thin.,i highly recommend you use a cpu contact frame.,it will get you a much better connection to the cpu which will give you lower temps and they only cost like $10.,i recommend the thermal grizzly contact frame.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's definitely bad, would recommend wiping it all off and applying the thermal paste directly on the cpu, and spreading it so it's completely covered.",i never liked using the thermal paste that came with aio's,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's bad ðÿ˜¬ i would recommend you a contac frame, but after being so bended already idk if it can make a difference

are you running unlimited power?,or power limiting to intel spec?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s good to hear.,iâ€™ve been watching it while gaming and you are right it dosent go above 60.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh ok. i need a actual wired keyboard to get into bios right?,this is my first pc after being a mac user so im trying to get everything down pack and make sure itâ€™s running right.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"you donâ€™t need a wired keyboard to get into bios, you can tell your computer to go to bios inside of windows and then reboot but you power states to usb devices should be on be default meaning any bluetooth keyboard should be active upon boot so you can access bios",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no the one ilm replacement.,lga1700 has a horrible ilm that bends the cpu and prevents proper contact with your cooler.,i bought the basic/cheap thermalright version.,https://youtu.be/ysb25vsnbqi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you should try unmounting the cooler and see how the thermal paste spreads.,usual telltale sign that the heatsink isn't sitting well due to this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh didnâ€™t know that.,thanks!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
awesome.,thank you.,i,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so both in dx11 and dx12 modes?,"you could try setting the game to dx11 and dropping in dxvk, and see if that works.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks, i updated the original post with solution",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
considering the recent price stratagy of intel they should have very good pricing.,"if not, i dont see them selling at all.",threadripper has such a vast variaty of platform options.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what's the cheapest xeon a normal consumer can buy?,we used to have the popular 1231v3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looking forward to these cpus and what they can do.,they carry the xeon name so not expecting them to be cheap.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its been 6 years but i'm hoping we may finally get a 7820x successor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i wouldn't say vast, in the wrx80 lineup for threadripper 5000 theres like 5 boards total?",and considering the enormous price hike of threadripper 5000 vs 3000 it's a hard pill to swallow.,"intel does need to nail pricing on this, and if they do it can get them inroads back into this high end part of the market.","but hell, if they mess it up and no one buys it i'll buy one when it's all discounted anyway so its a win.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it will be priced higher than threadripper, as it has been in the past.",but generally each core tends to be more powerful than its amd equivalents,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's not like there needs to be much variation in boards for threadripper pro - there's so much pcie and memory expansion that boards can just have 7x 16-lane pcie slots (like the almost identical epyc platform) and you just add whatever hardware need if it doesn't come with it already.,"that's very hard to achieve with mainstream platforms when you have a measly 20 (intel) or 24 (amd) pcie lanes from the cpu and 8 from the chipset, and on intel bifurcation support is terrible - which is why they have to carve-up the pcie lanes in weird and wonderful ways, share bandwidth over the dmi/chipset connection with usb/sata/nvme/ethernet, have strategic spacing between slots to take account of gpu sizing, put m.2 sockets on non-standard riser brackets, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
leaks have shown both 4 and 8 channel parts.,"the 8 channel one is the tr pro competitor, while the 4 channel looks more interesting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"some people upgrade fast, it has been out for a few months now",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have been contemplating getting the a770 for my 1440p rig.,can you share your experience with the a750?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why wouldnâ€™t it be a good buy?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"then it'll never work, it's upside down mate.",:),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ltt and his associate switched to an intel gpu for a video.,you should check that out if you haven't already.,"the cards look a little buggy with the drivers which need a lot more work, but eventually it might work out to be a good priced gpu for its performance",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6650xt is cheaper/around that price.,"if you really wanna go intel, arc 750 is like 5-10% slower, but costs 50 dollar less",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"again, i know you might be swayed by the downvotes, but please check gamers nexus's recent review and check others, where the 770 and 750 was neck and neck.",so buy 750 if you must go intel.,"however, 6650xt was generally better.","6650xt is 250 now, there's even a 6700 for 320.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have seen the whole series.,i felt that his findings while interesting were a little incoherent as he mostly focused on his personal use cases ( i see that was the point of the series).,i was just asking if a casual or semi casual users perspective,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"gotcha, hopefully it works out for you by the time you decide.",it seems fine just driver issues for now plaguing it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you need to detail a whole heck of a lot more about your computer!,what is it?,prebuilt?,diy?,what are the other specs?,motherboard?,after that you should also probably post a full sensor screen from hwinfo64 while running a benchmark.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"msi z170-a pro motherboard, gtx 1080, 1x16gb 2400 cl14 ram.",i gave our local pc store a budget at the time( 7 years ago) and they built it.,it has been running pretty good for long but a few months ago when trying to charge a disposable vape via my usb port i believe i short-circuited or something and my pc broke as in it wouldnt turn on.,"took it to a local pc repairman and he changed a chip on my motherboard, it was fine for some time but i started to notice performance issues after a while.",idk if they have something to do with each other.,after changing the psu a few days ago it got waay better but was still underperforming.,changing the gpu thermal paste and oc'ing the cpu also helped a bit but still underperforming compared to my friends pc's which have around the same cpu and gpu's.,"when playing the same game i get %100 cpu usage and huge fps drops ,he doesnt when he didnt even overclock.",also as i said my single threading score is fine but my multithreading score is really bad and i get worse minimum speed on multithreading even compared to the lowest category.,"single - https://imgur.com/a/jgrxkb9 --- multi [https://imgur.com/a/ldw490y](https://imgur.com/a/ldw490y)

i will post the hwinfo64 while running a benchmark in the morning really sleepy haha",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're running a single stick of ram.,that will make for a decent difference in performance if your friend has 2 sticks running in dual-channel mode.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
one stick of slow ram certainly isn't helping,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you have 4 cpu cores and an mt score that is 4 times your st score.,that looks correct to me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i am certainly gonna upgrade it in a few days.,going from 1x16 2400 cl14 to 2x?,3600 cl14.,not sure on whether i need 2x8 or 2x16 as i might need more ram in a few years when i buy a new cpu+gpu.,i just dont wanna spend money for a new cpu+motherboard this year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are right but what about the minimum speeds on multithreads being waaaaayyy lower compared to other people with the same cpu?,what could cause that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would just grab 2x8.,"https://benzhaomin.github.io/bdiefinder/

this should be useful to find good kits",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it could be throttling, but since performance was normal, it is probably nothing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how are you checking for the minimum clock speeds?,cpus will generally downclock when the workload goes down.,are you watching the clock speeds directly during your benchmarking?,"the 900 mhz sounds like an idle clock, so maybe it's occurring before or after the benchmark is run.","also, are all 8 threads working?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean the avg performance is good but as you said it is probably throttling causing fps drops and stuttering.,what could cause throttling other than temperature?,i have never seen my cpu go above 70 degrees which seems weird considering it can probably take a lot more heat.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am checking the minimum speeds via hwinfo and occt(which is what i used for the benchmark).,"im sure that was not idle clock minimum as i made sure to open the hwinfo after starting the benchmark, also occt records the clock speeds only during the benchmark.",what do you mean by all 8 threads working?,i have been trying to learn more but i am still new to these stuff :d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sorry, i meant whether you have hyperthreading enabled.",the 6700k has 4 cores but 8 threads.,"therefore, i wouldn't expect 'only' a 4x multiplier between st and mt scores, more so around 6x.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think arc is a major shift in pc gaming because while nvidia and amd compete for the high end, most people won't even need high end graphics anymore - they just want something affordable that can play most games well.",i'd think arc will be the go to for competitive gaming budget builds from here on in.,why do we need 20% more fps for $2000 when in a year or two it will be replaced by something that costs 1/3rd the price?,is what the other manufacturers need to ask.,"back when cryptomining was a thing, it was well worth the price because you get your money back.",but now?,"even if i can afford these flagship cards, why would i even buy them?",arc is definitely a welcome sight at a time where we see illogical price gouging.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think it's strange that they've cut the price of the a750 before releasing the a580.,"it's strange that we haven't heard anything about it in so long, too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would buy it if i didn t have a pure g sync monitor.,g sync/ freesync is just too good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think it is unlikely that intel can catch up with nvidia , barring some massive market innovation.",but what they can do is offer fully capable gpus at great prices.,"in a world where the hardware communities are eternally outraged at the 3000 and 4000 series prices, and the mid-range pricing reaching $800......... an a750 for $249 is the exact product that everyone claims they wanted.","there's no reason for a single 1 of these to be left on the shelf, otherwise people be cappin'.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"taking what they have and putting it on the market, even if a larger node and not as advanced as higher end gpus, was smart for intel.","it was more an example of if they could, and they did.",now it's on to making something substantially better for them.,these gpus were more a trial and to test reception.,price point for them is solid for what they do for a first iteration.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
axg got canned right?,"so we can pretty much expect the driver development to carry on, but battlemage and celestial launches are going to be small at best?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">most people won't even need high end graphics anymore

this is not a new thing.",the market has always been like this.,most game developers target mid range cards because that is where the most people are.,then they try to add a little extra icing on the cake to push the boundaries a little.,"the people who buy the flagship cards do it so they can a: brag about it, b: make the money back in some way, or c: have some longevity before needing to replace it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
crypto mining will be back again.,it always comes back.,but iâ€™m tempted to buy an arc now just because itâ€™s fun to test new major driver improvements,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"agreed, no one is competing at the low end like intel right now.",to be clear they are also in stock everywhere lately and intel has come under pressure from regulators because its hurting the market where amd can't make as many units and take the risk.,there's also new chinese and russian chip makers coming to the market and intel has to succeed both financially and politically.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think you can easily get a gpu from amd/nvidia for the same price range you're talking about that can also run most games if not better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's really not how anything works.,"you make an efficient architecture and generally because of the basic design of a gpu, you can scale it up or down.","if hte high end is way more efficient, so is the low end.","arc isn't magic because it's mid range, it's a large core for not much performance being sold likely under manufacturing costs because performance/mm^2 or performance/watt aren't great.","a more efficient architecture is better in a high end, midrange or low end card.",arc isn't a shift in anything at all.,"it's just a mid range card being sold at a lower end price because it's inefficient, nothing more or less.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> while nvidia and amd compete for the high end, most people won't even need high end graphics anymore - they just want something affordable that can play most games well.",i doubt the statement of high-end becuase we have yet to see what intel will do with battlemage enthusiast category on pricing.,maybe intel can sell a topline enthusiast battlemage gpu with a theoretical 5090ti or 6090ti performance in mind for $500.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they would need money dearly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think the 750 at $249 is essentially what weâ€™re going to get instead of the 580.  

maybe theyâ€™ll do a 500 series with the â€˜alchemist refreshâ€™ later this year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a770 supports freesync though.,what monitor is that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is some inflation going on in the gpu perception.,one might think that a card comparable to 3060ti in performance is way behind.,but if you look e.g.,"at steam hardware stats, the most popular gpu is not 3080 or anything close, but gtx 1650, followed by gtx 1060, then rtx 2060. and a770 is faster than all of those (i think a750 too).","so they don't have to catch up that much, they are already quite powerful, they're just not at the top of the performance hill.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as new build with a 4080 i agree on one of these.,potential longevity for the next 5 years want to max out 1440 uw at ultra settings and get butter smooth fps.,why?,i've spent over a decade on laptops and always compromising image quality to get something just playable.,no more!,from here on in i can move at dizzying frame rates without stutter!!!,i also see a trend towards better graphics in most aaa titles and higher requirements to push it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it makes building a pc fun when its affordable.,you can spend more money on an aesthetic rather performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"theyâ€™re trying to make money, not lose it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"plus, if developers want to capture the mass audience demographic is to conform with the most popular gpu's.",intel can shift the goalpost if they provide low end budget gpus that most people can be priced in.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
those are laptop gpus.,that's why they're so popular in steam survey,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes they do.,the reason the 1650 has bigger numbers is because of time on market.,low end sells more than the midrange which sells more than the high end.,"that's always been true, but for intel to make profit and continue gpu sales they need a competitive architecture.","selling 400mm^2 chips at the same price that are a similar size on a much older and much cheaper node on a 2 year old architecture and being beaten, is bad.",anyone can take a bigger core and sell it under price to be competitive but you can't maintain sales and make a profit doing that.,intel needs to catch up to being able to make similar sized cores to amd/intel that perform in the same ballpark or it will always be under pricing larger chips to compete which is fundamentally unsustainable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>i also see a trend towards better graphics in most aaa titles and higher requirements to push it.,yep.,i don't see that trend stopping anytime soon.,"if we didn't have a trend toward better graphics we'd all still be playing games that looked like quake, and duke nukem 3d.","until it becomes indistinguishable from real life, we'll probably continue to see attempts to make better graphics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
haha!,who says we aren't?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so both in dx11 and dx12 modes?,"you could try setting the game to dx11 and dropping in dxvk, and see if that works.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks, i updated the original post with solution",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
turn your voltage down.,its too high at 1.4v and stop using corsair icue to monitor your pc.,"turn off mce
download hwinfo64.",itâ€™s more accurate.,"cap your ldpl and sdpw to 256.
problem solved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
quite high,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"don't use static voltage on your cpu, turn off mce, also 1.46v is crazy!",different cpu but seriously my 13700k runs at 1.28v at full clocks or 1.18v with vdroop at 100% full load.,and drops down to 0.7v when idle and about 28-30c at idle.,"all the 13th gen have pretty similar voltage profiles, so that seems very high if your not aggressively overclocking.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"holy crap, you got problems dude.",that's waaaay too high at idle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the gpu and cpu temp seem high for idle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no itâ€™s way too high, especially with your liquid temp at 30",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"even for a 1.46v idle the temps for your cpu is way too high please check your cooler setup again see if the thermal paste has been applied correctly, or if the contact is good, or if you somehow forgot to remove the plastic on the cooler or something.",also check the airflow in the case and see if the fans orientations are correct.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if your cpu is using 1.46v then it is not idling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the gpu is perfectly fine, not sure what you mean.",the cpu got issued though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i found the problem, ai studio 3 overwritten my bios",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s literally the only time you should be over 1.42v,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
â€œup toâ€ refers to officially validated speeds.,"and the â€œup toâ€ part is because the officially validated speeds differ depending on the exact memory configuration (motherboard style, number of modules, and types of modules), and of course, it will work fine with slower memory too.","for ddr5 on 12th gen, the official maximum validated range is 3600-4800mhz (which ranges from 4 dual ranked modules at the slow end, to 2 modules on a 2-dimm motherboard at the fast end).","you can use faster and get better performance, but itâ€™s considered overclocking and is not guaranteed.",k-series cpus will often be able to run faster memory than non-k due to unlocked imc voltage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it means ""this cpu can natively support (i.e.","without overclocking) memory speeds under and including, ddr5@4800 and ddr4@3200"".","this is exactly the same as boost clocks - ""up to xghz"".","you can still overclock it higher, it will be faster, it just wonâ€™t be stock.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the rated speeds are jedec standard profiles, and it looks like if there's no faster jedec profiles the 'up to' rating won't go higher.",and 'up to' is probably from systems running dual rank (and/or 2 sticks per channel) being more stressful on the memory controller.,i.e.,they don't guarantee 4800 on something like four 32gb ddr5 sticks running together.,"edit: motherboards could affect ram limits too, although i don't think it is listed in the cpu specs, as these are generally higher than what intel rates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol that â€œup toâ€ is really the bare minimum you would even run.,"i would just ignore the jdec, those timings are very easy to get working with xmp on almost any recent intel chip.",and yes more performance for sure with faster ram.,in productivity apps the gains can be large.,in gaming more like 10 percent improvement max.,example: my 13900ks says up to 5600 and i turned on xmp and itâ€™s stable at 8000 with no tuning.,for a 12700k you could aim for 6600 working.,anymore than will be quite difficult without a 2 dimm board.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for all the replies!,"i also have another piece of information, maybe relevant.","according to the specs, 12700k has a maximum memory bandwidth of 76.8 gb/s.",when i use aida64 to measure the read/write memory speed i currently get about 47 gb/s.,that means there is room for improvement ie.,faster than 3200mhz ram will increase the available bandwidth.,"unfortunately, being on ddr4, there's little point in upgrading, given you can barely find fast ddr4 nowdays (end of life).","also, the fastest ddr4 with decent latency would be at 4800 mhz so not a huge improvement in bandwidth.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nothing socket wise has changed between z690 and z790.,it's not necessary in either case.,unless you want it.,"it's cheap, and it gives better contact to coolers and allows your cooling to do a more effective job.","if you have the mechanical skills required to use it, i'd use it anyway.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if you are using z series motherboard and you can just offset -0.03 to - 0.05,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
anything 100c and below for a 13900k is within spec.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
check your ambient temperature before running stress test.,there is no point stress test in hot room.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"check your thermal paste, that ended up being my issue when i was get 90-100c temp while gaming.",also setting the voltage offset to -0.09 dropped my temperature to 75-85c before re pasting thermal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for msi z790 boards, go into the overclocking section of your bios, click on advanced cpu configuration, and then look for lite load.","change it from auto or whatever it's on, to a lower numeric value.","my bios lite load was set to auto, but it was using lite load 12, i lowered my numbers all the way down to lite load 1 and stayed there.","also though, i dropped cpu voltage -0.065. instead of getting high 80c under workloads, i now stay in the low 60's",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah i prolly coulda said that in post, using msi z790 mobo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"jeezðÿ¤£, i just seen something about how the 14th gen is suppose to help with that whenever it does end up releasing.",hope it does lmao,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is no point stress test in hot room.,shouldn't a stress test be done in whatever temperature the pc will actually be used under?,"if it is usually a warm room, there would be no point in making it temporarily cooler just for the sake of testing.. no?","of course, if op decides to make the room permanently cooler than now, then that's always better for the cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"in gaming, the 9700k and 9900k, at the same clocks, will perform identically.",there are close to zero games that benefit from the extra threads on the 9900k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for all the advice!,tbh this was my first reddit post and i was pretty shocked to see all the responses.,"i like the idea of just getting a 14th gen chip in a year's time, probably the 14700k and just living with some games underutilizing the 4080 for the next year.",which btw i'm still getting 70 to 80 fps in cyberpunk but i just saw some benchmark videos with a 4080 doing 120fps sometimes with a 13900k so i just figured i'd get some ideas about what to do.,thanks again everybody!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"definitly go to the 13600k it will perfect for the 4080, or wait for 14th gen of intel.",but the 13600k is a beast right now for the price.,"i have the 9900k paired with a 2080 super and is already bottleneck the gpu in some intensive cpu games, so when i have money i will go to the 13600k too or maybe wait for the 14th gen, i dont know ðÿ˜…",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the cpu race is definitely heating up now with both of them beating each others flagship gaming cpus.,honestly it depends on your use case but waiting for the ryzen 3d gen cpus to come out might push prices lower on intels side.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9x series is already 4 years old.,why would you even consider waiting another 4 years to change it?,8 years cpu?,your current cpu cannot utilize 4080.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it would help.,minimally.,i wouldn't go 9900k unless you got a great price on it.,you can get an h 610 and an i5 12400f for about $240 which is what the 9900k is by itself.,"also, 9900k is still stuck on pcie 3.0. you really want pcie 4 or better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
get a 9900k for cheap if you can.,people are hyped over 13600k around here but i've seen a lot of people with 9900k and 4080 and its doing fine.,"the issue with 9700k is the lack of ht, if you can find a cheap 9900k i would recomend to get it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"thanks, very helpful.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what?,30-40fps in crowded areas?,"lol, your 9900k wasn't optimized properly.","getting 60-70 at least in the worst areas with high crowd density, 70-80fps in most normal crowded areas, all with rt and 4000cl15 memory",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
like i said the 4080 is still the bottleneck in most games.,"it's maxed out in cod, the witcher 3, flight sim and every other game i've played except cyberpunk, which is the only game cpu bound.",but you're right 8 years does sound like a lot.,maybe i'll go for a 14th gen in a year's time.,thanks for the advice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no op, but i went from a 2600k to a 9900k so you know...

using a cpu that long is not unheard of.,i used my 2500k for 7 years.,wasnt really a problem.,finally upgraded it in 2018 to a 7700k.,upgraded that in late 2021 because it died.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wrong.,"9700k will handle 4080 perfectly fine at 4k, no word about 9900k.",memory is also very important.,"these are still one of the best gaming cpus, performance around zen3, nothing wrong with keeping it for long.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was definitely leaning towards waiting but just curious if anyone had an iron clad reason i should get the 9900k.,very happy with game performance even in cyberpunk.,"didn't even think about the pcie generation difference, that's a good point.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

even dropped frames mean the counter went to that fps range which is not the way it's supposed to perform.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

oh absolutely.,"i moved my gaming pc from my desk to my movie room so  a 75"" tv just looks better at 4k and supports vrr.",my desk still has a 1440p144hz panel so i know where you're coming from.,i do still run 4k120 as the refresh-rate but don't mind 60-70fps.,"with halo infinate i drop it to 1440p120 to get a consistant 120.

"it's worth trying out how it feels, you can always turn it back off it it doesn't feel better.","it doesn't make a difference if your fps is higher than the monitor refresh rate but should help with tearing just like v-sync or g-sync, but for me it does smooth out transitions in fps when some games run nicely at 120fps but might dip to 60-70fps in demanding scenes.",i use vrr because the sony tv i use doesn't support g-sync properly but does support vrr.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have an asus motherboard, so it might be slightly different for you but all i did was disable asus' own automatic ai overclocking and set the core voltage offset to -0.06v.","with an air cooler and a mid tower case, it gets to 65c when running cinebench r23 (and even lower while gaming).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the l9i really struggles to cool more than 50w.,"undervolting is only part of the problem, sff builds inherently build up heat inside the case which means higher ambient temps during gaming.","it sounds like you need to probably put a tdp limit on your cpu, maybe to 65w.","combine that with an undervolt, and maybe try to the thermalright contact frame as well.","another option is getting a better cooler, the l12 ghost s1 edition (66mm tall) would fit your case and should give you some more headroom.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you very much!!!,gonna look at the l12 now.,"undervolting did not work, youâ€™re correct.",how do i set the tdp limit?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would look to put 65w in both the pl1 and pl2 settings in the bios for cpu power management.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you.,i downloaded intel extreme tuner and did a -0.080v and restarted the pc.,i also turned the performance core ratio down to 44x.,itâ€™s changed my gaming cpu temps from 92 to 69-72 which i think is way better.,what do you think?,is that still too hot?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
false alarm.,system keeps crashing.,looking for pl1 and pl2 now.,i donâ€™t see them in oc in the bios.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just use turbo.,it will go to 4.5 on all threads.,"with a good air cooler, you won't go over 75 degrees c.

still a decent cpu ...  i run one with a rtx 3080 ti.",attempting anything higher won't achieve anything worthwhile.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
use hwinfo and not hardware monitor.,and also check your mount of your cpu cooler.,unless you have no power limits you should be able to keep the temps down a little better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
please give more context?,what is running in the background?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"https://www.hwinfo.com/download/

not out of the ordinary at 300w.",you can mitigate it by lowering load line drive strength or undervolting slightly.,they're hot chips at full tilt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the cpu is running at 300w, so you need some good cooling.",what cooler do you have?,"also use hwinfo64 instead, more reliable and no trail.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
try running it at intel spec?,you are at 300w and we couldnt tell how much throttling is happening without its current clock speed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
slight undervolt and see how it drops a few degrees,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i was getting 90-100c at 150w gaming on my 13900k but it ended up being my thermal paste on the cpu, now i get 65-77c.","also setting the voltage offset to -0.09 also helped when it was hitting 100c, dropped it to 75-85c",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"set lite load to 3 and give it an additional undervolt until it's unstable (check for whea in hwinfo)
i have my 13700k on lite load 3 and an undervolt of - 0.050 and i've disabled mce or turbo enhanced on msi and i've increased the turbo boost for pcores and e cores by 2 and it's stable and cool.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
had the same running icue on my 12900. but in gaming i never reach 100. so iâ€™d say all good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as we continue to say, do not use hwmon if you want accurate readings.",use hwinfo64.,it is far more accurate and provides more information than hwmon.,"also, win-key+shift+s is your friend.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nothing only cinebech and hwmonitor is the onlythings running,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have the corsair h150i elite 360mm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i already turn off the mce from asus bios and it get lower temperature,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is that lite load.,im not aware if my asus z790 hero mobo has that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how long of cinebench?,single pass?,multiple passes?,10min?,i have the same cooler.,make sure pump and fans are extreme in icue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what speed do the fans get to?,under load you need to set them quite high for the cooler to do it's job properly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"single and multiple pass and 10 min for each 
i have on balanced on icue software",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its at 2500rpm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pretty normal unless you change things.,i have power unlocked like you and with fans and pump set at extreme i hit 90-92c on a single pass with a max of 335w.,as long as you aren't seeing temps like this gaming enjoy unlocked power and know you could always limit power if you're worried about temps.,could try undervolting too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i turn off the mce on bios and the temp get lower to 93 degrees maybe i can try with mce on and raise the fan speed on icue software to extreme and try like that and see what happen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sounds worth trying.,if you limit power limits to 253w you can get fairly similar cinebench scores and not have to worry about temps as much also.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
where i can do the undervolting im new on pc that why jajaj,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can undervolt in the bios.,you can download intel xtu and do it there also.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i will try and how it work on gaming with mce off and see how that work,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"download cpu-z and do stress test does all cores go 100%, if yes then it's game problem.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no mods?,100% vanilla?,did you also check the temps or probably other softwares to make sure the report isn't wrong?,the game is actually supposed to fully utilize up to 8 threads,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ok my 11700k with a 3060 i don't see cyberpunk using much more than a single core, presumably bottlenecked by the 3060 though.",is the game performance actually bad?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

any fixes?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

and i dont think 3070 is a bottleneck for 10400f.,gpu usage around 80% average with rt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same with 5800x.,nothing seems to work :(.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
get cinebench instead,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what about the temperatures?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"looking in task manager, all cores seemed utilised",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"okay, in cinebench r23 100% usage and good score",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
temps around 60-65,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hmm will still try with some other monitoring software.,"tried afterburner, open hardware monitor and hwmonitor.",all report the same thing.,"1st thought was, that maybe its just reporting wrong numbers on a hardware level but then if i do a stress test, it accurately does report the 100% load.","also, checking my core clocks also indicate that theyre not being stressed.","if i was near 100% util, then my clocks would be about 150-200 mhz lower as thats what happens with sustained all core load but the clocks are quite high as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then if the game runs fine you have zero issues,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i tried a few other games and was seeing just the one or two cores utilised.,let me know how you get on,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have drops to 50fps on optimized settings without rt.,i think thats not a good performance for this pc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
might have figured it out.,you need the afterburner 4.6.5 beta 2. that seems to report much more sensible numbers.,apparently windows 22h2 update changed something in the reporting system and thats the culprit.,some people also claiming that cpu util also went down and that cpu perf is actually worse in gaming but do not know about that myself.,still only getting like 45% utilization but that still makes at least some sense.,would not mind more util tho.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is not a good performance for cyberpunk.,is a heavy game to run even with  mid range hardware.,"i'm running it at 58 fps 1440p rtx on and dlss performance with  a 10700k stock, 3060ti.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
figured it'd be something like that.,nice find.,is your gpu usage 100?,if you're gpu bound you won't get more cpu utilisation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yep, reinstall do nothing for me, the same results, maybe i must format my computer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nope.,"it hovers around 92-96 in ""normal"" areas so then its ofcourse gpu bound.",but in the market behind toms diner for example the gpu usage can go down to as low as 65 though its around 70-80 normally.,it seems like my cpu usage just doesnt really change much.,unless im completely in a lonely corner somewhere.,might go down to 30% but everywhere else its always pretty much 40-45 and never goes above that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i noticed my similar issue because i'm forever on a quest to sustain 60fps in that damn game.if i sprint around the markets on anything other than the lowest settings, it still drops below 60fps on a 5600x and 3080",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"xmg here, thanks for linking to our announcement thread in op.",a few points for clarification and a timeline.,"**ancient past**

* voltage offset used to be unlocked on h-series cpus for ages
* after plundervolt (2019), intel [sent out guidance](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00289.html) to oems that they hide voltage offset from bios because safety first.",some oems followed suite.,"**2020**

* on clarification, intel confirmed to us in 2020 that we are still free to offer voltage offset if we understand and carry the risks, which we did.",* we published [this article](https://www.igorslab.de/en/undervolting-on-intel-laptops-in-2020-this-is-what-you-need-to-know-xmg-support/) on igor's lab with our official guidance based on intel core 10th gen h-eries (comet lake).,"**2021**

* with intel core 11th gen h-series (tiger lake), we introduced a fallback mechanism where the ec firmware can automatically reset all bios tuning options if the system fails to boot (post) multiple times due to inappropriate voltage offset or memory tuning values.",this fallback mechanism could also be triggered via hotkey (ctrl+b during cold boot).,this made undervolting via bios setup 100% safe and convenient for our users.,"please note, runtime undervolting (via xtu or throttlestop) is cumbersom on laptops because the laptop oem performance profiles (required for fan control and battery life) often overwrite such runtime tunings.","undervolting in bios setup is a more convenient, permanent ""fire & forget"" solution once you found your voltage offset sweet spot.","**2022**

* with 12th gen, intel moved all ""h-series"" (marketing name) to the ""alder lake p"" platform (technology platform), where voltage offset msr inbox was fused off, just like it was in previous u- and p-series cpus (e.g.","i7-1165g7, i7-11370h).","exception: i9-12900hk still allowed the msr inbox, despite being otherwise the same silicon as i7-12700h or i9-12900h.","* we have started to roll-out bios update to some of our 12th gen h-series to unlock ""ac loadline"" as a less powerful alternative to undervolting.","* in the same year (2022), intel introduced 12th gen hx-series, based on desktop chips.","codename: alder lake sbga (""s"" stands for desktop).",voltage offset was unlocked.,"**2023**

* when we learned of [hp's announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/hpomen/comments/yejp66/qa_for_vbs_and_impact_to/) about blocking runtime voltage offset, we contacted intel as a precaution.","this was still relatively low-key for us, because we felt safe in having voltage offset in bios setup (i.e.",not at runtime).,"* in 2023, 13th gen (raptor lake) continues the hx line-up, and voltage offset was still unlocked.","however, suddenly our odm partner advised us as follows:
   * the uncoming bios version will remove the â€œvoltage offsetâ€ option, because ""voltage offset"" values will affect bios update procedures when using ami's bios update tool (afuefi64, afuwin64).","it will cause a sudden ""power off"" crash.","* we tried -30mv, we tried -50mv, use afuefi64, afuefi64cap, afuwin64cap, all will have problems.","this is very dangerous, if ""power off"" crash occurs during a bios update process.",* we have announced that we will not be able to offer voltage offset in our raptor lake hx flagship models and that we are still pushing our odm partner and ami for a solution.,"* after now reading this write-up by op, we have contacted our intel contacts about this issue with additional urgency.","* we also read [this statement](https://boringtextreviews.com/2023/02/02/intels-lex-hoyos-clarifies-the-situation-with-undervolting/) from intel's lex hoyos, but it does not address the sudden stability issues that our odm partner encountered with the voltage offset options in bios setup on ami, so the issue is still unresolved for us.","**our position towards industry partners:**

* we want to allow undervolting for end-users as long as it provides performance-per-watt benefits.",* we are able to mitigate any risks and educate our customers about how to apply voltage offset without risking system stability (i.e.,"small steps, some testing, fallback mechanisms for system recovery).",* under our corporate nda we seek guidance from intel to educate us about how to offer reasonable tuning options via bios setup in a safe and orderly fashion on both ami and insyde bios.,we are currently uncertain as to how this is going to develop.,"so we are not able to promise to our customers that voltage offset will come back in our intel core 13th gen hx-series flagship  laptops, despite having committed all of our volume to the unlocked intel core i9-13900hx in this generation due to its superior thread count, cache size and ddr5-5600 memory support.",you can find us on [our discord server](https://discord.gg/xzykwqf) for further discussion or for sharing further insights on this issue.,a community member on discord pointed out this thread to us.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
summarize the deep points?,this reads like chatgpt generated word vomit.,muddies the water between laptop chip and desktop chip undervolting.,also lacking significant sample size data for claims that even a minimal uv on desktops would cause instant crashes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i saw posts describing this problem on some z690 msi and asus motherboards ([link 1](https://forum-en.msi.com/index.php?threads/z690-tomahawk-ddr4-cant-undervolt-adaptive-offset-with-any-bios-version.382220/), [link 2](https://forum-en.msi.com/index.php?threads/pro-z690-a-ddr4-wifi-owners-thread.370399/page-15#post-2149558), [link 3](https://rog.asus.com/forum/showthread.php?130428-asus-strix-z690-f-bios-1720-undervolt-protection-is-enabled-preventing-undervolts)), but did not expect that the problem is so deep.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
undervolting is not good actually based on my limited experience.,i have desktop 9900k and 2x 10980xe which i tinker alot.,"when you undervolt, like when you overclock, it requires thorough stress test.","however we all know that most people will go with whatever they are comfortable with like few runs of cinebench, never test avx-2, let alone avx-512 because they are running too hot, etc.",so in a sense we are reducing the stability.,"with all of my cpus, it looks stable with -0.1v for gaming and daily task but with thorough stress test even with small -0.02v offset it will have eventual error running linpack xtreme let alone when you also overclock the cache.",donâ€™t forget that negative offset is affecting stability more on lower speed ratios than the higher ratio let alone max cpu boost.,for example with 1.4v at 5.0 ghz you would have room to offset by -0.1v to 1.3v total.,however with 0.8v at 1.2ghz that -0.1v offset is too much and will leads to instability during idle or transient.,"so i would say if you really need to lower power consumption, do it by lowering the max boost clock or better yet using power limit.",there is reason the vid is programmed at that value.,"sure there is small safety margin for error included but you can find that it is not much, like 0.015v in my experience with all my intel cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the whole undervolting fad is foolish and pointless,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's great!,"probably, gigagyte decided to revert the intel's code to the old version or found a workaround for that.",i wish dell will do that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have added the tldr.,"obviously, i had experienced this problem on my system and know about a few similar cases.","also, this is something confirmed by hp and xmg directly.",you may find links in the post,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there's no h-series desktop cpus.,undervolting is available on hk and hx laptop cpus.,"on h-series laptop cpus it is disabled since 12th gen.

the new intel undervolting protection feature may affect both desktop and mobile platforms if a motherboard vendor decides to block the undervolting or can't make it work with the new intel firmware.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it should be called the undervolt or undervoltage protection, but it might be not working properly and significantly decrease the performance as i described in my post.",you may find more details here: [any way to undervolt on gigabyte boards?,](https://www.reddit.com/r/intel/comments/zcbp5j/any_way_to_undervolt_on_gigabyte_boards/),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"on the new microcode and inside sdk, if you specify a tiny 30mv offset, the cpu will be locked to 400 or 3600 mhz.","the performance, obviously, will be lower.",on the ami sdk the system won't boot at all.,that's why xmg decided to remove the undervolting functionality from their 13th gen devices till this issue is fixed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hp and xmg were talking about laptop undervolting.,desktop undervolting is a different beast.,maybe you could say more about your exact system to narrow down the issue.,youâ€™ve cast your net too wide and confusing vastly different chips by mixing desktop and laptop.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i wrote wrong, i meant k , maybe on basic boards, on msi and gigabyte it's still possible.","while the  overvolt , potentially dangerous, is allowed?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hp is talking about the mobile and desktop devices.,"as for xmg, the mobile hx cpus are exactly the same as regular desktop skus.","internally, they use excactly the same s efi toolkit.","in a broader perspective, the laptop and desktop efi are using the same sdk from intel, insyde, ami, etc.. there are some platform-specific code, but it's tiny.",all other parts the same.,there's no reason to create and support separate sdks for different platforms.,you can even find a recent uefi leak from lenovo (intel + insyde sdk) and check it by yourself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are not correct.,"from a silicon design standpoint, they are absurdly not the same, and the challenges you are seeing with bios corruption while undervolted are precisely the result when you try to make them the same.",it only looks the same to you because you have no clue what youâ€™re talking about lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok and how does that affect what i said?,"you developers tried to make them the same when theyâ€™re different beasts, and now you get to try and fix issues like bios corruption due to undervolting lol.","just because you guys want to make them 1 register, doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s actually the same thing lmao.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hardware unboxed reviewed the i5-13500 with 6400mhz ddr5 ram.,in some games it was much faster than 3466mhz ddr4.,locked vcssa might be a problem with ddr4 ram but it's not that big of a deal with current ddr5 speeds.,you should get at least +5600mhz hynix ram kit.,5200mhz kits are often micron which is crap.,"i bought 32gb 5600mhz cl36 hynix m-die kit for 134,90â‚¬ and easily overclocked it to 6400mhz cl32.",i might try 6600-6800mhz at some point.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"tbh, you chose to buy a laptop with a 45 watt cpu (and good thing you didnâ€™t get a 55w hx!).","but, there are plenty of 12th gen laptop cpus available with tdps of 28w, 15w and 9w.",you just have to pick those models.,"still, manufacturers are unquestionably putting too much cpu into todayâ€™s laptops, but thatâ€™s more the oemâ€™s issue than intelâ€™s.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you have the ability to modify the power limits and boost clock values with either intel xtu or throttlestop?,"i didn't necessarily have to do so for the laptop i own to keep temps under control, but i used throttlestop to create a low power / battery only profile that runs reduced clock and boost speeds as well as lower total power limit values.",i am also running a global core undervolt on the laptop which helped a lot by itself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel 12th gen have pretty inefficient power usage but what you described doesn't sound like a good cooling system.,cooling 12w in a large-ish gaming laptop should be quiet.,i'd advise replacing the stock thermal paste and check if all fans are connected properly first.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just curious.,does 12-13w of power draw include integrated gpu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's why people buy m1/m2, if you want a better power efficiency laptop wait for lunar lake.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why the hell did you buy an h processor of you wanted something that draws less power?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i used to have a 2nd gen i3 with 35w tdp and it was very silent because it was a thick boy with a large fan.,the problem with modern notebooks is apple.,"macs don't need as much cooling and these dumb x86 notebooks also want to be as slim as those, but there is no space for cooling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm not sure either, it's on silent, cpu utilization literally sits on 1-3%, so there's absolute no point for it to use that much power.",did you undervolt yours?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"xtu won't run because of ""system incompatibility"" and throttlestop won't let to undervolt, the option ""unlock adjustable voltage"" is greyed out.","i manage to turn off turbo boost, but that won't help since it's too high idle wattage is what warming cpu up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i really don't think fiddling with cooling system will let 12+watts run less than 50c to not trigger the cooling system.,there is a reason laptop cpus try to stay under 5w on low cpu activities to stay.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gpu is in sleep mode.,12-13w is cpu package usage from hwinfo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"my laptop is not thin, it's not chunky either it's 0.78 inches, with good cooling system with enough intakes and exhausts.",it should have been more than enough for mid-upper-tier cpu.,"the thing is that your laptop cpu tdp was max 35watt and in mine it's a minimum 45watts, which is my point, it's way too much for a laptop.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it uses this much wattage when you move cursor around with a touch pad, if you don't touch it, it uses <5watts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the option to do so unfortunately has to be allowed by the laptop manufacturer, the cpu also needs to have the ability to have these values adjusted in the first place.",i figured it would be worth checking to see if you could at least as it would have made a world of difference if so.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well depends what you want to do with it, i'm just gona wait till lunar lake comes out to upgrade all my hardware.","btw, i would recommend wait for amd 7000 laptop cpu for batter battery performance though",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah.,my question was why did you buy an h processor?,those a high-wattage cpus.,alder lake u or p class chips use much less power in laptops.,15-28w,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wiggling the cursor around doesnâ€™t count as idle, it would be a light load but still heavier than idle.",when people talk about idle they mean when the computer is literally doing nothing (apart from the necessary background processes).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i know.,"my first instincts was to turn off the boost, undervolt it and tweak fan curves, but it can't be done in bios and after hours of googling, none of the options worked.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

go into the bios and change your cpu lite load setting from the default 12 to 8 or even 1. lowered my volts a good amount at 8. much lower volts and overall heat with no hit to performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the msi motherboard feeds the cpu with 1.4v+ by default, cpu lite load is the msi's foolproof way of undervolting the cpu but i wish they would be more descriptive on the modes.",i'd advise starting with mode 1 and stepping up if you run into stability issues.,"mode 9 seems to be intel's recommendation, or so i heard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if intels spec is lite load 9, then its msi's fault for running it at 12 at stock.","on other boards its called ac_ll / dc_ll and requires manual tuning, msi make it easy with one setting with an easy number.","i set my 13600kf to 1 and its working for me, down from 1.375v to 1.25v and still passing cinebench without performance loss.","you need to not only check for stability after reducing this setting, but also check that performance doesn't degrade from not having enough voltage for boost clocks, basically to start with, set lite load 1 and run cinebench.","it needs to complete 10 cycles and give you a score around 23-24k for a 13600k, variance based on ram speed.","if that passes then its fine, if not you need higher than 1 but less than 12.

one other problem a lot of users are running into, you cannot do or fix this on b660 boards.","13th gen chips are fully incompatible with b660 as they run excessive voltage and heat, and for whatever reason undervolting doesn't work and hugely degrades performance compared to lite load adjustment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

sure i understand your perspective itâ€™s just in my view if you buy a k cpu you would want to spend a bit of time tune it up.,so i got 12600k more than a year ago and tuned it up on daily overclock and undervolt to get just over 20k r23 score.,despite it being old silicon and less ecores i am getting almost the same results.,13600k is capable of over 26k score if you tune it.,the only cpu which i would probably not bother overclocking is 13900k which i am i expecting  to upgrade in a years or more time when itâ€™s used price really tanks.,i would still tune it with voltages to reduce the power consumption but still keep it above 40k on r23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

intel support won't tell me either and initial response is 'take it up with the manufacturer'.,now another problem with this is that i've made a huge mistake advising people how to correct their voltages.,"they needed to take it up with intel support who straight up have an 'overheating' option for their support, as they are playing dumb with me over this whole issue.","so more accurately, the stock values are what the chips are running at under auto bios.",the issue is that the default vid table has been programmed incorrectly into every chip thats having this issue.,yet intel support chooses to play dumb and blame the mobo manufacturer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i agree that the marketing was nonsense, but to be fully jaded, it always is... just like the predictable outrage bandwagon that follows.","i didn't get a ""good"" deal on the 4070ti, i paid msrp at $799, but since it was only a $100 investment to sell my 3080ti and upgrade to the 4070ti i figured the performance and energy improvements merited the fairly small upgrade cost.",lets put this in a different context.,"compare the value prop of a prior gen and current intel cpu:

the intel i5/13600k is somewhere between 1 and 10% faster (mostly weighted on far cry 6 benches) than the i7/12700k, which was a ""tier"" higher  a generation ago.",they have essentially the same heat/power characteristics they currently have a similar street price (micro center) though the 12700k was $450-$500 at launch.,i have not yet seen pitchforks or torches regarding these prices.,"now, consider the geforce 4070ti vs the 3080ti...

the 4070ti is also 1-10%+ faster in all gaming benchmarks up to 1440p, where it's within margin of error of parity compared to the 3080ti @ 4k with or without rt enabled.","on average it's also faster than the 3090ti even with rt enabled up to 1440p, though it is a bit slower (5% average) at 4k and is only 2% off of the 2-tier higher card in rt gaming performance.","the 13600k does not fare so well compared to the 12900k, a prior gen cpu that is 2 tiers higher at a launch price double the 13600k (much like the 3090ti which was double the 4070ti's launch price).","using the linus tt data you cited, across all productivity tests averaged, the 4070ti is 3% overall faster than a 30**90**ti.","it does have a single productivity outlier in which the 3080 was faster, davinci resolve encoding performance, though oddly this was not mirrored in the adobe or topaz encoding/rendering tests that are also video/photo encoding tasks.","it uses 130w less power than a 3080ti to achieve those results, which means it runs at least 25-30% cooler using a similar hsf assembly.","the msrp of the 4070ti is $800 vs $1200 for the 3080ti at launch.... at retail the 3080ti is typically still more expensive than the 4070ti, though if you look at used examples you might get the 3080ti for around $100 less... which is why i've encouraged people sitting on 3080ti's to bail, soon.","there are arguments in favor of the 3090's greater vram compliment for some productivity and 4k gaming tasks when mods/texture packs are in play, but this doesn't fly with the 10-12gb equipped 3080 cards.","the current trend of basing current card msrp's on inflated mining/covid shortage numbers sucks but it's also a game like any ""asking"" price, and it's knowingly set high to protect the value of older cards still in the retail channel.","the 4070ti is not a bad card to do what i expect it was designed for which is 1440p high framerate gaming with or without rt along with decent productivity and decent 4k/rt performance.... it's terribly priced at $800 but when it inevitably creeps down to $699 and, perhaps, the msrp of the overpriced 3070ti at $599 where it should be i'd argue it actually offers a better relative value than the prior generation xx70 tier card and makes all flavors of 3080 irrelevant.","gpu pricing is a game right now, sales are at a 20 year low and will only get lower from here.. nvidia is dragging it's feet on dropping 30xx flagship card prices unlike intel who quickly adjusted it's 12xxx series cpu prices to line up with the value prop that the prior gen products offered.","it will just take time... people need to get their emotions in check and quit taking it personally, this is the retail game... if you don't want to play, sit on your wallet.",i just wouldn't sit on a 3080ti card longer than necessary right now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have been having the same issue with my asus z690 and 12600k.,near as i can figure when the bios sets the pl1 or pl2 to 4096 then 5% of that is never ever going to clock down at idle.,going into the windows power management and changing the minimum to 0% results in proper idle clocks.,4096 is a ridiculous setting.,i am running p cores (no e) at 5.1ghz and only see 186 watts maximum.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you need to either reset bios entirely or go through and find the turbo and speedstep settings and make sure they are on.,"even if your voltage was static, it would not stop the cpu from down clocking (the voltage just wouldn't change).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yes, it has nothing to do with your windows install or any of your files.","it will just reset your bios settings, so any overclock, custom voltages, etc will be reset to default.","if that doesn't fix it, then you have something running that is causing the cpu to stay clocked.","i should ask, how are you monitoring your clock speed to determine that it isn't down clocking?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

- will the psu be able to handle this?",most oems use rather mediocre to poor quality psus.,"the psu in this particular pc is rated at 180 watts, but it doesn't mention if this is peak or continuous.","the core i7 10700 is rated by intel for 65 watt, mind you that is almost halve of your psu budget.",benchmarks have shown that the i7 10700 can draw well over 200 watts if you stress it to it's maximum.,that is more than your whole psu can supply.,some benchmarks show that the i7 10700 can sit at some 150 watts when doing a heavier kind of workload.,"again, your psu will be closed to maxed out at the point.",- are the motherboard vrm's good enough they don't overheat and start throttling the cpu?,again these tend to be of poor or mediocre quality.,- is the cooling solution up to the job?,most oems use a more custom cooling setup with a heatsink on the cpu and a fan in the front sucking in the air and pushing it into a plastic funnel towards the heatsink.,the heatsink might not be able to shift enough heat from the cpu because it isn't big enough.,with a potential power consumtion of 150 watts up to a potential of some 200 watts that is quite a bit of heat.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i have no ragrets in upgrading to raptor lake because it's an absolute beast, but this does make me feel like i should have waited another year.","i knew the new process would be smaller and more efficient, but dayumn, 50% more efficient?",i'm thinking about my power bill for the next 5-7 years.,"gonna have to run the math on it after it gets released and we see the true numbers, but it may be worth it to sell the z790/13700kf and upgrade.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what i care more about this gen is efficiency and chips that are easier to cool.,love my 13900k but jesus it was a bit of a chore to keep cool.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
interesting.,my 13900k gets toasty but the aio does a good job keeping it in check.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i heard  that rocket  lake was another stop gap product from intel becausse they weren't sure meteor lake would ever ship on time.,so i expect this to be a complete overhaul in architecture.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hopefully it isn't like amd's 50% ppw gains on rdna (at 300w),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

tsmc 5nm?,"says that ""50% performance per watt gain"" is not bad for the investors?","anyway overclock the 13th gen for the same wattage is possible, they have a lot of headroom for a refresh series",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1. no shit, of course they're targeting that, its the minimum you'd expect from a combined architecture and process node jump.",2. the comments in the thread so far seem to be ignoring that most of intels cores aren't sold in desktop chips - they can't ignore thermal characteristics vs perf.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if it goes straight performance again when the 13900k can get 330 avaerage wattage at r23 then it 14900k can jump to 500 wattage which technically will be over 115c and not even custom loop can hold it at oc let say aio or fan cooler thus efficiency matter, especially they using a smaller chip with tsmc which mean they can tackle efficiency easier, think of amd",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
does that mean less heat output?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it feels like 12th gen has a bug on mobile.,it just consumes an absurd amount of power while idling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's not the first time intel has launched first with mobile skus on a new node and only later launched desktop skus.,we know for a fact that mobile skus on intel 4 will start ramping in 2h 2023 which probably means  by the end of the year they will appear in the market.,but no such clarity on when desktop skus shall start ramping on intel 4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because intel has done it before.,"new-gen doesn't always mean new desktop gen. 

remember gen 5th?",it could be something like that.,just very few sku are on desktop side.,or maybe even none at all.,it is not the first time intel made a new gen more specific to desktops or laptop.,"since this is mostly for power efficiency, which doesn't really benefit the desktop all that much.",there are some likelihood that might do something similar again and delay desktop until next gen. considering the desktop side is doing okay already.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i havenâ€™t seen any reliable information pointing towards the existence of desktop skus?,"reading between the lines of statements made by intel, it really does sound like meteor lake is mobile only.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its happened before but it was the exception.,im sure there will be desktop skus for mtl.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
true but intel canâ€™t be trusted anymore until something is really certain.,i will be very surprised if i finally get meteor lake instead of another raptor lake refresh.,i have 9700k.,the funny thing is that 9th gen is coffee lake refresh of 8th genâ€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

stay with 11th gen. you should only upgrade to high-na euv intel skews.,intel 20a processes.,if you had 10th gen intel chip (like me) i will be jumping onto intel 4 (euv process).,4 years is a good time to upgrade.,if you can stretch to 5 or 6 years that will be good use of your money.,3 years is too fast.,[https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/saxowk6binq6mamlbealvi-970-80.png.webp](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/saxowk6binq6mamlbealvi-970-80.png.webp) \- from tom's hardware cpu hierarchy.,from looking at this chart (purely for gaming) i would say if you had an i7 8700k (highest end intel chip for 8th gen) getting 125 fps avg and jumping to 12700k or even 13900k will be a good upgrade.,about roughly 6 year upgrade cycle.,[multi-thread performance](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hxcztqtaclquqxudfcadm9-970-80.png.webp) \- and you can see similar jumps in terms of productivity suites.,so from intel 9th gen upgrading to 13th gen would be a good upgrade.,but your i9 11900k is still at the top of the pack.,especially if you decide to overclock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15th or 16th tbh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
upgrade every 4 years on average!,no less than that for cpus/motherboards!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so far it seems like 14th gen will be mobile-only, because there is no information about 14th gen cpus with more than 6 p cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that would not be very good.,"the 13900k can already do, what, 70-80% of itâ€™s full performance at half the power draw?","a 50% efficiency gain would mean 50% faster at 300w, or maybe like 20% faster at 100w?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i couldnâ€™t agree more,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tough decision.,i'm one gen later (9900k) at constant 5ghz and very fast ram (3700 cl 15).,wondering if the 13900 is worth it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i heard rumours that the whole 14th gen line up will only have 6 p cores and the rest is e cores (including i9 and i7).,i think it was gamers nexus but donâ€™t quote me on that.,probably too early to tell anyway.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"when it is efficient you can always push for more performance, no?",at itâ€™s current state the 13900k is throttling even at stock for some owner so they had to under volt or ran it at lower speed or canâ€™t overclock higher.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
releasing a new gen = higher price = if performance stays same it's meh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

isnt it only the 4090?,"edit: downvoted for asking questions, impressive",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
temperature/heat output has very little to do with the efficiency of cpus/gpus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you usually need to tinker with bios settings and so.,my 13600k can run with stock speed at 110-120watts in cinebench r23 after tinkering with ia ac dc.,now it pulls 190w at 5.6pcores 4.4ecores and 5.0ring.,so i'm gonna say it is darn efficient imo for the level of performance i'm getting from it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think upgrade if you are unable to achieve your target framerate.,i play everything at 60fps so my target framerate is impossibly easy to achieve.,i am never cpu bound and my chip runs at 40 or 50c overclocked and i don't even think about it.,but if i was to suddenly require 120fps or the crazy 240fps.... i'd have no choice but to upgrade.,i think you could do 15th or 16th gen no problem.,likely 11900k is still desirable because of the avx512.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14th gen is generally referring to meteor lake.,"however, the plan to have raptor lake refresh later this year, if not officially referred to as 14th gen (which i donâ€™t think it would be as it would probably just be a minor speed bump and not a silicon change), would then just be a continuation of 13th gen. maybe 13.5th gen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

people will buy it.,most people outside of this echo chamber don't buy new motherboards/cpu's every 1-2 years.,the vast majority of sales are going to be to people with much older pc's looking to upgrade.,"i seriously doubt intel is targeting people with a 12th or 13th gen chip already, because the people who hop onto every new platform is a tiny portion of their market.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's not really irrelevant, higher power means bigger and more expensive heatsinks, power supplies, and cases.",this adds up quickly.,that said i don't think raptor lake is particularly bad as long as reasonable power limits are used and motherboards don't go nuts by default.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

definitely would have gone with the i9 13900k or ks.,seems like an odd choice to go with a top tier 4090 gpu and then pair it with a mid range cpu like the i7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

heat is not entropy.,heat exchange increases the entropy of a system.,"the theoretically perfect gpu you are mentioning is actually something that physicists usually refer to as ""ideal machine"", which has a 100% efficiency.",an ideal machine has no heat loss.,the 4090 you mention here is much more efficient.,"despite it uses +33% more watts, the output(fps or whatever you want to measure to compare) is more than the triple of the 690.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> a 100% efficient gpu just means that all the heat produced was used to perform computation.,this theoretically perfect gpu would still require power and produce heat proportional to the # of computations it performed.,"transistors are generally very very close to 100% efficient, so power draw is always the main component when it comes to heat.",your cpu or gpu is basically just as good at turning electricity into heat as an electric furnace would be.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"even if you don't care about the cost, the noise, or the heat dumped into your room, temperature has become a limiting factor behind performance.",are you being deliberately obtuse?,performance can't be pushed further than the 13900k with current technology without reducing energy consumption because it is already at the limits of what can reasonably be dissipated.,the only people who would vocally claim to not care about a reduction in energy consumption are blatantly ignorant.,less heat means more headroom for performance.all you are doing with this post is very publicly looking like a fool.,you don't seem to understand that performance and energy efficiency are intrinsically linked.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"so even if i'm missing the extra 8pin connector and plug only one, it will work fine?",(on a motherboard which has 8+8),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my psu doesn't have that connector that's why i'm asking to see if i need to buy a new psu.,"btw, is the b760m pg riptide good for the 13600k?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my psu only has one 8pin (4+4),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
650,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don't have the cable that's why i'm asking.,i only have one 8pin (4+4),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i run my 12900ks on a single 8pin cable and it pulls up to 300w in cb r20.,"i'd say it's fine, especially with a 13600k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nah, the motherboard manuals are almost always obscure about it.","gigabyte has a manual that says ""plug in the 12v or the computer will not  boot"", asus has a motherboard manual that says ""ensure the 12v is connected"".","and neither of those two manuals (among a bunch of others i've glanced over) says ""no need for both unless you overclock"".","just this week for the first time i saw a manual that said ""no need"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"uuuuuuuuuuuuh, no, they're not, rotfl.",where'd you get that number from xd.,"8-pin can handle just a shy from 400w before it starts getting really warm, but are rated well below that.",it will be long melted before it even reaches 800w.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends if you want to oc in the future.,would you mind sharing your build?,i'm building a pc as well with 13600k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"generally, non k intels are paired with b mb chipsets and k intels are paired with z chipsets.",z chipsets like my 790 do a good enough job of ocing when needed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
z board with ddr5.,"not sure what local stores you have in the uk, but i would just make watchlists and wait for sales.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"main difference is cpu overclocking, so if you want to do that get z690/790 as b series only allows memory overclock which is not worth it imo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i only mention 253w because itâ€™s the intel stock limit (pl1/pl2) for the 13900k.,"iâ€™ve run it at 270w for a benchmark, but, too hot.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for a 13600k, i would think it'd be ok.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yup, you don't need a second 8 pin or 4 pin unless your doing extreme overclocking with ln2 or dry ice.",a single 8 pin is all you need regardless of which cpu your running.,my current system has a 16 core 5950x and i'm only using a single 8 pin...my new am5 system will have a 7950x but also only needs a single 8 pin.m.you can overclock it too with no problem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
check your motherboard manual.,that might be for additional pcie power.,"in which case, its necessity would depend on your video card.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you sure it doesn't?,some psu will have a split 8 pin that can be used as a 4 pin for cou.,double check the manual and labeling on the cables.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it probably has it.,the 8 pin connectors break into two 4 pins.,they are clipped to each other.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am quite certain that your psu just wasnt packaged with the cable.,you should be able to use a cpu port from your psu with the proper cable.,"(i am being downvoted for the right answer, that is so very reddit.)","there are 8pin to 4pin cables

https://help.corsair.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043469632-how-to-connect-a-psu-to-a-4-pin-cpu-port

you might not have a corsair supply, you just need to find the proper cable for your psu.",it is important you get a cable compatible with your psu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hmm...the only thing i can think of is getting another psu, maybe a modular 750 ðÿ¤·â€â™‚ï¸.","or if your 650 is modular, maybe they sell a cable that will fit your needs.","not too sure, sorry",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
650 is a bit low these days in terms of wattage.,it really might be worth the upgrade for future (and now).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ahhh ok. you can try without but it might cause stability issues.,you can also buy 4 pin atx cable seperatly.,"if you do, try and get the 8 pin that you can seperate the plug head in case you need an 8 pin in the future :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
here this has the info.,https://www.overclock.net/threads/gpu-and-cpu-power-connections.1773088/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"continuous power vs power spikes are day, and night different some psu cables are rated for like 400 watts, but they're not rated for that in continuous power, i would in no way call cb r20 continuous power, and i have seen overclockers push far higher power on a single 8 pin, but that is also by no means continuous power, servers do better with continuous power do to the high power fans keeping stuff cool.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"every time i've seen someone ask this question i've looked up their motherboard manual and it usually has the answer, and it's usually 'optional'.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i heard 8 pins are rated for 150w but can do up to 300w.,even 400w sounds like it's pushing it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

didn't order a really high end cooler (xilence m705d) but i've seen some people overclocking their 13600k's while undervolting them at the same time that's why i was interested.,i guess the performance increase isn't worth it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i mean the extra 4 pin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and everytime i've looked into answering someone's problem by downloading their motherboard manual and seeing the words as i paraphrase-quoted - except for one motherboard this week for the 1st time as noted.,perhaps i tend to answer ddr5-motherboard problems or something.,"see, for example, the manuals for the gigabyte aorus elite ax ddr5 and the asus rog strix z790-e; the words they use are typical i've seen (they both discuss ""internal connectors"" or something and have pages for the extra power connectors).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"eps can easily deliver you enough power to torture 13900k in prime95 smallfft without any danger or long term consequences, pcie is rated for 150w, but was proven it can also easily deliver \~300w of power.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
go for the z board.,b boards are known to be quirky and broken when paired with 13th gen especially related to undervolting which is a must for most if not all systems with 13th gen chips.,the reason is the stock bios settings are way too agressive which leads to temps reaching 100 c almost instantly under load.,i ran mine with a b board at first but temps were horrendous.,"when ""undervolting"" the undervolt protection kicked in hard and led to massive performance drops.",it cant be disabled either.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ditch the b series board.,did the same and had to return it.,does not play nice with k chips.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have the 13600k, oc to 5.6ghz on all pcores with a z690 msi mobo.",i put a post about it.,"it can come in handy for video rendering, and for certain games like spiderman, and especially farcry 6. with farcry 6 i saw the most uplift.",about a 15% fps boost when ocd my 13600k.,even at 1440p.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"good to know, never owned an h chip before.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
awesome.,for what it's worth i have the same combo and it runs cool and silent.,i turned off mce though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what board and cpu?,did you undervolt through bios?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can just manually limit the pl1 and pl2 voltages though.,"i capped mine at 145w (for both) and lost a whopping 500ish points on r23 (from 23,100 or so to 22,550 or therabouts) and it still boosts to 5.1ghz on all six p-cores.",there was no real world or gaming performance loss,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why?,what kind of problems did you have,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"okay now i'm worried, i got a asus b660-f and i5 13600k, haven't build my pc yet, i can't return any of them, the sellers in my country are like that, once you bought them you own them",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"what mobo do you have,?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i5-13600k   
msi pro b660m-a wifi  


its across all b boards tho as found in many other threads.",yes undervolting through bios because i dont like having too many programs open in the background.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
high temps benchmarking.,would thermal throttle due to settings on the motherboard and trying to alter voltages didn't work.,"you've two options, get a z series board so you can play with the bios settings and overclock.",or just get a 13400f.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its fine.,undervolting is wonky (thanks intel!),but you can just manually limit the cpu pl1 and pl2 wattages without losing any real performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
asus tuf z790.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok thanks.,i'm gonna get a z790 pg lightning instead,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
was a b660 mobo by any chance?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how to do that?,is it in the bios?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the experience i had was that i could get it down to around 90ish.,"would still occasionally throttle on two individual cores and drop the clocks to under 4. 
with a z series board i can overclock to 5.5 and keep it under 80. 
not much point in spending the extra for a k series if you can't mess around with the clocks.","be as well just get a non k. 
i'm on itx which might not help with temps though.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, asus 760i",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it is on my asus b660i, and id assume your board would have it as well, but im not 100% sure where in the bios it would be.",in the b660i bios its under a heading called â€œinternal cpu power managementâ€.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i wouldn't say heat is a motherboard issue
 it's probably just allowing the cpu to draw more power.","if you have an issue with heat get a better cooler.b series boards just have less features, like you said there isn't really a point to get a k cpu and a b series motherboard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
alright.,should i get the z790 pg lighting?,it is good?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i see, i will check it out, thanks",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is nice idea :) but would be great also to some earlier mb but not sure what alternative was in the past before z chipset ?,?,x ?,?,":)

that rgb fase...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
curious.,"why z170 asrock looks so modern day mb standard and then... downgraded shit for 270 370 390.  


by the way, i jumped from end to end of spectrum z68 to z790 lol that's 10 years jump.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oof.. more and more gaudy every yr.

i like the first one the best.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what i am compiling here are the pro series based on the z chipset.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it was p chipsets i.e p67 for sandy bridge.,"z later became the ""p""performance chipset that also supported the igpu properly.",a long time before that it was just numbers.,"pentium 4 chipsets named 840, 865, 875 i think.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do not forget the substandard vrms too that spanned until its z490 years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
downgraded by component of choic?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i understand, but some older board are more intereting and colorfull.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the p67 chipset is the last generation of intel consumer chipsets with ""p"" naming that does not support igpu outside hedt series.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well asrock pro was usually the cheapest z series board you can find.,you wouldn't need good vrm with a 8350k or even 9600k.,but anything above 120w that thing will struggle hard.,honestly i think mobo manufacturers over done it these days.,even the lowest end mobo has 10+ phase power delivery (i've heard this number can be faked as it includes stuff like memory or igpu) and runs a i9 without issues.,"and i wouldn't complain about having better vrm, had the price of mobos not nearly doubled over the past 5 or 6 years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably they took the criticism about vrm quality only too well...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"while that reply is bullshit, they are actually not wrong that if you have a 10th gen or below you do not have resizable bar and the arc cards need that.","whether it was working before or not is going to be thrown out just because of the fact you don't have a supported platform...so why would they fix it 

not saying that they shouldnt fix it.",thats probably their thought process.,they can chalk it up as its not opening because its not supported.,unless more people with supported platforms speak up about an issue like this they arent going to do anything about it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
time for upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"what they are saying is that since your cpu is older than 10th generation, it's completely not supported by the card.","you need to look at the requirements for the card, not the requirements for arc control.",here: https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000091128/graphics.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not true many 8th gen z370 and up boards have bios updates for resizeable bar.,i have an asrock z370 taichi with rebar enabled and the a770 runs fine along with arc control.,only glitch on 10th gen or below is you have to leave the igpu disabled or wonky things happen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i bought a ddr5-7200 kit for my 13700k and it's been a headache honestly...    hours and hours of trying to get it stable.,exactly same motherboard too.,and the worst part of this i'm outside of return window for stuff now.,it's taken me 2 months to get things working.,hell the first 3 cpus i got couldn't handle ddr5-7200 without either boot problems or just memory errors.,"first one wouldn't post at all at anything above 6400, the other two just endless crashes or memory errors, etc...    it's honestly silicon lottery if you'll get a cpu that can run these faster ddr5 kits without much trouble.",i updated my bios and intel me firmware a few days ago and now have to go through all of it again.,as previous stable settings no longer work and it's crashing/unstable again.,i'm honestly just debating selling this ddr5-7200 kit and grabbing a slower kit to save myself the headache.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm running a 13700k oc (5.7ghz ps, 4.4ghz es) msi z790 edge mb and two sticks of 16gb gskill ddr5 6400 cl 32s and mine has been 100% stable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6400mhz is somewhat a good speed sweetspot where the benefits above this speed isnt so big.,better get yourself 2sticks with good timings (<36cl) around 6000-6400mhz the extra money you need to spend for 7200 and find good cl isnt worth it imo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you get 6000 c32 kit, you can overclock to 7200mhz without a sweat, same timings and same tuning level.","they're the same kits, just a different bin, it's not b-die binning grade.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"donâ€™t expect to run anything higher than 7000-7200 max, cause itâ€™s a pure lottery.","you might be able to run ~7600mt/s, but most likely you wonâ€™t.",you gonna need a super expensive 2 dimm motherboard like apex in order to run 7600-8000+ ddr5.,"cheaper 2 dimm itx boards can do that aswell, but not everyone likes itx boards.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13th gen imcs are usually good.,"just have to make sure your ram has a-die and you should be guaranteed up to about 7200, depending on the motherboard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have that exact motherboard (asus rog strix z790-e wifi) and i also have a 32gb g.skill ddr5 7200 kit which is overclocked to 7600 with more aggressive timings and it works great.,"out of the box timings with xmp should have no problems, but if you want to use more aggressive timings, then you may have to fiddle around with it a bit.",i'm using a 13900kf btw.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ohâ€¦ iâ€™m sorry about this situationâ€¦ i know how frustrating it is when computers donâ€™t work as we expect they wouldâ€¦ thanks for sharing this!,which kit would you buy if you have the chance now that the 7200 hasnâ€™t worked ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the comment!,since the price difference is not really big between the 6400 and 7200 here in korea (yea the 6400 version is really expensive) seems iâ€™ll be getting the 7200 version just in case haha thanks!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the advice!!,iâ€™ll check the 6400mhz cl32 kit!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
agreed.,were talking margin of error performance differences for double the cost.,not remotely worth it.,i grabbed 6000 cl30 and thatll be fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh really?,i didnâ€™t know that can be done!,it wonâ€™t get too hot or something?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeahâ€¦.,i am not expecting to go any higher than 7200mhz.,maybe i can get the 6400 kit and try overclock it to 7200. or just get the 7200 kit and leave it like that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"according to what i searched, the ram i want is a-die.",itâ€™s the dominator cmt32gx5m2x7200c34 which is 7200mhz without overclockingâ€¦ so technically there shouldnâ€™t be any problems with the 13700k ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s awesome!,do you think the 13900k makes the difference?,i am not planning to overclock the ram i just want to get a kit that gives 7200mhz at its normal speed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably this gskill ddr5-6000 cl30 kit:   f5-6000j3040f16gx2-tz5rk,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, they're literally the very same chips, that can get overclocked to very same performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
should be no problems at all.,nope.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the imc in the 13900k is far more robust than it was with alder lake, so i would be shocked if yours couldn't do 7200mhz.",i've had mine as high as 7800mhz and it was stable.,the most important thing is to make sure you're on the latest uefi bios.,the latest uefi allows for greater stability at higher memory speeds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've got a 13700k and managed to grab 32gb t force cl30 6000mhz ram and it's worked beautifully no tuning required,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the problem was 60 degree on idle on 1 -2 cores but i fixed it.,"turns out armory crate, software for rbg, fan speeds ect was working even after i closed it.",its cpu usage was around 7-10 %.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have aio eisbaer aurora 360 mm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 my x570 build was doing that yesterday.,i got fed up and reinstalled windows.,how did you fox it?,it seems like armory crate and aisuite are conflicting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

check your core clocks and temps while running cinebench.,my msi z790i was limiting cpu power with default bios settings.,"cpu pl1/pl2 were fine but the cpu current limit setting was low, causing my 13900k to run at 5ghz all core clocks instead of the stock 5.5ghz.",my temps were ok but the power draw was a dead give away at 225w or so.,removed the cpu current limit by bumping up the amperage from the stock 307a setting to the full 512a and the 13900k now performs as expected.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so you genuinely expect noctua d15 to be an almighty monster?,and a $100 air cooler is enough for a pc that costs $4k?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

lmao going all in with the motherboard and cheaping out on  ram.,hilarious.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wondering why you bought a z690 mobo.....you should have just gone straight into a z790.,the 13th gen cpu's minimum ddr5 support is 5600 by the way so don't short change yourself with 5000.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if i were you id upgrade that ram, that is very slow ddr5 ram.",if possible id get 6400+ ram.,also the 13900k going on sale is basically 0% chance.,but yes your upgrade will be awesome.,make sure you are on a fresh build of windows 11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6400mhz on the ram is a great start.,they are on sale for like 219 on newegg.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why would you buy 5000mhz ram?,at that point just get a 13700k and faster ram.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"everyone who is complaining about the ""slow"" ram [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ista56iaeva) shows how little difference it makes to pay much extra for so little gain.","but yeah imo that board is huge overkill, i got a z790 pg lightning for 230â‚¬, it is weird that you would ""waste"" so much money on a mobo but go with that ""cheap"" ram",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the z790 isnâ€™t worth the price increase for what it offers.,i can just update my bios and get the same performance and features out of a z690,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why win11?,i try to stay away from it with my 13700k pc that comes tomorrow for the sole reason that win11 is still so unfinished from what i have seen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you have any recommendations for ddr5 thatâ€™s not like 572626273 dollars.,"i know itâ€™s kind of weird that i would care about the price considering i brought an $800 motherboard, but ðÿ¤·â€â™€ï¸",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because 6000mhz+ ram is obscenely expensive and microcenter had a good deal on this ram.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea but people updating bios on some z690 boards are running into performance issues.,hope that doesn't affect you.,you're talking a $100 swing at most.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i dont know what you mean by unfinished.,but windows 11 comes with the thread director so it schedules each task to the correct core.,"gaming=p core, background task=e core.",windows 10 doesnt have that so if your gaming it might go to the e core and introduce latency or fps drops,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i just snagged gskill 6000mhz 32gb of ram for 200 bucks

seemed like a good deal to ne",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and why would you buy an $800 motherboard just to be cheap on ram.,you paid more for something that does not increase performance at all but want to cheap out on something essential ?,?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how much is the 5000 mhz?,bc you can get 32gb cl30 6000 for $200,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i literally have no idea what your talking about.,thereâ€™s really been no issues with win 11 except for a couple bugs (windows 10 had the same issues right at launch) and there is no 100% cpu bug or update lockdown.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just disable the e cores bro then windows 10 works just fine with alderlake,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sell it and buy better ram,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the microcenter promo is now 6000mhz memory with purchase of an amd chipâ€¦and isnâ€™t it kinda stealing to not return the whole package?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah i rather not throw away processing power i paid for, could have bought amd otherwise.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is latency as important with the ddr5 as it was with the ddr4?,i donâ€™t know what the baseline is for this generation of ram.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, they wonâ€™t take it back.",they said if i return it i would get 0.01 cent back.,i didnâ€™t steal it.,he let me keep it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there's always threadripper.,you're on hedt anyways so upgrading to another hedt platform would make the most sense.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
threadripper pro ryzen 5000 is exactly what he's looking for.,"of course, i'm not really recommending that with the cost being rather stupid and the availability being very slim.",intel simply can't compete in the hedt space currently with amd.,"they are making progress, but intel is using chiplets in their high end xeon classes now and e cores in their consumer platforms.",we will have to wait and see what technology kind of wins.,the other obvious thing is that ryzen pro 5000 is probably going to be the last hedt platform op is gonna be able to get.,intel and amd have no reason and no roadmaps for hedt platforms in the future.,a ryzen 7950x/13900k is good enough for 90% of consumers.,"when it comes to businesses, intel and amd would much rather sell them the more pricey xeon and epyc cpus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

considering the recent price stratagy of intel they should have very good pricing.,"if not, i dont see them selling at all.",threadripper has such a vast variaty of platform options.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what's the cheapest xeon a normal consumer can buy?,we used to have the popular 1231v3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

its been 6 years but i'm hoping we may finally get a 7820x successor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i wouldn't say vast, in the wrx80 lineup for threadripper 5000 theres like 5 boards total?",and considering the enormous price hike of threadripper 5000 vs 3000 it's a hard pill to swallow.,"intel does need to nail pricing on this, and if they do it can get them inroads back into this high end part of the market.","but hell, if they mess it up and no one buys it i'll buy one when it's all discounted anyway so its a win.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's not like there needs to be much variation in boards for threadripper pro - there's so much pcie and memory expansion that boards can just have 7x 16-lane pcie slots (like the almost identical epyc platform) and you just add whatever hardware need if it doesn't come with it already.,"that's very hard to achieve with mainstream platforms when you have a measly 20 (intel) or 24 (amd) pcie lanes from the cpu and 8 from the chipset, and on intel bifurcation support is terrible - which is why they have to carve-up the pcie lanes in weird and wonderful ways, share bandwidth over the dmi/chipset connection with usb/sata/nvme/ethernet, have strategic spacing between slots to take account of gpu sizing, put m.2 sockets on non-standard riser brackets, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
leaks have shown both 4 and 8 channel parts.,"the 8 channel one is the tr pro competitor, while the 4 channel looks more interesting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[none of your cores are parked in that image.,](https://imgur.com/zzckyjn) what you're seeing is the typical behavior of the thread director.,it is putting the priority work on the first thread of each p core and instead of loading up the second thread on each p core (which could compete for recourses with the other thread on each core) it is moving the lower priority tasks onto the e cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i don't think anyone would be able to answer this in a useful way until there are actual tests done.,for 12th gen the locked cpus lost very little actual performance so in terms of value they were the better option.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"base frequency doesnâ€™t matter, itâ€™s not an actual speed the cpu will ever run (well, unless you disable boost that is, but you should never do that).",base frequency is a reference number for the minimum clock speed the cpu can do under maximum load at the tdp power.,with lower tdp the base clock has to be lower.,all power limits should be configurable so 125w or 65w doesnâ€™t matter either.,the only speed that really matters is the max speed.,and you can calculate that effect easily yourself as its effect is basically linear.,"cache is more difficult, it depends on the workload.",in general games like more cache though.,edit: there are some possible hidden differences between k and non k processors in terms of configurability of certain voltages.,this might affect practical memory speed limits.,but we donâ€™t know about that yet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

changing the power limits is explicitly not overclocking by intels definition.,basically it wonâ€™t really change your cpus behavior but it will throttle less.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
umm.. no.,explaining how the boost works is a bit complicated.,"you have three main parameters, these are in intel technical documentation called pl1, pl2 and tau.",pl1 should in standard configuration correspond to the tdp.,it is in effect the actual maximum thermal output of the cpu over time.,how it works is that the cpu can use up to pl2 amount of power as long as the average power consumption is under pl1.,when the average reaches pl1 the cpu gets limited to pl1.,this ensures the average can never go over pl1.,the average is computed using a simple ewma filter.,the decay of the filter is controlled by the time constant parameter tau.,so you can control boost length by setting longer tau but also higher pl1 or lower pl2 might make the boost longer but it depends on the workload.,clock speed is another question because different workloads use different amount of power.,in many cases the cpu can run at full boost speed while consuming less than pl1 power.,in that case it can run as fast indefinitely.,clock speeds are only limited so that the average power consumption stays under pl1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">it wonâ€™t really change your cpus behavior but it will throttle less

which makes sense - when?",specifically with turbo boost 3.0 on board.,"in games, which are not core-demanding, tb 3.0 will rise the frequency of 1-2 cores to their maximum; in multitasking *all* cores will work faster (but all - *lower* than max possible).",so where is power limit here?,"and is there a good rule of a thumb of defining its resonable borders (e.g., +10-20% from stock w)?",thank you!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what an amazing explanation - thank you mate!,"finally, this pl1 which everyone mentions, started to have total sense to me.",":-)) 

let me paraphrase what you've wrote so that i'm sure i understood everything correctly:

* o/c cpu and power boost are *different* processes, but they are connected in the sense that o/clocked cpu consumes more power \[when task itself *requires* those extra clocks of course\], so boosting o/clocked cpu's power will make it more stable
* non-o/clocked cpus can be power-boosted as well, which will **extend the time** within which execution of power-consuming tasks will be possible.",speed of execution (ghz) will stay within the factory-set limits.,"if the above is correct, could you please kindly comment on the following:

1.","*what* are (typically) those power-sucking tasks: low with data, but frequent/fast (i.e., games), or big amounts of data to be processed (i.e., converting, rendering), or smth.",different at all?,"2. does power consumption have any connection with the *number* of cores in action (i.e., single-core / multi-core tasks)?","if yes - can power boost somehow affect the work of turbo boost 3.0, and are they ""compatible"" at all?","3. is there any good rule of a thumb regarding the ""sweet spot"" of power boost (e.g., +x% on top of factory-set defaults)?",thank you!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the pl will most likely kick in when all cores are working.,the rule of thumb is basically look at what your cpu cooler can handle.,"increase by 10-20, run all core workload, check temps.",if they hit 100c go back the last 10w.,if they are not increase by 10 again,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,the cpu has a target clock which is the maximum boost clock.,it will run as close to the target speed as the power limit (and some other factors) allows.,the target clock remains the same but power limit can change with the boost algorithm.,1. heaviest are vectorized floating point tasks that are â€œembarrassingly parallelâ€.,rendering tasks such as cinebench or blender are like this but they arenâ€™t perfectly vectorized and use some time got data access.,if you want an actual maximum â€œpower virusâ€ an example would be the lucas lehmer algorithm using fft to find prime numbers (an application called prime95).,"games are relatively light on power consumption, largely because so much of the processing time is used for waiting data from memory.",you are unlikely to exceed 100w in most games.,2. each core uses power mostly independently so more cores means more power.,intel divides â€œpackage powerâ€ to â€œcore powerâ€ and â€œuncore powerâ€.,clock domains are also divided to core clocks and uncore clock.,"each core is clocked independently (mostly, the number of active cores can affect maximum boost clock) and uses power independently.","uncore is shared between cores, this includes l3 cache and the data bus handling data distribution to and from the cores.",3. not really.,intel used to use 25% years ago but that is fairly small.,most diy people put maximum possible power consumption to pl2 but most diy people also have a very big cooler.,you should test with your own cooling solution so that the cpu never overheats.,i personally have 240w pl2 and 200w pl1 in my system.,the length of tau also affects how much total heat the cooler has to dissipate in boost.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"got it, thank you a lot!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
brilliant explanation - respect!,"to finalize with power boost, am i right, that since you didn't say anything about turbo boost 3.0, i shouldn't worry about it - i just leave it on, increase my cpu power (wizely, of course - step-by-step and with proper cooling) and turbo boost 3.0 will *automatically* adapt itself to my new tdp settings?","as for the benefits of increased power, if i buy a 65w 13700, which i plan to use for office tasks and gaming, with only occasional conversion/video-rendering, makes sense to rise its power to not more than \~85-95w, as games mostly won't benefit from that, while my occasional multitasking will probably run faster.",hope this logic/plan is correct..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
turbo boost 3 adds some extra situations when the cpu can run slightly faster but in general you don't need to worry about it.,just leave it on.,i would set the power limits as high as the cooling comfortably allows.,the 13700 has a sweet spot of multithreaded efficiency somewhere around 100w.,after that it gains performance but the gains are smaller than the power increase.,so set 100w and see how hot it gets in cinebench.,you can increase power limit until you start hitting 90c.,of course unless the fan noise bothers you earlier than that.,increasing the power limit doesn't increase power consumption in gaming or office tasks so it doesn't matter in general use.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1. threads are launched/created at runtime.,code will only contain logic if and when it will use multithreading.,2. the cpu has no knowledge how threads belonging to the same program relate to one another.,this logic is encapsulated within the program itself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
programs have to tell the operating system to create each new thread at run time.,"for example, on windows you can call createthread with a pointer to the code you want the thread to run.","windows then creates that thread, schedules it to run and loads up the code you passed to the function.",compilation just turns the programmers code into a binary file.,"so the call to createthread would be encoded in the binary, but nothing actually happens until you run the program.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"got it, thank you!","the multithreads are built into the source code, and the system simply creates and executes the multithreads per instructions of the source code.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the cpu just runs the instructions, it just does as the os tells it.",it is the os that keeps track of threads and two whom they belong.,"still, the os does not know what logic is behind any of the threads since only the application knows this.",the order of things returned by seperate threads has to be managed by the application that requested them in the first place.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that is definitely a plausible explanation.,"if the solder between the die & ihs isn't proper, then it can't transfer the heat to the ihs negating most of the benefit of the contact between the cooler & ihs.","if you can exchange it, that'd be a good route to go.",the alternative would be to delid/relid with some liquid metal.,"i've done that with mine, but it's definitely not for everyone.",lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you want to save your current settings and reset bios first.,the first thing you want to do is go to the page that has profiles on it.,save your current profile so that you can always go back to it if anything goes wrong.,"name it ""original bios"", if you have one on hand, also save this to a thumbdrive

turn the pc off

there's a button on the back of your pc that will say ""reset bios"" or have a circular arrow saying ""cmos"" on it""   

press that

reboot and go into bios, enable xmp for your memory, enable ""rebar/4g""

save this bios under another profile such as ""standard""

that's all you need to do",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
guarantee?,no.,"but, until it's attempted, there's also no guarantee that's the actual issue.",i'd definitely go the exchange route if available.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

congrats you have a board with the i225 that still has the hardware issues.,itâ€™s a hardware issue and would require a completely new motherboard.,"tbh, just use a usb or usb-c ethernet adapter.",not worth replacing the entire board.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

op probably has a board with the og i225v that had auto negotiation issues.,"only way to fix it was to redo the hardware and have a revision 2. i had one on my z590 and rmaâ€™d it and they sent me a new retail board that had the new chip, but iâ€™m sure thereâ€™s still some old stock floating around and op was just unlucky.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

these are honestly getting better and better every day.,already faster than my 3070 which is a great gpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love the competition that intel brought to the table.,would expect them to be more competitive as the years go by but so far the only card that would consider and recommend buying is the a750.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my thoughts are as follows..man bump you i want one let me borrow 5 dollars..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's nice that the us got a price cut.,"the a750 in france is over 320 euros, which is well above 250 usd....",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i owned one when they came out, i have gone through the updates for them, i have an rtx 3080 ti for my main card, i just used this as my main card for months just to test it thoroughly, intel is doing everything correct in my eyes, of course we expect growing pains but for the price to performance no other card on the market competes, it very easily keeps up with an rtx 3070, easily overpowering an rtx 2080ti.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they need more designs for sure.,more board partners would be nice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

we'll see about the results for this last quarter but as for intel's dc decline for q3 and beforehand amd definitely played a large role looking at marketshare figures.,"back when rome launched (zen 2, q3 2019 iirc?)",amd was sitting at just under 5% market share in dc.,as of q3 last year that had shot up to 17.5% (aka >3.5x growth in 3 years).,and this is just market share.,revenue share would be significantly higher as milan is selling for considerably more per-unit than ice lake is.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

where did they gain quarter to quarter?,"*overall* as a company, quarters are down from the same quarters last year *and* there is a drop in both revenue and profit from q3 to q4 2022. see the bottom ""top, bottom, and bling lines"" portion in this graphic:

however, if you are arguing that 2022 q3 to q4 ""growth"" in datacenter is notable, that is stereotypical myopia and a gross lack of understanding of how datacenter sales work.",it is typical for companies to do end-of-year upgrades which explains the expected q3 to q4 uptick.,the q4 should be the local maxima of any year in datacenter revenue.,they should have a hump there given how many companies plan for sales then.,that is typical of datacenter any year.,"if they didn't have that hump, that would mean their datacenter revenue is in even worse freefall.",never mind that 2022's q3->q4 revenue slope is only barely a hump unlike 2021's q3->q4 progression which means 2023 is going to be a bloodbath for intel in datacenter.,it is year-over-year that are the real tell-all here of their long-term customer retention.,"the most telling statistic is that from q4 2021 to q4 2022, revenue nose-dived from $6.426 billion to $4.304 billion, or a third of revenue simply evaporated.",that would put me in panic mode if i were the executive manning this company.,that is why their datacenter business is in dire straits right now and especially so as arm and amd combined are growing rapidly in the same sector.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's very accurate.,you need to port software to use arm.,arm's share is well under 5%.,"it says end of 2021 their share was ""one in twenty"" which is 5%.","so if the marketshare grew 40%, you are still at 7%, which is only 2% extra.","in contrast unlike xeons, genoa beats all.",there was a servethehome article where it said this particular arm chip offers amazing performance outperforming milan by 20%.,but genoa is 60-80% faster than milan.,"[https://www.servethehome.com/arm-based-alibaba-cloud-t-head-yitian-710-crushes-specrate2017\_int\_base/](https://www.servethehome.com/arm-based-alibaba-cloud-t-head-yitian-710-crushes-specrate2017_int_base/)

yitian 710 gets 520 in specint and dual genoa gets 1800. since single milan get 440 while dual milan gets like 840, this means single genoa gets 900+.",yitian is only 18% faster than milan while genoa is at least 70% faster than yitian and more than twice as fast as milan.,"and the author of the article claims yitian ""crushes"" milan.","switching to amd requires zero software infrastructure changes, and they have the fastest chip.",who do you think took the most?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
amd said its data-center revenue in the quarter rose 42%.,intel last week reported a 33% decline in data-center sales for the same period.,hey i used to be a intc shareholder.,but i saw the light after their ceo bk insider traded spectre and meltdown.,"i followed bk, sold all intc and bought amd and nvda.",the following years validated my thoughts on intel's incompetence.,"they couldn't find a ceo to replace the insider trader ceo and gave the job to the cfo bs, who all he did was to buy back stock with money that could have been used to fund r&d.","and now with pg, he's mainly a welfare queen living off of tens of billions of impending us taxpayer money called the chips act.",this company is going the way of the kodak.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
exactly my point.,"money or no money to burn, that is alarming.",you have to look at it with the whole year in perspective.,you can't just judge adjacent quarters relative to one another.,it is a truism that most datacenter purchases for companies occur at end of year.,"it should balloon at q4, much like christmas shopping season is prime time for retail consumer purchases.","for example, in 2021, q4 pulled in over $600 million more than q3, or 11% more revenue ($6.426 billion/$5.788 billion), or it ballooned.","by comparison, we see just under $100 million more than q3 in 2022, or 2% more revenue ($4.304 billion/$4.209 billion).","whichever way you cut it, that's one third of end-of-year customer datacenter sales simply gone year-over-year.","if they continue down this same road of year-over-year q4 performance, they will have virtually no business in 2-3 years, meaning just a quarter to a third of their current datacenter revenue (~$1 billion - $1.5 billion).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

more cores per socket also makes running more vms less annoying.,"if you have the same amount of vms on a given host the extra cores from amd make it so you have less overprovision on cpu, lowering the risk of running into a steal time issue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gotta re-read that article.,"they designed those chips around int performance because they are a cloud provider and did not submit fp performance numbers, likely because the fp performance is abysmal.","you can't compare specialized cores to generalized cores, genoa is likely dramatically faster overall.","also switching to amd does require infrastructure changes because intel also provides a lot of software and support directly, which is one of the reasons they still have dc business even with worse performing chips and sapphire rapids delayed for eternity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

have not tried it i will try and let you know with the new driver update,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you need to detail a whole heck of a lot more about your computer!,what is it?,prebuilt?,diy?,what are the other specs?,motherboard?,after that you should also probably post a full sensor screen from hwinfo64 while running a benchmark.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you're running a single stick of ram.,that will make for a decent difference in performance if your friend has 2 sticks running in dual-channel mode.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
one stick of slow ram certainly isn't helping,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you have 4 cpu cores and an mt score that is 4 times your st score.,that looks correct to me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i am certainly gonna upgrade it in a few days.,going from 1x16 2400 cl14 to 2x?,3600 cl14.,not sure on whether i need 2x8 or 2x16 as i might need more ram in a few years when i buy a new cpu+gpu.,i just dont wanna spend money for a new cpu+motherboard this year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are right but what about the minimum speeds on multithreads being waaaaayyy lower compared to other people with the same cpu?,what could cause that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would just grab 2x8.,"https://benzhaomin.github.io/bdiefinder/

this should be useful to find good kits",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it could be throttling, but since performance was normal, it is probably nothing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how are you checking for the minimum clock speeds?,cpus will generally downclock when the workload goes down.,are you watching the clock speeds directly during your benchmarking?,"the 900 mhz sounds like an idle clock, so maybe it's occurring before or after the benchmark is run.","also, are all 8 threads working?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean the avg performance is good but as you said it is probably throttling causing fps drops and stuttering.,what could cause throttling other than temperature?,i have never seen my cpu go above 70 degrees which seems weird considering it can probably take a lot more heat.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am checking the minimum speeds via hwinfo and occt(which is what i used for the benchmark).,"im sure that was not idle clock minimum as i made sure to open the hwinfo after starting the benchmark, also occt records the clock speeds only during the benchmark.",what do you mean by all 8 threads working?,i have been trying to learn more but i am still new to these stuff :d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sorry, i meant whether you have hyperthreading enabled.",the 6700k has 4 cores but 8 threads.,"therefore, i wouldn't expect 'only' a 4x multiplier between st and mt scores, more so around 6x.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

some of these comments are why i wish mainstream youtube would go back and review the a770 again.,it's been 4 months and there has been a significant improvement to the performance and stability to the card.,i love mine.,i still rock a 2080 super in my sim rig pc though.,"edit: to be clear, i understand the intel gpu is not for everyone and people will value the money they spend differently than i. 

i am just pointing out the absolute refusal to understand that things will and have improved as time passes and drivers are updated.",with that being said it isn't a horrible option for someone to purchase so long as they understand that it obviously isn't currently a flawless plug and play experience.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

they donâ€™t have a big enough market yet considering you need a 10th gen intel cpu and newer to get the full potential out of these new intel gpus.,iâ€™d bet thatâ€™s a very small share of the gaming/production pc market!,"i think it would be fun to get one to have in a spare pc to see what itâ€™s all about, but all of my builds are either ryzen or older than 10th gen intel chips.",so i myself would need to jump generations for both a cpu and motherboard in order to enjoy these new cards :/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

honestly.,i feel like mainstream youtubers have unintentionally stopped a huge portion of the market from buying an affordable powerful card with more potential because it wasn't perfect on day 1. and the longer they wait to redo a review the worse it gets for intels potential to want to make a new card in the future,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"but that wasn't the question, was it?",hugsnotdrugs wanted to know if the a770 was still plagued by higher idle power draw and the answer is yes.,"what you said was that it wasn't because it was idling at 40 watts, that is an insanely higher power draw for idling.",it is just factually wrong to say the a770 isn't still being plagued by a higher idle power draw.,it may not impact your thermals and you may not care but clearly hugsnotdrugs cares and it could in his case actually impact the thermals.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"as was previously stated by bas5eb you only really get one chance at a first impression, and if you start poorly you poison the well of public opinion which makes it less appealing to cover from the perspective of a tech reviewer as fewer and fewer people are interested in the product (and thus less likely to click on videos for it).",it's also not their jobs to directly market these cards to consumers it's to review them (and almost universally just the state they launch in).,"to be clear i'd love for intel to be a serious competitor in the market (hopefully their next release is solid out the gate), but this mess is all on them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes it on a b350 motherboard i have the option to have it enabled so i and it says it enabled in the arc control settings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i installed a r5 3600xt still getting max 50 fps,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah like i can average 60+ on my rx 470 so i was just confused on why the performance is below 40 fps most of the time.,now that i know that it was an unfinished product i wish i didnâ€™t buy it now and i could have used the 300 dollars on and actually good gpuâ€¦ i guess going off of specs isnâ€™t something i should do with intel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think zen 2 cpus are too weak for current driver overhead for the arc gpus.,"i read of another user on a ryzen 4k series apu having performance issues on cyberpunk 2077.

their driver has bottlenecks even in modern apis such as dx12 and likely even vulkan.","the golden cove cores in 12th and 13th gen are stronger than zen 3 nevermind zen 2, so low end 12th gen/13th gen/ryzen 5k/ryzen 7k is good.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whats the stick setup.,"3200 is also relatively slow for zen 2. would see a significant uplift more than likely from 3600-4000, depending on what your imc can handle.",even those speeds with crappy timings should net you a large performance increase from the if clock being much higher and arc having tons of cpu overhead,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just picked up a r5 3600xt so hopefully,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m new i thought ram only play a part in like loading speeds not fps too lol i have to much into the build as is so looks like iâ€™m giving up on the arc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3600xt is zen 2+.,you need 5000 series to get zen 3. and even zen 3 is slower than golden cove in alderlake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ram has nothing to do with loading speeds at all.,"i wouldnt give up on arc, so far lack of user knowledge is the root of your issues, not the card.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so would a ryzen 5 5600x be enough?,i canâ€™t afford the ryzen 7 5800x3d the other guy was saying to get?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well what should i do get rid of the ram i just dropped 100 on a few weeks ago and buy new stuff lol just keep dumping money until i get better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
idk i bet you i could put a 3060 in here it get it to run a lot better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think so.,the fact that it makes such a difference means the microarchitecture is what matters.,"because the single threaded performance is higher than zen 3 nevermind zen 2.

yes people seem to be fine with chips like 12100.",5600x should be more than fine.,"also since this is based on the current situation of the driver, whatever deficiency there is, it'll get better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
look into and play with overclocking the snot out of your ram.,"i would not recommend spending a significant amount of money on anything, it seems as if your system is pretty well spec'd.","like i said tuning, and then playing with your software environment, will lead to better performance and experience improvements over new parts.",(unless you were to upgrade to the 5800x3d or gpu with 3070 ti performance or greater),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks man appreciate the help i ended up getting an r5 5600x and some ddr4 3600 from 3200 and i went for a choppy 40 to 60 to 100+,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so your saying i should put a cpu that cost more the the gpu that just sounds crazy to me â€¦ like you said i thought i build something pretty good but ig not looks like i will just go back to ps5 and only use it for indi games and such,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

bios settings have nothing to do with cooling 450w.,"only the case air flow, paste and cooler position would affect that.",450w is more than most 360mm radiators can do in open air full fan speed and 10c delta over ambient.,doing that on a 280mm is certainly possible but the coolant would have to be uncomfortably hot.,especially if the radiator is in a case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i didnt say it does, but thats not strictly true you have to setup the fan curve in the bios properly, oh wait nobody know's how to do that these days and uses an external box thats software controled

and i didnt say its coolable at 454w i said thats the limit of my cooling 
i wouldnt like to keep it bouncing 2 cores off tj max at 454w for more than a few mins

i was infact talking about setting up the cpu properly or close to to intel spec
and not just whacking in random voltages and load line values (llc) and expecting to not have bad transients and such but yes in general cooling 454w isnt much to do with the bios


good job",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"no shit sherlock
thats half of the problem though

alot of people here have no idea and have a corsair control box and such running the fans / aio at 600rpm and wonder why they can only cool 200w

my fans run at 100% when the thermistor under the cpu hits 45â°c
which is about 55â°c die temp this allows plenty of time for ramp delays

and also results in a silent pc for daily use

yes it does.,"some motherboards try to seem faster by unlocking the turbo boost duration of pl1 and pl2 of cpus for a longer or even unlimited time with bios defaults, others strictly respect intel's recommended limits.",then there are also power limits to be taken into account.,"some respect intel's limits, others enhance them, others even completely remove them!!",but the worst case scenario should be the intel limits to be respected by your mother board.,which is actually good if you care about longevity.,"so you will definitely get the performance intel advertized, no matter which motherboard you'll get, while some give you higher performance but higher temperatures and also insane power draw.","if i'm wrong, anyone could correct me but this is what i gathered over the years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">so you will definitely get the performance intel advertized, no matter which motherboard you'll get

if i can have something close to max turbo speed without any limitation, provided there is good cooling, then i am fine

watching the video again, if i understand correctly out of the box, you get different clock speeds with different motherboards but once you remove the power limit all motherboards provide the advertised max speed stably.","however he later does a similar test with i7 10700 but clock speed is way less than what is advertised as max because of ""vrm thermal throttling"" on the low end b560m mobo

so if i don't upgrade i will probably be fine",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
low end boards with cheaper vrm and no heatsinks may have less ability to sustain max turbo under heavy load.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah if the vrm is crappy, then it will give you issues with the limits lifted.","your mobo has no heatsinks for the vrm fitted, but a 10 virtual phase setup.",mhhhm.,it depends on the cpu.,i think you will be fine up to an i7.,i9 might give you issues with limits lifted.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so even if i cool the cpu really well there is a chance turbo can't be sustained?,i guess only way to find out if it can sustain turbo without purchasing is if somebody has done an experiment with exact model cpu+mobo?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah you can overheat the vrms too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as far as i have seen, the z790 boards have higher oc potential than the z690.",that being said i went for a z690 gaming f from asus seeing as my ddr5 runs at 6400 which is where the z690 seems to cap out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yes, you will be able to push it just about as far as a z790 board.",the perf difference will be small.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the imc on the 13900k is more important vs the 12900k.,"it is much better, so even on z690 you should see better ram speed and stability.",the chipset itself doesn't really matter.,but it also depends on if you got decent ram to begin with.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i pushed my stock x2 ddr5-4800mhz (32gbs) to 5600mhz on my asus rog strix-f within a few weeks of owning it.,tweaked 4800mhz timings performs pretty well though from my testing in certain workloads with no complaints.,i 'm planning on switching to the msi mpg z690 carbon mb soon to hold me over until the 14th gen (planning on skipping 13th gen\\raptor lake at the moment).,"hopefully msi allows me to reach ddr5-5600mhz, but i'll settle for 5400mhz.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don't mean to hijack but has there been any talks of 13th gen imc improvements carrying over to ddr4?,not sure if my 12700k is a dud but it won't post using anything over 3733 cl16 with 4 dimms installed.,tempted to try my luck with rpl if it handles ddr4 any better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that sounds about right.,it's the memory controllers on the z690 boards that struggle.,the maximum memory speeds that the z690 boards can handle is around the mid 6000s.,"but remember, for the ram's overall system latency (in nanoseconds, iirc) on intel builds, the equation is:

(1/ram speed in mhz)*cas latency.","so, for example, in my z690 carbon wifi, my ram is 6400mhz at cl30.","so, (1/6400)*30 = 0.0046875.  most of the higher speed sticks that are being sold right now (in the upper 7000mhz range) have a higher number than what i'm getting with my 6400mhz sticks.","so, we're still really good with the intel 12 gen z690 boards ddr5 support =d.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i actually ordered the rog strix-f myself, and the newer 6400 ddr5 from g skill.","i saw on their siste that they are officially supported, so here's hoping it runs like it should!","that being said im going from 8700k to 13700k as well, so the upgrade makes a bit more sense for me",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"probably check out the various overclocking forums for user experiences, that's what i'm doing before pulling the trigger on a ddr4 z790 board.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i doubt it.,it doesn't make any sense for intel to build a better ddr4 controller than what 11th gen had because everyone seeking maximum performance will opt for ddr5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i really want to play around with some good z790 and hynix a-die but i think its to expensive maybe for minimal gain i managed to get around 50ns in aida64 with 6800cl32 .,did u try round trip latency enabled in bios it will give you nice little boost in score some say it can become unstable but i had no such a problem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ah makes sense if you need 64gb, i can agree!","when it comes to the 4090, just turn down power limit from 100% to like 80%.",you barely lose any performance and save a ton on wattage.,"that being said, its still stupid expensive, especially here in norway",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it runs great.,everything is 100% stable.,i did a slight oc on my p cores by setting them all to 5.4 (not just the first 2) and the undervolted with an offset.,"and the ram is 6400 ofcourse, have not tried pushing that higher though, should probably work but i dont see the need.",r23 score was ~31k.,"i also used a contact frame by thermal grizzly, not sure how much i gained there seeing as i never tested with the stock bracket.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6-8% average load is very high.,you see the cpu has 24 cores and 32 threads.,this means 2 to 3 cores are constantly under close to 100% load.,check if windows is processing updates or if a virus scanner is running a routine scan.,bloatware is software that usually gets installed alongside other tools you install without you noticing.,or rgb control software also can cause high cpu usage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have new evo laptop but there doesn't appear to be a list of supported pcs that i can find.,"that first page you posted states:  ""the intel unison pc app is available on the microsoft store.""",but it doesn't appear in the microsoft store when i search for it.,"that last page has been there with a ""coming soon"" message for a couple of months now.",it doesn't look like any information has been updated since the original announcement.,i wish the concept of unison wasn't so puzzlingly opaque.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
agreed 100%.,it's been a frustrating experience with unison.,i gave up.,i might go the macos mode.,i've used vmware but only for windows installs.,are you running macos on your pc (presumably a version of the os that supports intel cpus)?,did you have to buy/license macos to do that?,any tips on how you setting that up to make it a seamless experience?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
agreed.,"paired with my iphone, it hasn't been a reliable or enjoyable experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you have issues pairing the devices?,"i was able to install it to a non-evo laptop, but i canâ€™t get them to pair properly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

did you ever figure this out?,"i got it to """"pair"""" but literally anything requires bluetooth to work and that's the part that doesn't work",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i sort of have it working with an evo laptop.,when i first tried to connect my iphone to my laptop a few weeks ago it kept hanging.,i just had a chance now to try again.,"i paired the phone and pc using the usual os bluetooth pairing but then the unison apps on the phone shows ""oops... something went wrong"" and the pc app shows ""connecting your phone"".","if i click ""skip"" on the pc app it shows the phone is connected, shows the phone battery level, syncs the phone contacts, and displays the media on the phone.",i was able to send an sms from the pc but incoming messages don't appear on the pc.,the pc app shows a yellow exclamation mark intermittently.,presumably that's a connection issue but it's not clear.,"so far it's frustrating and half-baked, much like dell mobile connect was in the past.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i was hoping that someone here would know more, but i guess we'll just have to keep (impatiently) waiting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
now a few minutes later i'm also receiving incoming messages from some senders but not from others.,i've also noticed an annoying lag when you type messages on the pc app.,it doesn't appear that you can send reactions (e.g.,a thumbs up) to messages.,hopefully these issues are ironed out soon.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
getting same exact thing here.,"qr code pairing steps seem to work, was able to transfer a file but when trying to sms or anything else it asks to pair and hangs.",iphone app had all permissions.,rebooted everything.,tried 100 times.,cant find logs in event viewer.,wish this would actually work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i pretty much have an ipad pro with magic keyboard just for answering sms/imessages.,i'll be happy the day that i can do that on my pc because i don't have the patience to answer longer messages using my iphone.,dell mobile connect was half baked and i don't believe there's currently any other workable alternative available so i have high hopes for unison.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the xmp has those 2 profiles by default but whatever changes you do to them (well actually the settings in the bios) you save themin the asus profile in the boot section, not in the xmp profiles.",those are read only profiles that come with the xmp.,the ones that you save your changes to would be inthe boot section under asus profiles.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes it does.,"some motherboards try to seem faster by unlocking the turbo boost duration of pl1 and pl2 of cpus for a longer or even unlimited time with bios defaults, others strictly respect intel's recommended limits.",then there are also power limits to be taken into account.,"some respect intel's limits, others enhance them, others even completely remove them!!",but the worst case scenario should be the intel limits to be respected by your mother board.,which is actually good if you care about longevity.,"so you will definitely get the performance intel advertized, no matter which motherboard you'll get, while some give you higher performance but higher temperatures and also insane power draw.","if i'm wrong, anyone could correct me but this is what i gathered over the years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">so you will definitely get the performance intel advertized, no matter which motherboard you'll get

if i can have something close to max turbo speed without any limitation, provided there is good cooling, then i am fine

watching the video again, if i understand correctly out of the box, you get different clock speeds with different motherboards but once you remove the power limit all motherboards provide the advertised max speed stably.","however he later does a similar test with i7 10700 but clock speed is way less than what is advertised as max because of ""vrm thermal throttling"" on the low end b560m mobo

so if i don't upgrade i will probably be fine",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
low end boards with cheaper vrm and no heatsinks may have less ability to sustain max turbo under heavy load.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah if the vrm is crappy, then it will give you issues with the limits lifted.","your mobo has no heatsinks for the vrm fitted, but a 10 virtual phase setup.",mhhhm.,it depends on the cpu.,i think you will be fine up to an i7.,i9 might give you issues with limits lifted.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so even if i cool the cpu really well there is a chance turbo can't be sustained?,i guess only way to find out if it can sustain turbo without purchasing is if somebody has done an experiment with exact model cpu+mobo?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah you can overheat the vrms too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is the new msrp.,"the a750 was already competitive with the (terrible) rtx 3060 at its launch performance and price, but now with the driver updates, it genuinely rivals the discounted rx 6600 series in value.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

for  buttery smooth 1080p   with ultra settings gaming with new drivers at $250 is not bad is what i'm hearing but until the drivers are released and tested i'd  wait to buy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's a great price.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that's the new msrp for the a750 as two others have already said.,"the lowered msrp along with the updated drivers and better hardware encoding than amd's 6600/xt/6650 xt start making it pretty appealing, if they continue to improve drivers (which seems very likely), i could see it being very good in the long run.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's not a very good choice for 1080p because you're not taking advantage of the high fill rate and get cockblocked by drivers.,1440p/4k has better returns on arc than 1080p.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s great for 1440p gaming also!,for the majority of the games i play i have little to no issues using the latest drivers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that's good.,for now it would be used on a 1080p 144hz monitor.,might upgrade to 1440p later.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

launch.,i haven't seen many updates of it recently.,i just heard and saw that a lunch card was lucky to run a dozen or so aaa games at unplayable framerates,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it should be slower than the 3060 ti.,"the a770, however, is ideally almost a 3070 and probably on par with a 3060 ti.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you can run arc on older platforms just fine.,but for consistent performance you need rebar to be enabled on your motherboard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"that's cool and all, but it's good now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is greatly exaggerating the problems at launch.,the a750 could run a lot of aaa games at playable frame rates at launch.,most of the problems were with older games but most were still playable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> launch.,i haven't seen many updates of it recently.,"i just heard and saw that a lunch card was lucky to run a dozen or so aaa games at unplayable framerates

you're clearly not paying attention then.","the latest ""game ready"" drivers offer a significant performance increase verse the drivers available at launch.","in addition to the performance boost, the card is now being sold at a reduced price.","the a750 is now crushing nvidia's rtx 3060 in the ""price vs performance"" category.","https://youtu.be/ecfv17wrjfs

as it stands, this is a fantastic recommendation for budget gamers.","once they fix/remove their arc overlay shit, it will be a complete no-brainer recommendation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can confirm.,have an a770 in one of my rigs and it outperforms the 3070 is another machine on a few different games.,it's very very close most of the time.,"definitely a great deal for the price, the drivers have only gotten better and better!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah, it's great value now.",only $350 on newegg for intel's card.,there's an 8gb model for $320 by asrock as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
another option would be a used 3060 ti.,it's not that much slower than a 3070. i recently got one for 275. in the us it should be even cheaper.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just be careful with used.,the 3070 was a popular mining card.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mining cards have less wear and tear and were better maintained than your average gaming card.,only concern would be fan bearings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've always preferred new cards in my build as well as my clients builds.,yes you pay more but you have warranty protection and far better long term life of the card.,"also, you don't know how the particular miner treated the card, what humidity and temp levels were in the farm, etc.",way too many variables to take a chance in my book.,but that's just me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i hope so.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how do you get paste on the back of a cpu?,are you 12?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why don't you just clean it off with a q-tip dipped in rubbing alcohol?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as long as the thermal paste isn't conductive it doesn't make a difference if it got on the back, you can use a soft bristle toothbrush and some alcohol to get it all off if it bothers you.",even if it is conductive tim as long as you clean it off and make sure it isn't bridging any connections before placing it back into a board and powering it up you're still fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is good that you are honest and the downvotes do not really make sense here.,"of course you should not be getting thermal paste on the back of the cpu, but still... anyhow for future reference check some guides: you both apply and remove thermal paste while the cpu is in the socket so the paste does not spread anywhere.","you also do not apply a lot of the paste: ""one pea size"" is the general rule of thumb.","normal thermal paste is also non-conductive so unless you go for the liquid metal ones, you cannot really break anything with it.",you can still spoil contacts though if you let the paste spread to the socket itself (the socket should always be protected by the cpu).,"anyhow, for now you are good.",all is fine.,when cleaning up stuff: be careful though.,that is the moment when you can actually break something.,the pins on the socket are very small.,lga 1700 means that there are 1700 contacts on that small area.,"if the socket looks anyhow good, do not go messing around there while cleaning.",just clean the cpu gently with q-tips (as was suggested by others) and rubbing alcohol.,be careful to not apply force: roll the q-tip instead of dragging it there.,"it does not need to be fully clean, though.","looking at that cpu, it would not take more than a few seconds  to clean it for me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gotta have good thermal contact between the cpu and the socket,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

afaik it's best to go for a custom loop when you want to go with direct die cooling.,i only know of the ek velocity water block which is compatible - but i am not sure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is what you would need for a 10900k: [https://rockitcool.myshopify.com/products/10th-gen-direct-to-die-frame](https://rockitcool.myshopify.com/products/10th-gen-direct-to-die-frame)you probably would need a compatible waterblock and would have to do a custom loop.,i wouldn't bother personally since the 10900k is so old.,you'd be basically just as well off applying some protectant to the outer caps and then using liquid metal and re-adding the heat spreader.,then just install the cpu like normal and use your old cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there was [one](https://youtube.com/watch?v=n4o_dq3xrja&si=ensikaiecmiomare) reviewed on a linus tech tips episode a few years ago.,i don't mind lapping heat spreaders but that's a bit beyond my comfort zone.,if your kraken x61 is an aio (i don't know what that is) i would suggest you'll get much more effective cooling by swapping to a custom loop with a large radiator and a d5 pump.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
direct die is standard.,it is a standard thing in most laptops.,"when they do a direct die, the laptop screws are (1) tiny, (2) they use 3 instead of 4 mostly, and (3) they reduce the torque by having the screws spaced far apart and connected via a thin metal.",this way it transfers very little downward force.,they used to use springs under the screws too.,never had issue with that.,but they've replaced springs with much simpler thin metal spaced apart.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because silicon is very fragile and even with full proof mounting designs people will manage to break the die and blame everyone but themselves.,just not worth it for 99% of diy consumers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it was the standard decades ago.,my pentium 3 has no ihs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they tried it in the 90s and many chipped corners later the heatspreader became the standard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you like chipping your die?,because this was a great way to do it back in the day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it is when it comes to unique water cooling parts that were low volume even when the parts were new,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well i guess what i'm saying is that there's no point in spending so much time and effort on doing something like this when you aren't going to get performance close to modern stuff.,unless you are just doing it for fun.,i mean a delid tool and direct die frame combined are going to be north of $100 and you are going to get very little in return.,if you are doing it to the latest and greatest maybe it makes more sense but not for something that's 3 generations old.,so it's old for this application.,it's not that old in general i guess.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm torn on it.,"on the one hand, selling the cpu and getting a new 13th gen one costs probably the same as a new cooling solution and will bring the same if not more performance for the money.","at the same time, delidding a 3year old cpu is a lot more safe than a brand new one.","if you do it because you're interested, i would even advise you to not use the latest and greatest that you bought with your own money.",i'm just surprised that op delidded his cpu without doing proper research about what to do next.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

here you go op.",10900k is still a rockstar\* sure it isn't as sexy as the latest and greatest.,but don't let the marketing fool you.,3 year old cpu it is a rock star.,i have just the 10700k and i often think about the 10900k as a last upgrade.,165 fps down to 159 fps on average and uhhhh yeah no one will even notice it.,i think the cpu wars are overblown and over inflated to just 1 metric.,cinebench r20/r23 and the kids just get all flustered over that.,like they don't even use all their cores on the daily.,it is likely wasted silicon just idling for most of the day.,my theory is that people just want to make money by doing nothing.,and which is why bitcoin mining and to a lesser degree cpu mining is a thing.,they just want to turn their computers on.,"have them run technically a ""benchmark"" and have it make money.",heck that is why we overclockers overclock!,number go up.,right?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can do that with just a standard relid.,especially 5 ghz that's easy on a 10900k.,the only real difference is you'll lose like 5-7 degrees over a relid.,don't get me wrong direct die cooling is really fun i've done it.,but you won't get much out of it sadly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
honest question.,why do direct die cooling if you got an aio?,i feel like you're putting 40k of mods on a honda cr-v,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the introduction cost is expensive but the fittings and rads will last for a very long time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're going to spend so much money on this project that you could just buy a 12700 k and a new motherboard and get better performance.,i hope you like tinkering for the sake of tinkering.,i've seriously debated getting into building a custom loop but i just can't justify the cost relative to the pragmatic real world results.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

dellidding the 9900k and 10900k is really easy with the delid tool.,the soldered on ihs feels more like glue then solder.,but iâ€™m not sure what the new cpuâ€™s are like for dellidding.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol i have a 12900k and it is normal under 50-70% load on all cores.,often 90-100% on all cores.,what are you talking about?,actually many programms using more cores.,not only r20/r23 uses it.,mining is dead.. my theory is people like you only use 1% off that what is possible with technic...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
usually 4 to 6 cores seems like enough.,donâ€™t see the point in these cpuâ€™s with insane core counts like the xeon and threadripper.,"but still would love to  build a xeon/threadripper/epyc machine someday, if i can get the money for such a build.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you tried it with the direct die water pumps?,"and then there is also die lapping, which seems extreme.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would prefer an aio but cannot find ones compatible with direct die compatibility.,so it looks like iâ€™ll just have to build one.,i want to overclock my cpu to 5ghz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes it does have 2 extra cores and costs around the same amount.,but doesnâ€™t that run at 3.7ghz?,iâ€™d probably end up in a similar situation like this trying to overclock it whilst keeping the temps cool.,or just spending the extra on the 12900k.,"but to be honest for my next build i want a xeon, epyc or a threadripper.","a cpu with insane core count, would be nice to own someday as a be done with it kind of build.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™m going to overclock my cpu to 5ghz perhaps even 5.3ghz, so will have to delid it with a proper cooler.","i found the ncorev1 water pump, so iâ€™ll be using that.",thanks for the reply will check out that post.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hang around vr subreddits for a week or so and you'll see it.,"""oh no guys i smashed my controllers into my desk and it's broken!","what can i do???""",followed by a zillion replies recommending to contact the manufacturer and ask for a warranty defect replacement.,it's disgusting.,i used that as an example of how people through their own actions destroy something and then shirk responsibility of the consequences off to the manufacturer to waste resources fixing it.,in the case of cpus i agree with u/prince_melon that if we had bare die products tons of people would break them from reckless installations and then scam the system to get replacements for free.,"same concept, just a different application.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,but a delid and direct die kit are not worth the money.,like at all.,unless you are doing it because you like to tinker.,that's all i'm really saying.,you might drop like 10c at most or gain 100-200mhz.,"again, only makes sense if you like to tinker.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is good you use your cpu.,i am talking about generality.,i mean today the cpus we have available (these past 2 years pretty much) now all have the power of supercomputers and 52 core cpus of the past.,all within these past 2 years.,i don't think the pace of consumer level software (what i was getting at) has reached the point of everyone needing all this compute.,"if you fully utilize your cpu in your workload, that is awesome.",i don't.,"i just model, work on e-mail, pdfs, excel, and web browse.",ocassional phone use.,but nothing that needs 25 to 52 core level of past xeon/threadripper levels of performance.,amd doesn't even have a new threadripper line of cpus coming because the current consumer line has basically overlapped with that workstation class chip.,now all cpus are workstation class.,which is a good thing.,but doesn't mean everyone needs a workstation class cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i fully agree.,it is the sex sells marketing or car salesmen tactic.,"everybody would love a v8 400hp engine, but not many people can fully utilize it.",but you'll always get that one guy that can say that his diesel truck with a v8 and 500 lb-ft of torque is able to haul his 15 foot fishing boat every weekend and he makes full use of it.,while you'll have another guy drive his pristine with a fully covered truck bed never hauled a thing in its' life ford raptor.,truth be told i'll probably get a meteor lake i5 when it launches =d can't wait for something faster than 14nm.,but i know i'll still cap my fps at 60 to keep the gpu from being too loud.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was using a 280mm kraken x62.,with a custom loop the gains would probably be even less since cooling with ambient air becomes less and less effective the lower the temps.,would absolutely not recommend die lapping because if you go too far your chip is toast.,that's only really going to help you with ln2 cooling anyway.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i understand the goal.,i am of the mindset that aio is on par with a solid air cooler.,"if you're trying to overclock hard with direct die cooling, in my mind, you shouldn't even consider an aio",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you might as well buy a 13700k if you are going to go with a 12900k since they are the same price, and you can use a 13700k in a z690 motherboard with a bios update (get a mobo with usb flashback and you can update it from usb without a cpu.)","same cpu, slightly better with more l2 cache.",not much real world difference.,11gen had about a 20% ipc uplift and 12th gen had another 20% which means that at the same clock speeds a 12th gen or 13th gen is about 45% better performance than a 10th gen part.,a 10900 has 10 cores compared to a 12700 that has 8 pcores which are like the previous gen but 4 e cores which are slower and more energy efficient.,the net result however is still a dramatically faster cpu in both gaming and raw benchmarks.,a 10900 in cinebench will pull around 16k compared to the 22k+ even at stock that a 12700 will pull.,"by default the k cpus in 12th and 13th gen always run at their max boost clock with pl1 and pl2 set to max boost power as defined in the intel arc spec, and tau (boost duration) as infinite.","a 12700k will run at 4.7ghz boost as long as it stays within the power and temperatures limits (and you can raise the power limits on the motherboard if it is throttling down to like 4.5, which will of course raise the temps.)",definitely doable on air without an overclock with a contact frame.,a 12700 is actually easier to keep cool than a 10900 as the 10900 can easily pull 250+ watts especially overclocked; a 12700 can be kept cool with the best air towers like a nh-d15s.,12900k / 13700k / 13900k or overclocking should be done on 360mm / 420mm aio or better with a contact frame (contact frame lowers temps by 10c or so on 12th gen as the ilm bends the cpu creating uneven mounting pressure.,"costs like $25) 

if you do decide to go with a custom liquid loop at least a lot of the parts can be reused for when you upgrade.","the reservoir, tubes, fittings, radiator, and pump should all be able to be used again within their shelf life.",it's just the cost of the block you are going to be out.,"it's maybe worth pursuing even staying on your current platform if you want to stay with custom water cooling going forward, but it's a big commitment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i see.,"i don't think they are shirking responsibility as much as, they don't want to pay to fix it even though it is their fault.","i mean, you even see adults steal shit, and even tell and teach their kids that.","this only gets worse as more and more poor uneducated people is produced, because that's what our society has been steered for decades.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i also wanted to get everybody's butt out of the sand about cinebench scores and all those super inflated scores.",it is like just more marketing to make you seem like you are using an out of date product.,similar to what we see in the car market.,the salesmen/marketers just keep adding additional extra unnecessary options to inflate the cost of the vehicles.,just as an example (not to start a flame war) but tesla's model series vehicles.,some of them come equipped with twitch.tv or youtube or netflix in those vehicles!,and it's like i don't even like driving that much to begin with !,but it adds to the costs and complexity.,"my 2016/2017 hybrid works just fine to get me from point a to point b.

yes i looked onto it.,itâ€™s mostly done on the 9900k since it has a thick die.,where as the 10900k has a thinner die.,"since i found a direct die water block, i should be good with the rest of the build.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i canâ€™t really be bothered at the moment, iâ€™m not an editor or a renderer, just a gamer.","iâ€™d rather wait to see whatâ€™s in line in the future meteor lake, lunar lake.",a cpu that can truly utilise the power of the newest graphics cards like the rtx 4090. which seems to be bottlenecking even the newest of cpuâ€™s.,i will stick to this build with a 3090. plus iâ€™m more inclined to spend more when going over to an expandable motherboard since they support ddr5 ram aswell as support for 13th gen cpuâ€™s like the 13900k.,"i have a habit of maxing out motherboards, water cooling can also cost more due to multiple kits to purchase when delidding/watercooling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

for sure.,i delidded a 7960x and cooled it direct die style with an aio for a while.,it was pretty fun but yet it made no difference really lol.,i kind of want to direct die cool one of the new 7000 series processors cause i have an am5 board now but i don't think there are any frames yet :(,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

are we talking about the drive on which your os resides?,or just a disk containing data?,or just some data off a disk?,if it is the former i usually use a tool to clone the drive to the new one.,"most ssd manufacturers provide such a tool, i've had good experiences in the past with samsungs tools for this job.",if this is just a data drive you can plug it in and that is it.,"i keep most my data on seperate drives, so i just swap them over and assign them the correct drive letter and i'm good.",if this is some data of a disk you can either plug it in to the new machine and copy the data (i'd advise using a tool like `robocopy` on windows or `rsync` on linux to make sure the files are good when you finish copying them.,otherwise move them through a removeable drive to the new machine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yup.,normal.,try upping your fancurve a bit.,i used to get 90c package temp with peaks of 95-97c but after upping the curve i get 85 package temp.,but max peaks still will hit 90-93c on the hotter cores.,the cpu will not throttle until 100c unless your motherboard specifies 90c limit.,this is with stock 253 limit by the way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
check out the sensors in hwinfo to see what's throttling your cpu.,you should get 5.3 ghz and 4.1 ghz on your p and e cores respectively.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"5.1ghz is likely the all-core boost, that's not throttling.","if you think it's too hot, maybe consider contact frame?","thermalright has a pretty cheap one for $13 while thermal grizzly has a more accurate one for $45, but iirc gamers nexus didn't find much of a difference between the two.","but if it's only during cinebench and you aren't always maxing out the cores, then you're probably fine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it may also throttle because of your vrm.,pay attention to mosfet temps in hwinfo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you could have a poor mount.,or try putting the z73 fan header into the aio_pump header on the board instead of the cpu fan header.,iâ€™ve seen certain boards not supply the same voltage between the headers.,your pump speeds should be over 2000rpm under load-check that in cam.,with all aioâ€™s i would recommend wiping off the stock thermal paste and using your own on the cpu.,my x63 with a 13700k doesnâ€™t ever go beyond 90c package temp and my cpu will boost to 5300mhz.,what is your cb r23 score?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"edit, if you are getting p cores that are throttling, then that's not good.","you didn't give us a very good screenshot with your stats, so it's hard to tell what's going on.","90â° is fine, but if it's throttling p3, p5 and p7 to stay there then you either need to try to repaste the aio pump or set power limits.",your all core turbo boost multiplier is lower than even stock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it depends, how long it takes to throttle.",if its like instant then yes itâ€™s a problem.,i had exact similar issue and had to put contact frame to resolve it.,"it was throttling as soon as i was clicking start, now it throttles on 3 or 4th run.",i was getting score of 28k on 13900k but everyone else was hitting 40k so i kinda knew it is a problem.,"as soon as i installed contact frame and extreme grease from thermal grizzly, all issues were gone.",i got the score that everyone else were getting while temps were great.,definitely compare your score with others to understand how well it is performing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"90-91 is fine, i usually get 90 on cpu, 110 for package while pressuring it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
get thermalright contact frame!,makes a huge differenceâ€”probably only half of your heatsink is making contact,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have the same configuration.,the cpu temp in the second i start cinebench jump to 100 and trigger the thermal throttle.,maybe the aio is bedly mounted?,as additional info in gaming the temperature never exceed the 85 c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
may want to check your power limits in your bios.,running a z690 mpg edge and it was running unlimited wattage giving me some similar temps with a tg contact frame and mx6 paste on a 360 aio.,dropped it down the limit to 253w and i stay under 80c in game.,cinebench peaks briefly at 87 on startup but as soon as my fans catch-up temps stay under 80 on a multicore load.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

does the high temperatures of 95 plus degrees reduce the life of the cpu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would there be a specific alert?,iâ€™m new to hwinfo64,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no 13700kf is 5.3ghz all-core boost on p-cores.,he's thermal throttling if it's dropping down to 5.1ghz.,very common you might have mce on or some other motherboard feature that is aggressively overvolting the cpu causing much higher power draw.,i turned that off on my asus board and my 13700k no longer hits \~260w under cinebench.,it's more like 190w now and no longer throttles.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, raptor lake's turbo boost is different from previous generations.","single core and all core boost now share the same frequency, minus the ""best cores"", tvb so the all core turbo should be 5.3 ghz for p cores and 4.2 ghz for e cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for the insight!,iâ€™m using one currently from thermal grizzly!,only during cinebench,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,degradation doesnâ€™t start until 115c.,the cpu throttles at 100c to make sure that doesnâ€™t happen.,if this was 3-5 years ago then it would be a different story but these cpus are able to handle high voltage and high temps without reducing life.,and laptop cpus have been running high temps 90-100c for at least 10 or so years.,amd and intel made it so the cpu will boost until 95c for amd and 100c for intel.,anyone that says high temps are dangerous are living in the past and is wrong.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hyperthreading ist pretty much useless with high core count cpus anyway.,"hyperthreading in itself doesn't add any execution engine related stuff, it's just an easy way of increasing the load on the existing execution engine.",it achieves an overall better throughput at the expense of single thread execution times.,depending on workloads sometimes disabling hyper threading can give you even better performance.,in gaming will typically see slightly higher or identical fps with ht enabled but 0.1% and 0.01% lows are typically worse.,but todays cpus are so fast that it doesn't really matter anyways.,personally i have it disabled because i don't have anything that really benefits from ht being enabled and some applications that see slightly better performance without ht.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"why do you bother about power draw, exactly?","and yes, games still fare better with ht enabled than the minuscule clock gain, given you can maintain the clock stable anyway, as ht turned off doesn't change your stability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"-.15v undervolt and disabling e-cores and ht drops my max power draw from 250w to 100w, with no change in dcs vr frame rate.","however it does slow down other workflows like astro photography stacking, so iâ€™ve left them enabled (and dcs doesnâ€™t come close to using 250w, that only happens in cinebench)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the entire point is that a hyperthread takes advantage of inefficiency in the pipeline.,"if there's no inefficiency, it won't get scheduled for tasks.","if there is idle time on the main thread, it gives you access to those previously unusued cpu cycles.",no reason to disable ht.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

second, i'd review this video regarding intel thermals and mainboard settings... along with touching on cooler selection: https://youtu.be/dnfgswztvyc",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the performance is slim to none.,only get the 13900k if you need more threads,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12900k ddr5 mobo combo is at mc rn...$440.,that's unrivaled performance for the money tbh.,my 12900k is pushing 29.5k cinebench with adequate cooling and a few tweaks.,it's like shooting a chipmunk with a howitzer for gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if it's a pc purely for gaming, then neither the 13700k nor 13900k makes any sense at this point:

in terms of overclocking, almost all 13th gen k cpus should be able to hit 5.6 ghz like the 13900ks if your cooling allows it.","a particularly strong chip with particularly strong cooling should be able to hit 5.9 ghz, and 6.0 ghz in some more limited scenarios.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ðÿ‘œ

will say, you go for the 13900k you'll want to get a contact frame and a 420mm aio.","you get a bit better thermal capacity even if you will eventually saturate it anyways

with both and tg extreme mine still peaks about 85c gaming and 93c with workloads (stock)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so the 13900k actually reaches 5.4ghz-5.5ghz without overclocking?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not for long as new big games are now asking for 8 cores,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gonna piggyback of your comment since i am also deciding between 13700k and 13900k...why is that contact frame thing important?,and is there anything else that needs to be considered when using them?,like does the mobo or cpu cooler matter at all  (new rig will have a strix z690-e mobo if that is something relevant) i haven't heard of them before looking through this thread,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are forgetting the extra cache that comes with the 13700k along with the 2 extra p-cores.,"[https://youtu.be/r4zdhbuei9e](https://youtu.be/r4zdhbuei9e)

pay attention to those yellow bars, as he's comparing a 13900k running just 6 cores / 36 mb cache vs the 13700k / 30mb cache and 13600k / 24 mb cache.",it pretty clearly illustrates that the 13600k is cache starved vs the 13700k in numerous modern titles even at 1440p.,"[https://youtu.be/r4zdhbuei9e?t=384](https://youtu.be/r4zdhbuei9e?t=384)

given the $80 difference in price from the 13600k it's not a huge cost increase and you do pick up some nice productivity performance gains in addition to the potentially better gaming performance thanks to the increase in cache.","the 13600k is in a weird spot if you live near a micro center as the 12700k paired with the asus z690 ddr5 mainboard is $70 bundled, plus a 32 gb kit of pc6000 ddr5 ram lands right around $500.","this combo is faster than the 13600k at average 1440p game performance paired with ddr4, and only around 10 fps average behind the 13600k with ddr5 ram.",[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7-2ardyvfa&t=491s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7-2ardyvfa&t=491s)  they also have very similar productivity scores.,if you figure the cost of the 13600k ($250) with a prime-a or tuf z690 board without the promo ($260-20)and 32 gb of ddr5 ram ($150) you're spending $650.,"at that price the cheaper $600 ryzen 7 - 7900x, 32 gb of ddr5/6000 and asus strix b650e mainboard combo is a far better value with huge uplifts in productivity and a nice chunk of gaming fps in averaged 1440p tests.",[https://youtu.be/i7-2ardyvfa?t=822](https://youtu.be/i7-2ardyvfa?t=822),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

true.,"contact frame is a good option, even must in many cases, but i'd say first he should try to run it without, cause not all ihs are bending that much.","for example my 13700k performs perfectly fine with the stock frame, while some other are instantly throttling at 100c.","i have ordered tg contact frame, but after seeing other people temps i realised that i don't really need it, so i returned it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, easily.","also it boosts couple cores to 5.8ghz in single core workloads, like gaming.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, it will hold 5.5ghz across the cores unless you're thermal throttling",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they *donâ€™t*.,"new games ask for a certain level of *multicore performance*, not *cores*, and the 13600k succeeds on both metrics (and yes, the eight e-cores count).","moreover, new games actually donâ€™t need extra cores at all, it turns out they just need a ton of cache.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the contact frame is insurance against a known issue with deflection of the cpu's ihs due to the design of the mounting bracket on all socket 1700 motherboards.,it can improve temperatures by improving contact between the cooling solution and the top of the cpu by providing a flatter contact surface as well as potentially improve memory compatibility and timings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"he's testing overclocked memory, but leaving out all the details about the test setup.","aida64 latency and bandwidth numbers have no correlation with gaming performance, a far better idea would be a screenshot of asrock timing configurator and an uploaded cpu-z validation.","the testing methodology is also flawed, as there's absolutely no scenario where a 13700k should beat a 13900k, yet his results show that.","this indicates an inconsistent test, which could be fixed through more thorough testing in every game

performance drops when the cpu starts using e cores because they are not as strong as the p cores.,so it would be better to have had 8 performance cores.,people have disabled the e cores & overclocked the p cores & get better performance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh interesting, had no idea that was something that existed.",will be ordering one along with the cpu then.,appreciate you!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how does overclocked memory that's used consistently with all of the cpu's tested an issue?,"some of his tests did ""gimp"" the 13900k down to 6 cores specifically to illustrate the impact of cores vs cache, but that was called out in the results specifically to illustrate how badly the 13600k's smaller cache size was impacting game performance.",other benchmarks showed similar performance between the 13700k and 13900k and were called out as being within the normal margin of error which was not the case with the 13600k tests where there was in some cases 50fps differences in minimum fps between cpu's in the same title.,"the 13600k is a good ""right now"" value cpu but it's absolutely not as futureproof as a 13700k/13900k particularly given raptor lake is the last generation processor for the socket 1700 boards.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6 performance cores & 8 efficiency cores.,the e cores are not as strong as the p cores.,iâ€™ve seen benchmarks where the performance drops once the cpu starts using the e cores.,so it would it would be better to have 8 performance cores,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thatâ€™s not because the e-cores are weak, itâ€™s because the game is only dipping into the p-cores - and quite frankly, cpus become obsolete for gaming because of inferior single-core performance *long* before they become obsolete because of inferior multicore.",the 5800x3d and 7600x absolutely slaughtering the 5950x in gaming in this review is an illustration of why â€œfuture-proofingâ€ your multicore for gaming is something no one should ever seriously consider in the age of double-digit core counts: https://youtu.be/qjrkwrtmu64,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if the testing methodology is so inconsistent that a 13900k is running slower than a 13700k at clock speed parity, what's to say that the 1% lows he's getting on the 13600k isn't a result of shader compilation, background processes, or simply misconfiguration?","the memory speed is different, and we don't know anything about the timings which actually affect performance: rcd, ras, rrd, refi, and tertiary subtimings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if the application needs more cores then the performance will drop compared to if u had all p cores.,yes but the 5950x will pull ahead when more threads are needed.,future proof is a relative term but iâ€™m sure most ppl would want to get a decent life out of their hardware.,so get something with a little more power than u need unless u got money to upgrade all the time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 13900k/13700k hitting similar benchmark numbers (within margin of error) at the point that the game is gpu bottlenecked is absolutely normal...  the tester even called this fact out in his video.,he's actually giving the 13600k the benefit of the doubt with faster memory timings than the other cpu's to reflect a scenario where someone may be overclocking to maximize their performance.,"certainly sub timings matter, but the impact it has on system performance should generally be reflected in higher/lower gb/s throughput values which, in his test, clearly give the 13600k a 1.5 gb/s advantage.",if anything normalizing at xmp/docp or jdec values would likely make the results for the 13600k look even worse.,"your assertion that the 13600k is just as ""futureproof"" as the other i7/i9 processors simply doesn't make sense... it might if we were talking about am5 where there will be at least another generation or two of cpu's on the same socket... with the 13600k you are buying a processor that is already a bottleneck for current generation gpu's (the 4080/90+) but can only be upgraded to another faster raptor lake cpu.","spending the $80 now to go with a 13700k over a 13600k is not a bad ""futureproofing"" option, imho.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"his testing started actually attempting to prove that the ""6 core cpu was dead""... but through testing and process of elimination he made the discovery that his originally hypothesis was incorrect, and the differences were in cache vs core related.","he did not set out to ""prove"" what he believed, he admitted that what he set out to prove originally was wrong, and then followed the data to a logical explanation which led him to the cache explanation.","here is the original video..

i really recommend paying the extra for a 13600k.,"the 13500 is close to a 12600k, it has the same l2 cache layout, same memory controller, same c0 stepping which means it's using alder lake (12th gen p cores) silicon, difference is 4 more e cores which won't help at all in games and 4mb more l3 cache.","it's not a real 13th gen. could try to get a 12600k even so you could at least have the option of overclocking

if you live near a microcenter they have 13600k available for $250 right now.","they have a good deal on the 7600x and 7700x where you can get ""free"" ddr5.",the 7600x only gets 16gb of 5200 but the 7700x gets 2x16gb (32gb) 6000mhz.,"and they give a $20 discount on motherboards if you buy a cpu, theres a nice gigabyte b650 aorus elite on sale rn",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i would throw in that you can get a 9th gen chip, that'll be cheaper than the cost of a new mobo and a new cpu.","assuming you don't really need a big upgrade, personally i'd go that route.","if you really want to refresh your system though, getting a 13th gen chip is 100% worth it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

go for 12600k if you have z690.,"it is better than 13500 and it is unlocked, which means that it can be overclocked.",if the 12600k is cheaper than 13500 then it is a no brainer to go for it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

oddly enough i kept getting ram error codes from my motherboard (tried reseating) pair with my 12700kf and when i upgraded to 32gb the problem disappeared and been fine since.,i don't have in-depth knowledge so can't speculate that my mobo prefers 32gb to 16gb but found it odd.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for ddr5 you canâ€™t go lower.,itâ€™s where it starts.,"8gb sticks are bad, they are like trash ddr4 basically.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i come close to maxing out 16gb pretty often.,"if you just run one game at a time with maybe a few browser tabs open, 16 could be still fine.",but really depends on what you're doing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
always has been,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"32 has been the sweet spot for 16 years, \*literally\*",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you are only using that pc for gaming, just stay at 16gb.",just make sure it's dual channel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's more or less use case specific, there are certain games that are pretty ram hungry but they seem to be few and far between.",it's one of those situations where the price of ddr4 has dropped so much that it doesn't hurt to have extra in the event that you need it since you can get 32gb kits for dirt cheap at this point.,i would recommend faster ram if you're using ddr4 on a 12th gen and up cpu though as it really does make a difference on these processors.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16gb is still the standard but 32gb is a real nice to have especially ddr4 being cheap now.,"as someone who has 3 browsers and 50 tabs open and photoshop, it's very nice not closing anything to open a game.",purely just gaming 16 is still good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if youâ€™re on ddr5 itâ€™s the standard as i havenâ€™t seen 16gb kits.,"for ddr4 16gb is the minimum imo but if you rendering or something that requires more ram iâ€™d say 32-128gb depending on your needs
would be the sweet spot.","for strictly gaming, 16gb.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
32gb like in 2019?,"now 2023, everyone is running vms and mini k8s clusters in their computer.",128gb is bare minimum bro.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have 32gb because games like anno 1800 loves eating ram.,"also when i played battlefield 2042 back when it first released, 16gb wasn't cutting it.",fortnite (nanite and lumen on) also somehow uses 24gb of ram lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, itâ€™ll usually lower overclocking potential and increase minimum latencyâ€¦.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
one of the reasons 32gb is also making more sense is that due to the way ddr5 works it's actually going to be slower to run 16gb of ram.,"i am no expert on the matter, but it's similar to single vs dual rank or something along those lines and means effectively that with 16gb of ram you're limiting your speeds as well which does matter for gaming.","on ddr4, it's just what you said where it's $75 for 32gb and $45 for 16gb so just go bigger.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you have the loading screen mod revisted?,it might help a little with optimizing the memory usage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"certain games, and certain programs, like chrome, will eat 16gb for breakfast and stall out games.",if you a multi screen million tab user like i am 32 gb starts to make sense once you add a game to the mix,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"8gb sticks and 2x8gb kits of ddr5 exist, but they suck because of fewer banks.",https://www.techspot.com/article/2528-cheap-ddr5/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
four module ddr4/ddr5 motherboards all support up to 128gb of ram.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you ever try running memtest86+ on the ram?,https://www.memtest.org/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
does ddr5 exist?,"like i see cards for it now, but...

like, it would require a new mother board, right?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes that's with latest version of lsm lol.,"it's largely all the building, network and prop assets.",once you go over a couple thousand they really start to add up in ram.,i've pushed over 9000 at times.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's hugely incorrect, unless you mean just the new chipsets.",because.,not all ddr4 motherboards support up to 128gbs of ram.,"for example, my motherboard only goes up to 64gb supported - rog strix z390-h gaming.",however my i9-9900k can support up to 128gbs given the right motherboard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no but thanks for the link, i'll give it a try later",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

lmao!",the motherboard webpage is wrong as are you still.,i assure you that is more likely a mistake because referencing the official/original manual here - [https://dlcdnets.asus.com/pub/asus/mb/lga1151/rog\_strix\_z390-h\_gaming/e14867\_rog\_strix\_z390-h\_gaming\_um\_v2\_web.pdf?model=rog%20strix%20z390-h%20gaming](https://dlcdnets.asus.com/pub/asus/mb/lga1151/rog_strix_z390-h_gaming/e14867_rog_strix_z390-h_gaming_um_v2_web.pdf?model=rog%20strix%20z390-h%20gaming) \- and then read the supported ram configuration.,"""4 x dimm, max.","64gb ddr4"" - this was what the website reported since i've purchased the board.","and as i said, not all ddr4 motherboards support up to 128gbs.","note - again, that's not to say a newer revision of my board doesn't exist that supports 128gb, which i wouldn't completely rule out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i just set the ""turbo power limits"" option to disabled entirely iirc",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'd say try setting the ones that say ""time"" at the end to unlimited.","if the cpu overheats, it'll throttle automatically.",but i'm not sure if you are able to set these on b560 since this chipset doesn't allow any overclocking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't think so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well one option is to see if there is another xmp.,if only one drop the speed to 6000 and keep the timings from xmp.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you could also try reseating your ram.,"also make sure you're using the recommended slots (usually 2 and 4 starting from the cpu, but check your motherboard manual).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
set cpu vddq to 1.3v and set vccsa to 1.2v,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's in slots 2&4, for sure.","i haven't reseated the ram because the problem stopped when xmp was disabled, leading me to suspicion it has nothing to do with ram seating.",could it still?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
will keep that in mind for when i get to testing xmp again,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that did not do the trick unfortunately, occt crashes on all cores over a few minutes (just the xmp enabled + vddq/vccsa changes)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"reseating the ram takes like 10 seconds, why not try it?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not with noctua nh-d15 above it, that's a whole ass disassembly xd

actually maybe i can do it with just removing the rear fan.",you may be right.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
usually you can just take the fan off which is simple enough.,"fwiw, i had something similar happen on an alder lake system.",crashes with xmp that went away at jedec frequencies.,after some testing i found in memtest that there was a block of memory addresses on one controller that randomly flipped bits at xmp frequencies on just one dimm.,i sent it back for a replacement and have had no crashes since.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"what memtest tool did you use and were you testing with xmp on, or off?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
memtest86+.,"by the way, meant to say ""one dimm"" not controller.",rmaed the dimm and the problem went away.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so far i was using the machine as normal without xmp ever since i disabled it, heavy video editing was all good for the past day.",work come sfirst.,"i continued to test like this to make sure there was no other issues and it just crashed to blue screen with ""clock_watchdog_timeout""...

mind you this is 100% default bios settings.",i am speechless.,i haven't ran the memtest of any sort yet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it should be fine.,i just picked up a 13700k from microcenter and am putting it into a a4 h2o.,i saw a youtuber put a 12900k into his a4 h2o.,"also, i don't need my rig to be that quiet so i'm willing to increase my fan curve if necessary.",i can also rig up a fan on the outside of the mesh panel on the cpu side as an intake.,i'll update this post if i end up regretting it haha,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just wanted to add some anecdotal info to this thread since i just installed a 13700k in an itx case.,"i'm using a slightly larger cooler, but here's my setup and first impressions from popping the cpu in and doing some cinebench runs.",my machine is a 13700k on a msi z690i unify motherboard in a ssupd meshlicious case.,"cooler is a nzxt kraken x63 (280mm)

rough average of 30k for cinebench multi-thread scores (ranges from 295000s\~30600s)

max power draw in hwinfo is 288w.","max package temp is 92c

i am using the thermalwright contact frame (i'd bought it when trying to build a 12th gen machine in this case, but the cpu was dead so i returned that and kept the frame).",i also have an extra 92mm exhaust fan at the top from that same build attempt.,"i haven't touched any voltage/fan curves, no power limits, everything is at stock settings so there's plenty of room to tweak.","so i do have some ""advantages"" that give me some extra cooling headroom, and even then it gets real toasty in a small case.","given the efficiency that's possible to squeeze out of the 13th gen chips i'd expect that it would be possible to run a 13700k with a 240mm aio, but expect to spend some time doing tweaking to get it there.","edit: ok, i've started stepping back the vcore in 0.05v increments and holy moly this thing has a lot of room for undervolting.",you will be absolutely fine with a 240mm aio.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i know this is an older thread, but i just put a 13700k on a evga clc 240 aio.",in cinebench it hits 92c after 7 mins or so.,doesn't throttle but gets up there pulling 259 watts.,i undervolted the chip to a offset negative of 0.090v and the temps stay in the high 70s low 80s under full load.,it actually increased my cinebench score about 140 points.,so yes any 240 aio that is decent should be able to cool this cpu.,it's damn near a small heater pulling 250+ watts.,that's the age we're in though if you want performance.,"anyway 30465 stock at 92c

"any atx motherboard for the 13700k that you recommend, not so expensive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'd recommend stepping down to a 13600k in an itx case.,since with a 240mm aio you'd end up limiting the wattage to 150-200w anyway at most.,"no matter 13900k, 13700k or 13600k.",a 13700k is slightly faster than a 13600k (because the 13700k has 2 more performance cores) if both cpus run at 150 watts but not really worth the extra money you have to pay.,edit: corrected to 13700k has 2 more performance cores (and not 4 more efficiency cores),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

building the following in the coming days and am panicking about cooling.,"hardware in build is as follows:

ssd: 2 tb kingston kc3000 gen 4x4 m.2 nvme

the deepcool cg560 case comes with 3 argb 120mm pre-installed fans on the front and a non rgb 140 mm at the back which i've replaced with a gigabyte aorus 140mm fan for aesthetics.",case is fairly roomy and has very decent airflow.,"questions:

1. i need to install the radiator at the top of the case, do i attach the fans facing down or up for optimal cooling ?",(ie push vs pull)?,"2. i don't really plan on doing much over clocking, (besides a benchmark perhaps after setup, and maybe a few years down the line when system slows a bit).",how do you guys see the waterforce x 240 performing inside this case with the 13700k?,"still haven't opened the box yet, so if the consensus is that the 240 aio will be insufficient, then i need to think about a 280 (max for cg560).",thanks guys....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"bruh, 240mm aio is completely fine for 250w.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why would a 240mm aio perform any worse on an itx case?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just lock the power limit of 13700k to 200w.,you'll lose like.. 5% in multithread compared to performance without any power limits and you'll be able to easily cool it with air cooler (probably any 6heatpipe one).,still the performance will be high af.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i7 and i9 typically much different in tdp and thermals.,just wait for i7 reviews.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i donâ€™t plan to overclock the cpu lol 5ghz is enough at stock,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or lower the power limit slightly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

sorry i wasn't more specific.,"core temps at stock were generally in the mid-upper 80s, and peaked in the low 90s.",none of them tripped thermal throttling.,after undervolting (i ended up at -0.75v) temps were capping out at around 80\~81c in cinebench.,"still got hot with prime95 (90c) but again, no thermal throttling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sure, in a well-ventilated atx case.",in a small itx case you are gonna have a hot and loud mess.,[lots of people building itx agree with that.,](https://youtu.be/69ujclj9e4q?t=465) 12700k which has maximum turbo power of 190w and 13600k which has 181w are the best fit for a 240mmm aio.,(13700k has 253w.),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
limited airflow compared to a bigger case and therefore heat build-up.,i timestamped a videolink in my other reply.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then it should be fine.,just set a reasonable long time power limit that you can cool and let the cpu boost when it likes to.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

do you have your aio as intake or exhaust?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

exhaust.,every post iâ€™ve read with an a4-h2o has it set to exhaust.,have you seen otherwise?,iâ€™m curious to try one intake and one exhaust but iâ€™m too lazy to switch the fans unless i see that someone recommends it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i hope so.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how do you get paste on the back of a cpu?,are you 12?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why don't you just clean it off with a q-tip dipped in rubbing alcohol?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as long as the thermal paste isn't conductive it doesn't make a difference if it got on the back, you can use a soft bristle toothbrush and some alcohol to get it all off if it bothers you.",even if it is conductive tim as long as you clean it off and make sure it isn't bridging any connections before placing it back into a board and powering it up you're still fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is good that you are honest and the downvotes do not really make sense here.,"of course you should not be getting thermal paste on the back of the cpu, but still... anyhow for future reference check some guides: you both apply and remove thermal paste while the cpu is in the socket so the paste does not spread anywhere.","you also do not apply a lot of the paste: ""one pea size"" is the general rule of thumb.","normal thermal paste is also non-conductive so unless you go for the liquid metal ones, you cannot really break anything with it.",you can still spoil contacts though if you let the paste spread to the socket itself (the socket should always be protected by the cpu).,"anyhow, for now you are good.",all is fine.,when cleaning up stuff: be careful though.,that is the moment when you can actually break something.,the pins on the socket are very small.,lga 1700 means that there are 1700 contacts on that small area.,"if the socket looks anyhow good, do not go messing around there while cleaning.",just clean the cpu gently with q-tips (as was suggested by others) and rubbing alcohol.,be careful to not apply force: roll the q-tip instead of dragging it there.,"it does not need to be fully clean, though.","looking at that cpu, it would not take more than a few seconds  to clean it for me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gotta have good thermal contact between the cpu and the socket,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

clean most of the paste off while itâ€™s in the socket.,then remove and clean the rest off on a flat surface and it wonâ€™t get on the back or your hands.,q tips are your best friends.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

13700k is better.,easily worth $12 more.,it is probably the best option for $400 right now.,there are upcoming zen4 3d  cpus that could be better but likely cost more with more costly motherboards and it won't make much of a difference at 4k anyway.,you have the option of paying less and get a 13600k and it is still going to be good for video editing but definitely worse.,"if you want to save money, go this route instead of 12900k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

is the 13700k so much better than tha ryzen 9 7900 no-x?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think they want to know which one to but between the two, different hens and i7 vs i9.",itâ€™s a fair question.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"hmmm i mean.. it is next gen cpus, so usually i7s is faster then the previous i9s.",i mean the 12900k is just about even with the 13600k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"~~if your work load is all about the cores, there would be justification for the last gen i9.","not to mention more mature and stable, if working in a production environment.~~

ignore.",dumb.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 12900k and 13700k both have the exact same core configuration.,8 p cores and 8 e cores and 24 threads total.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your right.,even the cache has been improved from the i9->i7.,back during the hedt days: you had the i9s of the previous generation generally having higher cache and some other differences that would make somone into high core count applications look at a year old chip instead of the newest ones.,"in this case, there is 0 reason to go with the i9.",thanks for pointing it out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

cinebench r23 results please,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
congrats op!,enjoy it for us.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've been saying this is the real gem of the 13th gen lineup.,"for the price, imo it's the best chip for most new builders.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
awesome!,thinking thisâ€™ll be the best value non-k 13th gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how much did you pay?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can they overclock on external bclk motherboards like 12th gen?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i heard anything below 13600k is not raptor lake.,is that true?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

opinions vs 5600x?,"looking to upgrade, need more frames in my tac fps which is mostly few-core intensive.",need to build pc for friend so can pass down 5600x build if this better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
excited for you.,i'm thinking of this or the 13600 for a plex and small game server.,hoping to see them in stores soon and a few reviews benchmarks online.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is the price on these?,from the benchmarks it looks as though at max power level it almost matches the 12700k and 5900x for multi threaded performance.,"iâ€™m not really interested in upgrading my 12600k anytime soon, but itâ€™s great to see intelâ€™s continual progress in the budget market.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just had a look at some synthetic benchmarks and damn it is beating my 5900x in single thread!,impressive stuff for the price on this chip.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14 cores right?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gongrats.is it worth it next year this time upgrade from i5 10400f to this one?please share your opinion.thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
receiving mine tomorrow !,"need to update the b660 i've purchased, hopefully, it has a bios flashback button",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wait what?,i thought it was the 13600k?,what happened?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so what's better for gaming performance between this and 13500k if i'm not interested in overclocking?,is it worth the extra â£50 difference in price?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

crazy how far i5s have come.,"for years they were just quad cores without ht, now they're deca-core powerhouses that can be used for gaming and even workstation/server scenarios.","well, i'd imagine someone wanting to do some more intensive workstation stuff would want to go for an i7/i9 but the fact that even the lowest tiered i5 (13400) in the lineup has a whopping 16 total threads is honestly amazing.","i'm glad amd pushed intel to get serious, otherwise they might still have only 4 total threads to this day lol.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yup, although it's quite depressing having this box on my desk and no computer to use it lol... i sold my i5 9400f system to do a full rebuild.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it is almost up there with 5950x, seeing how 13600k is actually better than 5950x in some case.","i still wish they do something to i3, i3 is underwhelming.",intel should have give them 6+0 or 4+4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how does it compare to 12700f that i was about to get but didnt and thinking about 13500 :d ?,i mainly care about gaming and ideally would like ddr4 instead of ddr5 and need it to last 4-5 years :d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

does it really matter?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
where are you getting the benchmarks?,i've been waiting to see how price/performance pans out after this latest round from intel & amd but haven't seen anything yet.,which is strange because they're available in stores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have 13900k and run it just with one 8pin.,board has a second full 8pin connector i donâ€™t use.,will do 253w fine but iâ€™m on air so i donâ€™t bother letting it go that hot anyway.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13600k is not â€œpower hungryâ€ at all.,"but if you have the available connector, plug it in",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice name,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i came to the same realization when i got my 13700k + z690 mobo.,was hoping to keep my corsair hx650.,but ended up getting an used rm850x from fb marketplace.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i also have a 13600k on an mis z790 ddr5 mother board, paired with a nh-d15s chromax black cooler + noctua 15 fan.",i can definetley say it's mot really power hungry and that it aits at a cool 36 degrees and its max temp was 66 under load.,granted i have 2 x 8 pin for it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if only gaming and productivity, no need to have the extra 4 pin.",only if overclocking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"got this cpu a week ago, only need the 8 even if you oc (the 4 is for extreme oc...like with nitrogen lol).",see you're probably going z790 series which is nice....if you got a z690 you would have to bios flash it most likely (it's actually really easy but just saying).,"enjoy the cpu, i for sure am.",only problem i had is this z690 (gigabyte) has faulty xmp ram profiles so i had to set it manually.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's fine.,unless you're going extreme overclocked.,doubt there will be any issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've never once connected anything to the extra 4 pin.,i don't do anything crazy with my cpu either.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"typically you won't need that unless you're running an i9 or doing extreme overclocking, but it's not a bad idea to plug it in if you have the cable for it.","it probably won't help much, but it won't hurt either.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i run two xeon 2660v2 cpus off one 8-pin cpu connector.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
im not using the extra 4 pins with my 13600k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dont need it.,but the extra 4 pins is for overclocking.,one 8pin is enough to supply around 300 watts itself fine with airflow.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most of the more expensive motherboards include more vrm cooling and capacity for overclocking so its nothing b760 can't do unless intel has gone and changed that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no need , i am using i9 13900k with z690 , just using 8pin .",no issue at all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no it will rum fine without the xtra cable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have two 8 pin and use only one with 13600k without problem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you don't need anything beyond a single 8 pin cpu power connector for even a 16 core cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what is the wattage of your psu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just plug it in :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think the 8pin alone does 235 watts continuous, meaning 24/7 run time, and they have a big safety do to imperfections like all computer has as some people even run 280+ watts from 8 pins.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
every week people ask this question even though the answer is always provided in the motherboard manual.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in my experience it's needed if your mobo does automatic all-core oc.,sometimes called enhanced turbo or something.,otherwise it won't be stable.,so either plug it in or disable all-core overclocking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks.,i have another question.i've ordered a b760 mobo.,does it worth paying 50â‚¬ more for a z690 motherboard?,(160â‚¬ to 210â‚¬),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
253 is the bare minimum half decent cables will do almost 400. the extra connector is basically needed only for sub zero overclock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
always.,no harm having more redundancy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
235 watts for one 8 pin so can overclock too especially on 13600k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i run my 12900ks on a single 8pin cable and it pulls up to 300w in cb r20.,"i'd say it's fine, especially with a 13600k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nah, the motherboard manuals are almost always obscure about it.","gigabyte has a manual that says ""plug in the 12v or the computer will not  boot"", asus has a motherboard manual that says ""ensure the 12v is connected"".","and neither of those two manuals (among a bunch of others i've glanced over) says ""no need for both unless you overclock"".","just this week for the first time i saw a manual that said ""no need"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"uuuuuuuuuuuuh, no, they're not, rotfl.",where'd you get that number from xd.,"8-pin can handle just a shy from 400w before it starts getting really warm, but are rated well below that.",it will be long melted before it even reaches 800w.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"main difference is cpu overclocking, so if you want to do that get z690/790 as b series only allows memory overclock which is not worth it imo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i only mention 253w because itâ€™s the intel stock limit (pl1/pl2) for the 13900k.,"iâ€™ve run it at 270w for a benchmark, but, too hot.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for a 13600k, i would think it'd be ok.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yup, you don't need a second 8 pin or 4 pin unless your doing extreme overclocking with ln2 or dry ice.",a single 8 pin is all you need regardless of which cpu your running.,my current system has a 16 core 5950x and i'm only using a single 8 pin...my new am5 system will have a 7950x but also only needs a single 8 pin.m.you can overclock it too with no problem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
check your motherboard manual.,that might be for additional pcie power.,"in which case, its necessity would depend on your video card.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you sure it doesn't?,some psu will have a split 8 pin that can be used as a 4 pin for cou.,double check the manual and labeling on the cables.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it probably has it.,the 8 pin connectors break into two 4 pins.,they are clipped to each other.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am quite certain that your psu just wasnt packaged with the cable.,you should be able to use a cpu port from your psu with the proper cable.,"(i am being downvoted for the right answer, that is so very reddit.)","there are 8pin to 4pin cables

and everytime i've looked into answering someone's problem by downloading their motherboard manual and seeing the words as i paraphrase-quoted - except for one motherboard this week for the 1st time as noted.,perhaps i tend to answer ddr5-motherboard problems or something.,"see, for example, the manuals for the gigabyte aorus elite ax ddr5 and the asus rog strix z790-e; the words they use are typical i've seen (they both discuss ""internal connectors"" or something and have pages for the extra power connectors).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

go for the z board.,b boards are known to be quirky and broken when paired with 13th gen especially related to undervolting which is a must for most if not all systems with 13th gen chips.,the reason is the stock bios settings are way too agressive which leads to temps reaching 100 c almost instantly under load.,i ran mine with a b board at first but temps were horrendous.,"when ""undervolting"" the undervolt protection kicked in hard and led to massive performance drops.",it cant be disabled either.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what board and cpu?,did you undervolt through bios?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can just manually limit the pl1 and pl2 voltages though.,"i capped mine at 145w (for both) and lost a whopping 500ish points on r23 (from 23,100 or so to 22,550 or therabouts) and it still boosts to 5.1ghz on all six p-cores.",there was no real world or gaming performance loss,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

high temps benchmarking.,would thermal throttle due to settings on the motherboard and trying to alter voltages didn't work.,"you've two options, get a z series board so you can play with the bios settings and overclock.",or just get a 13400f.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its fine.,undervolting is wonky (thanks intel!),but you can just manually limit the cpu pl1 and pl2 wattages without losing any real performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ok thanks.,i'm gonna get a z790 pg lightning instead,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
was a b660 mobo by any chance?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how to do that?,is it in the bios?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the experience i had was that i could get it down to around 90ish.,"would still occasionally throttle on two individual cores and drop the clocks to under 4. 
with a z series board i can overclock to 5.5 and keep it under 80. 
not much point in spending the extra for a k series if you can't mess around with the clocks.","be as well just get a non k. 
i'm on itx which might not help with temps though.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

buy 11900k only if its cheaper than 12600k+b660.,"or 
you already have spare mobo.","you can sell your old cpu + mobo and buy into 13th or 12th gen.



11900k is superior to 10900k in single core performance.",you can't go wrong with any if price is right.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you might also consider the 11700k.,it's nearly identical to the 11900k but will be cheaper.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"neither, get a 12600k/13400/13600k and enjoy vastly superior *everything*.","every generation before alder lake is obsolete now, it was that much of a return to form.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

both are trash.,get a 12th/13th gen cpu.,even the 13600k is much faster than those two,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've had both.,in synthetics my 10900k was faster than the 11900k.,"having said that, i couldnt tell a difference in gaming.",if your motherboard is z590 get the 11900k for pcie gen 4 support.,otherwise get whats cheaper.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

exactly!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because i had a spare motherboard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it depends on local crowd.,i usually send video of hardware running and temperatures.,no returns accepted.,buy it only if you know what you are doing.,"sell local, i never shipped anyone ever.",its local 100% for me & cash only.,"if price is low enough, you ll get buyers in time.","got approached many times to ship it but i refused, its too much headache to do it all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in that case, cheaper is best option.",you arenâ€™t getting real value gains unless you hop on lga1700,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
either is fine.,i have a 11900k that i got for 300 dollars when best buy was selling them out.,i already had bought a motherboard too.,itâ€™s a good chip but get a better cooler for it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in that case i would go 10900. unless the 11900 is cheaper.,the 11th gen had a bad rap for being less than stellar improvement wise and in some case had firmware hiccups.,that could all be resolved but i am gonna wager the 10900 is cheaper and the 11900 doesn't offer a berth of improvement.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"technically its possible, im pretty sure windows lets you create power profiles and choose what apps run on what gpu.",that being said i forsee that it will not be a painless experience and probably wont be worth the headache.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

will setting power limits reduce its performance ?,how would you set up ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well it depends on your cooling.,because you only have a 240aio you will be thermally limited.,thus not being able to take advantage of the extra power since your cpu will throttle.,"just saying, if you are jumping to 80-90c in gaming then you definitely have a cooling issue",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

for you to compare i just ran cinebench r23 with my intel 13500 with it's 65 watt limit enabled.,"b660 motherboard and 32gb of 3200mhz ram

14 cores, 20 threads @ 2.5ghz = 17906

when it's allowed to ignore the power limit in bios i get around 21000+ @ 154 watts.",so it looks like you are running at the 65 watt power limit.,there will be a setting in your bios that allows the cpu to stay at it's highest power limit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the xmp has those 2 profiles by default but whatever changes you do to them (well actually the settings in the bios) you save themin the asus profile in the boot section, not in the xmp profiles.",those are read only profiles that come with the xmp.,the ones that you save your changes to would be inthe boot section under asus profiles.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"to avoid bsod i changed intelppm -> start from 3 to 4 earlier, may that be the reason for the low clock speed and power draw?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can you check via hwinfo instead of hwmonitor?,others have mentioned that hwinfo is more accurate.,"2.1ghz is 13700's default p-core frequency, so it looks like it's not doing any type of boosting at all.","in addition to loading default bios settings, have you also tried resetting (removing the battery and all that) it too?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"that's almost certainly your problem, but the bigger question is why were you getting bsods and why did you feel that was the solution.",i can assure you doing that is not normal.,edit: and probably the only reason the bsods stopped is because the cpu is barely working now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
definitely.,who told you to change the start value of intelppm and why?,you shouldn't do that.,"setting the start value to 4 means that the service is disabled, so intelppm never starts.",intelppm stands for intel processor power management.,it is the driver that allows windows to control the power states of the cpu.,"if the driver isn't started, then it will stay in a low power state and windows won't be able to change it.","i really doubt that intelppm is the cause of your bsod, even if disabling the service *seems* to fix it.",tons of people would be having this issue if that were the case since everyone has this driver enabled.,"if you are getting a consistent bsod on a fresh windows install then you must have some other issue, such as defective hardware or bad overclock.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sounds like you need to install the intel drivers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"its possible yea, but with it back to 3 it is doing bsod again in a loop.. my cpu is not having temp issues and i've installed it with a ak620.. device manager does have yellow triangles with error code 32 on the cpu cores..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it definitely is the cause, i've run hours with no problem, tried putting it back to 3, back to bsod loop :/... now its back to 4 and working again, still with low performance though, contemplating putting it to 1 instead?","ran memory diagnostic, no problems - also nothing is overclocked and all temperatures are fine",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel driver assistant says i am up to date and pressing update driver it says the same, can you link me the ones i would need?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is this a brand new windows installation or did you repurpose an old install?,"you appear to have some serious windows-related issues going on that are not common, and the â€œfixâ€ right now is basically breaking things just enough that whatever your actual issue is canâ€™t happen.","like an engine that knocks at 2000 rpm, simply limiting it to 1500 rpm does not fix the actual problem, it just masks it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's related to the cause, but it is not *the* cause.","you're basically running the processor in a low power state, if you're not experiencing issues while doing that, but have problems when you use it at full speed, it would likely point to some root cause in the power delivery to the processor.","you should check all the power cables to your motherboard, make sure the 8-pin to the processor is seated right along with the 24-pin to the board.",you can check a new powersupply as well if you have one available.,there's even the possibility that there is a hardware fault with the processor or on the motherboard vrms.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"completely clean windows install, wiped everything.","everything else in device manager looks fine, just the cores are yellow marked with the error code 32. i've read that that  is indeed because i've set intelppm to 4 and it is gone on 3, but then it is back to bsod hell.. ran driver support assistant, but it seems everything is up to date, as well is windows update",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i installed a clean windows exactly  because i had the bsod problem with the old, but yeah, new install didnt do anything, only changing intelppm, which leads to a bad performing cpu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
breaking intelppm is not the fix to your issue.,itâ€™s just masking the problem.,you need to find out the actual cause of your issues.,look up the bsod error codes.,they actually do mean something.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i've done nothing but googling every error code i could see before restarts, no clear answers to the problem, this was the only thing that made my pc not crash - i agree its not a fix, as is why im still reading everything to find a better solution..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

disabling ht will lower power consumption in cinebench because cinebench can use those extra threads.,"when you disable ht, the load in cinebench is lower.",if you play a game the load is different (and the load likely doesn't change by disabling ht).,"you should test the energy consumption difference in games, not unrelated software like cinebench.","if consistent benchmarks between test runs are hard to do, you could use 3dmark demo graphic test or something.",again there is a synthetic cpu test in most 3dmark test sets.,that test will likely load the cpu 100% and cause misleading power measurements for gaming.,"edit clarification:

test oc stability with synthetic + actual use.",test performance of your cooling with synthetic worst case load.,test power efficiency with your actual usage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hyperthreading ist pretty much useless with high core count cpus anyway.,"hyperthreading in itself doesn't add any execution engine related stuff, it's just an easy way of increasing the load on the existing execution engine.",it achieves an overall better throughput at the expense of single thread execution times.,depending on workloads sometimes disabling hyper threading can give you even better performance.,in gaming will typically see slightly higher or identical fps with ht enabled but 0.1% and 0.01% lows are typically worse.,but todays cpus are so fast that it doesn't really matter anyways.,personally i have it disabled because i don't have anything that really benefits from ht being enabled and some applications that see slightly better performance without ht.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"why do you bother about power draw, exactly?","and yes, games still fare better with ht enabled than the minuscule clock gain, given you can maintain the clock stable anyway, as ht turned off doesn't change your stability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you should benchmark your both solutions and show the results,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
power is thermal budget and noiseâ€¦ also many people pay big bucks for power.,cooler cpu runs quieter and higher low-core clocks.,"but i think op is trying to optimize for games, so as others have said, cinebench isnâ€™t a practical workload for testing purposes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"bump e cores clock with throttlestop, there's some wonkiness with cache frequency on some boards, where it just constantly drops well below e cores.","on z690-a pro d4 and 12700k at 1.24u2 bios cache stays at same level, but on 1.9 (and 1.a) the cache oscilates 3.6-4.4ghz, i had to use throttlestop to force cache into same level and it's also stable.","a friend with 13700k on same board (but d5) doesn't need to fiddle with cache at all, it's constantly on a proper ratio.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"-.15v undervolt and disabling e-cores and ht drops my max power draw from 250w to 100w, with no change in dcs vr frame rate.","however it does slow down other workflows like astro photography stacking, so iâ€™ve left them enabled (and dcs doesnâ€™t come close to using 250w, that only happens in cinebench)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the entire point is that a hyperthread takes advantage of inefficiency in the pipeline.,"if there's no inefficiency, it won't get scheduled for tasks.","if there is idle time on the main thread, it gives you access to those previously unusued cpu cycles.",no reason to disable ht.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">in gaming will typically see slightly higher or identical fps with ht enabled but 0.1% and 0.01% lows are typically worse

that's wrong, you can either get overall improvement or worsement from ht status, not ""this is higher but this is lower"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ht, when idle and moderately loaded, inserts itself into the pipeline, which can cause microstutter on the primary thread on the other half of the ht pipeline for that core.","this can impact gaming in .1 and 1% lows, and various forms of microstutter showing up in the game, even if avg framerates are completely unchanged.",if you have 6 or more p-cores and don't do production/rendering workloads that fully saturate every thread there's no reason *at all* to have ht on.,if you have 4 cores then ht can help games which are highly threaded by reducing contention a little.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is literal nonsense.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what's the source of the suppsed stutter?,context switching?,windows is constantly moving threads around between physical cores.,it's no different.,"i agree that there is only going to be a performance benefit if physical cores < process threads and there is idle time, but i disagree that there is a penalty incurred merely by having ht enabled.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

>clock stays still and asus' motherboards let's you turn off the ring down bin function too.,would using the windows performance powerplan stop the cache from dropping since it forces a constant cpu clock or does the cache still drop?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
