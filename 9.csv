i'm using the micron e-die kit crucial ballistix rgb 16gb (16-18-18-36).,how much ram do you have ?,16gb 3600 is the maximum a 12th gen non k can handle.,did you check your motherboard qvl before buying your kit ?,might not be compatible.,what cooler are you running ?,stock cooler can't really handle faster ram,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

clock watchdog timeout is usually a crash you see with unstable overclocks.,try resetting your bios to default.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yup, thatâ€™s typically the signs of an unstable system due to overclock (including any auto overclock), too low core voltage, bad memory timings, and so forth.","after checking your bios for overclocking settings, i would disable xmp, and also make sure you have memory installed in a2 and b2 slots (second and fourth) not first and second or first and third.","otherwise, we need way more details about your system and how you have it set up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"despite all the comments about which cpu is better, both these chips beat a desktop class intel i7 10700k for much less power draw.","my 10700k overclocked to 5.2ghz and with an alf2 aio cooling it to 85c will do \~13,693 points and i think it will draw close to 215 watts... it is roughly accurate.",i measure the power draw with a kill-a-watt meter at the wall.,cost wise (for 0.34 cents per kwh on average combination off-peak and peak hours (pg&e california rates).,if i were to run my i7 10700k 8 hrs a day for 1 year or 2080 hrs a year (working hours 52 weeks x 40 hours a week.),here would be the cost breakdown.,"&#x200b;

|cpu|power usage|cb r23|cost per year|perf per dollar|

|intel i7 10700k 5.2ghz - desktop |215 watts| 13693|=$152.05|90 points per dollar|

overall both systems are amazing.",they beat out a desktop class cpu in terms of both performance and cost per performance.,at least in multi-core workloads.,which i don't do a lot of.,this is for worse case.,2080 hours a year worth of render work.,seriously amazing for a laptop formfactor.,my desktop unit has an aio and dedicated psu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hmm...the performance still depends on the power supply to the processor right?,"on this case, while purchasing hx laptop, better select some laptop like msi who providing a higher power supply.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you don't need to call the i9 hx bro to kick the ass of 6900hx.,i7 12700h has already crashed it.,"(muti core 16000 @ 70w, 18000 @ 95w)

my desktop 5900x under a 360 closed loop cooler barely breaks 20k multicore after heavy optimisation.,pretty impressive for a mobile chip to best it just 2 years later.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whoo hoo lets go intel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is weird that the intel chip stops gaining performance after 75w.,usually intel surpasses amd in power efficiency somewhere around 50w and then gains performance all the way as far as the laptop can provide power.,"that cinebench score also seems high for 75w, i would expect something like that at 150w.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the implementation of power delivery for the msi w/ intel hx seems much more finely tuned compared to prior generations of cpus with older architecture.,"even though the form factors probably plays a large part in how the manufacturers are able to tune cooling and power limits, it's impressive that there has been such a large improvement on intel's side for this generation of processor and if rumors are to be true even more amazing for 13th gen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's not a perfect comparison because testing the 8 core 16 thread 6900hx vs the 16 core 24 thread 12800hx isn't fair and a perfect comparison is against the even higher clocked and binned 12900hx?,"yup, that's exactly what i'd consider a more fair comparison.","calling a chip a true beast that crushes the amd chip when comparing a chip with double the core count, and basically gets 50% faster best case scenario is, frankly, laughable.","it's a good chip, it's pretty ridiculous for a laptop, uses considerably more power and it's performance lead is dramatically reduced in the situations most people would actually use it, that is set to pretty low power usage on battery where low enough and the amd chip straight up takes the lead.","a 16 core apu would pretty clearly beat the intel chip in mobile, and easily, it would just be such a low demand chip that there is no worth to it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"but the battery life is garbage so it doesn't matter, my thicc boi strix ae lasts for 10 hours easily while working on it.","my friend had to return his 12700h tuf cause it didn't last, he's getting a 2022 a15 instead.",everyone i know has either a ryzen gaming laptop (mainly g14) or a m1 macbook.,only people who got intel gaming laptops and are fine with it don't care about battery cause they either don't use that laptop for work or their work involves having the laptop plugged in.,"these intel processors are great for people who need the horsepower on the go but while plugged in, for everyone else which is the vast majority the amd processors are better (not to mention they're cheaper in general).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"wow, this looks really bad for amd, doesnâ€™t it?","75w isnâ€™t all that much power in this form factor, and amd loses at pretty much every reasonable wattage, often losing *big* even to the 12700h.","weâ€™re a long way from the days when amd was embarrassing intel and delivering killer value in every single market segment with zen 2 (the greatest cpu generation of all time, in my book).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

every single mobile ryzen generation thus far is just u-die clocked way too high.,"notice amd boysâ€™ argument is always low power and low power alone, and for this generation, â€œlow powerâ€ has to be below 35w to strictly be in <14â€ ultrabook category to beat intel in multiple core.",which means performance wise rembrandt only makes sense in ultrabooks without a dgpu.,they still lose in single core and io regardless of power.,the main real advantage in a ryzen gaming laptop is battery life only.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

\- has good thermal management in comparison to other processors",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have gone through various articles and iâ€™ve found that intel hx is far better than amd hx processor in terms of :

did you disable pl1 for these tests?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think it is because we unleash the power for short term gains.,my 10700k short term would get 13693 points in cb r23.,i am going for highest possible (without resorting to changing the application priority).,"but if i were to limit the power to 125 watts, i would not get peak performance numbers.","and it wouldn't be quite an exciting benchmark =p

i think most users just use the all important cb r23 for short term bragging rights or really just to compare cpu silicon quality between users.",also to compare between cpu manufacturers and generations.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is kind of weird.,maybe the 12800hx's have the best silicons and lowest voltages?,shoudln't make that much of a difference.,"still, the desktop chips of adl are massively against the power curve.","intel is pushing those chips hundreds of watts to get a few hundred mhz, specially if you are using those modified turbo targets that gaming motherboards like to include.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think if you can't comprehend that dropping a full node which has drastically superior efficiency allows for higher core counts within the same rough power usage then you don't understand how chips work.,"using an argument that a company is increasing core count on a new node against someone saying they didn't do so on the current node because it would use too much power is a terrible, terrible argument.","if amd were launching 16 core chips on the same 7nm node with the same electrical performance and thus would use potentially 80% more power you'd have a point, but that's not what they are doing.","if that chip is rated at 55w tdp but uses up to 80w, that chip would still have a 100w tdp and a up to 180w usage on 7nm.",the point doesn't change between rated and actual power usage because both are still dramatically lower on a new node.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"did techpowerup run all their benchmarks at like max settings, with max textures?","some reviewers are showing the 6500xt being ahead of a 5500xt by like 5% or more in average, but here is like 5% slower.",but that's because others are testing at medium or low settings.,"effectively in most if not all of these benchmarks, the 6400 and 6500xt are over their vram limit and relying on their pathetic x4 pcie limit.","i definitely believe intel is ahead of amd with ray tracing enabled, but some of these huge performance gaps are likely caused because it's using way more than 4gb with rt, so amd is getting hit double as hard.","would not shock me if some are using 7gb, and that's causing intel to get hit harder than the rtx 3050.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

seems to be some sort of current throttle not sure what to do about that though not sure if i can raise available current somehow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
laptops can have manufacturer-specific power and thermal profiles.,some times those can be in the bios (like a my dell xps) and sometimes they are in software (like my hp envy 360).,some times the default profile is designed to limit the fan noise by throttling the cpu freq curve to keep temps down.,"i would recommend trying to find any control software that came from the factory (like from lonovo, dell, etc etc) and see if there are any software options that change the boost behavior.","also, often laptops cpu power limit will change if it's plugged into a charger or on battery.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"first, if you say that disabling all cores but one will cause the system to throttle at 4.3ghz - thatâ€™s 1 core of 12, never mind 12!","- then i honestly think that system has a big throttling or current limitation issue, and thatâ€™s why theyâ€™ve gimped its performance.","second, with a pl1 of just 28 watts iâ€™m doubtful that cpu is going to be able to sustain particularly high frequencies.","so you would definitely need to disable that (if as rock lets you, which is far from a certainty for as rock), but then youâ€™d likely run into worse thermal issues.","third, i canâ€™t for the life of me find what the all core turbo speed for the performance cores on that cpu is supposed to be.",4.7ghz is just for one core at a time.,"if all cores are in use, that number will be lower.","if this were a desktop part iâ€™d say maybe 4.2-4.4ghz would be likely, but this is a mobile part so it could very well be a lot lower, especially due to thermal constraints.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah that's how laptops are.,they never said it can do all core 4.7 lol.,heavy thermal and power limits.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
does your system have some kind of boost mode/oc mode or high speed fan mode available?,generally laptops have these kind of modes so processor will only boost to full potential on max fan speed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's a good thing why would you want your laptop hitting 100c by boosting.,now it runs cool n quiet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
double check bios options(look for something referencing current or iccmax).,i don't think there shouldn't be a current throttle at that low of frequency,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this pc is from asrock and there's nothing but drivers which i've already installed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so far with incremental increases i've got to about 3.6 ghz on the p cores with all cores active at around 75 c with a tp1 at 35 under consistent load.,that seems good enough to get 100% emulation speed with my 86box setup without needing to needlessly reboot between single and multi core setups.,i also turned down the graphics load as much as possible since almost everything this box will be doing is cpu heavy.,i was expecting slightly better performance but i think i can make it sufficient for the time being.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this isnt a laptop and that's fine but it's not even performing as well as the video shared with me in this chain.,my all core modifier won't go past 38 no matter what i do even though the temperature is not high and in the video eta prime was getting 40x modifier.,i also plan to remove this from the case and build put much better heat management on it so it would be nice to know that i can remove these limiters,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because i need the higher clock speeds i would be fine with a happy medium of low 4 ghz especially since i run between 50 and 60 now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yea i have limited options in bios i can change how many cores are on, turn on and off turbo, and turn on and off thermal throttling (which appears to do nothing).","i checked the manufacturer manual and it doesn't say anything about current throttling, i just don't know why they would sell all the variants of the chips in their devices if they don't allow for enough current to use it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which model is it?,"also, i should ask, how are you measuring the core frequencies?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"watching this review:

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=bkwxtildzia

it says you can adjust pl1 up to 45 watts, which is less than the 1260pâ€™s stock pl2 limit, and that 35 watts might be the sweet spot for the system.","they donâ€™t publish many cpu benchmarks, but they do offer a geekbench score, so you can at least see if your system is in line with that.","otherwise, this is a tiny system, so power and heat are going to need to be limited.","i know emulation is pretty intensive, so while the cpu may be capable of more, the form factor probably isnâ€™t.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it can only do what the oem decided it can do,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"thanks for sharing that, seems like his is doing a little better than mine, i'll have to keep tweaking tomorrow to see what i can do",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

would throttlestop software help?,this isn't a laptop so i can step up the cooling solution if need be,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hmm, my initial theory was you are looking at an overall frequency meter like on task manager which actually averages all the clock speeds of all the cores and with 8 little cores the average will always be well bellow the p-core speeds, but if you're using a core-by-core measurement or a peak frequency measurement then that theory is dead.",i'm not really sure as i don't really have any experience with nucs unfortunately.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so you've seen the same exact pc do better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm not familiar with that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"looks like throttlestop was partially the answer, was able to change my cpu/gpu power balance and give some more juice to the cpu as well as well as give some more room for the cpu to clock.",still seemed to be capped by some invisible rule when all the cores are turned on but i did manage to hit advertised clock rate on one core even though i'll need to improve the cooling a bit if i want to sustain that long term.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yup his 40x vs my 38x, i tried hooking this up to a egpu tonight to take graphics load as much off the chip as possible and even though it ran even cooler, still can't get 40x like eta prime did with all cores on, seems to be locked to 38x for some reason, my ability to increase that multiplier seems to be locked too",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

11800 is a very hot chip.,infact all intel 45w chips run hot.,nitro chassis isnâ€™t the best either.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just stop that prevention of boosting.,you are cutting huge amount of performance out of the machine.,"do repasting for thermal paste on the cpu (and gpu while there - remove all potential dust also), then put all fans to 100%, remove all boost limits and run cinebench 23 multicore for 10 minutes to see what the situation is.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don't disable turbo boost.,just download throttlestop and cap the wattage to something lower when gaming at the cost of a few fps if you don't feel comfortable running it hot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"because you have turned off boost the processor is not getting enough power to run at high speeds, so as soon as all core gets hit it throttles down.",turn on boost a 100c on laptop processor is fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

prochot is thermal throttling.,maybe acer set the 'hot' limit at 70 degrees.,get throttlestop and see if the 'prochot offset' in the 'options' tab can be changed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just change the thermal paste to syy 157,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"can be, but prochot is 92 actually",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is either **repasting** or doing an rma return if you think your machine is flawed.,a lot of machines do internal thermal throttling though (even apple m1 and m2 machines and especially the macbook airs).,it is only flawed if they do not throttle properly themselves and they end up crashing instead or they throttle at a lot lower performance levels than intended.,"modern cpus in general know how to do the throttling themselves properly, you do not throttle them yourself to ""prevent overheating"" as you mentioned on another comment.",it is practically impossible to damage your machine on default settings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes i mean the power limits.,what are your cpu temps when actually gaming?,you should be getting higher than 2.6ghz if you cap pl 1 and 2 to 45w when gaming since most games aren't going to push the cpu nearly as hard as cinebench.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
apex is fucking horrendous on most machines.,i play other games my temps are in the 70s i just open apex and i hit 100 on an alienware with fans maxed out.,wtf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what workload are you using to stress the cpu for that screenshot?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hmm that's weird for sure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ye i have higher than 2,6 in apexlegends for example but i have 90+c anyway, because frequency is high, power lower.","i need repaste cpu and gpu, there is problem too",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i used ts bench on throttlestop, 960m- threads 16, mhz-fixed",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"btw, i setup default tpl limits, and decreased undervolt to -70,3 and -60 for cache ( because i had in hwinfo, cache l1 errors ) and if i do disable turbo on throttlestop i have nothing on red while playing apex and still 144fps stable on 2,2ghz cpu, ofc with turbo many things turn red and sometimes drop from 4,2 to 3,6 ghz, didn't see drop to 0,8ghz like before but need to test it longer + i bought better thermalpaste so i repaste ( in 2-3days) then do more test probably.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"with that workload, the significant temperature differences between some of the cores suggest to me that that the thermal paste has been poorly applied or has been ""pumped out"" by repeated thermal cycles.","if you are handy with laptop disassembly, i would recommend repasting with a more viscous thermal paste.",i had a similar problem with a dell inspiron 16 plus with a 11800h and temperatures were greatly improved after repasting with ic7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"can be both,  in 2-3 days i will get new thermalpaste and will see.",for now i will use turbo boost off probably prevent too high temp.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you repaste?,how did it go?,i'm sitting here with a brand new nitro 5 with an 11800h that is running into thermal throttling even at -145mv and with a 40w power limit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"overall i did 4 things, repaste ( helped a bit but still throttled), 45w power limit and i limited gpu to 1400mhz ( because gou throttled too a lot) and using balaned power plan because it have different value of xxx( dont remember how its called but thanks to it cpu not go to high frequenzy too fast)
and additional  if not needed i turned turbo boost off, and with that settings never reach 80c.",sometimes i turn boost and with fans max have 85c max and not throttled but never used itvmoren than 1h,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

either one is overkill.,just keep the one you like.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"like what everyone says, both of these aios are more than enough for an i5-12600k if there is any difference it would be 1-2 degrees in favor of the arctic.","but with the galahad the rgb aesthetic  is so much better (plus the sl fan builds are very high quality)

lian li is the balance for appearance vs performance?,how much worse is the lian li?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sl fans?,the unifans?,i plan on sticking with the stock fans.,how are they?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not far behind, but with the arctic you get cooler vrm temps because of the fan mounted on the pump housing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the lian li aioâ€™s are known for having a pretty loud pump if thatâ€™s something that would bother you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think early models have had this issue.,i've gotten 2 galahads within the past 6 months and had zero issues,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how are the included fans?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the arctic fans are ok, iâ€™ve heard of people swapping them out for noctua fans.",never heard of anyone swapping out lianli fans for another make.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

itâ€™s a win but mediatek is still going to use tsmc for any of their designs that require tsmcâ€™s more advanced processes.,mediatek is taking a page out appleâ€™s playbook by diversifying itâ€™s supply chain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

aio?,could be a dead pump.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's dead man dead!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if it's running an aio - dead pump or clogged up block.,the latter has been a common issue recently due to contamination and growth in the loops of many popular aio's.,i'd consider warrantying the cooler if possible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes , but how do i check if the pumps dead?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can check pump speed in the bios or a monitoring app.,alternatively just give the tubing a slight squeeze when it's running and see if you can feel or hear liquid being moved through the tube.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, if it's overheating like that, that's like 99% probability it's dead.","i haven't had an aio in my life, but i've heard you can touch the pipes and feel if the coolant is flowing.","if you never did it before, though, you don't know how it feels when it *is* flowing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"on second thought, it could be some other problem, like the coolant evaporated or something.","i don't know much about aios, so it's kind of stupid of me to say that it's definitely the pump.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the temps are perfectly normal and there is no reason to lower the temps further.,my cpu temps are 85-95 while gaming and gpu temps are 70-80 while gaming,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"arc is only going to be, at max, a 3060/3060ti competitor, with a few titles maybe running 3070 speeds.","they'll probably bring that tier of pricing down, but nvidia and amd own the higher tiers and dictate pricing there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you need a gpu now buy a gpu now.,if you can wait a bit you should definitely wait.,"3 things can happen:
1) intel gpus have good price to performance and will be the smartest purchase
2) rtx 3000 gets cheaper due to rtx 4000 launching and thus has best price to performance
3) rtx 4000 has best price to performance",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they can't lower prices they haven't even announced yet, however they did say something along the lines of selling their gpus very competitively, but drivers may be a bit questionable if you don't play newer/commonly played games, which alone may push people away from arc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
arc gpus are going to be for people willing to go through a lot of growing pains to save a buck (basically early access hardware) or for enthusiasts looking to play with something new and half broken.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"most people that don't look much into pc hardware, probably don't even know intel is making gpus.","they'll put their price at a point where it is acceptable to take the risk of buying one, but not low enough that competitors really feel any pressure.","prices will drop anyways, though.",they just do in time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"while the rtx40 launch is getting close, they always start at the high-end cards first and it can take several more months before the cards that are meant to compete in the price range of arc come out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nvidia likely won't change pricing due to arc.,nvidia hates lowering margins and getting into price wars.,amd might lower prices on the low end like the gimped 6400 and 6500 might see $20 price drops,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it sounds as if you have an expensive system.,i9 11900k equipped with an rtx 3080ti with a z590 motherboard.,you should check with your system manufacturer first and see if you can't get them to fix the problem.,it honestly just sounds as if there is not enough thermal paste between the top of the cpu ihs cold plate and the bottom of the aio metal cold plate.,you need to have enough paste there in order for heat to transfer.,also it depends on how they mounted the aio cold plate.,excess mounting pressure from pushing down on the cooler can cause the paste to just pump out.,this can lead to inadequate cooling.,dota2 is a very light load.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is most likely because of an inadequate cooler for a high end processor.,i have the 11900k and it does run hotter than my friends 12900k.,mine runs 50c max.,i have the nzxt cooler.,also check thermal paste especially if itâ€™s a prebuilt as they cheap out on thermal paste.,hope this helped,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

go for the 12th gen. it'll be much faster and worth the extra money.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"12th gen is significantly faster

"that 11th gen chip has nice single core speeds, but it is only a quad core chip anyhow.",on some workloads it will be lacking because it only has 4 cores and some lastgen laptop chips go up to 16 cores (i9 and some of the i7s).,so the outcome of this is that sometimes you will notice no difference between the 12th gen and 11th gen and on the other workloads the 11th gen will be over 3x slower.,you say that you will run solidworks and other engineering programs.,typically the workloads that students face are not really that demanding even though the programs themselves can be used for heavier load stuff.,the 11th gen would probably be enough for you.,i personally would not buy it though.,the extra 200 can go a long way in keeping your machine usable for a few more years in this case.,you did not mention which i7 your alternative machine would have.,"there is a big different between them

[https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/processors/core/12th-gen-core-mobile-processors-brief.html](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/processors/core/12th-gen-core-mobile-processors-brief.html)

i7-1255u has two p-cores and 8 e-cores (this is not really significantly better than the 11th gen i7 you were considering)

and on the other end

i7-12850hx has 8 p-cores and 8 e-cores

in between those there are few more skus for various levels of performance needs.",for me personally (a lot of rather heavy excel and data analysis work) the sweet spot is around i7-12700h or at least i7-1270p if i want for me battery life.,"while you are at it, it is probably worthwhile for you to buy a computer that has upgradable ram or just enough of it.",i personally like to have at least 16gb but preferably 32gb ram on my work machines.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would recommend you looking deep at the hardware requirements of the various programs you plan on running on the laptop.,"11th gen vs 12th gen laptops is just a huge debate since we are talking cpu, dedicated gpu, ram and storage.",next issues are going to be display and energy source and redundancy.,"solidworks, autodesk products (autocad, fusion 360) etc all have their spelled out requirements.",on laptops you can substitute a gaming gpu for a workstation card but trying to use a intergrated gpu to substitute for a dedicated one is a mess waiting to occur.,(yes you can try to do it but will take you probably 20x longer).,look to each individual cpu specs and compare from there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12th gen no question.,"the performance difference is likely 2x that of 11th gen.

i had the exact same setup like you with an i9 10900k.,if you want cooler temps on the cpu youâ€™re gonna have to change your fan configuration.,(bottom intake) (top intake) (side exhaust) and set a custom fan curve!,also can you send me a picture of your fan setup/build.,if that doesnâ€™t help enough a slight undervolt on the cpu will help as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

like i said itâ€™s gonna take a bit of work but i would set the fans as following (bottom intake) (side exhaust) (top intake) i changed my fan setup on my build and noticed significant temp reduction on the cpu.,also undervolting will help a lot with cpu temps!,keep me posting on what you end up doing and if you need any help feel free to let me know.,best of luck :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also if you do plan on undervolting you can start with https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/17881/intel-extreme-tuning-utility-intel-xtu.html find a stable undervolt and then set it in the bios after trial and error on extreme tuning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

did you reinstall windows?,it will feel faster.,no?,slower.,get the pattern?,"going from 4460 to 12900 feels slower, didnt have time to strip w11 services.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i recently had my mind blown about how tolerant modern versions of windows 10+ are to things like this.,i come from the days of windows 95 when a cpu and motherboard swap always meant a format and reinstall of windows was in order.,well then my buddy showed me his test bench where he likes swapping out boards and chips to test different benchmarks on variable hardware.,"same ssd, same windows install, no issues whatsoever.","i probably still will format every time i do a major upgrade but i guess the moral of the story is, formatting doesn't really need to be done anymore.","i guess if you clogged up your pc with malware and other junk sure, but you'll probably just put it right back on anyway.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on how you handle your pc i guess.,i'm very picky with what i install in the first part and deactivate everything that wants to autostart.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i also switched pcie nvme 3.0 drive to faster pcie 4.0 one when i was switching from ryzen 3600 to 5900x.,maybe thats why it feels snappier.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
here is a secret build the iso of the windows version you want - then mount it and use that to reinstall windows and check keep files and data.,"it will reinstall windows and use the registry to ""reinstall"" your apps and required drivers.",its not a 100% reinstall but its better than not doing anything.,always fixed any issues i ever had.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"adding to the ""look into optane"" bit.",some could also be looking for alternate storage means.,primocache with l1arc set to metadata could be enough.,or primocache with something like a used 118gb optane 800p.,next step up is basically a 280gb 900p (good for a boot drive and not a ton else other than caching),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

been in the fence about jumping to win 11 with a similar intel 12th gen rig.,noticeable difference to 10?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, gaming wise no as well.",5900x vs 12700.,5900x is very comparable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is far from true.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well it is, itâ€™s just that it wouldnâ€™t be noticeable by just comparing os from what iâ€™m gathering",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is slower in single core performance and  multi core performance.,"however, is it slow enough to warrant the cost of ddr5, a new motherboard, and an i9 12900k?",probably not.,"like others have said, he should probably hold out for raptorlake because the leaks are claiming some healthy multicore performance gains.",not to mention windows 11 is continually  improving to fully utilize those slabs of e cores that raptorlake will pack.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

> i come from the days of windows 95 when a cpu and motherboard swap always meant a format and reinstall of windows was in order.,reinstalling windows sometimes still is a requirement or at least suggested.,"i remember months ago, people upgraded to alder lake and were suffering performance related issues entirely because they didn't reinstall windows, once they reinstalled windows the issues were gone.",i've also personally had issues at least twice that i can remember in the last few years where i had to reinstall windows because it wouldn't even load into windows after switching (although i'm almost certain it was always going from amd to intel where i was forced to reinstall).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah and they also fixed it with higher bandwidth thanks to infinity cache 2.0 and larger unified cache with better branch predictor and better ipc.,same as you would go from dual xeon to single epyc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"people can claim all they want, but the first few generations of ryzen chips all had latency issues even with extremely fine tuned memory.","they were good products, but they came with an asterisk.",something was always a compromise.,"5000 series was the first one without that latency issue, with virtually no downside making it the first great product from amd in a long time, and here hoping to some great cpu competition between the two companies for the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"disagree, i just retired my westmere system recently and it was perfectly fine.",you would be hard pressed to tell the difference in how fast am 11 year old sandy bridge system runs windows as compared to an alder lake system provided both had similar ssds.,you have to go back way before sandy bridge before windows cares about cpu architecture and not just io performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

most of the time spent getting data off a drive is spent locating a boatload of super tiny blocks of data.,optane drives are about 5-10x as fast at this vs the fastest nand drives.,on top of that optane drives don't suffer a penalty when doing reads and writes at the same time like nand drives do.,nand drives can lose \~90% of their performance for mixed workloads.,a 980 pro (not in review) and similar drives are hitting around 100 mbps at 4kqd1.,"[https://images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph11953/burst-rr.png](https://images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph11953/burst-rr.png) [https://images.anandtech.com/doci/11953/rm-s-960pro-2tb.png](https://images.anandtech.com/doci/11953/rm-s-960pro-2tb.png)

what nand drives are good for is moving a bunch of large blocks of data around.",think iso files.,i don't do this very often and most people don't either.,"[https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sf9ntwtzkpgddaqtpdxhbx-1200-80.png](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sf9ntwtzkpgddaqtpdxhbx-1200-80.png) [https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/as5vkaozexmxiqhvqjgkjx-1200-80.png.webp](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/as5vkaozexmxiqhvqjgkjx-1200-80.png.webp)

my personal take for most people is that optane is so expensive that it only makes sense to use it as a cache.",think $120ish for a 118gb intel 800p that gets put in front of your main boot drive with primocache or storemi or similar.,this will get you most of the benefit.,something like 90% of the hits to your system will be serviced by that cache drive.,you can also partition out a bit and have it serve as page file and remove the page file from your main drive.,best case scenario you end up with performance that's close to the sum of both drives combined.,"&#x200b;

even then it often does not make sense to use it as a cache... it's just... expensive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s more responsive and they have a pcie 4 drive as well.,"problem is the fastest optane drives are insanely expensive, using a smaller and cheaper one for a boot drive can make sense.",but everything is diminishing returns,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i want to ask a question if i may.,"i have a ryzen 5 3600 and i get random stutters/micro stutters ingame, could the cpu architecture be at fault for this?",i asked this multiple times online and people never believed me and said upgrading cpu's won't improve anything.,thank you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 it's plausible that zen2 felt more sluggish to use due to the split ccx design.,zen3 doubled the cache available to each core after all.,the fact that zen2 still needs a special power plan while zen3 doesn't is a red flag.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just went from sandybridge to a 12800hx, the difference is huge!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if you know which system it is, it's very easy to imagine differences that aren't significant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wow thanks.,"i will try to find used optane, maybe someones mom is getting rid of sons computer and dont know what optane is lol.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
could be a lot of things.,really hard to pinpoint.,"it could be as simple as a bad xmp profile, or a disabled xmp profile.",it could just be that your chipset drivers and power plans arenâ€™t up to date.,it could be that your ram kit is too low end and the increased latency is noticeable to you.,itâ€™s not as simple as â€œall ryzen 3000 ships stutterâ€ but more of its more prone to stutters due to latency.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>it's plausible that zen2 felt more sluggish to use due to the split ccx design.,it is not plausible that tens of nanoseconds of latency will make a system feel more or less sluggish.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"went from an i5-8400u to a desktop 5600g, the difference is definitely noticeable here as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

used server parts are usually flooded on ebay and occasionally amazon and newegg.,for a while 118gb 800ps were going for $70-something on ebay and p4801x were going for $70-something on newegg.,the 800ps are now 120ish and the p4801x cost more than the better 900p/905p drives.,"server pulls are fine, these drives just don't wear out - insane endurance.","optane is probably going to die as a technology - intel was losing money on optane, nand keeps on getting better (4kqd1 performance has gone up 2x on top end nand parts) and ram keeps on getting cheaper.","i'm hoping that cxl will be awesome in 1-3 years and at that point optane will have a new generation of product launched that's able to be aggregated across servers but... ehh

i bought enough to last me 10ish years.","it'll continue to make sense for caching data on a nas/file server, but at some point... ehh, just use a decent nand ssd, it's good enough (probably coming in the next 5ish years) since the pcie bus is a bottleneck [optane in memory mode with a special memory controller has way better latency and io characteristics vs what we're seeing in drives].",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not for 4k no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably not for 4k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™d just wait for 13th gen tbh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a 9900k is still a good cpu.,honestly i'd wait until 2024ish for arrow lake or zen 5 with cheaper ddr5 and  gen 5 ssds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i went from a 9900k to a 12700k and i game at 4k and since a lot of games especially the new ones will never see 144hz (and i have a 3090).,its not worth it unless you want to future proof your pci bandwidth for pci 4.0 for nvme ssd (new games that may require this) and pci 5.0 for future gpus (4xxx and 5xxx) series if nvidia fan.,otherwise just wait for the 14th gen or the 16th gen - so you can drop in the 15th or 17th upgrade.,i plan on going 13700k depending on the voltage and temps as my 12700k is a dud but only upgrading gpus for the next two cycles.,my computer is a show piece so i'm not interested in ripping it all apart which is why i will only consider the 4090 and not the power monster 4090ti and staying on the z690 for awhile.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
only with next gen gpus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

get a 12400 or 12600k instead

i mean that seriously, youâ€™d get like a minimal difference at such resolution cause youâ€™re just bound to the gpu at that point",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have ryzen5 3600 ans 3080ti i can run 4k 144hz on low demainding games and around 100-80 in middle/ high demanding games,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the only reason i can think of is so you can take advantage of pcie 4.0 and load times.,loading maps takes longer in 4k than 1k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i went from 8700k to 12700k and barely notice any difference.,"it might benchmark a little better, but if i did a blind test i couldnt tell.",waiting a couple months for 13th gen wont be any more of a difference either.,you'll just spend more on a newer cpu and enjoy the same gaming performance.,it's not like 13th gen will unlock some hidden fps that 12th gen wont.,"if you are just ready for an upgrade, 12th gen value is pretty good right now if you find a good sale.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
youâ€™ll get like 4% extra gpu performance just from switching to pcie 4 (9900k is pcie 3).,it gives better frame time consistency and alleviates weird stuttering inconsistencies.,is it night and day?,no.,"it does improve gaming though, but itâ€™s not like you need it.","itâ€™s a big upgrade, new motherboard maybe new ram.",oof.,personally i think it was worth it bc it allows me to do a chip swap for 13900k and itâ€™ll handle the beast that is a 4090.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"at 4k even ur 9900k, ie-12100 or i9-12900 will produce same fps coz all games are gpu bound at that resolution,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it will help  quite a bit with the 1% and .1% lows.,"it's not 'needed' but youve already spent like $1500 on a 3090, i wouldnt gimp it with a 9900k.",but realistically id just grab a 12700k because the performance difference in gaming between it and the 12900k is close enough.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
eh it actually could have made a difference.,"even at 4k, a faster cpu can still improve performance, may not be a lot but it will still be some improvement.","i remember the first few days of me upgrading to alder lakes, my 3080 actually beat 3090 on 9900k n benchmark (and even in some real-world gaming, yes at 4k.)",is the difference between 3080 and 3090 a lot?,not really but it's still something,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
since you wasted money on 3090 buy 12900ks too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
asking if itâ€™s worth it when this mf has a 3090,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
technically yes but not necessarily.,the 9900k was meant to be paired with 2080ti and itâ€™s replacement (3090).,12900k will be for ti versions of the 30 series and the non ti 40 series.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ah it might matter for some cpu limited scenarios like mmos but not much for most games.,almost always gpu bound.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it depends on the game and your framerate target.,"i target high refresh, 100-144 fps in all games, regardless of resolution on a 3080 ti.","i was able to keep my gpu near 100% usage while targeting ~100 fps when i upgraded from 9900k to 12700k in cpu heavy games like watch dogs legion (dlss, no rt).",that was not possible with 9900k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that's for sure.,thank you!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
alright!,my latest question would be if the kingston brand is one of the best ones?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and i mean, am i making a good choice buying that or nah?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok a couple questions need to be answered for best?,are you planning on oc?,is this for video games?,or production?,because that would determine the price to performance.,i know these questions may seem stupid but depending on those you may or may not see a difference,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"dude, you're using 12100f which will make no detectable difference at all with 2666mhz or 3200mhz (your mobo max).","here is my video comparing how ram frequency affect ultrahigh fps games: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vsintsbqyk&t=155s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vsintsbqyk&t=155s) although it is just tested in overwatch, it can still demonstrate something.",2666mhz is fine.,i'm using 12600kf + 4x8gb cl16 4000mhz (cheapest ram among all products of this class).,"so for your question, i think kingston brand is good.","brand does not make a big difference, because all these brands do not manufacture the ram chips.",chips are manufactured by other companies.,"as long as the cl# is low, the mhz is acceptable, and the price is affordable, it is good to go.","ps: kingston has 3200mhz cl16 rams, 60usd or so, cheap and nice: **kingston fury beast ddr4 16gb (2x8gb) c16 3200mhz desktop ram**, **sku# kf432c16bbk2/16**.",[https://www.kingston.com/datasheets/kf432c16bbk2\_16.pdf](https://www.kingston.com/datasheets/kf432c16bbk2_16.pdf)  you should go for them if you can make sure your cpu/mobo can enable 3200mhz rams.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there was another poster asking a similar question and the guy said the most he got out of his 3200, was 2933. 

but if you want no question i have a link for kingston thatâ€™s compatible to your build, according to their website


https://www.kingstonmemoryshop.co.uk/kingston-kcp432nd8-32-32gb-ddr4-3200mt-s-non-ecc-memory-ram-dimm

only problem is itâ€™s cl 22, and i think cl16 would be better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>are you planning on oc?,is this for video games?,"no, i'm not planning to overclock it but yeah it's definitely for gaming.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you tuned your memory yet?,you have samsung b die.,"hope youâ€™re not just turning on xmp and calling it a day, you can unlock significantly more fps with b die.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ok so because your board is a h410, it doesnâ€™t support an oc, i was checking things out.",the most you will get is 2666. so buying anything more than that will leave performance on the table.,also your 10400f only supports up to 2666 as well.,nothing wrong with kingston memory.,if you can find a 2666 with a cl 16 that would be the perfect set up for your motherboard.,"otherwise, if you want more performance you would need a mother board that can support higher ram, i suggest a minimum of 16gbs for modern gaming, but i found out 32gbs is better because it leaves head room for games like star citizen which uses 16gbs to run properly and more demanding games down the road",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks.,but 400 fps is max for overwatch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the one which i mentioned up is 2666 with a cl 16 which it's good i guess.,i'm also gonna turn on the xmp.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for the record, the 10100/10400 can easily do 3600, but only with z490/b560/h570/z590 motherboards as an other poster mentioned.",with anything else it's capped at 2666.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"pay attention to the amount of sticks, your board only has two slots.",donâ€™t accidentally buy a 4 stick.,just a friendly reminder,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that will be perfect for you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah the motherboard allows the overclock.,thatâ€™s why you can buy a 11th gen/ 10th gen boards and over clock up to 4000 on some of those.,but if you have no interest in oc the average pc person wouldnâ€™t know that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nah.,thats 2x8gb.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
only some of the i7-10700k can get up to 5.1 ghz maybe you don't have that one or you might have just don't try directly 5100 mhz start with 4.7 mhz see if it is stable or not and also hyperthreading will increase 9-10 celcius temp so keep in mind of that.,refer [this](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/intel-core-i7-10700k-cpu-review/2) guide for overclocking your i7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, even at stock you should be getting 12200 points at least in r23.","is a single core hitting 4,7, or are they all hitting that at the same time and roughly staying there for the whole r23 test?",i think the all core turbo is 4.7ghz.,reset your bios to stock and see what the score is with that.,maybe you messed something up in the bios.,"maybe your uncore ratio is set extremely low, or something else.",just reset entire bios to stock.,pres f9 when you're in the bios.,you oc'd so you should know how to get back in there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thank you so much, i found out the issue!",apparently only 8 of my 16 threads were active and on task manager it showed all 16 threads being used when they actually were not some reason.,i reset the bios and that fixed my issue!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

87â°c is normal when gaming and completely fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whatâ€™s the cpu cooler look like?,theyâ€™re usually inadequate on prebuilts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
let me guess its a 240mm aio (one fan sized cooler)?,anyways those temps are pretty normal for 11th gen and prebuilts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"87 is fine, don't worry about it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a one fan sized cooler would be a 120mm aio.,"a 240mm has two 120mm fans, hence 240mm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i5-12400(f).,performance difference is about 15% better on average in games but 40% for mt.,"yes its like $60+ more, so the 12100f is the price per gaming performance champ, but there will also be titles that really benefit from 6 cores and extra cache.","despite being a great price to performance cpu, i wouldnt really recommend the i3-12100 for anyone building a higher end rig, as it simply wont age well and will bottleneck you in some titles.","so get the 12400(f), unless you're going for 4k, and in that case youd be entirely gpu bottlenecked regardless",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™d say 12100. i assume youâ€™re making a gaming rig, and the extra money saved can be put towards something else, like psu or ram.",both cpus have similar haming preformance.,crazy how good i3â€™s are these days.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how expensive is the 3060 youâ€™re considering?,itâ€™s almost certainly a bad idea.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would upgrade the gpu before upgrading from 12100 to 12400.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have a 12100f and a 2060. the 12100f can handle most games with the 2060 at 1080p but can get caught off guard in select titles like cyberpunk 2077, where certain areas can cause the gpu utilization to plummet because the cpu cannot keep up.","however, these instances are fairly rare.","still, with a 3060, i'd advise going with a 12400 as it's just a better match overall.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12100 and 12400 have nearly identical gaming performance but if you want to stream youtube and use discord at the same time then more cores is best,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the i3 performs mostly the same as the 12400 paired with a 3060. not really necessary to go for the i5.,however i do like the extra cores for better multi tasking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[benchmark here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jod0xcsjbgq)

not sure how accurate they are but i'd take the extra 2 cores and 4 threads alongside the lower core clocks.","just for context my 3700x is still going along nicely but if i bought a 3600 with my current usage i'd be straight onto a 5800x3d, sometimes spending more now means you can skip a generation or two.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to be honest here i really much prefer pairing i3 12100 with a rtx 3050, rtx 3060 is much better with i5 12400/12500.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12400f some games benefit greatly from mt performance and those 2 extra cores will add quite a bit in that regard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

does the 12400?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah that doesn't surprise me with the improved ipc, 13th gen or zen 4 are going to be huge for me!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah that's why i said about not being sure how accurate they're but i'd say looking at the average fps it's correct (educated guess).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 12700k is faster but iâ€™d be surprised that you need the additional power unless itâ€™s for work.,you current cpu is still really fast.,you could easily wait at least another generation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it was thermal throttling because the bloody bios update.",the new update has disabled undervolting in intel cpus.,i didn't know that and so i didn't know my throttlestop was not working in the background (as it's setup on a task scheduler) .,i found a guide on re enabling the undervolting by extracting the bios file.,it was a lengthy process but got the jobe done.,"i undervolted my cpu again and everything is back to silky smooth fps <3 :d

2. enable rst + optane in the bios.","i'm using a asus prime z270m-plus (reboot after this change)
3. disabled csm support and put secure boot in windows uefi mode
4. made sure tpm and other security features are enabled (it's a bit of a mess with these settings on different motherboards)
5. in my m2.1 slot i have a regular ssd
6. the optane module is in my m2.2 slot
7. i put the m2.2 slot in ""rst controlled"" mode after enabling rst (i think this is the remapping feature intel talks about in the manual)
8. in the bios i had an option to put the m2.2 slot in sata mode i set this to disabled
9. during the installation of windows 10 i loaded up all the drivers from the ""f6flpy-x64.zip"" file (i put the extracted folder on a usb thumb drive)
10.",**important**: you need to make sure there is some free space at the end of the drive windows 10 will be installed on.,i did this by selecting the drive and then creating a new partition where i reduced the total size by 100mb.,"after you create the partition it creates 3 in total (efi, reserved and the main partition) and 100mb will be unallocated at the end.",then select the biggest partition to actually install windows 10 on.,"if you don't do this you can't install the optane software, it will throw an error during install.",when you're done installing windows 10 and look at the final partition layout it also created a 500-600mb one (for me at least) just before the 100mb unallocated space for recovery purposes but still leaving the end of the drive with 100mb unallocated that you require for the optane software.,"10. after installing windows 10 i first did all the windows updates
11. after the windows updates i installed the chipset drivers (link above)
12. after the chipset drivers i installed the optane software using setupoptanememory.exe (right click properties and see details should be version 16.8.4.1011)

just like with the 12900k, youâ€™re never going to see a game load all cores causing it to reach its pl2.","in fact, you wonâ€™t even see most games cause the 12900k to reach its 125 tdp simply because games donâ€™t require 16 cores.",you can imagine that no game is going to require the 24 cores of the 13900k.,"therefore, the maximum power draw of the 13900k literally means nothing for you if youâ€™re only gaming which i assume.",buy whatever the gpu manufacturer recommends,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

depends on how crazy you want to oc and how crazy your rig is my hx1200 has turned itself off 3 times i think more because of heat that being said 1000w should easily be fine iirc someone had a 3090 running on 450w ðÿ˜†,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you're probably better off with intel then.,"the 12700k is as fast as the 5950x is both premiere and resolve, and the 12900k is well [ahead](https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/articles/12th-gen-intel-core-cpu-review-roundup-2248/#adobepremierepro).",better platform across the board as well imo.,"you may go ddr4 or ddr5, you probably won't see too much of a difference as long as they're both at similar latencies.","intel also has quicksync, which can be an interesting alternative to nvenc where supported.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's pcie 4.0 so yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it will work out of the box with any 6xx board 100%.,you're either thinking of avx512 compatibility or something else.,xmp issues are from locked chips locking system agent voltages making it very difficult to run ram above 3200. there are individual board specific issues like gigabyte having to downgrade pcie lanes but every board will work without any bios updates.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">i have heard for a while that beyond 8 cores, ringbus starts losing it's shine in terms of low latency compared to mesh.","considering that intel already went beyond 8 cores on ringbus, with 10 on comet lake and essentially 10 on alder lake (each 4 core cluster shares one stop on the ringbus to my knowledge), would going to 12 mean that raptor lake might start struggling with it's ringbus interconnect?",tiger lake redesigned the ring bus.,"its now two parallel buses to double capacity, so scaling will be better than in comet lake.","i don't know what the ultimate limit is, but if capacity is doubled going from 10 to 16 isn't completely unreasonable, although probably not ideal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yea 8+32 would be what, like 16 ring stops?",the most intels had is 12 on some server broadwell and that didn't go well afaik.,"why don't they just do two 8-10 p core tiles, for 20 cores total?","wouldn't that be way simpler and cheaper than doing a massive 8+32 tile with 16 ring stops, and dealing with the added software complexity of hybrid architecture?",also having e cores on a separate tile is also not an option due to latency increase.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"somebody correct me if i'm wrong but isn't this related more to a ""distance"" rather than amount of cores?",making the node smaller and more dense while increasing the amount of cores should in theory result in roughly the same latency.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">and if arrow lake goes up to 8+32, i find it really hard to believe that they would stick with the ringbus with all those cores

"that makes sense, i was not aware of that improvement.",thank you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm pretty sure you can have a separate e core tile along with a p core tile, the latency won't be that bad considering intel is already using tiles for sapphire rapids.","the best part about using tiles the way intel is using them is that you can share cache globally across all tiles, afaik.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">somebody correct me if i'm wrong but isn't this related more to a ""distance"" rather than amount of cores?","no, just number of cores.","the distance is not significant, but each extra core adds more broadcast traffic.",eventually you fill up the bus and performance drops.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wouldn't this become a massive issue in terms of bandwidth and accessing the l3 cache?,"and wouldn't this also mean that all 8 e-cores would have to share the same l2 cache, which also causes worse l2 bandwidth and latency?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"from my understanding, its number of cores-per-stop and number of stops; 16 p cores such that 8 p cores share one stop is basically the same as 2 p cores such that each has one stop",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
e cores come in clusters of 4 with shared l2 cache and so count as one stop.,each p core has its own stop.,technically the gpu and memory controller also are stops too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ddr5 smokes ddr4 in most games.,"a lot of games are faster with quality well tuned ddr4, but the vast majority of people are not going to tune their memory at all, let alone good enough to beat quality ddr5.",the reason i recommended just getting some quality ddr5 is the general vibe i got from the op.,"that dude isnâ€™t tuning anything lol, he might not even have xmp enabled.","watch the first couple minutes of this video

keeping the same system for five years is an even bigger reason to buy a system with an upgrade path.,extend that five years to seven or eight while keeping up with performance.,i am certainly happy i bought a 1700x instead of a 6900k!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most people dont bother because all they got in the past was 5% extra.,now that intel has matched amd rhythm ( each generations i5 is as good as last generations i7 ) it matters most.,on a meteor lake mb you can buy an entry 14 core and upgrade to a 40 core arrow lake.,on a b650 you can buy a 6 or 8 core zen4 and upgrade to a 32 core zen5 ( and beyond ) + x3d gaming variants.,on a rpt lake mb you cant do anything.,"its the only game in town if you have ddr4, sure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think your points are valid.,i was somewhat on the same page as to who the 12700k or really who are the users that purchase intel i7 cpus.,i would guess that the cpu market is freakin huge.,and if we were to put this in terms of engines we could see who intel is marketing towards.,"i5 = i-4 - 4 cylinder engine

i7 = v6 - 6 cylinder engine

i9 = v10 - 10 cylinder engine

i think when we put it in terms of engines, we can see how they are positioning their product.",and i think amd tends to agree since they offer similar product range.,nvidia also agrees.,and actually!!!,nvidia segments their market even further.,"rtx 3050, rtx 3050ti

rtx 3060, rtx 3060ti

rtx 3070, rtx 3070ti

rtx 3080, rtx 3080ti

rtx 3090, and finally rtx 3090ti

and lets not forget their 10gb or 12gb versions..... 

so i think i7 are for users like system admins or mid level users.","users who need performance/power to run basic tasks, cad, some programs, and maybe a vm.","i7 is like standard for all c-level vps

vast majority of normal users use i5.",i9 is pretty much for the gear head or bosses who want the absolute best.,money/performance and power be damned!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think it has it's use cases.,its not an overly exciting product but i think it works for amd users who want an upgrade path.,"and well don't like to tweak/overclock, but then they are completely fine with re-flashing their bios and researching how to get their older motherboard to be compatible with the latest ryzen 5000 product.",so i can see why they released the products and why they provided so much legacy support on their hardware.,i can see amd's strategy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if you do buy now, worst case you end up updating to a 13th gen cpu since the current boards are supposed to be able to support them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"seems like you arenâ€™t in an urgent need of a new computer, so i suppose you wait.","i would personally give you this advice - buy what you need, when you need it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
given the fact we are basically at the eol for 12th gen as well as the rtx 3000 series id definitely hold of on upgrading given the fact the new cpus are probably gonna be a whole new socket as well with the power rumours for the 4000 series id say wait for the launch of the new hardware,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13th gen announcement gonna be late september and availability 2-3 weeks later.,so if you don't mind waiting 2.5 months then 13th gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'd wait.,"even if you end up not buying 13th gen for whatever reason, you'd probably find some good discount on 12th gen or at least get a used cpu at reasonable price.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just wait, the 7600k is really dated now, but you donâ€™t need anything special to drive the 1060, and raptor lake, zen 4, lovelace and rdna 3 are only three months away.","with secondhand gpu prices crashing, weâ€™re looking at one of the best times in history to build a pc just around the corner.","just donâ€™t buy new gpus now, theyâ€™re all horrendously overpriced given itâ€™s been 18 months since the beginning of the generation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
upgrades to boards are far more fun than upgrades to cpus now.,most people probably have too much cpu anyway.,i love having six nvme drives on my current board.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"with rumors that intel will be raising cpu prices when raptor lake/13th gen launches, i'd wager getting a 12700k during the holiday season sales would be best.","i'm sorta in the same boat and with rumors of the 13600k benchmarks, i'm keen to see what intel announces in september.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can i vote to buy a 13th gen then sell my 12th gen?,bc that seems like a good play.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you are aiming for something like a high end i7 or something even better, you can go for 12th gen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wait for 13th gen to buy a 12th gen for cheaper,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the question i'd ask (before ignoring my question/justification and buying and upgrade anyway) is: ""at the moment is your cpu sufficiently impairing your performance in common use cases to justify the expense of an upgrade?""",if yes then go for it.,if no then wait.,"another option worth considering particularly if you're keeping the 1060 and the only intensive workload you use the pc for is gaming is a 12400f + b660 combo, probably the best bang for buck at the min if you don't care too much about memory oc or oc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if raptor lake introduces e-cores to the lower end (like i3-13100 and i5-13400) then it might be the best performance you can buy regardless of what cpu you choose.,"couldn't hurt to see what it has to offer, only a few more months at this point",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when i think about upgrading or waiting i think about my backlog of games i want to play.,probably going to be a while before i play anything that needs a high spec pc so waiting a bit longer isnâ€™t really going to hurt.,"if you canâ€™t play what you want to, then itâ€™s time to upgrade!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a 7600k and 1060 6gb isn't new hardware but it probably still plays anything you want at 1080 medium/low with good framerates.,my older desktop is still using a 1060 6gb because the monitors i use with it only support up to 1080/60hz and it can push that just fine for anything i want to run.,"your system is old enough to be thinking about upgrades, but it doesn't deserve the capital old in my opinion.",(obviously i voted wait).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you have the luxury to ask that question then wait.,if you have to have a pc now then get one.,one thing i will say is that a 40 series and 13th gen pc will abosuletly demolish over a 12th gen and 30 series pc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
might as well wait for 14th gen while youâ€™re at it.,just buy now and enjoy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your i5 7600k and gtx 1060 is still nice for gaming in 2022 so u can wait for 13th gen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a pc is obsolete the day you buy it if you need it now but it now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i would wait for 13 gen because it's a great boost of performance compared to 12. other than that, i'd also give a bit more time to ddr5 for many reasons.",also the rumoured release date of 13 gens is close to the (again rumoured) release date of nvidia's new 40xx chips.,just saying.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my suggestion - never buy first generation of anything
12 gen can be said as first generation of new performance core and efficiency core combination",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it doesnâ€™t really matter if itâ€™s used for gaming, your gpu will bottleneck like crazy.","just buy the 12 gen, you will have a peace of mind, the 12 and 13 donâ€™t have much a leap either like the amd 3d cache cpu which could potentially future proof, so just get the 12 gen if you are into intel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i personally with an i7 8700k and gtx 1070 would wait for meteor lake and 4000 series,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hey if you wait for 13th gen the 12th gen chips will drop in price so either way waiting is a win win.,new high preforming chip or cheaper still relatively high performing chip,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel is planning price hikes.,"buy now, while your money is still worth something",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i voted upgrade now because the 12th generation was a big tech cap.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wait, always wait.","by the time 13th gen is out, you might as well wait for 14th gen.
not a whole lot of difference between them, but i'd wait for one with more cache.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you could buy 12th gen now since it's readily available.,"if you want to upgrade to 13th when they come out and can find one at a reasonable price, buy one and sell your 12th gen cpu.",both gens run on the same platform and 13th will just be a drop-in upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's not old.,sandy bridge and older is old.,you could always look for a cheap i7-7700 as that is your major bottleneck at 1080p.,are you wanting 4k gaming or video creation?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we are brothers lol i have a 7500 with a gtx 1060 6gb.,im in the same situation you are in!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"buy, or you will spend all your life waiting for something better",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there's always something better around the corner,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the advice!,"my old system isn't bad, but it's time to upgrade, and would love to buy the 13th gen directly after the lunch!",without waiting again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no!,13th gonna be enough lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"14th gen desktop cpus supposedly will release in q3/q4 2023 but with current state of intel 4 node (pretty bad) it will most probably get delayed to 2024.

that's too long.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's cool, i think i'm going to wait for the 13th gen, and buy directly after the announcement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's a good news.,thanks.,i'll wait fot the 13th gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you so much!,"i'll not really in an urgent need, but in some games like cod warzone, i'm dropping fps a lot and is not running on windows 11 really well because of drivers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"alright, thank you!",ðÿ˜š,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just because the next generation of something is out (or about to come out) does not in any way  mean that the current product is ""eol"".","eol, by definition, is when the manufacturer stops supporting it and declares it eol.","currently, 8th gen intel is still not eol.","nvidia is still releasing driver updates for 1600/2000 series as well - again, not eol.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"intel usually doesn't give discounts on last gen tho.. 

only happened with 10th gen for some reason.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to be honest, my cpu of still fine, buy in some games, i have a lot of fps drops, and can't do multitasking when i'm playing.",that's why..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

13th gen is around the corner..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i will not wait anymore after the raptor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's coming in 2 months..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you want to wait till 13th gen then go ahead,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would wait to the release of 13th gen and buy 12th gen. the prices will probably drop.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what are you planning for lunch?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there's only really one bad side of waiting - intels arc gpu are such failures, they're already reflecting its financial failure by pumping 12th gen prices as of right now.","it may get even worse, once they actually throw current inflation trend into revenue calculations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">but with current state of intel 4 node (pretty bad)

the 13600k will be a rocking cpu having 4 more cores than the 10 core 12600k.,"it will be worth to wait just a bit longer, if the price isn't too high.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"iâ€™m a big fan of getting as much time as you possibly can out of your hardware, and happen to have a very similar build to yours (i3-8100 + gtx 1060 6gb), and itâ€™s definitely long in the tooth, but it also does everything i need it to, so iâ€™m in no rush to upgrade until iâ€™m out of university and financially stable again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12600k is 269.99 right now and says msrp is 342.50,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's understandable, if i were in your shoes i'd go for it :).",if we always wait for the next best thing we never end up upgrading.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
warzone likes atleast 8 threads for a usable experience and 12 for a comfortable one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's what i am considering.,the 11th gen deals during the 12th gen were honestly pretty good.,hoping for a repeat of that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

+ inflation
+ high demand",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why not itâ€™s only money,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it doesn't make sense to swap with what you have.,if you're chasing more performance flip the 12900k for a $100 loss and grab a 13900k in 3 months.,swapping around for better bin cpus is pointless outside of benchmarks/for competitive overclockers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why should we judge if you should swap or not?,decide for yourself if you're fine with your chip capabilities.,you're restrained by your cooler anyway.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
was it is with this obsession on numbers that actually donâ€™t make a difference?,itâ€™s a waste of money and time.,changing you cpu for better binning?,for what at the end?,"heck, you already lost money by buying a 12900k instead of a 12700k and now to sell it at a loss for maybe 0.5% gain in a synthetic benchmark.",itâ€™s your money but itâ€™s such a waste.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i know the feeling/problem.,"i had the same shit when i upgraded last summer, i was chasing some score (i cant even remember anymore because it usually just matters to you when you're really into it at that moment) and i ended up buying 2x more cpus of the same brand in hopes of getting a better bin, ended up getting 2x worse bin then the one i got (turns out i was on a pretty good bin after all but you always want better).","the thing is, i personally was comparing my scores to people on [overclocking.co.uk](https://overclocking.co.uk) forum... what most overclockers dont tell you is what cooling they are using.","most people there are really extreme, they ain't using no 420aio cooler, no, they are so fucking extreme they have a sepearate unit that is the size of a god damn pc itself and they put that unit on the balcony or hang it outside the window so it sucks in cool air and then they have tubes that go a long way into their pc.","you cannot compete with this cooling, and the reason their scores are so brutally good is because of this cooling, the bin has little to do with it at that point.","and at the end of the day, the performance we are talking is literally maybe 1% faster, it means you might get 1-2 fps more in games or save a couple of seconds in a rendering scenario.","its not something worth chasing but i know the feeling once you are ""in the zone"" you just gotta get it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what is so special about meteor lake?,genuine question,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"don't listen to this dude, raptor lake is a big upgrade over 12th gen. they increased core number, it is not just a refresh like 10th and 11th series.",meteor lake may be cool but it is still a long way until we see them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm on 9900k and 3090. definitely won't be upgrading the gpu this gen, but i am definitely wanting a cpu refresh, and might pull the trigger on ddr5 as i cannot find a board with dual thunderbolt 4 and ddr 4...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's going to be on intel 4 (7nm) not intel 7 (10 nm) which is what 12 and 13 gen are.,which should be much more power efficient for laptops.,if i had to buy something windows today i would get the amd 6000 series.,a meteor lake chip with its p/e cores and thunderbolt 4 would change that.,also the intel discrete gpus should be perfected by the time meteor lake comes out.,i feel like intel has been working towards really good things and meteor lake puts them all together.,intel 4 + thunderbolt 4 + discrete gpu.,thunderbolt 4 also has a pci 3.0 built in so it can support an egpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"its the first 3d tiled chip for consumers

it would mark the begining of a new era",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we will have to see.,it feels like a refresh to me anyway.,raptor lake kind of just looks like alder lake plus.,i could be wrong.,"it isn't out yet, so maybe i shouldn't have even written this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
meteor lake is just starting engineering sampling and bench testing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
honestly if i had a 9900k i would actually try to hold on until like 2024 for arrow lake or zen 5 3d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> also the intel discrete gpus should be perfected by the time meteor lake comes out.,"no product is perfect, don't get too hyped.","also, it's funny to think of mtl's gpu as discrete but i understand why you say that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i feel like you missed the most important aspect of mtl, namely that itâ€™s a pure chiplet architecture.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
based on the early leaked benchmarks it doesnt seems to be a refresh.,"increased ipc, core count, maybe power consumption.",at 300 bucks the 13600k may be one hell of an upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is a return to the old tick tock schedule.,raptorlake is the refined and improved version of alderlake.,"meteorlake will most likely have bigger improvements, but wonâ€™t be as refined as 15th gen will be.",also meteorlake requires ddr5 which means youâ€™ll have to get all new memory.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
refresh doesnt have to be like 9th gen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"dude, raptor lake isnt even launched yet you are talking about meteor lake.","it is a long way until we will see it, most likely q4 2023.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no shot i'm waiting that long.,i've suffered through long enough compile times as it is with this thing.,"i was intending on going 12th gen but the one i ordered had a faulty mobo and they didn't have any stock to replace it, so i had to wait longer than i wanted to already.",if arrow lake or zen 5 are exciting enough then i'll happily upgrade again then.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i do mean the actual discrete gpu's intel just launched.,"i'm confident the drivers will be ready by the time mtl comes out, and pairing the two together would hopefully be very impressive.","mtl's igpu should be 128eu, so that should be great as well.",or even use thunderbolt 4 to connect to the gpu as an egpu.,these three different products coming together gives me hope.,this is what i want in a laptop.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"true, thing is that it has been taped out and its in testing.",its a long road.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah true, still i'd hang on until meteor lake because ddr5 will almost certainly have way higher speeds (6400-7200 cl36 or lower kits) and an upgrade path to arrow lake (both will be on lga 1851).",overall i think hot chips next month with intel probably talking about mtl & arl will be interesting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i hope thunderbolt 5 will be ready by the time meteor lake comes out next year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i really hope and would love to see a paradigm shift in power consumption for mobile chips with mtl.,there are a lot of creative opportunities with big little as it matures.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i really hope the xe lpg graphics tile is based on the upcoming battlemage uarch.,"if it's based on alchemist, then it will be a oof.","but given it's low-power gaming(lpg), then it will probably be a alchemist adaptation but focused on perf/w.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rumor mill seems to point to lunar lake and nova lake being the perf/w revolutions.,gonna be great given that they will use intel advanced nodes such as intel 18a/20a and tsmc n3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's all good ol gen12 til 2025 druid afaik.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm not going to go digging for the source as it happened months ago but i'm pretty sure intel insinuated mtl igp was battlemage based.,i think they called it xe-2 or 2nd generation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"meteor lake already moves to a new node, intel 4, as well as bringing tiles (chiplets) to intel mainstream devices.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the meteor lake specs that igors lab leaked said x^e2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel 4 is a node focused on high performance, not power efficiency.",it doesn't even have any high density/low power libraries.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[intel 4's hp libraries are denser than intel 7's hd libraries](https://www.techinsights.com/blog/correctly-understanding-intel-4-scaling-value).,and there will be [20% perf/watt improvement](https://semiwiki.com/semiconductor-manufacturers/intel/314047-intel-4-presented-at-vlsi/).,and there will be not one but two new core architectures.,meteor lake will absolutely be vastly better in perf/watt than raptor lake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i mean, of course they are denser, and yeah, meteor lake will of course have better perf/watt, but that doesn't mean lower power consumption; alder lake has 2x better perf/w against rocket lake sometimes whilst still using loads of power.","people apparently fail to understand this but something can be both energy efficient and power hungry at the same time, as that's defined by the relationship between power consumption and performance -not power consumption alone.",and that's what i'm expecting of meteor lake and it's performance oriented node.,"vastly better power efficiency and very high power consumption, ie, incredibly good performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nodes themselves dont have any characteristic power consumption

alder lake having barely lower power consumption than rocket lake has got nothing to do with intel 7

meteor lake having """"very high power consumption"""" has got nothing with intel 4 having only high performance libraries",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

keep in mind that gb5 gets a significant boost with ddr5 memory.,this score seems in line with ddr4 12900k scores.,though it should have been better than average adl i9 considering the 5.3ghz average p core frequency,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's some guy from china, you can read all his posts here:

i cant wait for the 13900ks 6 ghz edition,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
jesus and how are we supposed to cool it?,i can barely keep my 12900ks cool.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and probably over 320 w power consumption in oc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i expected the multi gain to be better here considering plus 4 more cores but i guess it's ok, 4 more e core is like 20%, i guess it makes sense if you count the e cores as 1 and p cores as 2, you get similar gain but it is higher clocked on top too so the gains don't seem that impressive overall.","i am more interested to see what improvement the memory controller will bring because alderlake isn't that great with higher speed ddr5, at least with current chips and mid 6000 is probably the best you can do as something you would run daily.","i hope these can easily do 7000 and maybe even 8500.

as a 12700k owner, looks like the only sensible upgrade would be 13900k and i probably won't bother with that either.",quite happy with 12700k and i paid below msrp for it.,"hopefully these are priced as well as alderlake, specially because looks like amd is going for really high pricing with zen 4.

i hope they run cooler than 12900k.","i can air cool 12700k with the ilm bracket and noctua u12a just fine with comfortable temperature during synthetic benchmarks (low 80c and it's hot here right now) and it idles at 32.

main selling point is the cache increase.",ddr5 even the best kits at 6000 have like 60-70ns latency and to get lower it can get very unstable and just not worth it so larger cache can counteract that and it is quite a big deal in gaming loads which i expect these to have better gains over alderlake than just the typical 10% increase.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is the one.,this is when i finally upgrade my 4790k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but it's multicore performance is worse than the 12900k.,how?,"same number of cores, and faster p-cores.",are the e-cores that much worse?,how is the 12900k like 800 points faster?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

same here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i would be sceptical, nvidia 4070 is rated for same amount of performance as 3090 ti, so it will likely exceed far more power consumption.",but we have to wait for offical confirmation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just use set appropriate power limits if it isnt

or just get 13700",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ofcourse it will be.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why would you clock them the same?,all the benchmarks will compare them at stock advertised speeds.,"overclock is a lottery, not every sample will get same results.",stock performance is what you are buying.,everything else is a bonus.,i am sure you can get 12700k to match this score with an overclock but is it going to be as stable or as cool?,who knows how much oc 13700k can get or not either.,that's not a good way to test.,"as soon as you oc, you  are comparing the specific samples and not the product.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8+8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is barely?,all these chips run below 100c.,"however if you pair a 3090 with a 12900ks with no aio and a cramped case, things will heat up.","opposite end though, a 12900ks in a case alone with an aio and you are still heating up?",then the cpu has a fault.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
final ddr3 i7 to final ddr4 i7.,definitely a sick upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"same node, same arch, bigger cache and higher frequency.",there is no way it will use less power than the 12900k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's a nice psu capacity headway you got there, shame if something happened to it.",- nvidia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
upgrade it to to 13700k?,youâ€™ll be able to buy a i5 15400 with the performance of a i9 12900k by then.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"raptor lake's memory controller will run ddr5 faster before overclocking, 4800 i think.","that said, it's still not going to make ddr5 itself any faster.",and if you're just gaming you're unlikely to notice any difference.,a 15% speed increase in cpu performance could be far more beneficial.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they look like qualification samples, which are typically finalized designs, but minor changes from microcode and bios tweaks can and do often result in performance differences at launch.","it'll be very close, though.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
people say this every time and rarely is it true.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, this is a completely untrue meme.",people said this constantly about zen 2 in 2019 and lo and behold it actually was exactly like the leaks.,"people also said the same things about alder lake when anandtech had the preview months ahead, also, exactly the same performance except for a couple pro applications that nobody here on reddit actually uses.",es chips at production clocks aren't going to have any instructions or features disabled.,"maybe these scores are with a bad cooler or something, but thats literally the only way intel could be sandbagging these current leaks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

zero ipc but it have 60% more l2 cache,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if it wasn't clear enough, you wouldn't find this in store by then.",only used if you're fine with that.,2 years is a long time and alot of new processors is going to be released before you'll upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sure you could do that, i guess it depends on what youâ€™ll use it for.",personally i would just wait for the 5 year period to be over.,youâ€™re looking at a $200+ investment for 15% that will last you 2 years (if that does end up being the increase).,maybe use that money to upgrade all around every 4 years instead of 5. just an option.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how many 5 years can you live from now on?,seriously,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this made me laugh harder than it should,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you increase cache size, the ipc will go up in some workloads.",some workloads might see a regression if latency increases however...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"2-year-old cpus are commonly available at stores (albeit, not at great prices)

"yes i hear you, but i could use the same socket one more time and donâ€˜t have to upgrade my 64gb ddr4 to ddr5 in the near future.",itâ€˜s more like a at least 5 years in between.,but i do upgrade gpus earlier sometimes if it makes sense.,did upgrade from 1080 to 3070 with my 6700k one year early.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you are comparing an es sample with imature bios with a released cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also the es was on z690 with like only 1 bios update to even enable 13th gen support.,it's definitely not final performance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"he's right though, ipc won't increase in that specific workload.",ipc in games or other cache sensitive loads will see benefit though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
early ess are those with very low clock.,this is obviously not one of those.,"we are not far from launch, this is probably identical to the final variant.",it's not going to clock higher than this on current node.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yes ,ultra performance ,bios doesn't limit cpu ,but as know you dell fan profile is too bad ,fan does start spinning when cpu already reaches 90+ ,so its better to use cool profile which limits cpu at 80% ,also fan is little bit aggressive in cool profile


however using intel dynamic tuning machine learning,you will notice ,cpu max turbo frequency gradually decrease while contant load,it means without reaching 100 degrees ,your cpu will be running on turbo for more times


for example

a task needed a cpu max turbo frequency under full load for 5 seconds ,then cpu will complete its task before reaching 100 degrees ,and in other ,cpu will not run at 100% power,so it will take 6-7 seconds to complete the same task ,but in long term,its very beneficial,but eventually if you put load on cpu for long ,it will still reaches to 100 degrees",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
interesting.,"so you think it's best to use dell's ""cool"" with intel dynamic tuning machine learning?",i don't think my computer is capable with intel dynamic tuning because it's not listed under my list of available software/drivers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in cool profile ,you will loose mutlicore performance 

giving my laptop example

my laptop cpu is 1115g4

under ultra performance ,both core at 4.1ghz 
but under cool profile both core at around 3.8 ghz then as time passes ,it will decrease ,but your laptop temperature will be around 70-80 degree

with turbo off - both core at 3ghz with 60-63 degrees under full load


since my laptop cpu is weak for games 
so i turned of turbo , because 3ghz is enough for basic task and it gives more backup

my laptop backup with 41whr battery gives 5+ hours backup,and you can increase your backup further by using edge for browsing and movies and tv for watching movies",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"games were unplayable in ""cool"" profile.",i was getting like 12 fps lmao.,"i might try ""optimized"" next time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it means ,dell changed that profile for everyone,have you noticed your cpu frequency ,your cpu must be running below base frequency ,just like mine

my cpu base frequency is 3 ghz and turbo 4.1 ghz,on cool profile ,under load it runs around 2.5 ghz ,sometimes it lowers to 1.6 ghz 

&#x200b;

i dont know why dell not giving fan control to users,and why they dont want to use fan ,my laptop fan wouldnt start untill it reaches 70+ degrees,not with recent bios ,fan is not reaching at full power even after reaching 100 degrees ,(for fan to run at full speed ,your cpu need to be 95+ for about 10+ minutes ,and the moment fan reach full speed ,cpu already throttled too much )

&#x200b;

you will not feel any difference in ultra performance and optimized

&#x200b;

either turnoff turbo or use intel dynamic tuning ,and if you are expert use throttlestop and just lowers your multiplier ,decrease by 2 means ,your cpu max freuquency will decrease by 200 mhz",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

youâ€™re concerned about power consumption when using a mora?,youâ€™re way over concerned about an unreleased product.,"if youâ€™re advanced enough to do custom water, you know where to find the answers to your questions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're correct in saying with alder lake there is very little diffrence between an alder lake chip (say the 12700k) being allowed to use 125 watts vs it's full 190 watts for gaming.,"if you wanted to set a hard limit in the bios you'd set pl1 and pl2 at the same value (like 125 watts) and still get basically all of the performance, although you probably don't need to do that as even if power unlocked games won't typically draw significantly more power than needed (so a pl1/pl2 cap does basically nothing).",only other thing i'll add is this might not be true for raptor lake like it is for alder/zen 3. rocket lake for instance still draws a ton of power while gaming.,"now raptor lake will probably be the same as alder lake behavior (rocket lake was a werid exception), but you'll want to check reviews to make sure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pl2 is the tdp.,"adl runs at pl2 indefinitely, stock.",12900k uses 90w and loses by 1% vs 60w 5800x3d.,"12900ks uses 150w and wins by 1% vs 60w 5800x3d

why are you buying 12900k for gaming?",and limiting it?,in 4 months 13600 will beat it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"games won't really pull more than 100w with your cpu, even a 12900k, simply because none actually use all the cores available at high usage.","the 200w numbers, pl2 and max power draws are really for 100% usage scenarios, lilke stress tests, video encoding, etc.",you will never normally hit that in a game.,so there is very little need to worry about that.,on the other hand a 4080 will probably be pulling 500w which is the far bigger concern.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the way you talk about pl1 and pl2 is a bit confusing.,"those are limits, not states.",the cpu uses what it needs up to the power limit.,"how it works is that the cpu can consume up to pl2 as long as the average power consumption over a period defined by ""tau"" is still under pl1.",when the average reaches pl1 the peak limit also drops to it.,"this is what makes pl1 the thermally relevant number, the average heat output can never be higher than pl1.",the reason it doesn't matter for gaming is that games do not stress the cpu very much.,but the key there is *it doesn't matter*.,your pl1 can be 300w and the cpu won't use any more power in most games than if the pl1 is 125w.,however limiting pl2 might be a bad idea because workloads tend to be bursty.,so there might be short peaks over pl1 and if you have set pl2 to the same value the cpu will have to slow down to keep those peaks at the limit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are way wrong on amd's am5 power.,it maxes out at 170w tdp with a maximum power draw of 230w.,"from what amd has said, that's just the socket capability and there will be very few, if any, cpus that max out the socket... probably the high core count zen 5 cpus, but zen 4 *might* max out at 125w tdp/170w real for 16 cores.","intel engineers have been pushing the silicon to the limits with maximum power draw for their entire careers, i wouldn't expect them to change.","if you're concerned about efficiency, zen 4 will likely dominate raptor lake at the high end... lower down is harder to judge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thx for the reply,

no as i clearly said in the first post cooling is not my main concern it is for silence and cooling to prolong life expectancy for cpu and gpu not for oc'ing.",it was about the pl1 and pl2 states in gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thx for the reply,

yes your right i have to wait till the official release raptor lake but according to this link:

[https://videocardz.com/newz/intel-core-i5-13600k-es3-raptor-lake-14-core-cpu-tested-in-cpu-z-and-cinebench](https://videocardz.com/newz/intel-core-i5-13600k-es3-raptor-lake-14-core-cpu-tested-in-cpu-z-and-cinebench)

might even be higher tdp then expected which is a bit of a concern for me but if i can set the pl1 and pl2 at say 100 watt this should not impact gaming in comparison with full power draw at least i hope so...weird all of a sudden in a time with big energy crisis the release of rtx4000 series which will consume a lot as well as the new cpu's from intel and amd (raptor lake and am5).",100% will undervolt the rtx4080 hopefully around 60 to 120 watt less without sacrificing performance to much.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"thank you,

yes your right it is a bit confusing for me with the pl states i assume with the raptor lake cpu's it will be similar to the alder lake cpu's when it comes down to pl states i was a bit concerned about the tdp and power draw.",i think have a slight better understanding now about the pl states.,just have to wait till both ryzen 7000 cpu's and raptor lake cpu's reviews are out and then make my final decision and this will be mainly focused on which of the 2 cpu lines will have a better efficiency when it comes down to power draw.,i think this thread is solved for now.,"thank you to every one  who shed light to my questions, i think i shouldn't be to worried about pl states when gaming.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thx for the reply,

wrong?",i did mention in my previous comments i do know according to info online the ryzen 7000 might go as high as 230watt but from my understanding this is for the top tier cpu ie 7950x while the 7900x is locked on max 125watt but who knows because what the real spec reveal.,i just have to wait till both raptor lake and ryzen 7000 will be official released and we have reviews on it.,i will go with the most efficient cpu combining with a rtx4080.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"pl is a limit, not a target.",just leave at default and forget about it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"life of cpus is essentially indefinite, so this is not something you should be concerned about.",doubly so for games which will rarely generate substantial cpu power load on a 16 core cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
should average 120w gaming unless the new power saving tech intel implemented is really good.,boost is going up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, its max 1.3 x tdp.",so the 16core might hit that in mt unless you run it in eco mode.,if you want just gaming x3d is probably the way to go but who knows when that will be out.,13700 might be 5% better vs 5800x3d.,probably better than zen4 too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

which motherboard do you have?,when you go to the bios and look for cpu settings what does it say on power limit 1 and power limit 2 (may be called short duration boost power max or something similar)?,edit: or if bios is scary you can install hwinfo and see what it reports for cpu package power during the cinebench runs.,"edit: and while you are at it with hwinfo, you could also check the maximum cpu temperature during the cinebench run.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

usually an aio watercooler would be recommended for a build like yours.,the 3090 rtx will be outputting large amounts of heat in your case and the coolermaster hyper 212 heatsink may not cut it.,you have two options.,option 1. replace the hyper 212 with an aio.,maybe arctic liquid freezer 2 240mm can get you 30c idle 55c loads.,the higher versions may or may or may not perform better.,or stay the same.,280mm upto 360mm and 420mm.,option 2. lower your warzone fps cap to 60 or 90 or 120. whatever gets the heat down.,"if that 3090 is running full tilt, the whole system will be a heatsink.",option 3. you can tweak some internal bios settings (lowering voltage) but it won't help much.,i think the big rtx 3090 is the heat culprit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"check your cooler connections, 10700k is easy to cool.",i have it on a sff case with a sff cooler a  big shuriken 3 and while gaming is around mid 60c and stress test it hits mid to high 80s.,my ambient temps are around 30c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
buy a good cooler.,"ak620, nh u12a, d15(s), thermalright pa 120 or the best price/performance cooler that noctua has to offer the nh u14s (a bit older but very decent for it's \~65 bucks).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"thanks, i was told aio liquid coolers are not too effective but i'll look into teh arctic liquid freezer 2.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i have the alf 2 240mm (120mm dual fan version) they sell the 280mm (140mm dual fan) and then 360mm (120mm triple fan) and again 420mm (140mm triple fan)

the alf2 radiator is thicker.",my 240mm is equivalent to a 360mm (triple 120mm fan) aio.,because the radiator is thicker.,so the volume of liquid in the radiator is roughly the same as larger 3 fan radiators.,my alf 2 is mounted on my i7 10700k just like yours.,"except i only have a 3070ti (relatively low heat) compared to your much beefier beefcake 3090 rtx =p

yeah that hyper 212 heatsink just is too tiny.",single fan.,with the air moving over it already supercharged (heated) by your gpu.,it will struggle.,i locate my alf 2 at the front of the case with tubes down (tubes down to control the air bubble) and it draws in fresh cold air cools the cpu very well.,55c under load is with an overclock to 5.1ghz all core.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"its not your cpu cooler thats the problem, its your case.",getting an aio will make things even worse since the radiator will restrict airflow even more.,"ive been in your situation, my 3090 outputted a shitload of heat and my old o11 dynamic couldn't handle it.","swapped to the torrent, cpu temps while gaming dropped by 25-30 degrees",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i tries with the glass open towards the top and temps dropped 25* so i'm thinking it's the case too.,i can get by with keeping the case open when i play for now but will start looking for a bigger more breathable case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"lancool 2, lancool 3, bequiet 510dx, fractal torrent, phanteks p400 mesh, phanteks p500 mesh are basically your options.",not many cases that can accommodate a 3090 ðÿ˜•,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the roseville case i have is similar to those.,"lots of mesh on the front, top and back.",i even 3d printed a custom 80mm fan shroud to mount to the empty slots to  draw air out from the gpu fans.,i'll need to get a pic and post but i think all in all the cases need much higher cfm's to keep up with a 3090's heat generation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

might look similar but no clue about the mesh.,if it's too restrictive then it stops all airflow.,"also rgb fans don't help at all, they have smaller blades so they can fit the rgb ring which doesn't help when against restriction, like a mesh front.",if the mesh on your case is okay then you might get away with just replacing the fans.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on ihs geometry and its fit with coolers coldplate.,if your cooler have a flat coldplate (liquid freezer ii i.e.),"- it's pretty much a must, if convex (all asetek units and all air coolers with no bare heatpipes) it depends.",you can get anything from 2 to a dozen degrees of improvement.,"the lower quality bin of your cpu, the more significance this improvement brings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

without crying wolfâ€¦i do wonder what the long term outcome of what the cpu will physically look like with a bent substrateâ€¦like 3+ years down the road,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
easiest solution is to go amd instead.,worst that will happen to you by doing that is saving money.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it depends on your cooler.,"if it has a rounded cold plate, you're already getting good contact.","if it's completely flat, the frame helps to make contact.","the cpu will obviously work without a frame, but it's like $6 for the cheapest one, and is a no frills investment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it did help me, i was struggling to get good contact and i noticed my temps rise over a couple months on my 12900k, and repasting didn't help but showed my contact was very poor.",the thermalright frame helped me and i noticed a 6c drop on my hottest core in cb20.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'd not recommend them for everyone.,some setups are fine without.,"my lian li galahad 360 on a 12700k was all good stock, with undervolting it's even better.",-125mv offset sees 70c peaks under cinebench multicore in a \~21c ambient.,"i could use better paste, improve fan configuration, and it's quite a mild fan profile as i like a quiet pc so there's plenty of room for improvement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for around $5-15 you can save yourself on average 7c on temps.,check out gamersnexus new video that came out today.,does anyone know if this issue only effects 12th gen cpus?,would love one for my 10th gen if it has a chance at dropping temps even more.,high overclocks in the summer are pretty tough temp wise.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the fact of the matter is that if you want new chip factories in the usa, you either have to match foreign subsidies or impose a tariff to negate the cost savings of overseas fabs.",an unsubsidized usa factory will never be able to compete against state-sponsored factories in asia and now europe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i expect this to not change anything.,"corporations won't just build factories ""for fun"", even if the entire factory was fully paid for by the subsidy (it probably would be).",they don't want the factory to just idle and/or produce more than they can sell.,"the subsidy will go to finance capacity that these corporations were already building anyway, there will just be more $$$ left for the shareholders.","where the capacity will be built matters less, but since intel is lobbying hard for the ""you can use this money for whatever"" loophole, corporations can build capacity anywhere and keep this subsidy.","iirc, the bernie sanders bill that would force corporations that receive the subsidy to not fire workers and to use that $$$ to build factories in the us got killed in the senate by like 15-85 vote.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this subsidy should not go to the red states that oppress women's rights and will soon oppress others rights as well.,"if you think china will use chips as leverage against america, wait until you see what the the fascist red states will do.",keep all investment in the free states.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sounds like more wall building on this shrinking planet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"like it or not, it's a smart move.","if china moves on taiwan, it will throw any industry relying on electronics components into chaos.",north korea could similarly move on south korea at the same time at the behest of china to create an additional diversion.,"that would leave philippines, vietnam, and thailand with some minor capacity to supplement what comes out of singapore and japan.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a tariff is largely free and will force them to expand production in the us easily.,"this is once again a legal bride in which surely the big players behind the bill definitely won't get kickbacks at all, nor cause an immediate reaction in the stock market they could (and provably did) profit from.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the extra fabs aren't going to be built short term without subsidies.,"tsmc/samsung were already guaranteed subsidies for their local fabs and will be given more if it passes, and intel has already stated they're considering the eu for the rest of their ohio buildout (20b guaranteed, 100b total with chips bill) if the chips act doesn't pass on time.","tsmc has the money to expand as much as it wants thanks to some mysterious forces bankrolling it (probably taiwan and apple) that helps them avoid eating all their cash flow, but intel doesn't have enough cash flow without subsidies even if they cut their dividend.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lmfao,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
imposing a broad tariff instead of subsidies because some people made a little money out of it is the economic equivalent of an allergic reaction.,the same people would've made the same money shorting tech if a big tariff bill was on the table.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other than the fact that intel and other companies can say whatever they want to hold countries hostage to get more benefit.,the fact is that intel building more production in the eu is still a benefit to the us.,the sole future danger really being talked about right now is a chinese take over of taiwan.,frankly any expansion outside of china suits the us goal of securing chip production supply.,"still the only reason to through money around is bribery and kickbacks that get involved around that, also the immediate stock market reactions which can be exploited by everyone involved.","a tariff can be implemented to kick in over time and in stages such that intel, amd, tsmc, samsung and any other players make more money by building more fabs in the us would have the same effect and yet cost nothing.","though it would also you know, not be as exploitable, wouldn't be a big cash payout to the companies so no kickbacks on offer, wouldn't cause a sudden spike in the market to be taken advantage of.",it would be the us using it's purchasing power and domestic market to force the corporations hand rather than the corporation forcing the countries hand.,it's truly difficult to see why politicians who can profit off one method and not so much the other are for it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel will go wherever they believe is most appropriate for their profits.,"they don't mind getting subsidies on top of it, but they will never build factories just for ""fun"", or to decrease their own profits by having too much production capacity and being forced to sell excess products at lower margins.",they also won't stop expanding their capacity if they believe that extra capacity will bring them more profits.,"intel can easily get very low interest loans for new fabs if they want, they don't need to have literally enough cash on hand right now.","-

this is nothing new, the same game plays out with subsidies.","for example, the 2021 biden infrastructure bill had around $25 billion (!!!)","in subsidies for fossil fuel, the money was supposed to be used for new production and refining capacity.","fossil fuel companies said ""thank you for the subsidy"" and then cashed in on high prices of their products because... that was more profitable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a tariff for this would need to factor in time, as in you say 5% tariff on imported chips or products with those chips kicking in 3 years later and a 15% tariff 5 years later.",long enough to get a couple packaging facilities up and running in a few years and time to complete a couple big fabs in the us before the biggest tariff kicks in.,there would be effectively no shorting because of the time frame.,they'll start building long before the tariffs kick in.,"regardless, politicians shouldn't be allowed to own stock but they can, they cheat and they make money with a tariff, a subsidy or doing nothing so it makes no difference.",using tax payer money for bribery on a company that in no way needs that money when there is a literally free way to achieve the same end goal when that tax payer money could be used for vastly superior things to help the american people still makes it a terrible idea.,"then the campaign contributions, the kickbacks and the totally surprising, no one could see it coming board position offer for key members of congress in 5 years are all things that simply shouldn't happen and won't happen with a tariff.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"their financials tell you they aren't lying about burning through their money in the short term, which has tanked the stock like clockwork every earnings report and will probably continue to do so for the foreseeable future.",even without the fab problem intel is years behind in enterprise design thanks to their long validation delays.,but yes it is very easy for these bills to end up being wasteful corporate welfare and they need guarantees built in that the money is going towards local expansion rather than building out somewhere cheaper and pocketing the rest of the money.,everyone is begging for money while still planning on building packaging and testing facilities in asia for cost savings.,they need to bring it back local and the western world needs to get used to manufacturing things again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>the sole future danger really being talked about right now is a chinese take over of taiwan.,frankly any expansion outside of china suits the us goal of securing chip production supply.,"you're right about europe, but i think this goes too far.","in a world where china has taken taiwan, i would have confidence in china's ability to bring the whole of sea into a chinese sphere of influence.","concretely, intel expanding their operations in malaysia or vietnam doesn't feel likely to make america comfortable about their supply problem.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they're already taking out loans and paying up for expansion, that's why all of their cash flow is gone.",they expect cash flow to be in the negative billions for the next few years.,"this is all public information, they do not have the money.",fab underutilization is not something they can try to game their way out of anymore considering they are no longer leaders in node performance and they're attempting proper foundry services.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if we're talking about a chips bill to secure future production particularly outside of china, then intel doesn't produce anything in china.","though they are at the moment outsourcing more and more to tsmc, their main production facilities are already in the us, ireland, packaging in malaysia and somewhere else i've forgotten.",intel should frankly be excluded from any chips bills based on protecting production in the us and security of chips being made for the us market.,"also intel burning through their money is largely irrelevant, unless they were making losses (they aren't) and unless they couldn't borrow money against future earnings which they absolutely can to the tune of more than they'd ever commit to current expansions by several times over then it's pretty irrelevant.","the only companies the bill should target is effectively tsmc and samsung and it's cheaper to just do an individual deal to encourage them to build single plants, get them committed to the market and local production because then once they secure everything they need to build in the us with one fab it will be cheaper/easier to add more fabs in the same market as all their shipping/supply chain is in place already.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, their cash flow is negative, but they can still easily finance their expansion.",they have access to financing.,"and again, this subsidy will only help intel's shareholders, why should the rest of us care about intel ""being behind"" or whatever?","i'll just buy amd if they are behind, the lower demand for intel products will make intel no longer having product shortages.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they aren't posting losses because they have negative cashflow, meaning they are already borrowing money.",how do you think their cash flow can be negative without losses?,why do people making up excuses instead of just looking at their financials?,they aren't broke but they also do not have anywhere near the 70b or so they've marked down in 2 years.,"they're close to reaching their total equity value in capital expenses and their stock value is in the toilet, where exactly do you expect them to get money from, especially when they have a high risk of failure?",the idea that they couldn't have failed and be hard pressed for money just because they're intel is completely bizarre and ignores their half decade of 10nm failures.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
... they've already financed it.,what are you talking about?,the things you're saying make no sense.,they've broken ground already in arizona and germany and will start ohio soon.,"their petitions for subsidies has always been to get support for **more fabs in the same time period,** not to bankroll all of their expansion.","of course free money to help expand will help shareholders, that's the whole reason they're begging for it.",that doesn't mean they can materialized money and financing out nowhere when they already financed the fabs they are building and **still** have negative cash flow.,you've got some strange outlook on intel as though they're the illuminati and hiding their true finances from all their shareholders.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

exactly.,different cards have different watts.,and seeing how you gave us zero information about what you actually have.,(make and model of your exact card) how could we possibly know.,i was assuming you were asking how to find it.,and it is literally by typing your make and model into google and adding â€œhow many wattsâ€ added to the search.,the same make and model card use the same wattages.,you have given us zero information.,you are the only person here who knows the make and model of your graphics cards,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"once the 8 first gb is used it goes slower, until then no.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks, one more question, do you think i should invest more on a 4+16 gb setup or is 4+8 enough?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"depends on what you will use it for, gaming i would suggest 16gb minimum.",now the issue with 4+16gb is the same as 4+8 once the first 8gb is used it will turn into single channel operation!,now that is not as terrible as the 4+4 tough since that will start using the storage as dram once its depleted.,also beware some sticks if not identical may not play nice with each other...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"biggest deal however would be that the os, while giving priority to the dual channel portion of the memory, will not refray from going into single channel mode if needed.",that means that the os will always prioritize using more ram if it's capable than staying on dual channel memory(which happens on most cases).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is there a way to avoid this?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
using proper dual channel.,"outside that, not really, it's just the way the os handles things.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it says ""ultimate raytracing"" probably just a term for the absolute highest settings possible.","""amazing raytracing"" recommends a 11600k and it is still using raytracing.","besides that, the gpu is mostly responsible for the calculations needed.",so no you don't need a 12700k.,lastly a actual benchmark is much more reliable than this chart.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ray tracing is scalable.,there is no such thing as just one universal level of ray tracing.,comparing across games without knowing the final implementation is even more pointless.,the longer term trajectory will almost certainly see rt effects scale higher up in fidelity and therefore hardware demands.,in that table those requirements are for the higher (max) ray tracing setting.,system requirements are not that fine grained.,just think of the logistics of actually testing it to that level of precision given the amount of hardware combinations possible even within a certain performance band.,"also that a game's performance is not uniform, how wide of an area in that game do you want to test it for?",they are also recommendations and not hard minimums.,ray tracing does put more processing load on the cpu both in terms of per thread and also in terms of mutilthreading.,people would likely know more about this if there wasn't this oversimplified/dated mindset on testing cpu performance in games by just using low settings/resolution to avoid any gpu limitations at all.,ray tracing also does add more memory requirements as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
honestly not sure why youâ€™re surprised that 4k 60 fps at the maximum possible settings requires the best hardware.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"4k@60 high settings, very high raytracing on a 3080.....i am wondering if thats with dlss turned up or not",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the highest possible settings are designed for the best hardware and it runs perfectly fine on a below average machine if you're not pushing those highest settings?,sounds good to me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sometimes pc games really push the boundaries, when future hardware comes out it allows people to crank up the settings that weren't easily possible when released.","we are also very early in ray tracing hardware, the gpus still struggle to get high frame rates at max settings of current gen games and have to use dlss to get anywhere near playable frame rates",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is the remastered pc version.,"the ps5 remastered version will run with lower graphics settings and doesn't do true 4k60 with ray tracing on, it's dubbed 'performance rt' on the ps5 because it is allowed to render at as low as 1080p (and 720p for the ray traced reflections) and then upscales it to 4k to fake 4k.",the non-rt quality mode renders at a higher resolution with no rt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ps5 version runs at checkerboarded 4k, not true native 4k.",it also uses lower graphics settings than a pc version.,it would be like setting the pc version on medium or low.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the ryze of i5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
begun the cpu wars has,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the i3 hasnâ€™t been this exciting since itâ€™s first launch all those years ago,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is amd going to have 5950x level of performance for the 7600x?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fuck yeah.,i love this level of competition.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thatâ€™s very impressive for it being a 20 thread, but of course the 5950x is a cpu from 1 year almost 2 years ago, will be interesting to see what amd does against 13th gen",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it will be a monster cpu at a good price.,"remember folks, intel has been very consistent with prices.",they also have to fight amds new cpus with competitive prices.,the only people that claim the prices will be high are those who bought 12600k this year and are jealous.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s fun seeing the competition build back up between ryzen and intel.,hopefully it keeps being a continuous back and forth!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
amd really has to start increasing core count of they want to compete.,"i don't get how even a 7800x is going to compete with that, unless they just starting rebranding skus and the 7800x gets 12 cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"this is amazing, very fast and iâ€™m not knocking it but just keep in mind geekbench doesnâ€™t scale well at all.",itâ€™s a great indicator that this chip will be great but it might not be this insane.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
god damn i built my pc at the wrong time.,i guess this means i should build another.,what a bummer!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
am still sad they gave up on hpdc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's gonna be a good time upgrading from my 3700x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can we have better (and cheap) pentium?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this thing is going to be insane.,"the ryzen 5 7600x really just doesnâ€™t have a hope of competing, and this will probably even curbstomp the 7800x.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pretty impressive but iâ€™m going to still stay on the side of â€œiâ€™ll believe it when i see itâ€,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe weâ€™ll be seeing 24c zen4 skus after all..?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it should be the i5 12600k is vaster than the ryzen 7 5700x by a good margin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thats impressive.,those p-cores are so much faster than zen 3 and will be even more so with raptor cove cores will have a big ipc advantage over zen 3 and even zen 4 to a lesser extent.,"&#x200b;

the 13700k will be a beast for gaming that will smoke all zen 4 until 3d cache versions come which could make it interesting.","it is other chip 13700k that also has 8 p cores like the 13900k, almost s much l3 cache and much more l3 cache than 12900k which will make it a gaming beast with e-cores off and you will be able to clock ring so high and p cores so high it will be outstanding.","&#x200b;

13700k will only have 8 less e-cores which i and many others do not care about do not care about.",but it will be an equal 8 p core count monster to buy it and disable e-cores and the added cache will help so much in games and it will be a bit better 8 core 16 thread chip in other things too and way better than the 7800 x3d in all by games and just as good in games.,"&#x200b;

if intel could also put more than 8 p cores on a ring and have high clocks in addition to their hybrid approach, it would be nearly game over for amd and worse knockout than conroe 16 years ago.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wow multiple p & r cores beat a lower amount of regular cores?!!1!1!!??!?!1!1!?,?ðÿ¤¯ amd is most likely going to switch to a big/little architecture next year anyways,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
me who saves up: i missed the part where thats my problem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ooh, a raptor lake upgrade is looking more and more tempting",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've just bought a 12700k for spenny money.,it's unopened as of yet.,will the i5 13600 come at a cheaper pricepoint?,when does it launch?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
man... i really want a i5-13600k too bad is a unreachable dream to a poor latin american dude =/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
having i5 with 14 cores feels great.,i m all in for core war between intel and amd,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"considering how much the 5950x costs, that's progress.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"damn, i hope amd keeps intel to go toe to toe like this for as long as possible.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ah fuck, competition is so goddamn nice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
running 4790k + 970.. was always kinda enough for all the games i play,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sheesh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
still on ivy bridge here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4670k?,shieet.,my grandpa had one of those.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"anything is a good upgrade from a 4670k, a cheap used b350/3600x bundle would be huge!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in other words 2022?,14 core cpu from intel is still not able to beat 2020 16 core cpu from amd.,"but it ""beats"" it in power consumption 2 years later....",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[still gets creamed by the 20t 3.2ghz m1 ultra.,"](https://browser.geekbench.com/search?q=m1+ultra) 

raptor lake looks good, a lot more like what alder lake should have been.","but intel and especially amd have a long way to go in geekbench, as if this dumb benchmark actually matters.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 1600 to amd's 7600x.,we have come full circle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"https://hothardware.com/news/alleged-zen-4-cpu-battles-5950x-in-benchmark-leak

showing about 10 percent above 5950x with engineering sample.","i understand this is an intel biased sub, but let's be realistic here and not just company cheering",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it depends on how much power amd is pushing into 7600x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, kind of a bad comparison when you're going back almost 2 years.",still excited to see this since competition only benefits the consumer.,i've been loving the i5-1235u in my work laptop so i can't wait to see where intel and amd go from here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you seem to forget that 2 years old cpu cost at least 800$ when it was released - and that was right before the inflation kicked in.,the fact we will have this level of performance for \~ 300-350$ is still great!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is also geekebench.,intel typically outperforms amd in their tests only to lose in real world applications.,just look at the 12900k vs 5950x geekbench results and then see how they stack up under actual mt workloads.,"sure, the 13600k is impressive, but not nearly as much so as this thread would like to believe.","its pretty plausible that the 5900x could keep an edge over it, or at least break even.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it'll be under $300 though.,has the 5950x hit that street price anywhere yet?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also iâ€™m waiting to see the power consumption.,"intel doesnâ€™t seem to care about efficiency, i think it should be one of the top goalâ€¦",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i bought a 12600k yesterday, dunno why people would complain.","you buy your performance, not your place in the performance hierarchy.",even less of a big deal since you can upgrade it just fine on a z690,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 12600k isn't a bad chip for the money especially compared to the 2 generations before it.,although the 12700kf is absolutely worth the extra $80,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 you would struggle to find a real difference between 12600k and 13600k outside of the benchmarks.,single core performance difference is what?,7-8% with the mc difference coming from 4 extra efficiency cores so meh.,"most people who got the 12600k have 0 reasons for upgrade, they won an year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oof, i can't wait 6 months so i guess i gotta go with the 12600 as well",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"once people are buying 14 core i5's zen 4 is gonna look really stupid coming with a 6 core ryzen 5 chip, even if it's faster.",if amd doesn't increase core counts intel might have the upper hand this generation.,"really exciting stuff regardless, hoping for some fierce competition.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"probably lowering prices to place the 8 core against this, 12 core vs i7, etc.","given the one benchmark of the 7950x being like 45% faster in mt then the 12900k, i could see that being a close match.","the rumor is that they are doubling core count with zen 5, but that's still way out there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"faster clocks, a little optimization here and there, new p core architecture, and just as many p cores and e cores as the 12900k.",iâ€™d be surprised if it wasnâ€™t a little faster.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it probably can, 10700k=9900ks and 12700k destroyed every intel cpu before it.",we donâ€™t talk about the 11th shit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> some are even saying that a 13700k can beat a 12900k.,nothing surprising about this.,past generation the jump was even bigger.,12600k beats 11900k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i try to upgrade my cpu every three years but itâ€™s up to you and what you do,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10850k is still pretty good today.,"i'd wait until the next socket and get 14th gen.  up to you though, 13th gen will still be a pretty big upgrade even at an i5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a 10850k paired up with a 6900xt.the i9 keeps my gpu 95%-100% at 1440p.,i know i can easily skip a gpu generation so i'll see what cpus are available in 2 years and see if its worth building an entire new rig for.,then again all i really use my pc for is high end gaming and web browsing lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on what you need it for.,"even at 1080p this cpu holds strong: https://www.techpowerup.com/review/amd-ryzen-7-5700x/15.html

yeah, i guess you can keep it for at least a couple of years unless you gonna snatch rtx 4090 or rx 7900 xt right away **and** you're playing at 1080p.",at higher resolutions (1440p and above) there's barely any difference between modern cpus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
absolutely not.,wait for 14th gen intel or see if ryzen 7000 series is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'd leave it unless your usage calls for it.,"alternatively, if you actually step up that often you probably want to go amd since they have better socket longevity.",the new am5 socket is coming soon and if am4 is anything to go by you'll probably have a few years before you need to change the motherboard to facilitate an upgrade.,intel changes socket every 2 gens.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"personally i've been updating my cpu every 4th gen, mildly (overclocking) each step:

4790k (4.8) -> 8700k (5.0) -> 12700k (5.2)

660 -> 970 -> 1080 -> 3080

currently gaming pretty flawlessly maxed out at 1440p / 165hz.",your biggest gains on 12th gen vs. 10th will be major ipc gains as well as more l3 cache.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wait for benchmarks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for gaming+multimedia r5 7600x can easily be a better choice over 13600k because it will only need half the power draw, could be cheaper and have basically the same gaming performance (under 10% fps difference = unnoticeable)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6p 8e 20 threads baby.,"they doubled l2 cache on e cores, bumped up l2 cache on the p cores, and added some additional l3 cache since they bumped e core clusters from 1 to 2 (4 clusters on the full chip).",there is a reason amd is pricing their ryzen 7 sku's around intel's i5 12600k now.,fun times ahead.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"or 16 core zen4 at even higher power

"that is a gpu benchmark, not a cpu one.","what were seeing here for intel is cpu performance uplift, not gpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what's great is that it only took about 2 years for a mid-range product to out pace the old flagships.,stagnation is over and hopefully we will have good competition in the coming years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> yeah, kind of a bad comparison when you're going back almost 2 years.",also bad when your current flagship chip is 2 years old,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s really not though when you look at itâ€™s product segment.,i5 is the lower middle class cpu and your putting it against a top end cpu that has more cores and threads.,itâ€™s direct competitor in product segment would be a 7800x 8 core.,amd absolutely needs to come out with massive gains seeing how they already were behind a lot in single core performance to alderlake.,they have to fill the alderlake gap and then surpass raptor lake if they have any glimmer of hope to catch up in multi core/thread performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

is the 13600k available to buy yet?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on who launches first and how it compares to amd's lineup.,"alder lake had very competitive pricing to regain the market's interest after the disappointing 11th gen. alder lake has very much proven the point that intel's cpu's are competitive again, so they could up the price this gen to keep the investors happy (didn't verify this myself but apparently intel investors were a bit iffy about the lower margins relative to past products).",of course it needs to compete against amd so pricing will need to take that into account as well.,also i hope they take into account they're launching on a dead platform against amd's new am5.,"now considering the 5600x was $300 and held that price for a long time and that both companies show very nice gains gen over gen, the 7600x might just be $300 again.","if, say, the 13400 matches the 7600x and the 13600k beats it, the 13400 could creep up to $250 against a $300 7600x and then the 13600k could be $350 without issue.","this is of course only guesswork, but still something to think about.",i wouldn't automatically assume we're gonna see a repeat of alder lake pricing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"5950x has been on sale for under $400 a few times, some lucky people have got it for $350.","5950x has about 15% overclocking headroom with minor tweaking as well, it's very conservatively clocked out of the box and very power constrained.",later this year it is being replaced with a cpu that's over 40% faster.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bold assumption given intel's announcement of price increases across the board.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah man unless you are a professional gamer and need to squeeze out that little bit more performance or are using heavily threaded programs it doesnâ€™t make too much sense to have the best of the best.,unless you are like me and simply just want it because weâ€™ll itâ€™s the best.,but iâ€™ll admit that and never play it off like itâ€™s a justifiable purchase because of this or that.,i simply like having the latest and greatest even though i have no legitimate reason for it lol.,honesty goes along way and not many have it in the internet.,"i just picked up a 12600k for the wife and it handles everything no problem, no one needs more than that for just gaming thatâ€™s for damn sure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

desktop 11th gen was a flop as it was backported to 14nm (cause 10nm yields were a problem and bad at the time for more than quad core in late 2020-early 2021) which crippled the latency.,"if it was desktop tiger lake on 10nm like it was supposed to have been, it probably would have beaten an equal p core count zen 3 by like 5% in ipc and could clock higher and been better than zen 3. where as rocket lake being on 14nm ruined it and made it a flop.","&#x200b;

then once proper node was fixed in spring to summer 2021 on desktop with alder lake that enabled 10nm with good yields for more than 4 strong cores before being ready to be released and mass production late 2021, the p cores handily beat zen 3 at same clock speed by like 10-15% sometimes even 20% ipc and ability to clock higher almost knocked it out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

pretty much my sentiment on this.,appearing on ltt and gn to butter them up along with the viewers doesn't change anything.,at all.,the end product in systems is all that matters.,"remember when rdna1 ate ass for 9 months with constant black screens and other issues from users, but it beat the competition when it came to price to performance?",same situation.,no need to treat them with kiddie gloves.,"they should be almost giving this stuff away, and if they take a loss, then they take a loss.",better luck next time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"agree with both of these paragraphs

> what irritated me about making comments, however, is the sudden puppy-protector instinct that erupts whenever you want to protect something small and fragile.","yes, it is intelâ€™s first dedicated graphics card developed for the consumer market in what feels like ages, but it is neither a sympathetic underdog nor a fragile plant that should not be trampled on.","here, a multi-billion corporation with extensively purchased personnel and know-how (also in the heads) as well as many years of development time and almost infinite seeming resources has failed grandiosely.",you cannot and must not call it anything else.,"the saying that money alone does not score goals, which is often used in soccer, also lives on in it, and the fact that an unfinished product with even more unfinished drivers is sold to customers for expensive money can and must be criticized.","....

> of course, you should feel sorry for intel, but even more for those who have spent their money on such products because the pr machinery produces full-length propaganda at its best and you as a consumer have trusted it.",trust is also exactly the keyword that really matters here.,because i canâ€™t use anything productively that i canâ€™t know if it wonâ€™t destroy the work iâ€™ve done up to that point in the next five minutes with a crashing gesture of nonchalance just like that.,and there are so many technical bugs and carelessness in the drivers and gui that you could lose faith in programming mankind.,"sure, programmers donâ€™t grow on trees, but intel didnâ€™t start from scratch.","this should never be forgotten, and criticism should also include those who have willingly followed the call of money and have not managed anything that would really be resilient.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

well aib partners can charge extra money for â€œpremiumâ€ card variants so that is kind of a mute point.,$129.99 is the base msrp for the card.,"yeah, it is up to aib partners to release their version of the card in the us, it sounds like intel will be making their reference cards available everywhere but they are only limited runs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

iâ€™m very interested in their claims about pricing.,"while still unannounced for most of the cards they seem committed to performance per dollar 

the a380 (as bad as itâ€™s early benches are) is a good value at $129 with 6gb gddr6 compared to nvidia and amd",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i like the honesty.,they probably delayed the launch because the top management was not aware of how difficult optimizations of old apis are,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this was genuinely wholesome video.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the point here is price vs performance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the settings have to be different somehow between the two games, because 200 fps at 1440p high in f1 2021 is unreal, about rtx 3080 levels of performance.","itâ€™s probably, like, 1440p medium or 1440p low.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this happens even on radeons (linus made a videon on it) so i wouldn't doubt it at all.,"if this ends up being the card to get for linux gaming i'll certainly be getting battlemage down the line, since nvidia is basically the sole source of issues with linux on my pc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">intel tom on the video said â€˜we are going to kill everyone on price/performanceâ€™..  i really hope thatâ€™s true, because its awesome..

he's referring to the tier 1. since they are basing their pricing based on their tier 3 performance (old api that are not optimized), they definitely will, unless other gpu prices continue to crater.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is all founded on the premise of a functional card and user experience.,you first need stability for that.,here is the current scenario.,"https://www.igorslab.de/en/the-morning-after-reflections-of-a-premiere-and-second-summary/

the a380 crashes randomly.",the drivers include bugs.,"the oc control panel includes bugs, including a nasty one that apparently can force a non-boot situation unless you remove the intel card, have a second gpu on hand to boot, and then remove the intel drivers.",a750 and a770 are designed from the same architecture.,this product line and intel driver stack appear to be in an alpha state and is nowhere ready for launch yet intel are proceeding anyway.,i want intel to succeed.,i also agree 100% with igor on this.,why are consumers being forced to pay for the privilege of being beta testers on unfinished products.,"it would be one thing if the drivers are stable but unoptimized, but this is far beyond that.",the card is unusable unless your motherboard includes resizable bar (rbar) support.,assuming you do have rbar support there are still crashes and microstuttering.,i'm going to criticize linus here.,he acted like paid pr for intel and said nothing even remotely critical in this video.,intel clearly is putting all these flaws out on display through friendly mouthpieces like linus.,this suggests problems are much worse behind the scenes than what they are showing and intel are attempting to mitigate incoming waves of criticism before the product launch.,https://old.reddit.com/r/intel/comments/w3im2q/intel_arc_a380_6gb_review_gunnir_photon_including/igzhf6a/?context=3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"av1, deep link, xmx, 6gb of ram and the large potential for improvements make it very interesting at $129.","i'd rather buy it than a 1650 or rx 6400. but if you're looking for solely the best gaming performance in the segment *today*, it's not that, but it will almost certainly gain performance overtime unlike the competition.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
isn't 1650 the best case scenario?,gn showed it was below the 1050ti(basically 1050 2gb levels) in unoptimized titles.,it's gonna depend on drivers maturing for any of these cards to be worth it.,"they're going to have the old amd problem where they ""only exist to lower nvidia's prices.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you watched the full video, and have seen the price/performance comparison chart for the new arc lineup, its worth noting that they have priced these at the 3060ti level, and f12021 is one of their best performing titles.",(all the titles shown in the ltt video are their tier 1 best performers).,they are targeting pricing based on performance in their 3rd tier super unoptimised titles.,"it wouldn't surprise me, that if you get the right game with the right set of apis (dx12 etc) that it will perform as well as a 3080 for the price of a 3060ti.","but, remember, it will perform like (or worse than!)",a 3060ti in ~~many~~ **most** other titles due to the total lack of api optimisation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the real question is why is it unfinished, how are drivers bad when they supposedly increased driver team to improve their shit for decades gpu drivers back in 2017 when pushing for a new d-gpu architecture.","this architecture was due to launch in 2020, they've had designs and a fundamental idea how the architecture works for years now.",delays in production doesn't mean drivers can't be worked on.,how are drivers not damn near perfect by now and likewise how a drivers for gaming so bad on the last 4 years of products after supposed massive hiring and intended improvements to drivers.,i can't understand at all how drivers are still bad with literal years of delays.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no it is fake msrp.,basically manufacturer puts a certain msrp but then sell the needed parts to an aib at such a price that they'd actually lose money if they sold the final product for the msrp.,that's the case of rtx 3050 and 3060 .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"agreed, the one silver lining is that it can only go up from here, but as it stands, the a380 is a bad card.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's almost always faster than the 1650 but not as fast as an rx6400.,https://www.igorslab.de/en/intel-arc-a380-6gb-in-test-gunnir-photon-total-benchmarks-detail-analysis-and-extensive-teardown/5/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this is the part i found most interesting, if for example tier 3 performance is on par with a 3060 and is therefore priced at a 3060 price point then it's really a win/win.",you pay a fair price for the tier 3 performance and any tier 2/1 games will perform exceptional well for the price.,"in theory, this would make the cards a no brainer for the budget.",i'm still sceptical on the actual price so we'll wait and see but it sounds good on paper.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"huh, that should be at least 3060 ti performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this is clearly an impressive card in theory, but i donâ€™t think itâ€™ll ever be an impressive card in practice.","itâ€™s just too late, and the drivers suck too much.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they might price the 16gb model at 3060ti levels.,"there is rumours of 8 and 16gb, but not sure.",but the 8gb model might be like $330 to $350.,gddr6 was like $11-$12 per gb last time i checked.,and a lot of suppliers have been raising prices?,so $70 cheaper for the 8gb model makes sense.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"welcome to the youtube algorithm, have you not visited the internet in the last 5 years?","i found it interesting and also learnt something new, it was quite obvious from the video that the product is flawed.",they literally streamed the card bugging out at points.,"there is always some one ragging on a video unless there is an entire section dedicated to bagging out the device, some one always looses their mind for no apparent reason.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

amd's drivers sucked for years so i'm not sure it's that surprising,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably the same reason amd's drivers still have issues - drivers are hard.,even more so when games are not made with your cards in mind.,*even more so* when you have decades of legacy games which rely on driver hackery to work properly to patch in.,"not to mention they just now released their first proper card...

drivers being subpar at this point was never in doubt.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i should've probably added it's only in dx11 titles that it really stuggles.,at least it should be a decent card going forward.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah intel has a bad track record with their marketing lies so i wouldn't trust them that the real price will be according to performance in unoptimized titles... 

look at the arc a380.. it's currently selling for around 190$ in china, same as rx 6500xt but that one is 50% more powerful than it and stable.","so they should be selling it for 100$ real price to fulfill their pricing wish, yet they don't.",also 6500xt isn't really a good price/performance gpu in the first place.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this is best case scenario, but here's a hypothetical.",someone in the market has a budget for around a 3060ti.,if someone's buys an a770 they are looking at on average 3060ti in performance for tier 3 games at the time of launch.,better than 3060ti performance for dx12 and vulkan based games(most modern games).,and significantly better than 3060ti performance for arc optimized games.,and over time the drivers should get better meaning more performance for those tier three games.,"the first few generations of arc should age better than other gpu's

this assumes everything we know so far is correct, which i admit is probably not the case.",if everything we know is correct i think it will be impressive compared to other cards in its performance bracket.,which is the most important thing for most consumers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> $330 to $350.,"with the 6600 hitting prices down in the 250 range, intel won't hold up value at those prices.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"$330 makes it doa, amd rx 6600 xt can be had for less than $340 ($320 if you count the rebate), rx 6600 non xt for $280($260 if you count the rebate)

who is going to pay the same price to be a beta tester for intel where some games will straight up not work and others will drop 50% of the performance coupled with the fact that we haven't even seen the bottom of the gpu market yet.","in the $280-$450 price bracket amd has 5 gpus right now, 4 of them are in stock and 1 on back order with newegg(rx 6600, rx 6600 xt, rx 6650 xt rx 6700 10gb , rx 6700 xt).",that is a very competitive bracket that amd has on lock right now when it comes to bang for buck.,if they really are honest about pricing it based on tier 3 games and customers being the beta testers then it will have to be a substantial discount vs amd and nvidia.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think the averages score at the end was more like 20-25% decrease, but yeah, certain scenes seem to drop close to 50%.","i think it might be a better choice for people who:

a) have rebar, and know how to turn it on.","(i think it's also broken for these gpus on amd right now, so you even need an intel cpu.).",b) care way more about playing brand new titles than their old library of games.,"if they can get dx11 stuff to at least be stable at 70% performance, i'd be happy.","even an a770 running at like 70% of it's potential, is still more fps than my 120hz monitor can do.","dx11 stuff isn't that demanding, and unless you're a pro e-sports player who needs 400 fps in cs:go, it might not matter for you.",but there is a lot of caveats to get one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yea, that all makes sense and i'm sure they are going to want to squeeze as much performance out as they can.",the 12th gen is already crazy as far as heat and cooling go though.,i just can't imagine it getting worse.,i have one of the best air coolers out there and my i9 still thermal throttles.,"if it's worse for the 13th or 14th gen, you will almost assuredly need a water cooled setup which is ridiculous to require as the baseline.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

right.,i would prefer this as well.,same reason i try and undervolt my cpu as soon as i get it.,i love performance gains as much as the next person but not at the cost of cooling issues.,it seems to me that there will need to be some major architectural shifts as adding larger amounts of power only give small performance gains.,law of diminishing marginal returns or something like that i guess.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not sure why you are being down-voted here.,everything you said was true.,the problem is you have to crank the power up a ton percentage wise for only small performance gains at this point.,i'd almost rather have the same power as the 10th/11th gen except using significantly less power and running much cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes there is.,"the 1165g7 packs the full igpu, with 96eu.",the 1135g7 packs a smaller one(possibly due to binning/manufacturing defects) with 80eu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"fyi, if you are concerned with either cpu or gpu performance or both then there are much better choices than either 1135g7 or 1165g7.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"edit: totally confused 11th gen woth 12th gen. 

nonetheless, there is 1 die (tgl-u, 4c96eu) for all u series sku, where the igpu gets disabled based on need/defects to enable 80eu skus like the 1135g7

â€-----------------------------------------

to be precise: the physical silicon implementation is the same between the two mentioned cpus, as both of them are based on the adl-u die (2p/8e/96eu = 2p cores, 8e cores, 96 xe execution units).",in the case of the i5-1135g7 only 16eu are disabled (due to defects or product segmentation) so 80eus remain.,"there are (at least) two other dies that intel is manufacturing for alder lake apart from adl-u : adl-p and adl-h/s (h in notebook, s in desktop, same silicon).","adl-p features up to 6p/8e/96eu = 6p cores, 8e cores and 96xe eus and  is used for the ix-12xxp series of 28w notebook cpus, so more premium, higher power than u series, but still not as power hungry as the big ones

adl-h then features up to 8p/8e/32eu = 8p cores, 8e cores and 32xe eus.",so this die is mainly used for desktop and high performance notebook cpus with > 45w (aka all the ix-12xxh/hx cpus in notebooks).,"as seen, these have a smaller physical implementation of the xe gpu with just 32xe eus, but they usually equip a dgpu anyway, so the performance of the igpu doesn't matter in this case.","the media capabilities in all the igpus should be the same (de/encodig, etc.)",die overview found [here](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16881/a-deep-dive-into-intels-alder-lake-microarchitectures),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"> conclusion:  [a one star review](https://www.igorslab.de/en/intel-arc-a380-6gb-in-test-gunnir-photon-total-benchmarks-detail-analysis-and-extensive-teardown/19/)

not going to lie, i'm starting to rethink a day one purchase.",i've been waiting to purchase a new graphics card for seven months now.,the arc series launch has already been delayed twice because apparently intel's graphics team is having issues producing stable drivers for this architecture.,"i'll hold out a little longer, but i'm not going to pay for the privilege of being a beta tester while intel spends the next year trying to produce stable drivers.","it really makes me wonder how this could happen to a company like intel who isn't new to r&d, chip fabrication, and software.",i would have expected that some pre-fab r&d would have had proof of concept code for firmware and drivers working and relatively stable on engineering samples before committing to a launch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, i mean if itâ€™s priced to match its performance then it may not be a bad deal, still a bit disappointing though.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
making graphics cards from scratch is hard...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is 'unknow' a word/saying?,"unknown is how that word should be spelled, but i've seen 'unknow' many times on chicken scratch and just assumed it was a misspelling",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
over a decade of not caring one bit about their igpu gaming drivers has caught up with them.,"i remember the arguments here between the people who insisted intel drivers were ""rock solid"" (and thus a good sign for xe) versus the handful who were telling those people the intel gaming drivers were terrible.",*i told you so*,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
doesn't matter if performance is up to par as long as it's priced well.,the a380 is supposed to be $130 to $140.,"for the performance and features it provides, that's a great deal imo.","not sure how the a770 stands, but it seems to be at least somewhat competitive with the 3060ti.","i'd expect the price to be lower than the 3060ti msrp, maybe around $350.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not just a new architecture but a forward looking one as well.,if you look around the web with the performance hit with not having resize bar support on a intel arc gpu is massive.,meanwhile the performance bump from amd and nvidia is minimal.,as things stands right now i think with time this gens gpus will age rather well as driver support gets better and better.,but the future if intel keeps going on the gpu can be something that properly smashes nvidia and amd with time due to a newer base architecture.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nah, this sub allows criticism of intel, the only hardware sub where you can't criticise is the nvidia one",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the truth hurts sometimes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it was a cheap build with a lot of errors made by the manufacturer effectively neutering the gpu.,it's mentioned in the conclusion.,the reviewer clearly stated they did not ask intel for a card but bought a crappy card somewhere in asia for this test.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"when it's july 19 in the philippines, it will be july 18 in the us.",that doesn't mean that the 18th was the actual day for intel's birthday.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i originally posted the information on its birthday.,factual and its here on reddit for posterity.,[https://www.reddit.com/r/intel/comments/w2jjjj/on\_this\_day\_in\_1968\_intel\_was\_founded/](https://www.reddit.com/r/intel/comments/w2jjjj/on_this_day_in_1968_intel_was_founded/),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i've got mine in a fractal torrent and cooled by a nh-d15.,i have the cpu undervolted at -0.07 and capped pl1/2 to 125w.,i think i was around 60c in cbr23 while hitting 25k.,my main use is software development using vs2022 and android studio.,"i also use multiple office packages, vmware and of course games.",i also have the nasty habit of having open several sandboxed (sandboxie) browsers with up to \~300 tabs open within each.,"[https://www.techpowerup.com/review/intel-core-i9-12900k-alder-lake-tested-at-various-power-limits/](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/intel-core-i9-12900k-alder-lake-tested-at-various-power-limits/)

if you really do need the high multi core performance then perhaps waiting for the 13900k or amd would be a better choice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a 280 or 260mm aio.,use noctua or thermal grizzle paste.,they all have comparable cooling performance at that size; corsair and deepcool have been solid performers for me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[removed],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you dont have any contact issues, an air cooler will do just fine.",i have a u12a and it peaks at 76c in cbr23 at stock.,which is perfectly fine.,"if you are running heavy multitasking you shouldnt leave it at the power limit of 240, drop it down to something like 180 and apply a bit of undervolting.","in which case, pretty much any decent cooler will get the job done brilliantly.",fuma 2 / ak620 / assasin 3/ dark rock pro 4 / nh d15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gotta recommend the contact frame from thermal grizzly and then a good 360mm or bigger aio cooler.,the icegiant prosiphon might also work.,"that being said, maybe a threadripper is more in line with your worktask, but those cost quite a bit more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't think i'd try to air cool it unless you have a really big case that can fit something like a noctua dh-15 in it.,"i'd look into at least a 240mm aio, running a 240mm myself and even under full synthetic load for hours to stress test it only throttled ever so slightly from 4.9ghz @ 245\~w to 4.7ghz @ 225\~w.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the biggest one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm doing pretty much exactly the same thing.,"pl to 125w, undervolted, nh-d15.",i'm a software developer who frequently compiles large c++ codebases.,"when editing code, the nh-d15 can shut off its fans and i get a completely silent machine.",i prefer this over the constant pump noise from aios.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
noted.,thanks for giving me advice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the advice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™d recommend against msi aios as the last one i bought in october and the cooling performance was terrible.,it happened to actually cause my pc to overheat and shutdown under load.,reason 2 is that they were recalled as they get clogged and cause the aforementioned overheating.,i would recommend getting a more quality aio from like corsair as an example.,iâ€™ve bought a remanufactured corsair aio to save some money but it hasnâ€™t had any problems yet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
got it!,thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bigger than 360mm?,that seems absurd to me unless you're going for a crazy overclock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don't need any of that.,just get an arctic lf ii 280mm and call it a day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
awesome.,thanks!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> iâ€™d recommend against msi aios as the last one i bought in october and the cooling performance was terrible

this isn't the case with the s360 - it's hands down the best aio i have ever tested.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
glad it worked well for you but my experience has been been a huge turnoff to using msi products.,iâ€™m still keeping my motherboard but i donâ€™t have a lot of faith in their coolers anymore.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"fyi you can right click and change that graph to show logical processors, so you'll see the load of each individual thread.",seems fine to me unless you're noticing stuttering or other performance issues during gameplay.,whatever game you're playing is probably loading the cpu more heavily at certain points.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what the hell have you done to disk 0 and 2?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you have msi dragon centre installed.,mine was fixed after uninstalling dragon centre,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looks like the gpu is working constantly so the cpu is not your bottleneck and i guess the cpu has all the capacity it needs and just spikes when the game temporary needs more processing power.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
check the processes on the left side- see what is spiking cpu usage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is your game library installed on a hd?,that could be a sign of buffering from the hd.,if you move your games from the hd to the ssd that could be a much more stable processor usage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
windows: hey!,hey!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"probably an issue with some software, had intel graphics driver causing a similar issue to this",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the spiking makes me wonder if you've got some throttling?,are clock frequencies stable?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you are on windows 10, this could be the issue with windows not using e and p cores properly, causing the spikes.","&#x200b;

you would need to either disable the e cores or move to windows 11 to fix it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"seems normal to me, check the cpu usage when idle.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the strength of the us dollar vs australia dollar is a factor.,austrian dollar has been dropping vs the us dollar.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
everyones going to have mass lay offs my man.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i noticed the sudden price increase in just a few days.,the only part that seems resistant to it is the pentiums and celerons that are not worth buying and f skus which i don't want to rely on.,seems a bit too sudden for inflation no?,i thought it was just because they were re-diverting production from alder lake to raptor lake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think you have cause and effect confused.,"inflation is not something that happens to money, inflation is what we call the phenomenon of consumer prices rising.","inflation doesn't cause higher prices, inflation is what we call it when prices rise.",the higher inflation in most of the world lately is mainly caused by turmoil in energy market.,when oil price goes up the production and logistics cost of pretty much everything also goes up which means consumer prices will go up too (cost-pull inflation).,australia doesn't have general inflation that would cause significant changes within 24h timeframe.,that kind of effects can be caused for imported products when currency value compared to other currencies is very unstable.,but australian dollar to usd is fairly stable.,more likely you are looking at random variation in how some store sets prices.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i guess it's supply and demand rebalancing as more people are building new pcs, now that gpus are available again",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"prices arent constant

it wont *always* stay at the official msrp",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nah, it's purely demand driven.",i think a lot of folks are buying gpus while they're cheap and cpu sales are seeing an uptick as a consequence.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
floor is floor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ah yes, the inflation... intel raises cpu prices like mad and nvidia lowers gpu prices like mad.",totally inflation e.e,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah between aus weakening to usd and inflation, prices should be 15%+ higher compared to launch.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably :(,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i was planning to build alder lake but gpu prices stopped me, now that gpu prices are down raptor is right around the corner so i'll wait for it but i agree with you that massive amount of people are finally getting the chance to actually build a pc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nvidia has been selling gpus over msrp.,intel has been selling cpus under msrp.,"nvidia now has a surplus of ampere because crypto demand is way low, and people are waiting for next gen. who do you think has more room to drop prices?..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i was lucky, bought everything except gpu in june.","had to go for an opened mobo from a reputable store (wanted to go z690 mitx, but at least for the open one i paid 270â‚¬ instead of 400+ ðÿ¥¶) and used ddr5 (32gb 5600 cl36 for â‚¬180, not bad) but everything is working fine.",now idk.,how much longer i can wait to get a gpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and how is that related to ""inflation""?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the cpu prices increasing when there is a no additional demand is inflation.,gpuâ€™s prices are falling due to overstock (manufacturing too many).,the flood of secondhand gpus due to the crash of crypto is not helping either.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, it's increasing msrp, nothing else.",have you seen amd suddenly raising prices?,or mobo manufacturers?,"ssd prices are falling, ram prices are falling, inflation isn't one sided, it hits everyone and msrp already has inflation buffer in it.",current price raising isn't a result of inflation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you have taller than usual/rgb ram?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
imho aio are overrated.,i think a lot of people just assume they are better when most aio donâ€™t perform better then a decent tower style hsf of half the cost.,"your setup is fine 
just donâ€™t expect to oc with it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you just game on it, it'll be fine.",if you render video or do streaming maybe you should upgrade.,aois have a higher failure rate.,you'll probably do more damage from a failed aio that throttles your cpu for 3 months if you don't notice.,"my brother had that kind of happen, where it wore down his cpu, since he doesn't pay close attention to his system, and his cpu was running at 92-95c for that time and now can't clock ram past 3500mhz anymore.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
id cooling frostflow or auraflow 240mm aio is dirt cheap and will last  years.,no frills no extra branding just stuff that has proven to work design wise.,think it is like 54 bucks from amazon delivered.,daughter has had hers cooling a 2200 then 5600x for just over 4 years now.,zero issues just works and at 54 bucks its a steal.,simple to install.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what are your temps?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

pu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for a 9900k, it's actually been a but sluggish, and it's not my cooling or storage.","as uncommon as it is, i kinda think the board is holding it back.",ram maxes out at 2666 and cpu at 4.7 with vrms that thermal throttle under load.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to give you and idea at whatâ€™s possible iâ€™m still running a 9900k on a z390 msi ace.,iâ€™m able to run 5.1 ghz at 1.3v (75c max with 360 aio with 32gb (2x16) running at 4200 mhz cl 16. fyi i mainly game on my pc.,iâ€™ve been looking at upgrading but still canâ€™t justify the money for little gaming performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

probably cause youâ€™re running a cheap $110 motherboard with a literal $500 9900k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you need a better motherboard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just out of curiosity, why did you cheap out on a motherboard for this powerful build!",?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do not use userbenchmark.,it sucks.,one of the worst benchmark softwares out there.,"run 3d mark, cpuz, cinebench r23, and unigine superposition instead.",also maybe aidia64 cache and ram benchmark.,"however, your motherboard is very cheap.",why cheap out in a motherboard with a 9900k?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you don't mention what cooler you have, that ram speed is so bad cause you board is cheap af.",if i had to bet you cpu is throttling cause of temps and vrm choking.,you don't buy the most expensive cpu on a certain gen to pair it with a trash board.,makes no sense,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because you are cheapskate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i agree with the general thoughts here.,it's definitely that motherboard no way will a motherboard without vrm heatsinks handle a 9900k.,most likely that board is limiting your turbo boost spends as the vrms can't take a 9900k without a lower power limit.,even if you are able to move the power limit it would just result in the vrms overheating.,my suggestion is look at ebay for a z390 motherboard they are getting older so finding them off amazon may result in higher prices,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if that's a thermaltake smart psu i highly recommend   replacing it before it pops,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"also, what should i do about xmp?",should i keep it enabled or disable it since my motherboard canâ€™t handle the 3600mhz ram speed?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
keep the ram and sell the motherboard and cpu separately.,buy a b660 ddr4 and 12400 for the money you get and be happy.,itâ€™s not worth it to get a z board for the 9900k now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yea it's not so much the price it's more the board he picked has a very poor vrm and has no heat sinks for the vrm.,likely it has a very low power limit locked in the bios on that board which in the end probably hold back a 9900k quite a bit in clocks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"a vrm is short for voltage regulator module, it regulates the voltage going into the cpu (12v from power supply down to anywhere, for example between 0.6v and 1.7v, however a 9900k probably is around 1.3).",they are the small chips on the left side  and top of your cpu.,on a quality board they would be under a heatsink.,there would also be many more of them so each heats up less.,they arent 100% efficient and when under load heat up.,"if they get too hot, they throttle your cpu (regardless of how much headroom it has) to keep the vrm temperature low, usually under 100c.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
any decent z390 you can find.,watch some reviews.,the 9900k its a 95w tdp stock so the hyper 212 should suffice for gaming at stock clocks.,might throttle under sustain loads and heavy use applications .,be sure you have proper ventilation on your case too.,you have all the components in analogy to build a ferrari but your chassis is made of plastic.,edit: and use hwinfo64 to log your temps and frequency under stress test to check if its throttling or not .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
z390 mobo.,there is not much you can do with that current motherboard it will limit your 9900k quite a bit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are investing in a really old platform and today your chip might be worth enough to sell and break even to do the switch to modern hardware.,sure you can drain 175 bucks or you get like 200 or even more and buy a better chip and board combined for under 300. the 12400 will get you more stable 1% frames which is better for your esport gaming.,it will do it while being more power efficient too.,"iâ€™d say keep the 9900k if you play in 4k, but remove the trash board.",this suggest you have a 4k monitor and gpu to push the pixels,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol.,just because it says i9â€¦ you bought a ferrari and you run it on vinegar with training wheels four years past itâ€™s prime,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gotcha.,i think it's silly that the board is one hundred ten dollars for the reasons you listed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would have gone with an i7 and a z series board tbh.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which out of these 2 do you recommend?,i will be getting one and want to buy whichever one that will support 32gb 3600mhz of ram and give me constant 240 fps.,"either then msi z390-a pr, or the asus z390-p.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what do you think about the msi z390 mag tomahawk?,or is the z390 msi a pro better?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea most likely overpaid to some degree as mobos go out of production like the 300 series sometimes finding new in box can end up more then there orginal msrp.,i think it was more in the 80 dollar range new when it came out.,but i do agree for the price they charge these boards are junk even if there target is a low power chip what's the point when 20 bucks more gets you a proper board lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the msi board is the better one in my opinion.,but one thing i will say is fortnite can be kinda jumpy in fps even with good hardware.,but a better motherboard will no doubt improve your cpus performance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the a pro and tomahawk are both fine boards if one is alot cheaper then the other i'd go with that.,the tomahawk is a better board.,but for your usage either will work fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ya.,sad but true,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
op is at least on the right track and looking at some reasonable budget z390 motherboards,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i understand your train of thought and like the innovative thinking on maximizing your budget.,keep the 12700k and if you feel like you need a better gpu then the budget can afford.. wait a little longer and save up a tad more.,plus now is the worst time to buy a gpu.,people alway fire sale the week of official announcement from nvidia.,"i upgrade every generation my motherboard, cpu, and gpu.",there have been several generations where i have profited off of my upgrades to next gen too.,this gen i already sold my gpu right before teh crash and run on a backup.,usually i dont have to sell so early but the pandemic really messed up the flow.,worse case i pay 200-300 bucks and always have top tier(more of a rental fee).,been doing this since teh 90's.,food for thought.,good luck!,!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"no, multithreaded portions of software will be split up in a thread pool, and dynamically assigned to different processor threads.",this means any competently written multithreaded software should speed up slightly with more cores and threads available.,the reason you see scaling drop off rather quickly in games is because the serial portion of a game is still a  substantial part of the loop.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that is potentially possible - you can see the effect even running cinebench r23 (when an e core gets stuck with a complex block) - but whether it means anything significant is dependant on just how long each thread normally takes to complete.,you can always disable e-cores on the fly if needed.,"also, check here for some single threaded benchmarks of p vs e cores.",https://www.anandtech.com/show/17047/the-intel-12th-gen-core-i912900k-review-hybrid-performance-brings-hybrid-complexity/7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the question you are interested in is does an e core finish one of the parcels so much slower than a p-core that it costs more than what the extra number of parcels processed in parallel gains.,that is something that can't be answered without knowing the workload.,if your workload is very highly parallelizable you can just make the individual parcels smaller so any difference between e and p cores in finishing them would be proportionally smaller.,">i.e the 12900k with 8 p and 8 e, end up performing like 16 e?",this could only technically happen if the software is implemented extremely naively.,you would have to have the task divided to 16 equally sized parcels that have to be processed before the task can continue.,in less naive parallel implementation you would have bigger number of smaller parcels that can be distributed to any free core and the p cores could do two or three parcels while e cores do one.,but even in the naive case the os scheduler should move the thread from e cores to p-cores after they start idling.,e cores are only used for priority tasks if p cores are busy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>could the p-cores not end up waiting for the slower e-cores to finish their parcels of work before being able to compute the next parcel and therefore slowing down the analysis?,"(i.e the 12900k with 8 p and 8 e, end up performing like 16 e? )","yes, potientially, although you'd have to teat.","you can probably configure your software to only use 8 threads though, in which case the p cores will be mostly used instead of e cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i've been on a i7-8700 with a 1080 ti for about 4 years now, running a 1440p 120hz monitor, only a couple games give any trouble and thats only if i put the settings to max as well.","it's windows 11 eligible, so it's still a useful functioning processor.","&#x200b;

but with that said, i also am going to upgrade to a 12700k system shortly, but thats mostly because i got bit by the upgrade bug.","&#x200b;

if you are currently on a i7-8700, you can choose to wait longer, if you are deciding between a 8700 and something else to upgrade to, the 12th gen intel cpu's have improved single thread performance, which is want games generally want the most of.","&#x200b;

yes but even an i3-12100f will beat it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah you can game ez on it.,i just finally upgraded from i56600k.,i was playing cpu intensive games with multiple browsers/ discord and during big group raids and a lot of projected texture/ detail it was struggling and sometimes stuttering as iâ€™m guessing it was my 1% lows.,i just got 12600k and man i went from graphics setting 1 to about mid and will test more as itâ€™s definitely more capable.,i am running 1440p and 1080ti,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my 5820k oc'd performs very similar to a stock 8700. i game on it daily, with a 3070 ti.","this is about the limit of the cpu, as it bottlenecks a few games (whereas the gpu is usually the bottleneck, while gaming).","your 8700 should be fine, so long as it's not running at it's base clock the entire time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

depends on the gpu you have and the games you play.,"if you are pairing it with a 3070 or better, even at 1440p you should upgrade.","if you are playing at 1080p, play esports titles or sim games, you should upgrade.",there are monumental gains in 1% lows to be had moving to a modern cpu and decent avg fps gains.,moving from 8th gen to 12th gen is like +60% st and +150% mt.,there have also been vulnerabilities that have been fixed in hardware mitigations.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

let me also add that it completely depends on how cpu bound the game is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can't compare 12th gen to previous gens that's not fair.,i got to play around with a 12400kf in a friend's build and it felt quicker than my 9700k.,of course that's subjective and i didn't bench it or anything but still.,12th gen performance is awesome.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

they commented they will never build another intel system ever again.,i threw out the $50 dollar offer for both the cpu and mobo.,it was more or less a 'as is' type of a deal meaning if there was an issue with say the motherboard it would be on me at that point.,i was willing to take the gamble for $50 dollars and they took the offer.,i threw out the offer to see if it would stick and it did.,i been around computers my whole life been around them since commodore 64 days.,i'm capable of doing electronic repair and repaired a few motherboards in my lifetime.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

for a very long time cpus have prevented themselves from being damaged by throttling.,technically a cpu should be able to handle being at the throttle point for at least the duration of the warranty without issue.,some laptops are always throttling.,i will say that even at the throttle point the system should not really be unstable.,"i guess see how a better cooler goes, but you might need to look at some other system settings if the instability remains.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what are some other areas i could look in to?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
memory speed/timings/voltage.,cpu settings/core voltage/llc/and other related settings.,maybe the system agent as well.,it could also be hardware based.,like the motherboardâ€™s vrm or the psu having issues.,"or, it could be software based.",like just drivers or random weirdness.,what are your system components?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a stock 12400 uses 65w (capped by pl1)

it may stray towards 90w if pl unlocked.","it won't reach tj-max temp on its own stock cooler when unlocked and will stay ""cold"" at the 65w limit.","the 65w limit is fine to keep enabled if, say, you only game (games will only draw 50-60 watts max, so the cpu will stay at max turbo)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no they run very cool.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what are the systems used for?,"if it's just very basic stuff, the i3-12100 would be fine, since the i5 is kind of overkill, heck you could probably even get away with the g7400 in extrme cases lol, but i think the i3 is a good area to be.","most of the tiny desktops by dell, hp, lenovo also use the ""t"" variant chips which are clocked lower and use less power.","the tiny/micro desktops use barely any power, spec it with a i3-12100t and it should be fine for basic tasks.",unless the computers are used for more intensive workloads.,"if you're planning on going the tiny/micro route, the youtube channel servethehome has a lot of reviews on these sort of desktops, including the ones from hp, dell, or lenovo.",just note what processor his unit he's testing came with.,"i wouldn't go with the i5 in a dell,hp, lenovo build if they are going to be used under high sustained loads(100% load for a few minutes), since they will get loud under those conditions.","if going tiny/micro, make sure you get a t processor, and not a non-t.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 12400 doesnt even go past 70 in cinebench unlocked.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
even in a small/mini build?,"it seems as though for ""office"" desktops most offerings today are the small/mini form factors and i'd rather lose performance due to artificial limiters than losing performance due to heat.",i have to expect these cpus to last much longer than what should be a normal replacement period as i work for a rural school district so what we spend needs to last as i haven't been able to get the upper echelons to commit to a replacement schedule.,we're still using 4th gen and older devices which doesn't support the latest security requirements which is why we've been having to scramble for devices.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i might give that channel a peruse.,"the desktops are, at least as of right now, meant to serve as an interface between the teacher and their classroom devices.","currently a projector, overhead speakers (through a amp), and a doc cam.",potentially looking to replace projectors with a interactive panel and that may take the desktop with it as the teachers can use their laptops for making lessons to port over.,most stuff is being run in the browser and i already know teachers have a bad habit of leaving a ton of tabs open.,in the case of office staff they're still using misc software like quickbooks and publisher but it does look like that may have to start migrating over to the cloud as well if only because the versions we have now aren't supported any longer.,"&#x200b;

mainly what it comes down to is the price of the desktops.","frankly it seems like it's the wild west for ""office"" desktops as i'll see one build priced at say $700 and then here's a worse specced system for $800 instead, from the same vendor/manufacturer.",that's not even getting into availability.,i literally remarked earlier today to my coworker at how the small/mini cases appear to be the standard as there were very few mid tower offerings... and even from a vendor that mostly deals with businesses/government the mid towers were starting to be infiltrated by rgb crud.,"&#x200b;

i also have to deal with the knowledge that these cpus are probably going to be run long after they should be replaced.",we're still running 4th gen intel and older on most of our current machines which is exactly why we have to replace them as they don't support the current security requirements.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, and whether it is worth it just comes down to your expectations and whether the \~$175 premium is worth it to be almost guaranteed better silicon.","i have also seen a few mediocre 12900ks so it's not a guarantee, but even the mediocre 12900ks are better silicon quality than an average 12900k if the 12900ks isn't defective.",i have seen multiple defective alder lake desktop chips with bad cores that would either throttle or crash (known good cooling setup used in testing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is it most likely all 12900k cpus now are worse binned than before 12900ks was released as did intel just basically start taking best 12900k cpus and branding them as ks??,or are all newer cpus better binned regardless and it does not always work like that??,"&#x200b;

and does 12700k have worse bin p cores than 12900k on average or is it just have 4 e-cores fused off that were defective and not necessarily worse binned p cores?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so it is definitely possible to get a worse binned 12900ks than 12900k, its just that the premium price puts the odds highly in favor of the 12900ks having better silicon when yo buy it.",but the lottery element is still there.,"&#x200b;

likewise the 12900k cpus are usually better binned p cores than 12700k cpus but some 12700k cpus may have better binned p cores than 12900k/ks cpus??","&#x200b;

"> is it most likely all 12900k cpus now are worse binned than before 12900ks

no.","this was tested with a few hundred cpus, and the binning for the 12900k is the same from before and after the 12900ks.",so bin quality remains the same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's extremely rare to get a 12900k with better silicon than a 12900ks, but it's possible and it's like you said regarding the lottery element.",i think it's even more rare for a 12700k to have better silicon on the p-cores than a 12900k but totally possible and it happens.,nobody is certain exactly how intel decides to bin a 12700k but it's almost certainly like you said.,"with that said, this all makes it that much more clear why the 12700k is often such a good value.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes 12700k such a great value because you get 8 p cores and if you want 8 p cores but no e-cores you just shut them off and it is over $200 less expensive just for 4 less e-cores which many disable anyways.,and there is no p core only cpu 12th gen for sale so 12700k is best bet for those who want all p cores and disable e-cores anyways.,"well you get 5mb less l3 cache, but that seems mild difference at most.",the p cores are so awesome though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

pretty huge is the short answer.,"you have 8 ""performance"" cores that are about 50% more powerful than 8th gen,  and an additional 8 or so ""efficient"" cores that are about equal to the cores of 8700k @ \~ 4.3 ghz.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"still just 6 p cores, but they're running around 5ghz by default so about the same as what 8700k would overclock to.",changes to cache will presumably make the 13 series run much faster than the 8 series.,"more e-cores will up the multithreading ability for productivity, but few games can make use of them at this time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think amd switching to am5 is leaving them extremely vulnerable here and intel is choosing to attack at the perfect time to grab back market share.,if people canâ€™t stay on am4 and are forced into changing platforms then thereâ€™s a high chance they just build an intel system.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>i wonder how would amd even compete against this with their upcoming zen 4 ryzen 5 7600x?,"*thats the neat part, they wont*",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it will be ddr5 so mt will have gains ( like adl ).,but agaist budget ddr4 rpt they will have nothing.,the only thing am5 has is the better io and upgrade path ( buy 7600x today and upgrade to 9800x3d in 2026 ) but i dont think there will be many board under 200 and none under 150.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"> i think 8p cores would also take less die space

4 e-cores take up about the same amount of space as 1 p-core, so a 6p+8e takes up roughly the same amount of space, at the same time they're very efficient in terms of die space/multi-threaded performance, especially when power consumption is added into the equation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i doubt the small cores are going to limit performance so much that a 8+0 configuration makes more sense.,"remember that pretty much nothing scales to 8 cores, but at the same time does not scale to 14. games certainly don't.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"people said this about 12th gen, yet the 12600k is still sold with msrp decent price.",they have no reason to increase prices.,they also have to fight with amd.,"to anyone who is still on 6th, 7th, or 9th gen, hell, even 10th and 11th gen, the 13 series will be a hell of an upgrade.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the new amd chips will be just like intels, a marginal arch changes with a frequency bump, but amd is also going from ddr4 to ddr5 which will be a performance bump intel already went through, so add that on top of all the core changes.","yes and amd had their 5000 chips out a year before intel, one would expect a chip that comes out a year later to be better?",then amd bring a 5000 chip with v-cache on the market and it's back again head to head with intel.,"both are literally neck to neck, the real only difference is that amd has the efficiency upper hand, which i believe they will keep into the new generation.",it all depends what you want or need.,"that being said, amd received some new releases and reduced prices a lot in the past few months.","for example the ""new"" 5700x is cheaper than the 12600k, while the 5600x is significantly cheaper than the 12600k.","and someone buying either of those chips will have a good time, if you have strict requirements of what you need from a cpu, well you already know what to buy, but for everyone else, amd or intel really doesn't matter these days.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

in fact going by numbers a pure 8 core zen 4 is not going to suffice in mt.,zen 4 cores are a bit slower than rpl p cores.,even if they had parity then it would be 2 zen 4 cores vs 8 e cores.,there is simply no way a 8 core zen 4 matches the 13600k in multithread.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the cache games are nearly all simulator/strategy type games.,"think racing sims, flight sims, 4x empire type games, etc.","that's an entire genre of games, not so much cherry picked individual titles.","that's not a very large target audience, but it's one that tends to have deep pockets and wants the best, racing and flight sim audience in general spends nearly as much on peripherals as they do on pcs.","a few generations back these audiences were intel dominated as cpus like the ryzen 1700x, 2700x or 3700x, while offering multicore advantages over 7th 8th and 9th gen intel chips at equal or less pricing, did not have the raw cpu performance needed for these games, and so any serious players of these games opted for the 7700k, 8700k, or 9900k.","the 5800x3d is now the penultimate cpu in this entire genre, plus offering solid gains in other more mainstream games, but it seems to be limited in production/availability and came very close to the next gen chips and on an eol socket, this is why i haven't gotten one.","the 7000 series v cache cpus could very well continue to dominate in these fields and expand the niche so to speak,  with additional refinements plus more units sold, might cut back the biggest problem with the 5800x3d which is that it's on an eol socket, is expensive, and hard to find even at msrp.",a hypothetical 7900x3d would also fix the multicore performance problem of the 5800x3d only having 8 cores.,"i'm going to upgrade to a latest platform, whether that's ryzen 7000 or intel 13th gen, whichever one performs best in these games gets my money.","i'm betting it will 7800x3d (or whatever it's called) vs the 13900k, but ofc i will wait for final benchmarks to see.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"5800x3d, not 5800x.",two entirely different cpus.,this discussion is about v cache so the regular 5800x isn't relevant except as a benchmark to compare to the x3d.,"sorry but it doesn't matter what clock speed and ram you have on the 12900k, any cache sensitive games the 5800 x3d beats the 12900ks and stomps the 5800x in games.","even in games where the x3d isn't massively improved over the 5800x, its still competitive to the 12900ks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think price wise it's not likely for amd to be hugely competitive here.,not just because n5 is expensive (i'm sure an amortized intel 7 is also pretty much expensive) but because of the opportunity cost.,unless there is a big slow down on the data centre side it's hard to see why amd would want to aggressively price a zen 4 ccx in a ryzen product to compete with rl when they could use the same ccx in a genoa/bergamo product with much high margins as there isn't really any competition there.,i expect for most gamers raptor lake will be the best price/performance but maybe at some specific uses/price points ryzen might be the niche choice - i also expect efficiency to still be pretty good which might be relevant to some people.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
im not even sure if that will even be the case.,i mean a 5800x close or past the verge of melting down can maybe get 16.500 cbr23 score.,that's already at 150-160 watts.,in order for an 8 core zen 4 to hit 25k it needs a more than 50% st performance increase at all core clocks.,even with balls to the wall oc it might not be possible.,"out of the box, no freaking chance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

well this is a hard sell since nvidia's rtx 4000 series is going to have a very good supply.,it's so very good that they're searching for other fabless semi to get their overbooked wafer supply and crypto crash is forcing gpu miners to sell their gpu which is the main driving force of the plummeting msrp for the current gen cards.,"if this is even true i don't think price, regardless how cheap it is versus amd and intel, matter because intel need to ship this with a relatively stable driver.",and from what we seen so far their gpu driver is not ready for a release.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think other than power usage (which many people don't care about) it looks fairly compelling at the current price.,"performance is average for the price, not bad or good, likely to only go up with driver updates.","features are great, raytracing and ai hardware onboard even at the low end.",and they have the most advanced video encoder and decoder with support for new formats.,for a decent general purpose non gaming machine it's actually quite competitive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

with a 192bit bus the only other alternative would have been 6gb.,which would have sucked.,"they should have just gone with a 256bit bus, and made the card $30 cheaper with 8gb.",but who knows... we once thought that having 8gb on an rx 570 was pointless over the 4gb model.,"and yet lots of games use more than 6gb still, and people are still using those cards at settings that use 6gb.","mostly allows you to turn up textures, since textures don't have much of an fps impact.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you can certainly try the bios fix to have the 3700x around as a spare backup pc, but it didn't fix stuff for myself and others.","it's possible mine was also dying on top of the ftpm stuff, but i really don't see how a cpu that was never oc'd and never had high temps would start doing this, coincidently around the same time months ago that amd admitted to the ftpm problems.","for what i play and do, even a 5600x would have been fine, but, i didn't want to risk potentially having another unsolvable ftpm problem so i went 12th gen intel that isn't affected by the ftpm crap.","if amd won't give me too much hassle, i'm going to try doing an rma on the 3700x.","previously, i had a 2600k before i went ryzen years ago, and, it kept up well despite its old age even then.","this 12400/12500 matches or beats the 5600x that everyone seems to love in games, so, it's certainly potent.","hopefully i can ride out the rest of this console gen problem free............. i never ended up streaming like i thought i would so the ryzen 7's extra threads didn't help me much there, and, these days, the encoding can be offloaded to the gpu anyway.","i have never had an unsolvable issue like i had with the 3700x in 13 years of pc gaming and building.....it was just my luck i replaced every component besides the faulty one, because, who would assume an un-abused component would just start dying

whoever shows you the end result does the sync.,the nvidia gpu does the heavy work but who is showing the end result?,in your case its in igpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"never used these options but im just tryna helpful here

so you can enable adaptive sync from graphics control centre and vrr from windows settings 

if you want further information you can go through this reddit post 
https://www.reddit.com/r/intel/comments/ucaqk2/intel_adaptive_sync_vrr_on_laptops/",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i realize when using optimus the nvidia gpu does the heavy work and goes through the igpu.,but there was never an option to enable adaptive sync in this situation because the igpu didn't offer adaptive sync.,"in the past, if a laptop had a port going through the igpu, you had no ability to use g sync through nvidia or any type of vrr/adaptive sync.",i've never heard of anyone using it through the intel gpu like this so i guess what i'm asking is has anyone tried it and is it as effective as using g sync through the nvidia gpu?,i'm assuming this is a new feature because my 2019 gaming laptop never had the option to use adaptive sync unless i bypassed the integrated intel gpu...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh awesome thank you!,this is all so foreign to me considering how i normally would enable g sync through the nvidia control panel so that post has a lot of good info.,makes me wonder if this is a recent microsoft/intel doing where they are providing adaptive sync to a lot more laptop displays that prior wouldn't be able to use it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">in the past, if a laptop had a port going through the igpu, you had no ability to use g sync through nvidia or any type of vrr/adaptive sync.",i've never heard of anyone using it through the intel gpu like this so i guess what i'm asking is has anyone tried it and is it as effective as using g sync through the nvidia gpu?,i have no idea where you were told this but you definitely had an ability to turn on vrr.,"people brought cheap amd gpus and used vrr on them while letting the nvidia gpu do the heavy work before ""gsync compatible"" was a thing, probably talking 2015/2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
glad you liked it and was informative to you sir.,yeah !,!,maybe what i think is that it's the igpu thing in the new alder lake cpus of intel so yeah !,!,and microsoft gave the settings to support that :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you referring to desktops or laptops with this?,i'm assuming you mean they were using integrated amd graphics from the cpu to run vrr since i didn't think it was possible to have dedicated amd gpu and nvidia gpu in the same system.,i know sli existed with two nvidia gpus back in the day.,i've only had gaming laptops that allowed me to enable g sync on an external monitor by using mini dp and doing it through the nvidia control panel.,"being able to enable it through the intel graphics center, i've never read/heard or seen anyone doing it this way.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"in the tests in [this comparison](https://www.notebookcheck.net/r7-4700u-vs-i5-10500h_11683_13217.247596.0.html) the 10500h wins by 11%
> average benchmarks amd ryzen 7 4700u â†’ 100% n=39  
> average benchmarks intel core i5-10500h â†’ 111% n=39

but what the performance numbers don't reveal is how inefficient the intel chip is compared with the amd chip.",the amd chip uses roughly a third as much watts so if thermals and battery life (assuming it's a laptop) matters then i'd go with the 4700u despite the average being in intel's favor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the power limit is reducing performance.,"some boards have higher limits automatically, but i guess not that one.",these can draw over 200w.,"i know the 12900k can draw 240, but not sure about the 12700k.",go look into pl1 and pl2 limits.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"pl1 and pl2 limits are already disabled, meaning there are no restrictions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pl1 and pl2 were already removed.,i think i fixed it by increasing vdroop and enabling all vrm phases.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wrote all that info on the post.,"logic is the same in all bioses, you disable pl1 and pl2 limits.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the gpu is worth about 350-400cad but gpu prices could decrease further.,another 400 could get you a 12400/r5 5600 with a cheap board but that wouldn't include the case/peripherals.,"not a fan of dell/alienware either, they make things proprietary so you can't upgrade and overall the case is badly designed.",i'd pass.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"been using a 3930 for 5 years i got it used from amazon i didnt know it was a chip from 2011 i thought it was just cheap cause it was used i found out months later in the same year when i did research it came out in 2011

i dont research chips often so i just now found out last week that its been a 10th 11th and now 12th gen chips and just found earlier this week more chips are coming 

both 12400 and 11600 vs my chip is a 70 percent jump

i didnt get a 11600 cause of the temp problems 

12600 vs my chip is a 100 percent jump

these chips compared to each other which is why i went with the 12400

on the left is the classic 3930 which the load temps are in 40s with the d9dx cooler and on the right is the monster 12400 with the se-214-xt 

its amazing how much these chips are able to stay cool even being pre oced out the box compared to the old chips where even going to the same 4.0 as these newer chips the old ones will run hotter

>the total work you do will require a specific energy.,the heat output will be the same if you have 1 core running for six times as long as six cores running for one sixth the time to complete the same task.,this is false.,"there is no specific amount of energy required to do a calculation, it depends on how you run the calculation.","power consumption scales with between the square and cube of frequency, so 6 slower cores use a lot less power to do the same amount of work as 1 fast core.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

> the power consumption and heat produced should already be very low during this type of workloads since the pc is basically doing nothing.,"but my question is why did you even buy a 12600k, which is a beast of a cpu, while you don't use it for anything intensive.","you are probably right, you don't need the p cores, but if you end up not using ~80% of the cpu just sell it and buy a weaker one.",although i have mostly weaker workloads i sometimes do stuff that involves compiling bigger programs or compressing huge amounts of files.,"also i wanted it to be future-proof, like really future-proof.","and although i don't have much time for gaming right now, i do play more sometimes - especially in the winter...

> i also want to add that disabling cores is a very inefficient way of reducing power consumption, undervolting is much more effective and doesn't destroy the cpu performance.",if you set the p cores to something like 4ghz and e cores to 2.5ghz you could decrease the voltage a lot and massively reduce the heat output of the cpu.,"but as i said in the begging it shouldn't change much for you since you are already utilizing the cpu very lightly, it makes more of a difference in heavier workloads.",thanks that was the answer i was looking for.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

and thatâ€™s why cpus are already designed to be power efficient when thereâ€™s no or low workload.,itâ€™s not like youâ€™ve got a cpu thatâ€™s constantly burning 200 watts no matter what youâ€™re doing.,itâ€™s smarter than that!,itâ€™s like you have a car.,it goes from 0-120 miles per hour.,"you donâ€™t need that, so youâ€™re asking how to disable cylinders in the engine to ensure it doesnâ€™t go above 50. but occasionally you might want 70.

only, the car is already capable of varying its speed and the amount of gas consumed.",just trust the gas pedal!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you'd better undervolting and applying a lower pl1 and pl2 in this way you lower power consumption and optimise performance per watt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"e cores are not more power efficient, actually they are pretty terrible at that.",their saving grace is that they run at way lower clockspeeds.,if you run the pcores at 4ghz they will absolutely destroy the ecores in efficiency,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">hm in my understanding the e-cores are more power-efficient, so running two workloads consecutively on an e-core should in fact use less energy, than if one of them would run on an e-core should it not?",they're more efficient at lower to middle clock speed.,at higher clocks the p cores become more efficient.,for this reason don't disable anything.,"if you want to improve power efficiency, lower the maximum boost clock and the pl2 power limits.",this will force both processors to operate more in their higher efficiency zones while still retaining pretty good performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
power efficient at certain workloads.,not everything.,"but by default the cpu is already designed to run in the most efficient manner, and manually butchering its feature set or capabilities is not going to help.",even my 12900k uses under 8 watts when idling.,"run windows 11. it, combined with your 12th gen cpu, will endeavour to ensure that the correct workload is always assigned to the correct core type.","as suggested, undervolt a little.","if you are really anal about limiting performance / power draw, i would suggest lowering the pl1/pl2 power limits and otherwise allowing the system to manage how that power is utilized.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i know.,my question was rather if i could even further push down power consumption by forcing everything to use e-cores.,as per your other answer this does not seem to be the case :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'm curious to see the ddr5 vs ddr4 comparisons for raptor lake.,i had originally considered maybe upgrading straight up a ryzen 1600 + b450 board to raptor lake ddr4 platform in order to keep my 48gb ram setup.,"the reason why i have that setup is because cities skylines uses about 30gb ram (after combing through my subscribed content to throw out ones that i didn't need) and showed no performance improvement of going from 2933 mhz cl16 auto timings to 3533 mhz cl18 manually tightened timings (while civilization 6 showed faster turn times), so there was no point in setting my wallet on fire with a 64gb ddr5 kit for negligible performance gains.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it looks like the 3090ti is a bottleneck.,"based on the synthetic bench of the two, there should've been a bigger difference if there was no bottleneck.","there's a difference in minimum fps but considering the averages are practically the same in most titles, i'm guessing the 1% lows are actually quite comparable to each other.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
average isn't that useful here.,far cry 6 and hzd were running at their gpu bottlenecked settings at 1080p.,"yes, even on a 3090ti.",that's why reviewers drop to medium for those games.,rdr2 was probably some scheduling issue on alder lake that's fixed by raptor lake so that's an outlier.,lows were always a little too low on that game.,ironically i think pubg is the better indicator of what raptor lake can do since the game is such a shoddily optimized ue4 game that it's always cpu bottlenecked but runs as expected on alder lake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i thought the perf difference in some games was a scheduler thing rather than a ring thing?,like game threads were being scheduled to the slower e-cores.,i know i've had to use process lasso a couple of times to make sure a process only uses p-cores.,you can easily get 4.2 on ring with e-cores which is not that far off the 4.5 p-core only ring boost.,does ring really make that much of a difference?,genuinely asking here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same as zen4?,it's die-shrunk zen3 with double the l2 and the ability to run avx512 on the 256bit avx2 pipelines.,meteor lake v. zen5 is the proper big battle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have u seen the 13600k es3 in cpu-z?,"10100 points in mt... the 12900k has 8600, 5950x has 11800... in st near 880 points, another 10% increase over adl-s, zen4 has a 15% improvement in st and 35% in mt, i see that really close dont u?",zen3 to zen 4 has near the same increase (even lower in mt) than adl-s to rpl-s,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how trustworthy is this source?,are they testing a 13th gen developer sample?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> power consumption + 20%

*peak* power consumption + 20%, honestly i would have expected much bigger increase, considering we are comparing a 5.5ghz cpu against a 4.9ghz one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
am i missing something or isn't it getting like an average of 20% improvements to 1% lows at 1440/1080p?,this is considered only moderate?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"20% power draw increase for 5% more performance... typical intel move, totally worth it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wait for the 18900k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for gaming, work or both?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if gaming performance is what you want, you might want to consider waiting for a price drop on the 12900k or 12900ks",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"always wait - there's something much better coming ""soon""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
honestly i'd even coast until 15th gen/arrow lake at least.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you want to keep ddr4 a 13600 would be nice.,why do you need the extra cores?,if you want ddr5 zen4 is the better option.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"at least unlike kaby lake, thereâ€™s mt improvements.","but yeah, not much for gaming it seems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is much different.,kabylake was literally skylake + 300 mhz and slightly better thermals per mhz because of the enhanced 14nm process.,this at least adds cache and cores in addition to the above.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is an incremental increase.,meteor lake coming next should be a good deal bigger.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the idea that every generation is a huge jump has never been true.,amd has done good progress for a few generations but that was largely because they started from very low and had fairly obvious improvements to do every generation.,but apparently people are not expecting zen4 to be a very large architectural improvement.,intelâ€™s traditional model had bigger architecture update every two generations.,this was disrupted in 6-10th gen by the delay on new process which prevented bringing new architecture to market.,raptor lake is a smaller update to caches and power management so you would expect performance increases to happen in some workloads but not all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not for amd lol, amd is going from 4.6ghz to 5.4ghz all core clock and additional 5% higher ipc.",only thing intel does with raptor lake is overclocking alder lake and doubling the amount of little cores that don't help gaming performance at all.,disabling them actually increases gaming perf a bit and improves frametime stability.,very very lazy update.,"it's clear that intel again cheaped out on their cpu architecture development, just like they did from 6th gen to 10th gen.

in fact the only use case for these small cores is heavy multithread such as rendering, but that's pointless because nowadays rendering is much faster with gpu compute.",so basically main reason why intel is using little cores is marketing because for many people more cores = better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
amd sucks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, its already been unofficially confirmed, and these tests are done on a z690 board.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea thats what i was wondering too.,do you still have to use process lasso to this day?i was told those issues where fixed by a ppl who believed turning off the e-cores wasn't needed anymore.got downvoted for it actually too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no?,it's a new architecture with new cores different from zen3 cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"most hardware leaks come from china, taiwan and hong kong.",i don't speak their languages therefore cannot comment on the validity of the leaks.,however the video content lines up to what's been rumored.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to me the 13900k seems more a rebranded 12900ks.,a 20% more power consumption for a slight increase in performance.,i hope iâ€™m wrong.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
red dead redemption 2 and pubg skewered the results.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're missing that the amd discord was here and they're trying to downplay the +40% mins with their cute brigade,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah just like apple with the m2.,(it was 33% power draw increase for 15% more performance over the m1),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"worth noting that on the most important metric for gaming (minimums), the performance increased by 28%.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wait until the names get too long that they go through a name change

i think 13th gen is where it stops rolling off the tongue",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wait for post-silicon cpus, or when someone finds a way to cool stacked high performance cores without the whole thing melting from the insane thermal density.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there isnâ€™t really a gaming performance difference between the 12600k and 12900k tbh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"uh, you do know that 12th gen supports ddr5 right?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"zen 4 isn't even released yet, and it's ddr5 performance will certainly be worse due to infinity fabric limitations",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got screwed last time i upgraded and went for the 7700k.,not making the same mistake with 13th gen being a rehash.,i'm waiting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"raptor lake is a totally lazy update over alder lake...

they could have released 13900k few months after 12900k if they wanted because they're only adding more little cores and little cache increase into a scalable design.",+ of course factory overclock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's actually 8-10% higher ipc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
even with the clocks they advertise only 15 st gain.,this is why i said what i said.,ofc intel is doing it for marketing.,most people would buy a quad core i9 over an 8core amd.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[it's been **officially** confirmed.,](https://wccftech.com/roundup/intel-13th-gen-raptor-lake-cpus/),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you know i just set process lasso when i first got this 12600k (at launch) and forgot about it.,i haven't tried testing to see if windows 10 updates have improved the scheduler!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just like zen 2 was ""completely different"" from zen 1?","the performance projections by amd places zen 4 in the refresh with low-hanging fruit category of zen 2, rather than complete revamp of zen 3.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what are you smoking?,zen 4 is basically just zen 3 with a cache bump on 5nm.,is that what counts as â€œbrand new coreâ€ these days?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
?,?,"it gets huge gains in 3 games, and single digit gains in 3 games.",considering the sample size you could literally say the same thing about far cry and hzd skewering results lower.,"these results look pretty similar to x3d results, which were quite good across many games even if not all games got the massive 100% flight simulator gains.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think it will be with the 16th gen and the use of the royal core project,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and you cant upgrade the cpu, that is the literal point i was making ( via the op discution )",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
assumption.,what we know for sure is that the socket will suport upgrades.,raptor lake is perfect for ddr4 and a dead end for ddr5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"on the plus side, used 7700ks were going for insane prices on ebay for a while.","back in 2019-2020, i saw the price skyrocket to $330.","i took a screenshot when it was at around $300: https://i.redd.it/i64wqpdt1rm41.png

bear in mind that the 7700k had a msrp of $305 back in jan 2017 when anandtech published their review: https://www.anandtech.com/show/10968/the-intel-core-i7-7700k-91w-review-the-new-stock-performance-champion

someone could have sold that cpu and their motherboard, and using the sales profit, get a new motherboard and a 9600k/9700k or ryzen 3700x/3900x at the time.","just 10 months ago, the 6700k was still going for $200: https://i.redd.it/v3w3460p8xj71.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you improve architecture mainly by making it bigger.,"golden cove is already huge, there is not really room to make it much bigger.",so no huge architecture reform expected.,the changes in raptor lake are supposed to be more about power delivery.,i'm not sure how you know this was ready for launch right after alder lake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they increased l2 cache on the big and little cores though.,also more l3 cache as well since they added an extra 2 e-core clusters.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ironically, next gen it will be intel offering higher core counts.",the ryzen 5 7600x is going to feel like the i5 7600k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh so you're using w10.that would explain why the scheduler might not be working as intended,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
these results look nothing like x3d which has good improvements in both average and 1% min.,+600mhz with 2x l2$ won't yield such results.,only red dead redemption 2 and pub g yield more than average (average + 1% low).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it doesn't deliver that much performance as it's ""huge"" size suggests tho.. only like 15% higher ipc over zen3 eventhough 2 zen3 cores can fit in place of one golden cove.","the point of improving architecture is about making it reach as much performance per transistor as possible, not making it big.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"apparently you haven't actually looked at the performance figures compared to the 12900k: https://static.techspot.com/articles-info/2450/bench/1080p.png

memory access bottleneck was already less severe on the 12900k keeping it close to the x3d performance overall even with dramatically less cache, but the x3d cache gave a lot of huge 1% low improvements.",now this small sample shows simple outsized 1% gains.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sure 2 zen 3 cores can fit in place of golden cove, but that doesn't count l3 cache which takes up massive amount of zen 3 ccd.",so the overall 8 core golden cove cluster is 30% larger than 8 core zen 3 cluster.,"and with cezanne we saw that even though halving l3 cache to 16mb saves quite a lot of area, at least in gaming, performance drops quite a bit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you should compare x3d vs 5800x and 12900k vs 13900k.,13900k improvement over 12900k is no where near that of x3d over 5800x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"these temps really arenâ€™t that bad, i wouldnâ€™t worry too much about it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"cooler dead or aired, try shaking it vigorously in bios with pump speed at maximum (just make sure your cpu doesn't overheat while doing it lol, should be fine in bios though).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i would check your cooler, mounting, paste and if the aio pump is running  correctly.",i have a 10700k in an sfx case with a sfx cooler big shuriken 3 and i only see low 80c if i stress test.,while gaming heavy games the max i got is low 70s.,i love in domincan republic and ambient temperature is around mid 30c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ho can i know if aio cooler runs correctly?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this totally sounds like a problem with shader cache but i have no idea about how it's controlled.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mabey try to clear the shader cache in the nvidia control panel.,also steam lets you clear the cache in the settings different cache tho update your drivers and restart the computer good luck.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wiill!,thank you :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for your comment!,i have a small question: i can use the nvidia control panel even if i have intel?,i am very ignorant on this stuff lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no you canâ€™t, maybe in intel graphics control panel (but idk).",iâ€™d just get a budget gpu like (new) gtx 1060/ti for around 200â‚¬.,you should be good then.,if youâ€™ll ever need to upgrade in near future go for i5 12600k / 12600kf (270â‚¬) + 2x8gb ddr4 ram 3600mhz (65â‚¬) and use the 1060/ti from this computer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the op has a laptop,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh rip, my bad.",i mean he could get an external gpu but wouldnâ€™t say itâ€™s quite worth it.. just get a better pc at that point.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
his laptop might not have the proper connection for a external gpu or budget.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

for gamers best options are k and f.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the only difference between the two is that the f version comes without an integrated gpu and the other has an integrated gpu.,"if you wanna save some money, get the f version because it is usually cheaper.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12700 has igpu and 12700f doesnâ€™t.,"you wonâ€™t be using your igpu anyways, only reason could be troubleshooting while your gpu breaks - imo not worth the price difference.",there isnâ€™t any reason to overclock these days imo - all cpuâ€™s offer turbo boost which will be sufficient for 99% of people.,"iâ€™m planning to build a similar build in near furure: 12700 + 2x8 gb ddr4 3600mhz (i might upgrade to 32 later), ssd+m.2 only (no hdd),",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12700f and 12700 difference is only the inclusion of the igpu.,it's super helpful when you're debugging issues if you like to tinker with settings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i always go for something with an igpu just in case i need to trouble shoot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i know you didn't ask, but, i would:

- buy a 12400f
- use a stock cooler
- sell 1060
- think about saving money on mobo, ram, fans(maybe do get a proper cooler instead of fans)
- buy 3060, 6699xt or 3060 ti with money saved",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if yhe difference was $10-15 i would say go with 12700 (igpu) but price difference is too much.. go with f in my opinion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you should pick 12100.

and upgrade to a 13600 in 4 months that will be better in gaming and about the same performance in mt.",for 50-100 euro less than you want to spend now.,"or even better, buy a 13400 for the upgrade and spend the 150 you saved on a 4060.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
non-f because that f price bump is too much.,correction: choose the f.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i always get cpu with igpu.,"sometimes it can help you, if your main video card will fail,  you can use the igpu for a while till the main video will be fixed or changed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
alright thanks !,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i see thanks, since i already have a gpu i guess it's a better choice :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i see thanks!,":)
good luck with your build too!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tbf if the price difference wasnt that big i would have picked the igpu i think,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh i do plan on selling the 1060 later but gpu are kinda overpriced in my country right now 

i was also able to find the ram on sale during the prime days :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
okay thanks !,:),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you mean f right ?,it's the cheaper one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i guess its useful but here the price difference is almost 100â‚¬ :/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you need quicksync you will lose performance on the f chip,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nice, sounds good.","in that case, a 12700f plus 32gb of ram should set a pretty solid foundation for your next complete machine.",:),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
f. i guess i'm too tired.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's not normal, the price difference must be around $25.",check another seller or wait for a better offer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to clarify: you might need quicksync for video editing work, video transcodes, and you can use it as another option for live stream compression too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
alright thanks !,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is correct.,but op needs to do his homework for once.,if he never heard of it and doesnâ€™t do more then gamingâ€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you update the bios?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"assuming it doesnâ€™t work at all - like just at base speed, never mind xmp - and both modules do work in the one slot, then your options are bent cpu pins or defective motherboard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what ram?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
check if your cpu pins are bent - edit sorry you checked already.,try reset/flash the bios?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
could be a contact issue.,"i heard the 12900k has issues with all the pins getting contact with the pins because of the cheap mounting system intel uses, which usually results in ram not being registered.",not sure if that translates to the lower models.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes i updated bios , infact i tried every bios available .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
return the board to where you bought it and tell them only 1 ram slot works.,sometimes there is a dud,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"while objectively it is gonna be a good upgrade (chances are, the 9300h will be paired with a more competent graphics card too), 9300h is still fairly old and slow to cpus today.",the 9300h laptop you are looking at must be extremely discounted and cheap for this to be worth it.,can you not afford even the lowest tier of laptops with modern cpus like at least ryzen 4000+ or 11th gen for intel?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the i5-11400h is 6 cores / 12 threads and would be a much better upgrade.,they're often paired with mobile 3050 / 3050 ti in newer laptops,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"might as well wait another month or so to see what new features z790 motherboards may bring, theyâ€™re likely to be revealed in the coming weeks.","if you plan to get a 13th gen cpu and think z790 is worth it, then get the more up-to-date chipset, if not, z690 is still a great chipset and if you can get a good deal it could be worth it.",my advice this close to any new release is always wait and see.,"either the next gen is worth it, or last gen parts get discounted as new stuff comes to market.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
really comes down to how urgent you need the pc.,"you can forever be waiting on the next big reveal

best advice i can give is don't buy parts over time - just keep saving.","once you've decided you have enough to spend, buy the best that suits your needs/budget at the time.","as someone else said, 790 may have extra features, but z690 will be discounted.",just buy what suits your needs best at time of building,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most z690 motherboard will support 13th gen cpu with bios update in the future.,asus and asrock already released the updated bios to support 13th gen cpu (with their z690 and b660 lines),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so the posted multi cinebench scores were based on 400w tdp.,so if your going to build a raptorlake with a high-end 4 series card.,"your looking at nothing less than a 1200w psu, to cool a 400w cpu you will have to run a substantial aio 360mm or more.",or  a custom loop.,then you have to evacuate that heat.,"a ground up proper raptorlake and 4xxx setup is goin to cost 3500 to $4000... 

it's not just the cost of the chip anymore...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
youre looking at 2-3 months before launch of z790.,there's also the price difference.,"z690 is now on sale, as it launched almost a year ago.",z790 will be full price and might even have higher msrps due to nearly 10% inflation year of year.,"unless youre willing to wait a few months and fork over more money, i'd just buy the z690 board.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"appreciate it, thank you!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
will the early z790 boards be as good as high end z690 boards?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"is it true that certain z690 motherboards support pcie gen 5 m.2 slots, but they can mess with the gpu slot?","i heard this a few times, but looked through a few manuals of some of the more expensive models and could not confirm it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the boards wonâ€™t post tho, how do you flash the bios if the board doesnâ€™t post.",i just did a build today to find that it requires a bios update and apparently the update is pretty sketchy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oct 20 is when intel will release its raptor lake cpus.,i assume motherboards will be available then too.,"if someone is reading this in october, it is worth to wait rather than upgrading with a z690 chipset",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

they won't be any worse.,"the socket is staying the same so the main changes will be optimisation for 13th gen and possibly a better feature set, better i/o etc.","again, depends on what you need.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
think the biggest improvement for 13th gen will be on the mobile side for power management.,there will probably be a tweak to the ddr5 memory controller.,"but realistically if you find a good deal on the 12900k, then the 10 percent or so you wonâ€™t notice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"all boards can have this, not just z690.",basically the closest m.2 slot to the cpu is a direct link and doesn't affect pcie at all.,"if it has more than one m.2 slots, then the lower ones use some of the pcie lanes.","gpus generally don't saturate all the pcie lanes anyway so it's not really going to affect performance, but it is possible.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

k yeah a 12900k is frankly ridiculous for gaming and also produces a shitload of heat.,if u want an insane gaming build right now with performance similar to 12900k but without the heat consider 5800x3d.,we dont know the specs for 13th gen but once they come out either make a decision then and go for the 13600k or whatever the i5 is called or pick up a 12700k since theyll probably be cheaper.,edit: 5800x3d will also be cheaper than 12900k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the biggest issue intel will face is drivers.,"we've all heard the ""fine wine"" meme for ati/amd, and though generally more on top of it, nvidia still often faces issues requiring rapid patches - which they hide in their 'game ready' deployment system.",for a while these are likely to 'fine wine' as intel fixes bugs and optimises settings on a per-game basis.,"in the next generation, it'll be interesting to see whether they get on top of the software with large, effective software teams, or perpetually play catch up aka 'fine wine'.",it's worth noting that to an extent these driver changes can be a two way collaborative process.,hardware makers can find bugs and recommend changes to game devs.,"as a known, but relatively new entry into the non-integrated space, and unlikely to make huge inroads in market share rapidly, intel's recommendations are likely to take back seat vs amd and nvidia.","the fact they have igpus in a huge chunk of machines, and it is my understanding that arc is built from that base architecture, may mitigate this backseating somewhat.","still, it's very likely amd and nvidia will get the most resources.",intel's reaction to be treated that way may define their success.,they're going to have to accept far more of the performance responsibility in the early years until they have a customer base worth catering to.,"if they throw a tantrum, they'll be ignored by devs, and they'll get a rep from gamers as having inconsistent cards.",it's also a bad time to enter this market.,"naturally, you can easily imagine the team 5 years ago saying ""we're ready to start designing a real gpu"", the board saying no, and then when prices flew up the board seeing dollar signs.",of course it takes a bit more than a working base igpu architecture to build a competitive discrete gpu.,it's a much bigger beast and the development process meant they got to the dock just in time to watch it leave.,happens a lot in the history of ics.,"anyway, it'll be interesting to see how it plays out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"people are misunderstanding **this chart is solely for pricing, not performance.","**

for example the 3060 ti and 6650 xt had $400 msrp's.",thus they perfectly hit the $399 segment line.,"similar the gtx 1650 has a $149 msrp so it hits that price line perfectly and intel has confirmed the a380 is $129-$139, hence why it is placed below the $150 price line.","further proof its just for pricing, is gn's review of the a380 with its early drivers it already competes with the rx 6400 up to a rx 6500 in a few games, yet this slide has the a380 quite a bit below the rx 6400. why?",because the a380 is a $129 card and the rx 6400 is a $160 one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
came here to post [the videocardz article](https://videocardz.com/newz/intel-arc-alchemist-desktop-sku-pricing-leaks-out-arc-a770-for-less-than-400-usd) but i guess this is better since wccf is the primary source.,"don't like wccftech at all, but they clearly have someone feeding them this info.","[this new chart](https://cdn.videocardz.com/1/2022/07/intel-arc-alchemist-desktop-pricing.jpg) is almost identical to [the first one that was posted](https://cdn.videocardz.com/1/2021/09/intel-arc-alchemist-dg2-xehpg-performance.jpg) almost a year ago, which leads me to believe it's real.","also, the a770 dropping from a 3070 competitor to a 3060 ti competitor is a little more believable.",it looks like they're aiming to undercut prices a bit.,i'm just worried they won't be as cheap as they should be.,they're extremely late with these gpus and will be substantially outperformed by nvidia's new generation in the coming months.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"that's kind of disappointing still, from a performance point.",maybe not from a performance per dollar point of view.,"on paper the full die has more rasterization, raw texture fill, and geometry processing and other raw compute than a 3070ti.",especially if it clocks to 2400mhz or higher.,"[it's actually close to an rtx 3080](https://youtu.be/kvegyrmimxk?t=1910), as it beats a 3070ti by like 10% in a lot of areas at 2200mhz already.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the full 32 xe core die being below a 6650xt better be including dx11 games dragging it down.,"if this is actually in the best case scenario, that's pretty bad from a scaling perspective.",the a770 has 4x the compute units of a a380.,"a 6650xt only has 2.66x the compute units as a 6400, and only 2x of a 6500xt.","so amd is able to achieve with roughly 2.5x the gpu, when intel needs 4x the gpu?","is this really just drivers, or something architecturally chocking this bigger chip to death?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

> intel's reaction to be treated that way may define their success.,they're going to have to accept far more of the performance responsibility in the early years until they have a customer base worth catering to.,"if they throw a tantrum, they'll be ignored by devs, and they'll get a rep from gamers as having inconsistent cards.","not to mention having to patch their drivers around games if the developers aren't interested in doing anything on their end, especially if the games are no longer being supported by developers (e.g.",total war 3 kingdom or civilization 6).,"reminds me of when microsoft was testing windows 95's compatibility with various software, there were some that worked fine in older oses but absolutely failed with w95 and the developer was not going to be patching the software (assuming they were still in business).",one example was the original simcity.,"it utilized some windows api in a non-standard way, but that was tolerated by older oses.","w95 did not like that, contributing to a major memory leak problem.",microsoft implemented a fix specifically for that game.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sound like a770 would go directly with rx 6700xt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's intel's best-case scenario using only a handful of dx12 games.,"the reality is, arc won't ship in volume in the diy market this year.","when it has its actual launch in early 2023, it'll be competing against $400 rx 7600 xts and $500 4070s.","intel have a passable product that, if heavily discounted, would've been worth buying had it come out on time.",the story of intel since 2017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
diminishing returns?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my thoughts exactly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the rx 6400 die is half that of the a380.,"it's a 54w card getting power only from the slot, and it comfortably beat the a380 with an 8 pin connector in almost every single game.","nobody should buy the rx 6400 because it's a gutted overpriced piece of silicon, but when it comes to gaming, it's still a better purchase than the a380,  which means the a380 is even a worse option than a rx 6400. also the gunnir model gamers nexus had was closer to $200 than to $100, so don't lie, it was pretty much in the same price bracket than aib rx 6400.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nvidia's wafer cost will double or triple on the new generation, i think people will be surprised by how expensive they are.","it's possible that competition will force nvidia to reduce their margins, but there's little reason to think they will do it proactively.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they'll undercut nvidia, not amd, you can randomly find a rx 6600xt for around $300-320, they will drop below $300 in the next month, a non xt rx 6600 is going for under $290 for about a month now already, and that too will drop to somewhere between $220-250 no so far in the future.",nvidia cards will drop too eventually.,so if you ask me the a770 and a750 should be around and below $300 to stand a chance.,"that's from a pure gaming perspective, which is what 90% of people care about right.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would hope they are basing their placement on total averages when also including dx11 performance.,it lists the a380 as being a tier lower than an rx 6400 when we know it can actually be faster than a 6500xt in certain dx12 titles.,f1 for example.,"i'd be curious to see an rx 6500xt vs a380 in cyberpunk, or other even newer dx12 titles.","i'd buy this gpu for future performance, not for playing 6 year old games at 200 fps.","but i would not be shocked if in certain titles the a770 actually matches a 3070ti, even if the average is at 3060ti levels.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this new chart is pricing segmentation, not performance segmentation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6600 = 130 tbp.,"it was performing a bit better than a 3060 in that intel video, so not a 6600 competitor, it seems.",wait for benchmarks tho.,it probably performs worse than the 6600 in dx11 or older games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s not just them.,"it seems like every other person i speak to on tech forums lately has drunk the kool-aid and has entirely forgotten that the 1650 super a) existed, b) is now four years old, and c) puts all of the new, terrible sub-$200 cards to shame.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

because the rx 6400 is missing encoders and decoders, and doesnt have ai accelerators (xmx for intel) or dedicated ray tracing units.",">also the gunnir model gamers nexus had was closer to $200 than to $100, so don't lie, it was pretty much in the same price bracket than aib rx 6400.

liquid metal doesn't really help when used between the ihs and cooler so that is expected.,it helps much more when there is high heat density.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which seller did you purchase this from?,"and was there a noticeable difference in temps, before and after installation of the bracket?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"never put liquid metal on your ihs between the cooler, it's a desaster waiting to happen.",+it doesn't do much.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

very easy to install.,just unscrew the 4 screws and remove existing bracket and replace using same screws.,equal amounts of pressure when tightening up.,don't over tighten there is a supplied torx head driver included with tp as well .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just undo the the 4 screws on existing retainer plate and reuse screws on frame.,very easy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2â° though considering the ambient temp currently whilst testing is at 30â°,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that means it is has a thin oxidized al2o3 layer (maybe a few microns in thickness) on the al.,"however, it will not stop the room-temperature liquid alloy (typically ga-in based alloys, expensive ones may contain zn and ag to enhance the thermal conductivity) from etching and corroding your al plate.","we have a lot of room-temperature liquid alloys in our lab, so i can tell you it can easily dissolve al.","thus, you really should not apply rt liquid alloys on any al plates.","if your metal plate is cu, it is more stable than al.","however, for the record, rt liquid alloys can still attack cu.","when t>200c, it can etch into cu at a speed of several tens of microns per month (you can find some papers on google scholar).","&#x200b;

is not confusion is follow their cpu naming convention.,"a is the generation, 7 is tier of the gpu like i7 cpu and the other 7 or 8 is the tier inside that bracket.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel has decades of brand history.,"*most people* aren't fully aware (or care) that intel igpu is why their laptop sucks at gaming, they just know ""hurr i didn't buy a gamingzzzz laptopszzzz""

the instant intel drops a billion dollars on marketing ""omg rgb gaming laptop!",""", stuffs store shelves with them, etc, it'll fly off shelves.",nvidia's dominance isn't because of skill or a superior product(they've often had the inferior products).,it's because they *vastly outspend* amd on *marketing*.,marketing is *the* lynchpin on which this industry turns and will be the only determinant between success or fail.,and intel can 100% outspend nvidia on marketing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

maybe they could ship dxvk with their drivers?,"seems like that could be a stopgap measure for a lot of their driver issues at the moment, seeing as their vulkan performance is better than dx11.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not just marketing, but volume sales and o.e.m connections as well.",intel can easily strong arm nvidia out of the mx450~gtx 1650 mobile market segment.,"since they're running with 6gb of gddr6 as well, they can also steal market share away from the 4gb rtx 3050(ti) laptops.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4070 will probably be a better choice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
handles all gpus very well.,up to the 3060 and 6600xt it behaves mostly the same with the i5 12400.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i3 12100 and 12400 work mostly the exact same with a 3060.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the i3 works perfectly fine with the 3060.

besides it probably means that he sacrificed the i5 for that better gpu.","and i3 works fine for now, if he wants to upgrade it should be to 13th gen. the cheap i3 is useful for when you need the cpu but it's not going to be your final product.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's literally the sweet spot rn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"it lacks over-current protection, which doesn't mean it's going to blow up tomorrow or something, but it's a standard safety feature on modern psus.","it's not ""don't turn the pc on"" bad but it's something i would consider replacing sooner rather than later.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seeing how seasonic is the leader in power supplies and has been around a long time and also has warranties for 10-12 years on their products i wouldnâ€™t worry.,looks like that particular psu has a 5 year warranty which is better than the suggested brands by others on here which only give 2-3 years.,donâ€™t even worry about what others say your psu and components are covered in a failure for 5 years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's fine for your 3060 but if you upgrade you should change the psu to a more modern design that has ocp and dc-dc.,the lack of protection against transient loads is a bit dangerous although again for a 3060 it is okay.,my seasonic focus 750 (branded as nzxt c750 gold) was only 69.99 in the uk.,so the essentially 15 year old seasonic s12iii is kinda illogical now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, as far as i know",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how is it going so far?,would love to hear about your experience.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
idk why i3 still gets so much hate for gaming...the 12100f is faster in single core than previous gen i5 and i7 (non-k models) while only boosting to 4.3ghz.,makes it very efficient for both power and thermals.,"for gaming it does really well, it's just limited by only having 4c/8t so for multi-threaded tasks it is not the best.","i think with raptor lake we will finally see i3's have p-cores *and* e-cores, like maybe 4p + 2e (6c/10t) or with 2 more e-cores for 8c/12t total.","it would still fall below the i5-13600k and beyond, while also being better value for entry level.","hopefully that's intel's plan, cause it would make them have zero competition on the low end since amd refuses to make a good ryzen 3 cpu since the 3300x.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"donâ€™t listen to that guy, the 12100f is the best budget chip you can get your hands on.",you wonâ€™t bottleneck lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that guy definitely didn't watch any actual reviews of the i3-12100, lol.",great cpu to pair with a 3060.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s perfect likeâ€¦itâ€™s an equivalent of a 9th/10th gen core i5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeahhhâ€¦maybeâ€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not really sweet spot, just adequate.",i5 12400 and 3060ti/6700xt is the sweet spot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i know that it works, but i think that 12400 is better for this build.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12 gen will be perfect then.,even 12100f is insanely good and all you would need.,it could probably pull off ultra settings too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have a 12600kf and 100% agree.,"why spend $500+ on the next gen when you can grab a great cpu for $250, can literally do whatever you need.",now once the prices come down after 13th gen drops then thats a different story.,but is the little performance increase worth an extra $300-$400 to you?,"that's subjective and in my personal opinion, hell no.","the 12000f is a great cpu as well, you're not gonna need to upgrade for a years down the road",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"need a quick suggestion:
i5 12400f+ rtx 3080 = will it be a bottleneck?",or should i wait for 13th gen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah... i've learned the hard way not to cheap out on a psu.,"it's the thing keeping all your other parts working, if it fails in the wrong way it could take other things with it.",it may seem like a good way to cut costs upfront but after a few years it starts to be a liability.,"i had a cheap psu fail in a home theater pc, and after that the ram would give me weird issues randomly, especially when booting.","i couldn't prove definitively the psu failure did it, but i do know it started around the same time, and the issue only went away after buying new ram.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> it's not ""don't turn the pc on"" bad but it's something i would consider replacing sooner rather than later.","i don't think anything you said was wrong, but i also personally tend to base all psu purchasing decisions on feedback from people who have actually owned and used said psus (like that on pcpartpicker) rather than academic speculation about features (which too often is just an utter nothingburger that results in people being discouraged from buying psus that basically no real person has ever actually had a problem with).",like the s12iii in my books isn't a bad unit until a high enough number of people who have actually used it in practice report it as being such.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's not a very popular or common psu as the price is bascially the same as much better units.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'ts been flawless... everything works fine :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's perfect, i don't see nothing wrong with an i5 10th gen performance on this combo with a 3060.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
more like it keeps up in gaming within less than 10% of a i9 9900k.,no bottleneck here unless itâ€™s trying to get 300fps at 1080p.,"even look at it vs 12900k  

https://youtu.be/dlba4mxojny",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12100 is perfectly adequate for a low budget gaming rig,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the difference is not noticeable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes but one thing where i live the pc parts are more than double the price that's why i wait so long and if i order online the customs is a bitch, that's why i'm going to wait until my sister who is living in austria and let her move the stuff, i'm from iceland btw",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have 12600k and 3080 ti.,it was personal thing.,amazing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i will say the main reason i am waiting for 13th gen is ddr5.,the first cpu to support a new ram generation is never as well optimized especially if it is backwards compatible with the last generation of ram also.,but i think it matters what your budget is and what you are replacing or if it's your first pc.,i personally have an 8700k and i have been wanting to replace it for a while now but i am holding out.,my 3090 isn't being bottlenecked too hard since i play mostly in 4k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just go for the 12600k or kf or wait for the 13600k supposed to be 12 cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have the i5-12400kf and can confirm it's a great cpu.,"besides, if you wait for next gen just imagine how expensive it'll be compared to 12400kf, so is 5%-8% difference worth $300 more to you?",imo no way,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there's a difference between **actually** cheaping out (like buying unrated diablotek nonsense or something) and buying legitimate budget psus.,every single person does **not** need an unnecessarily expensive quadruply-fully modular 10000+ unobtanium unit from [insert name brand.],"people parroting nonsense that effectively amounts to ""no usable psu costs less than ~85 usd"" on subs like /r/buildapc is a massively annoying problem.","on more than one occasion i've had the perfect budget build that was **not** going to fucking blow up, like zero chance, lined up in a post for someone on subs like that when bob the psu nazi showed up and and started pulling factoids he'd taken verbatim from some youtuber probably out of his ass and derailing the entire thread.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah i ran one with an r7 1700 and a gtx 1080 for a while and it was fine, so i don't think it's gigabyte exploding psu -level bad or anything, it's just not something i typically recommend.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

does i5 12400 support pcie gen 4 ssd?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the s12iii is an ancient group regulated design i believe and is known not to have ocp at all.,not great.,the seasonic s12 was amazing back in the day but it has not changed much in the past 15 years and now is thoroughly outclassed by pretty much anything and lack of any protection against transients could cause major problems.,my nzxt  c750 gold is a seasonic focus based psu and only cost â£69.99.,"much better in every way, fully modular and everything.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think it will, but i of course can't be sure until i see one or at least a good review of one.",i am only basing it on previous generational leaps in ram corresponding to generational leaps in cpus and due to so many other factors being involved it is not an exact science.,for me it's all about the years i can get out of the cpu without compromising too much.,my 8700k came out in oct 2017 and we are nearing the 5 year mark.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, gen 4 is a huge improvement but only suggest upgrading if you have the budget because gen 3 runs great as well",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

wonder if disabling e cores will make 5.4-5.5ghz on all p cores feasible under 260w.,"that'd be a gaming beast, especially with 36mb of l3.",also it seems they fixed the ring clock drop with active e cores?,on adl afaik it drops to 3.6ghz when e cores are enabled,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
actually really well.,"under 250watt, still can reach 5.2+4.1 all core.",with 16 efficiency core.,"12900k only can reach 5+3.7 under 250watt, and only 8 efficiency core.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the clock fluctuates wildly, according to readings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes they fixed the ring clock drop with e-cores in c0 state.,you can still turn them off but there's no way you'll make up for the loss in throughput of 16 cores and the 16mb of l2 attached to them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">on adl afaik it drops to 3.6ghz when e cores are enabled

200 mhz difference between cores isn't wild fluctuation?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12900k aida64 fpu power draw is about 220-260 watt.,and the stock clock speed is  4.9+3.7 .,"so when you run aida 64, the temp is under 100 degree, the clock speed will stable at 4.9 all pcore+3.7 all ecore,but the power draw will depend your fortune.","&#x200b;

13900k qs was different case,the stock clock speed actually is 5.5+4.3 ,

but they set a pl2 power draw limited= 253watt,in this limited, the clock speed will limited under 5.1-5.3  +4-4.3 .so  that differen core show different clock speed higher clock speed mean that core is good sp coreï¼œ lower clock speed mean that core is bad sp core.","so  from his graph, core 5 is  best, core 6 is worst.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"> i canâ€™t understand why such a huge company like intel canâ€™t make home run products out of the gate

apple got its arm license six months after the first iphone, **in 2008**.","https://appleinsider.com/articles/08/07/30/arm_reports_finger_apple_as_long_term_architecture_licensee

their first in-house silicon to go in a product was the a4 in 2010.

a14 was the *seventeenth* iteration they used in a product.",(the m1 uses the same cores.),"these were released in 2020.

the time from getting the architecture license to putting their cores into a desktop was **12 years**.","---

to stick with the arm example: nvidia tried it with tegra and failed.",intel tried it with xscale and failed.,samsung tried it with exynos and recently gave up.,this stuff is *really hard* and breaking into a competitive market is even harder.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nah, gamer's nexus has an a750 in hand but isn't allowed to benchmark it yet",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

most likely.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
absolutely.,watched the a380 review from gn already and i gotta say...i hope these other two are much better cards lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this gives them more time to update the drivers so the highest end card has a better chance on bench tests.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i guess that makes sense.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
apple undoubtedly could have done it much sooner had they really wanted to.,it's the benefit to being so vertically integrated.,you are your own huge customer.,end users are an afterthought here.,nvidia and intel have the problem of needing to find somebody else to sell to.,it's not really the same thing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"absolutely - we need independent benchmarks for the games.. 

but we have at least seen some evidence on the application side that it could be quite strong.","here's a review where a380 is hitting above it's weight:

it **is** an appropriate response.",experience in the field matters.,you can't just magically snap your fingers and overcome the years of r&d and money other established companies have put into researching how to do this very specific thing.,"samsung, the company that makes aircraft engines; did you know they are also in the auto industry?",have you heard or them or even seen one?,why aren't they homeruns?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">nda involved

it's not gifted then.","however, this is called an embargo date.","it's pretty weird to have a no-bench embargo though, it's more typical to allow reviewers to bench and have a release embargo.","i'm wondering when we'll get something other than first party benchmarks which are always, always cherry picked and hardly ever representative of true in-game performance.",i'm just asking because i really want a reviewer with a standardized setup to do it so we can compare.,bilibili videos are better than first party benchmarks but if the person posting the bench doesn't have competing hardware to directly compare against it's kinda moot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"doesnâ€™t the 6400 have no hardware encoders/decoders, so thatâ€™s basically software encoding/decoding?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no bench is probably intel scrambling to get more driver updates out.,they already let the a380 benches go out so it's not like they can hide the lackluster performance and bugginess anymore.,in linus's review he said they kept going back and forth with intel about the problems and ultimately just released the review anyway since fixes wouldn't be ready on time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i don't think a 3070 would pair well with a 12100. your i3 would bottleneck.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just look at the task manager to see all the programs that are running during the games.,it might not be the game that causes the 100% cpu usage.,"otherwise check that your power plan is set to ""performance"" or whatever it is on your system that allows the cpu to boost.",check also that your cpu boost clocks are on the level that they normally are.,those things being said: i also switched from 6600k around 2 years ago as it started to be running at 100% usage far too often.,the cpu is just getting outpaced these days.,12100 is the slowest of the new cpus.,it is still a huge improvement from what you have now.,i personally would try to get at least 12400 or 12600k.,the latter of those would last you a long time as a valid cpu.,hardware unboxed just did a test on 6-core and 8-core cpus on gaming while multitasking [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd9-otzzfxs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd9-otzzfxs) .,in their tests the 6-core cpu (equivalent to 12400) did just fine on that.,if you want to stream also: that really is best to be given to the gpu when it supports stream encoding.,1050 ti should support that so i guess you are ok on that front.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's called cep.,the cpu will clock stretch when the vcore drops below the vf table.,this happens if you do a flat negative offset or reduce ia ac loadline below stock since the vf table is supposed to the minimum vcore.,on msi boards it was enabled by default on launch day bios.,"asus/gigabyte had it off on ""auto"".",just run cb23 and look at the score.,it'll be obvious when there's a lot of cep kicking in.,"to avoid cep kicking in, either turn it off or undervolt only using the vf table with ia ac == ia dc loadline.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"> just going from 3600 mhz cl14 xmp to 3700 cl13 (11400, 6600 xt) all tight timings bring around 10%

that's an unfair comparison since you are putting xmp against a manual oc, which of course is going to be better.","on the i3 as you said you can still tighten the timings, the only limit is the maximum frequency you can reach.","a fair comparison would be like 3400 vs 4000, both with manually tightened timings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"sure, but in this case the limit is 200w, which is enough for anything except the 12700 and 12900. this kind of board doesn't make much sense if it's priced like a z690 board in the first place, cutting down the vrm slightly so that it's more suited to a 12400 makes perfect sense in my book as long as it's cheaper.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"you have primary timings (cas/cl, trp, trcd, tras, cr), secondary (trrd, trfc, trefi, tfaw, tcwl etc) and tertiary (trdrd, trdwr and lots of other).","secondary and tertiary timings are also called subtimings and these are timings that halt the most peformance, after finding the highest frequency, you want to lower them as much as possible (except trefi, which you want the highest possible).",what you can achieve vary between different ram dies.,and also with ddr5 you can mostly leave primaries alone and focus completely on subtimings.,i don't go into what each timing does simply lower (trefi higher) the better and subtimings simply hold peformance back the most.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then again i don't know if you really have no upgradeability to better cpu later is it really worth the 250$ / probably 260-270â‚¬ as i can get z690 board or high end b660 board for that or sometimes tad cheaper.,"yes ram is double the price, but still.","obviously if you plan on full system upgrade next time you do, maybe it makes more sense but then why you wouldn't go with ryzen platform which is cheaper.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

upgrading from a 12400 at 5 ghz to a 12900ks or something similar won't bring a noticeable improvement in anything game-related.,"if you are one of those few who suddenly find out that they have become video creators later, buying a new motherboard, cpu, and memory as a business expense isn't really a big deal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

performance is an easy guess.,the 8 xe core gpu's confirmed performance is ~1050ti.,"32 xe cores would be 4x that in compute, but it also gets a wider memory bus, so picks up a few more % fps.","on napkin math, that puts it somewhere around a 3060/3070, which is in line with leaks from last year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's really hard to go from having no high power gpu at all to having one.,all the other graphics chip manufacturers gave up fighting nvidia and amd decades ago.,just glad to see competition isn't just two companies anymore.,"miss the glory days when you had 3dfx, nvidia, ati (now amd), matrix, s3, etc.",all producing graphics cards.,after nvidia started the gpu era they really whittled down the field because most companies just couldn't put the resources in to build a competitive gpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'd be conservative and say more likely closer to a 3060 in performance than a 3070 but who knows tbh.,it was never realistic for intel to compete with nvidia's high or even upper mid range cards with their first generation.,important thing is that they got something out of the gate and probably learned a lot in the process to be more competitive going forward.,i probably won't buy an intel gpu for a long time (until they reliably compete with nvidia's high end at least) but i do want them to do well to further increase competition in the marketplace.,"a three way competition between nvidia, amd, and intel will be great for consumers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

intel can pull alot of power so seeing that many watts beeen used it not rare.,the oc file probably just dumps voltage to the cores.,also your ram is set wrong or aorus is reading it wrong.,how many sticks of ram are you using?,go under advance ddr oc+ and see what it says on memory frequency and xmp setup profile.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"donâ€™t use auto oc programs , they pump volts with little regard",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"probably irrelevant to the question, but you should probably consider enabling xmp since the ram speed is 2400mhz and that's pretty slow",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what cooler are you currently using?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"considering the 12700k is rated for 190w, yeah thatâ€™s a power hungry boi you got there",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't have any idea to how to make it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am using arctic freezer 34 esports duo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
try going to bios to enable it i think,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ok nice, thats a great cooler.",i also use it on my i5 12400 (bit overkill though).,has thermal paste been applied correctly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not enough to oc with,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as i know we made it to 6000 mhz from bios with my pc serviceman, since i have a ""kingston fury beast 32 gb (2x16) ddr5 6000 mhz cl40 kf560c40bbk2/32"" ram.",but i don't know anything about xmp.,so you say it doesn't work and it works at 2400mhz?,are you sure about this?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's a fine cooler for a stock 12700k but if he's overclocking he'll want a nh-d15 or drp4 minimum.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
certainly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i mean the gigabyte easytune app is reporting that your ram is 2400mhz, maybe the app might be wrong about it, consider checking ram speed in task manager",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you want an nvme disk for 4k video editing too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
f sku doesnâ€™t have igpu which would benefit you most.,you want intel quicksync,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

would that make a lot of difference instead of a normal ssd?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ðÿ‘,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
editing and saving from a hdd would be a painfully slow in your use case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s really not ideal.,7200rpm hard drives give maybe 100-120mb/sec sequential read speeds and have horrible access times.,"a normal sata ssd will give maybe 550mb/sec, with great access time.","a gen 3 nvme ssd will do maybe 3500mb/sec, and a gen 4 maybe 7000+mb/sec.","so while you can â€œtryâ€ to edit 4k footage on a hdd, itâ€™s going to chug a lot.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"to be fair though, gaming workload do take a lot less power than productivity for cpu.",intel alder lake maybe taking over 200w in video rendering but it only take a hundred or so when you game.,so i don't think it will be that big of a deal (despite making the joke above.),"at the end of the day, cpu only takes as much power as it needs to perform its function, and gaming is a much lighter function on cpu than gpu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> does anyone really want a chip like this?,i do.,does anyone else remember the entire decade where intel kept peddling lazy 95w quad cores with minor ipc improvements every year?,at the same time amd was a dumpster fire with fx and the a series apus.,i'm glad we have options now.,the i9 should be a bonkers enthusiast chip imo.,if you want something reasonable there's always the i5s and i7s or xeons if you need more cores.,amd is also doing really well in the efficiency category if you care about that sort of thing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

fuck yeah i do.,invested in a 1600w power supply in a full tower case with 140mm noctua fans years ago.,the massive energy leakage you see at small nodes and high frequencies has been around for decades.,cost per transitor in recent times is static so why not pump a double door fridge worth of power through the latest massive monolith gpu.,"seriously, if you want balance, buy a console.",that's in no way a criticism.,i have a ps5 and it's such a beautiful software / hardware combination that performs great.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"amd have always been pretty power efficient with zen, while energy prices are increasing i'd be happy with a cpu pulling around 200w as that's what i believe is fairly easy to cool on air, if it needs a 360mm aio or a custom loop that makes things a little tricky for me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

did you not see the prices for alder lake when they first dropped?,everyone was trying to get a piece of pie.,even amazon marked up the msrp for a profit at one point.,"they also sold out, but came back into stock, but sold out again due to backorders on a few sites.","i completely understand that these aren't gpus, but lets not act like adl didn't have it's fair share of problems with scalpers or companies marking them up when the supplies were clearly limited.","however, ddr5 ram was the worse if not as bad as the initial supply of gpus (30xx \\ 6xxx).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol sorry about that typo (edited now).,if the rumors are true rocket lake was just a precursor to what is coming from intel (and amd by the way).,it's going to make lower spec cpus shine even more (which i love by the way) and make people focus more performance to power usage\\watts again.,"all those cores won't matter when they either aren't being used (over paid = throwing away money), heats up the room (a\\c running so you don't burn up) and pulls wattage for things like gaming or video editing (electric bill).",so maybe amd and intel pushing all of these cores\\caches will make people start to re-think a few things.,it probably won't though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

congratulations.,"i didn't have a lot of issues with my adl\\z690 build or availability either, but i knew a few people who couldn't get a 12900k on day one or a z690 motherboard due to being sold out\\back ordered.",they had awhile.,unfortunate but it happens.,i was able to get my ddr5 before the price hikes as well.,overclocked my ddr5-4800mhz to 5600mhz.,i was able also to get my rtx 3080 at msrp around late december so it wasn't that was too bad considering it released in september.,so i lucked out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>nope i didn't see that.,"al prices were cheap, i think cheaper than even now but i guess it was close.",you could just walk in and grab one.,the motherboards were more expensive.,yeah......ummm......no.,alder lake msrp was $589  *(later changed to $589 - $600)* and you were not getting it at that price when they first dropped unless you were lucky.,i paid about $683 (including shipping - $649.99) when i ordered my adl cpu from an actual retail store.,amazon was sold out constantly and prices were way to high sold directly from amazon.,i saw them around $700 sold directly from amazon as well at times.,obviously prices eventually settled after the craze.,now to todays prices if you don't catch sales on two of the more popular sites that sell directly: amazon + newegg.,of course alder lake prices would be cheaper now since it's pushing it's 8th month in the market with various sales around the holidays and prime day etc.,without random sales\\promotional deals amazon price for alder lake is still higher than msrp being sold around $600+ after tax ($597.99 not including tax at regular price).,obviously there will be random sales.,intel did include some wiggle room to the pricing for retailers\\e-tailers.,newegg's pricing is $649.99 not including taxes (with taxes $680 - $710 depending on where you live) if you don't catch it on sale or near a holiday or prime day.,so with no promotions running you'll be paying well about msrp.,not everyone is lucky when a new product releases and it will be priced accordingly to supply & demand.,"intel can set their msrp all they want, but retailers, e-tailers, authorize resellers, private sellers and scalpers will do whatever they want once they get the product.",if it's a new cpu they will be priced accordingly and be rather difficult to obtain in some situations unless you want to pay the initial premium tax.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea i clicked signup for auto-notify from evga on launch day before they even announced a queue system.,"got a 3090 ftw3 email in 2 weeks, largely luck as there was no point in those useless notification emails until the queue.","it was a hair pulling day up at 5:30 am pst and a hair pulling few weeks tho, as i had just gotten a lg cx and was dying to put that 4k 120 hdmi 2.1 to work.",ddr5 was also i nightmare.,i bought some 4800 mhz but it was 8 gb sticks got some ok 6000 mhz c40 now.,iâ€™ll wait a while until 6400 c32 is cheaper,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the 3090s were far easier to get than the 3080s iirc.,evga queue was rather pointless.,"i think after a year, or close to a year they finally sent me a notification.",i actually can't remember when i signed up for the queue.,luckily i didn't waste time waiting on anyone and got msrp.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>it was like $220 for a 12600k and $320 for the 12700k at my local microcenter.,"they had dozens of the things, and were pretty much trying to give them away on release.",one of the most hyped up cpus intel has released in a long time with a new uarch on 10nm.,so you are trying to tell me that the prices were lower than msrp when the 12700k first dropped and microcenter basically wanted to give them away?,motherboards were hard to come by for a while and trust me no one was giving anything away.,pretty much all well-known retailers\\e-tailers were settled on the price being around $450 or higher for the 12700k early on.,you could've easily went around $500 with tax and shipping.,"i can only think of best buy being slightly cheaper, but stock availability and bots were an issue for best buy.","you also had some cases were people had some parts, but missing others (cpu, but no motherboard vice-versa)

microcenter isnâ€™t accessible to everyone and even on microcenter website without a promotional rate\\sale they are selling the 12700k above msrp as expected.",most of the best deals are usually available for pick-up only anyways so if you live near a microcenter congratulations.,the 12700k did eventually drop in price like all things after a certain amount of time.,"&#x200b;

>i don't even know what cpu you are referring to, alder lake is not a single product, it's a lineup.",i am obviously talking about the **i9-12900k** the flagship based on the price and my previous conversations above with other reddit users.,i never stated that adl was a single lineup.,.....and yes intel did better than most people expected with their pricing on with their 10nm release.,"i always believed that intel would attempt to undercut amd, but i spoke with a few people who thought intel would get greedy and try to increase the prices similar to their past.",good competition is always welcomed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

sounds a bit strange.,"my 11700f (albeit underclocked to 3.5-4.0) does 41-45 idle/ web browsing in a prebuilt with no airflow, and is cooled by something similar to the stock cooler, and it is in a room with ambient 28-30 degrees (35 outside).",in winter (probably 18-20 degrees?),it can sometimes go down to 34 degrees.,edit: looks like he had c-states turned off.,maybe that's why.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah people need to keep their expectations in line for these chips.,intel has said all along they would be marginal upgrades over 12th gen on the same architecture.,at best i'd say expect a zen 2 to zen 3 type jump and maybe not even that much.,edit: people have pointed out that the jump from zen 2 to 3 was actually fairly large which i guess is true.,i was more thinking about it from the aspect of both lines being on the same architecture and process node only more optimized and refined which is supposedly what 13th gen would be.,maybe a performance jump more in line of intel 9th to 10th or 10th to 11th gen would be more accurate when talking about potential gains that 13th gen will have.,mt performance should see a nice jump with higher e cores but i think jumps in st performance will be much smaller which has been rumored for awhile.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13th gen would be a great upgrade for a 12100f or 12400f for example but with any higher end chip i7 and above just wait a generation or two.,until ddr5 platforms matured,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how tf is 13th gen 3 months away,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
these performance figures are too high for the 13900k.,this is probably overclocked.,especially the cinebench r23 increase of 140.25 % is ridiculous.,that would be a score of around 40000. also the power consumption.,it will not go beyond 253w or something not 400w.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s still a sample.,the real deal will be a bit faster,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

is it me or has not much changed since 8700k?,i'm running 10th series i7 and i still see no reason to jump.,usually by 4gens after (14) i'm compelled but it's looking like i may be good until 15/16.,gaming not hamstrung at all yet on the 10700k.,4k@120 is gpu heavy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
people also need to understand they don't need the latest processor every damn year/gen.,"these chips are designed to last several generations, especially the flag ships.",my i9 9900k has yet to show it's age and its 3 gens old.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you're ignoring the multithreaded uplift of 40%+ which was always expected to be the bigger uplift due to doubling the e-cores.,"zen 2 to zen 3 only had 10-20% mt uplift, so it's a pretty poor comparison.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

400 watt is easy for a cpu.,the cpu has ample cooling solutions readily available to most consumers.,they can place the rad at the front or up top depending on the user's performance preferences.,"so if they require 400 watts and the most power, it is avaliable!",which is awesome!,i dont have that typ.,"use case so i'd be more aligned with an i5 or i7

not necessarily.,"raptor cove is a different architecture than alder lake, and considering we saw basically no ipc increase from the tests, they could have just increased the pipeline slightly to get a bump in clocks.",dude it reached pl4 of 400 watts.,the pl4 lasts for a couple of microseconds.,the article itself calls it pl4 as well.,"additionally, the reviewer said the cinebench results were bugged and fixed it, where in the comment section the correct results are pinned.",in cb r23 it's a near 40 percent improvement.,"and yes, a score of nearly 40,000 was expected.","using [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yblztujbisg&t=346s) review for p vs e core cinebench scores for alder lake, 8 p cores score 19471 points, so lets say 8 raptor lake cores score around 20,000.","8 e cores score 7727, so double that for 16 e-cores and we get around 15,000.","20,000+15,000 = 35,000. slight frequency bumps on p and e cores and you can easily get to near 40,000.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if it's a qualification sample (qs) then there's going to barely be any difference between this and a retail sample,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i donâ€™t want better performance, i want better thermals.",while you are right that same architecture gen upgrades increase power draws to improve performance that is not the only improvement.,they usually make the chips more efficient at low power consumption (and way less efficient at higher draws).,"think of the 1200 socket; while 11th gen was famous for raising power limits with little improvement from their previous gen, non-k cpus saw a decrease in sustained power draw while keeping the same performance (increase is within margin of error).","specifically, in the case of the 10700 vs 11700 with a decrease of up to 45% under sustained loads maintaining the same performance (+1%).",i would gladly drop 55 watts of power for same performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[https://www.asrock.com/news/index.asp?id=451](https://www.asrock.com/news/index.asp?id=451)

it's been pretty well known that the 600 series would support raptor lake especially since it's based on adl (tick)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11700 drew more power in basically everything versus 10700.. look at reviews.,for example in games performance stayed same as 10700 but power draw increased 20%.,11th gen was just so bad.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it was terrible as an upgrade if you have no power limits but if you undervolt chips then you would know what i mean by performance improvements by power consumption under load.,a pl1 90w 11700 performs just like a pl1 125w 10700. that is 35w less for the same performance.,"this is useful for builds where cooling is limited, like for my personal pc, an itx with a low profile cooler with a power rating of 95w.",itâ€™s quite literally the difference of a cpu hitting 100c or remaining under 80c for the same performance.,new gen cpus with the same socket tend to be good for power consumption/performance when undervolted.,this is the kind of stuff that you have to test for yourself since benchmarks will not show you performance at every point of a voltage or pl decrease.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
making 4 dimms work above abysmal speeds is a general pita.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"install the first kit, update bios, install second kit.",3600 should be doable on four modules if you have a good board,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hmmm... im gonna risk it from what i've been reading some peole have got it to at least post with 4 modules on latest bios revisions.,if it i get bsod or errors at 3600 mhz ill just lower the speeds to 3200 and tighten the timings a bit.,thanks for your input.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not normal.,spikes like that indicate a problem.,"check your thermal paste, aio fit and make sure you removed all of the plastic covers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my 12900kf goes from 33c to 100c when i run cinebench, running on a 240 radiator.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
90f+ indoors?,consistently?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ä° have 12900k as well with 360 mm aio at the stock options,it is instantly push to 100c as well,if you are not content creator,at the bios make long and short duration power limit 175 w and make p core 5.1 ghz and e core 4.0 and just play your cpu intensive game you would see that any loss of performance even so much lower temps",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i guess iâ€™ll buy the anti bending thing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, getting an a/c next week",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can play at that.,but i would never recommend such a system.,it's better to pay expensive and have no issues than to pay cheap and have to pay twice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what resolution/fps do you hope to run at?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all these peiple saying u cant run it are talking out their asses.,will it run fine as long as you play 1080p and drop srttings?,- yes.,should you maybe spend more on something better to have a more enjoyable time?,- absolutely.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a potato can run lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i run heroes of storm on similar setup pretty sure a potato can run lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7000 series mobile chip... i hope you're getting this at a deeeep discount because it's basically already becoming obsolete.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you donâ€™t need anything higher than qhd resolution, iâ€™ve played with 1080p and uhd screens and honestly, 1440p (2560x1440) has the best balance.","you can play it on low maybe textures at medium, you donâ€™t need any of the other crap especially shadows that kill off your frames.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this build can run lol just fine in max resolution of your monitor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in 1080p maybe 30 fps o 45,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3200x1800, maybe like medium settings, low if needed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah lol but my question was regarding the resolution.,iâ€™m not gonna get the razer one anymore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"itll have be low, maybe even shadows and stuff off, a 1050 ti will be enough and there like ~180",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"with this resolution, you need a separate gpu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was just trying to be one of those edgy ironic kids.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s a laptop.,"also, i found a youtube of that same cpu paired with the same igpu and it was running league at max settings 1080p like 130 frames.","so would i maybe be able to run max settings, 3200x1800 and put v sync on and lock it at 60fps?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://youtu.be/4hsoheoqbeq (14:13),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which one?,the igpu or cpu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have doubts that it ran at 170 fps on max,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i7-7500u and hd 620 graphics.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wdym which one?,the one in the photo with the specs list.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, that was the highest it reached, not the average.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the cpu is not good and you only have integrated graphics.,i doubt it will run smoothly at a good fps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
trust me.,it won't.,intergarted graphics run off of system ram and use your gpu clock speeds graphic cards use there own individual graphic processor and vram.,(intergarted graphics are graphics processed by cpu),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have the same thing just 1080p display 
dont buy this crap i can assure you its op as a workhorse but its crap af for gaming or even streaming 4k",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
trust me.,it won't.,intergarted graphics run off of system ram and use your gpu clock speeds graphic cards use there own individual graphic processor and vram,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"still though, those are frames that i've never seen intel hd run, let alone some gtx 900 series cards",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for $300 what are my options for a used laptop then.,could i maybe get one with a gtx 1650 or something?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i could still easily run it at 60 fps at that resolution, no?",i donâ€™t need to run it 130+ anyways.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
get a more modern laptop on sale.,check slickdeals.com or laptop deals subreddit.,$300 is a very cheap but you should be able to get an 11th gen i5 for around that price on sale.,for example https://www.walmart.com/ip/acer-swift-3-14-0-full-hd-11th-gen-intel-core-i5-1135g7-8gb-lpddr4x-512gb-nvme-ssd-silver-windows-10-sf314-511-51a3/534855652?,that would be more than enough to play lol at max settings.,you can get an 11th gen i3 for under $300 too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"man, if you plan to game 300 isn't enough",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think you should wait for 7000 gen ryzen apu.,"granted they will cost more than 300, but you'll have a way better cpu and igpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, i guess on lower maybe medium if you set it to 1080p, i was just pointing out that something is sketchy with that video",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i only want to play league of legends lol it can run on a toaster.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the website doesnt explain how it measures the power consumption.,whole system from the plug?,software?,"etc etc

without the proper details, there's nothing to talk about really",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel cpus have a short and long term power limit which can be adjusted for each product.,recommended for your cpu is 64w short term limit and 28w long term.,"so if you load up a stress test, it should allow about 64w for a while, then drop to 28w eventually (assuming your device kept the intel defaults).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"but is this possible for a laptop cpu to use 55+watt who is rated as tdp up 28 watt

i checked on my laptop ,this cpu can reach full power within 26 watt

even hwinfo64 says power level 2 is 51 watt whereas laptop comes with 45 watt charger ,
i tried many times,even constant stress for 4 hours,still not crossing ,infact it throttle itself 

may be their is some capacitor to provide such power for a very short amount of time",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sir tried many times ,many type of stress test,not even a single time it cross 26 watt ,even while at full capacity its still using 25.8 watt around",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"from where it take that much power,most laptop which has 1115g4 comes with 45 watt charger",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">from where it take that much power

battery and charger.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can laptop takes power from battery and charger at the same time ?,?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, absolutely.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
couple watts.,if you've set it to maintain high voltage/clock when idle then it'll consume a ton at idle though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my 12700k overclocked to 4900 mhz, draws 2-3 watts on idle, but increases to something around 8-9 watts in every 10 seconds.",when i am gaming its mostly between 30-65,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"30-50 w, 5.0/4.0/4.4 ghz,1.36 v override, all energy savings enabled, power plans minimum processor state set to 5%.",i believe it's even less when hwinfo is turned off.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's probably the ring minimum frequency.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have an asus board and set the voltage to 'manual'.,is that wrong?,i did the same with my old 9900k and had way lower idle power draw.,edit: instead of downvoting from whoever maybe getting a helpful answer would be better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you sure your values are right ?,"my 12700 non k idles at 5 to 7w, right now with firefox open with 12 tabs i'm at 11.3w power draw ..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what did you set as min clock for cache?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"surely a stability thing, but what's the minimum i should go for?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why would you set voltage to manual?,"if you want to increase/decrease voltage, use the offset setting.",so that voltage can be decreased during idle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
absolutely sure.,are you looking at package power in hwinfo or something else?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can you tell me your bios and windows power settings?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wdym minimal clock for cache, it's static x44, just like the rest of multipliers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't have that cpu so you will have to determine how stable the system is with lower minimum.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i set it to manual because friends did that and tutorials i watched did that.,i also had manual mode with my 9900k.,der8auer used the manual mode in his 9900k and 12th gen tutorial for example.,"after a quick google search

offset is basicly just base voltage +- the value i set with the ability of the cpu to lower the voltage during idle right?","some also talk about adaptive mode, but i fail to find a proper description of that.",is it simply that the cpu pulls what it thinks it needs + an additionalsetting of the maximum voltage i have to set in the bios?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes i'm looking at package power and using hwinfo.,i'm on win 11 btw.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh that's what you mean.,basicly what i set as min and max ring values?,what's a common gap for these values to try?,right now and with my old 9900k i simply set the same values for both.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>offset is basicly just base voltage +- the value i set with the ability of the cpu to lower the voltage during idle right?,"yes, voltage will always be x +/- offset.","x will be dynamically adjusted by the cpu, you can get the same voltage as you have now at full load, as long as you set the correct offset.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if so, then your scores are simply due to having 12700, whereas i've got 12700k overclocked.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
try a 500mhz delta to even see if there's still a high idle consumption.,i would probably do 100mhz steps from there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have 12900k overclocked and at  idle it doesn't get more than 15w.,"quick edit: just checked, barely 10w",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah i get that, but shouldn't the overclock only affect clocks and wattage at peak performance ?","at idle a 12700 and a 12700k should be, in theory, similar .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can you tell me your bios and windows power settings?,do you have a fix voltage value as override?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pretty much.,i'm just trying to tell the other guy that with theoretically more power hungry cpu and oc i'm still around the figures you are.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
adaptive voltage?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the rebar thing is probably also due to the drivers, amd and nvidia had to make their drivers work without it for years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
long ways still to go for intel here.,it loses to the rx 6400 pretty much across the board and consumers more power at that.,if it comes to the west at the 150$-ish price its gonna be doa.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
really interesting how much performance was optimized for resizable bar.,i wonder if this is a complete architectural design or if amd and nvidia could get similar uplift if they optimized for it more,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so,   52 vs 82 watts ( so 60% more power) for on average ~14% less performance than the 6400.            
oh, an they are both on same process node of tsmc n6 .",ouch...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"really, no encoding reviews?","av1, and hyper encode (igp+dgpu) are the standout features for arc, especially on these budget cards where you can spend $130 and get native av1 encoding.","i have zero interest in using arc for gaming, but will buy one immediately for if it delivers the encoding capabilities it claims to have.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
those re-sizable bar numbers are crazy.,38.5% improvement in hitman 3?,!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the perfect outcome for this gpu would be to **consistently** compete against amd's and nvidias offerings.,"considering that this is pretty much the very first gpu entry for intel it is an ok result, but it certainly needs a lot of work in their driver department.",considering that most low end gpus goes to older pc's the requirement for rebar support (at least with current drivers) is mostly doa for that market.,"another massive downside, the performance on older api's which is also very relevant for low end gpus so that is also massive dealbreaker.","if they manage in upcoming 6 months or so to polish those drivers to at least ease those issues it might be a viable product, currently thats a straight ""no"".",probably in next few generations we are going to see massive steps forward.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"all i have to say is the hardware encoder on these better be good, and they better be cheap.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a really hard time seeing these being anything but instantly doa in the pc builder community.,"mostly failing to overtake the 6400 in a similar price bracket is a really bad showing, even with poor drivers.",best case i can see for their higher end offerings is a 3070 equivalent a few months before lovelace and rdna3 launch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ho boy, gonna guess it's not worth the money b4 i watch the review, i'll report back",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is definitely one of the gpus of all time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a raja koduri special brought to you by intel.,who would have imaging an that this would be even worse than vega.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""gaming gpu""... fucking kek.",it loses to the glorified display adapter across the board.,i was gonna buy one but holy crap is that thing weak.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel fucked up badly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do remember that particular gpu has an 8 pin power connector even though it's capable of running using on board power according to intel.,"remember during the peak gpu shortage, when everyone is expecting intel, very unfamiliar on creating gpus, to release gtx 1080 like card for way cheaper?",yeah i remember that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"still waiting for the 3060 competitor, gonna sidegrade from a gtx 1660 super(now i can finally sell without ripping anyone off).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"honestly, for a first attempt, not terrible.","the 5 and 7 series is going to be crucial, though.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"people still don't think how import driver madurity is for gpus, intel gpus don't need to be powerful, they need to be stable and ditch crashes.",in this generation amd is as powerful as nvidia but people still prefer nvidia because  of the bad press previous amd gpu had because of crashes and other bad drivers issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wouldn't it be funny if intel started looking into optimizing their drivers for gaming, and because of that, a regular old hd/uhd became much faster, too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is *anything* doa in 2022?,"iâ€™m sincerely asking myself that, now that weâ€™re living in a world where people will defend the 6500 xt and 6400, cards so bad that theyâ€™ve taken us back to 2016 levels of performance/$.","at least with the 1630, a card so financially and morally indefensible that itâ€™s slaughtered by the two historic abominations directly above it, gpu buyers appear to have finally had enough.",amd at least had a flimsy excuse to release the 6500 xt and 6400. nvidia doesnâ€™t even have that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they're only making 4 million arc cards.,"when wendell from level1techs was on broken silicon, he said that intel was selling the cards to cloud services to run android games.",seems they had a plan all along if the cards didn't pan out.,let's see how battlemage goes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it looks to be the other way around, that for the a380 the performance without rebar is much worse than it should be.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i donâ€™t think it was â€œenhanced with rbarâ€ i think it was merely â€œnot crippled without itâ€,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
kinda doa if you ask me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm more interested how this translates into synopsis for  their a500 and a700 series - because i'd say it's rather worrying despite all these entry level cards this gen being utterly disgusting.,"rx 6500 xt = yikes, rx 6400 = yikes, gtx 1630 = yikes!!!",- so this being what it is doesn't surprise me at all.,"and that's even more so, because it's even a question if those get released before nvidia launches next gen - and obviously their performance levels are within ampere and rdna2 boundaries, not the upcoming gen. so yeah - rather not looking good.",and the thing is - third competitive player on the gpu market would only benefit the consumer - more competition = better prices and better products.,i've been buying gpu last year in all that price gouging and scalping shitshow and it wasn't fun at all - took me few weeks to fish acceptable deal for the circumstances and it was period where i wished intel's arc cards were already out to help with scarce supply.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they stated in the comments there will be a follow up video covering av1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
first person i've seen in these comments that gets it.,thank you.,i'm way more interested in the features that they didn't review here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's gamers nexus not pseudo creator nexus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"more than the improvement, the crazy part is how bad it performs without it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hopefully, battlemage is ready for tape, and they spend now till q2 next year working on drivers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's not that bad, but wont beat nvidia or amd yet",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not bad, it's the best gpu intel has ever delivered yet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
raja isn't the whole arc team.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's funny cause raja had his hits too.i dont believe is a coincidence that steve is often comparing to the rx 580(refreshed polaris),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ok, and?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol no.,"this is their entry level desktop gpu, the a380 is a $130 gpu.",the a780 is what is supposed to rival the 3070 ti.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i mean nvidia also has better video decode, rt support, and creator tools than amd.",the drivers may be at parity but nvidia gives you so much more.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are those similar enough to even benefit?,from what i've seen intel is offering separate driver packages now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
since gpu's are widely available at msrp or below it.,yes there can absolutely be a doa card at this current moment.,the 6400 is not a good product but why would someone pay the same money for what is an even worse product with the a380.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>he said that intel was selling the cards to cloud services to run android games.,is that selling arc gpus or arctic sound m?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
only way is if this thing isn't in the same price category.,"but like this would need a $99 msrp in order to be a ""good"" buy somehow.",i see this getting shoved into budget alienware and omen machines because intel will sell them at crazy low prices to system integrators.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whats that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'd omly care for av1 encoding if the card can run at low power while doing it.,i don't need a 75w card in an htpc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
av1 encoder is extremely important for gamers because once it gets adapted for streaming the quality of streams will skyrocket.,"in theory, you could do 1440p 120hz at the same bitrate people use for 1080p60 right now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they do enough content creation to know a few things.,"also, they did encoding stuff with dg1.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah drivers are the most important part for intel gpus right now, it is very hard to get rid of ""bad driver"" reputation so they need to make them actually usable and relatively consistent in performance across wide plethora of api's and programs.","if they manage to get even close to that the next gpu generation from them will be much more desirable, currently its at that point ""well we have to start somewhere"" but its a hard no for average consumer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i tend to think it \*is\* that bad.,it can't even beat the poorly priced budget (category) gpus from amd or nvidia.,and on pcs without rebar support it's just a video output.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah real talk, if they ever officially come to the us i might grab one as an encoding gpu alongside my 6900xt",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
right he has a bunch of people who contribute a lot by just designing the architecture the way raja wants it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"doesn't matter, he's at the head of the team and it's vision that's coming to fruition.",raja complained at amd about lack of resources.,now he's at intel and he's delivering a poor product where resources are not a constraint.,i don't know why intel even hired this guy.,they could have done a lot better than raja.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
people like to forget his work on apple's igpus too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
excuse me but which hits are you referring to?,a freshed polaris was not a hit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's easy to find flaws with it, it'd be nice if it had av1 hardware decoding for instance, but for those looking for a power efficient card that can handle casual 1080p gaming at less than ultra settings i think it's awesome.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>the 6400 is not a good product but why would someone pay the same money for what is an even worse product with the a380.,weren't you people arguing that amds gpus were good because of finewineâ©.,as in it took a while for amd to fix performance issues with their cards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"look, if i wake up one day and the a380 becomes the improvement upon the four-year-old gtx 1650 super weâ€™ve all been waiting for iâ€™ll be very happy, but intel actually needs to *do* that work first, and amdâ€™s cards usually at least *started* in a competitive position.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

arc in cloud doesnt make sense,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the a380 does have *some* redeeming qualities compared to the 6400 / 6500 xt.,the a380 has an actual media encoder (not to mention av1 support) as well as a x8 pcie bus compared to amd's x4.,i am curious to see the performance comparison between gen 3 systems and gen 4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"can you link to that review, i have not seen a review testing between pcie 3 and 4 with the a380.","given that the 6400 has only 4gb of vram and a x4 bus, it makes sense that it will lose more performance than an a380 with 6gb of vram and a x8 bus.",would love to see the data if you can point me in the right direction.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> i dont see how the x4 or x8 is significant, as even with x8 it is still slower..

but is it still slower if we compare these gpus on pcie 3.0?","i'd guess majority of people who buy these lowest end gaming gpus are still rocking older systems without pcie 4.0 capability (pcie 3.0 x4 is only equivalent of pcie 1.0 x16 in terms of bandwidth, so it could be a bottleneck).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"no

you donâ€™t consider more like forget that and get a 12600k or 12700f",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™ve seen i7 12700k and r7 5800x for $300-330.,"11900k would need to be $200 for me to consider picking it up, given how much of a meme it is.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you basically have a 10600k but with toothpaste between the die and ihs.,should still be good for a while.,have you overclocked it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have the 10700 is pretty fast paried with a 3080 it scores 12300 cpu in timespy when oc, but if you buy new get a 12600k/f or just wait the 13400/13600k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"considering that for 300 right now you can get a 12600kf and a b660 mobo, or a z690 for $30 more i wouldnâ€™t bother with lga 1200, jump to lga 1700 and enjoy those sweet sweet e cores which are entirely underrated",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the ecores are actually pretty garbage imo.,the only time they do anything good is when iâ€™m encoding a video.,"for a regular gamer or office user, theyâ€™re just wasted die space.",better to turn them off and reclaim some of that cache for the big cores if youâ€™re just gaming.,(12600k is still a good cpu though.),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"what you have open isnâ€™t anything impressive, thatâ€™s a workload that an 8700k could handle(while gaming, even).","the best use iâ€™ve found for the ecores is using process lasso to make handbrake run on the ecores while i game on the big cores, but thatâ€™s something you can do much better with a 5900x or 5950x.",iâ€™m just happy intel didnâ€™t use the ecores to increase prices.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah

i would say get 12700 (or 13700 if you can wait few months)

it would need new mobo and this would cost $400-600, but its worth every single dollar over the 10700/11900k and you would *really* love it if speed matters",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah they help a lot for that, they just donâ€™t do pretty much anything for gaming.","iâ€™d say if you want to go more gaming focused go for a 12700k, if you want to go more production focused go for a 5950x(although itâ€™s more expensive).","12900k is also an option, but itâ€™s very hot, power hungry, not much faster than the 12700k in gaming, and slightly slower than the 5950x in production.","you could also consider waiting a couple months for the new cpus from intel and amd to come out, but i donâ€™t think youâ€™ll be too disappointed if you buy something right now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

can confirm.,i've been using a 9700k @ 5.0 for almost 3 years and it's been perfect at 1440p.,only time it goes 100% is stress testing.,i'm running dual monitors and have twitch or tube on the 2nd while gaming.,maybe it helps that it's on a 360mm aio paired with a 6900xt.,definitely hitting it's limits but never throttling or maxed out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

your screenshot shows your cpu was running at 800mhz average...     i've only seen that if your cpu is aggressively thermal throttling due to a bad cpu cooler mount or failed cpu cooler.,what cpu temps do you get when your cpu is at full 100% load?,also what cooler are you using on your cpu?,lastly you haven't messed with the power settings in windows have you??,i know on intel cpus there are ways to force it to stay on the lowest supported clockspeed all the time if you really wanted to.,"might be a good idea to restore the power plan to defaults or go back to the ""balanaced"" power plan if your using a custom power plan or something like that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

couple things.,1) you mentioned you are in high performance mode for power settings.,"can you please go into ""change plan settings"", then ""change advanced power settings"", and look for the submenu that says ""processor power management"".",what is the minimum and maximum processor state set to?,"it should be 5% minimum, and 100% maximum, if they are not, change these settings and retest.","2) if the above is set accurately, do you know what motherboard your prebuilt is using?","is it from a classic oem like dell, hp, acer, etc?","or is it from a build-for-you website like nzxt's building service or pcpower, etc?","if you can get me this information, i can help troubleshoot further on whether or not something is set incorrectly in bios not allowing your cpu to turbo/increase clocks.","this doesn't sound like a thermal throttling scenario to me, as even with the crappy stock cooler from intel, it should easily be able to handle well over 800mhz.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™ve been scrolling a while and i havenâ€™t seen it discussed yet but what brand, capacity and rating is your psu (power supply)?","for example, the one in my pc is an evga supernova p2 850w platinum+ where:


- **brand:** evga
- **model:** supernova p2
- **capacity:** 850w
- **rating:** platinum+


while i do agree with everyone saying youâ€™re likely thermal throttling, it is very odd to see your base clock so much higher than your boost clock (not only that, itâ€™s very odd to see a boost clock speed of 0.8mhz.)","to me, if not thermal throttling, that signifies 1 of 2 things (or a combination of both):


- 1.)","either your psu is choking because your system is trying to draw more power than your psu can handle so your pc simply chokes all components in response â€”orâ€”
- 2.)",whoever prebuilt the pc thought they were applying a good custom oc but were playing with turbo voltages for the first time.,"regardless, before removing your cooler and reapplying thermal paste (like the other guy said, rarely ever the issue) hereâ€™s my suggestions in order:


- 1.)",reset your bios to default settings.,save & reboot.,- 2.),update your bios to the latest version.,iâ€™ll provide links for the asus support center later.,"basically, download the most recent bios file, put it on a usb drive, unzip it, reboot into bios, go to update bios section, choose your usb drive, hit go and walk away.",- 3.),"once the bios has been updated, boot into windows again to make sure everything is running.","disable fast startup â€” open cmd as an administrator, type `powercfg -h off` and press enter.","youâ€™ll know it worked if thereâ€™s no message, it just goes to the next line.","thereâ€™s all sorts of documentation on this but, long story short, fast startup is enabled by default and causes your pc to go into hibernation when you press start -> shutdown instead of *oh, i donâ€™t know, actually shutting down your pc???",* so that can cause all kinds of weird issues (including windows updates not installing.),- 4.),reboot once by using start -> restart.,"once windows comes back up, login and shutdown using start -> shutdown.",- 5.),boot into the bios and enable the xmp ii profile for your ram.,save & exit.,- 6.),test again using geekbench or whatever you prefer.,"if youâ€™re still scoring terribly, reboot into bios, disable asus multicore enhancement (asus mce.)","if youâ€™re given the option to choose â€œenforce intel default limits,â€ then choose that.","save, reboot and try again.",- 7.),"if youâ€™re still getting horrible performance then either the psu is trash, you really are thermal throttling that badly, or you got a really shitty prebuilt & need to return immediately (in fact, you shouldnâ€™t have to be doing any of this with a prebuilt pc â€” thatâ€™s the whole entire point of buying a prebuilt, they test this stuff for you and deliver a functional pc.)","**edit:** just return it and grab you a prebuilt from https://www.nzxt.com

there's a reason why intel doesn't include stock coolers with beefy chips like 9700k.,a beefy tower cooler with two fans will do the trick.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there's no way the stock cooler is that bad, something more catastrophic is wrong.","210 single core is 1/5 of the speed of a 5th gen i7, op has a 9th gen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"hey, nothing wrong with a prebuilt if it works for you :)   
   
and yea, you would want new thermal compound.",edit: you should definitely reach out to the company that made the pc and let them know the issues you are having,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thermal compound is almost never answer to your problems.,95% that's not it.,"if it is, then that means they're is no thermal compound at all.",even a garbage level application won't cause these horribly results.,pre-builds come with garbage coolers that can't even cool 100w cpus.,yours probably pulls 180-240w.,cheap motherboards also don't allow the cpu to run at full power load for more than a few seconds.,"pre-builds often come with these kinds of boards that limit 200w cpus to under 100w after a few seconds, which greatly reduces long term tests.",edit: oh it's a z390 board.,so it's probably a 9700k cpu i'd guess.,or 8700k.3-4 years old.,"might pull 140w max, but i would not be shocked if the motherboard settings and cooler are still limiting you.",the cooler might have come completely off the cpu.,my brother had some plastic brackets break and experienced similar results.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's no sin, it was actually cheaper to build a prebuild in the last year.",good thing you checked your performance.,contact the company you bought the pc from and let them fix it.,the problem is probably a thermal issue but if you touch it yourself you might loose warranty.,"as long as you can, let them fix it (for free).",that's what you paid extra for.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"with the piece of crap one, i'd expect your results to be in the bottom 30%.","people who buy k-series processors generally pair them with strong coolers and overclock, whereas it seems you've paired yours with a crappy cooler and are being thermal-throttled.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you may have to manually set xmp in your bios to take advantage of that high speed ram.,"if you havent, the ram runs at stock 2400 and this may also impact your performance",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and i'd imagine the ram is actually not running at 3200 at all because pre-builds don't have the xmp profile enabled in bios.,maybe it's running at 2400 i'd guess.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
replace with something faster.,"if you can find a good deal on more, then you might as well.","prime day is now, so iâ€™d start looking now anyway",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in the mean time until you can replace your cpu cooler, you could probably set a 65w power limit in the bios for your cpu to at least try to keep it from completely throttling soo badly.",still though a 9700kf with a 65w power limit would be severely limited i doubt it would even be able to run at the 3.6ghz base clock.,those intel coolers depending on what cpu they come bundled with are really only rated to 45w or 65w.,with that 9700f if you truly set it to 4095w maximum power limit allowed in the bios.,it's likely your power draw and temps are instantly hitting \~100c and staying at 100c and it's throttling you all the way down to 800mhz.,i know my 9900k will hit \~60-80w loads with even moderate usage like running games.,if i throw something heavy like cinebench or video encoding it will easily hit 180-200w power draw.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah, i agree.",nothing wrong with pre-builts.,"it depends on the specific pre-built... generally, if you want a pre-built that's serviceable and can last longer, don't get a pre-built from hp, dell/alienware, lenovo, any oem company.","i'd be more likely to recommend brands like nzxt bld, powerspec (microcenter), build redux, main gear, skytech, etc.",these are called si (system integrators).,"they just get off-the-shelf components that regular people can get, versus the proprietary junk from hp, dell/alienware, lenovo, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> hey, nothing wrong with a prebuilt if it works for you :) 

agreed.","i build my own now, but i'm one of those people that learns by mistakes.",and mistakes when building a pc can add up *real* fast.,"i'm glad i have the knowledge now, but god damn the sound of hearing your motherboard crack as you try to put on the cpu cooler, realizing the motherboard is completely unsupported because you forgot to put all the standoff screws in, and the following feeling of knowing you can't afford to replace that motherboard for another month, well, that's not a good feeling.","nor is hearing a 'pop' and then smelling smoke when you go to fire it up for the first time...

i was coming at this from the perspective of an out of the box experience from a customer.,this driver was the whql driver that windows update installed for me on this machine.,asus also did not show any updates in their update suite.,generally notebooks and 2 in 1s are very particular about running the drivers provided by the manufacturers.,for instance the 2022 g14 will not work correctly with the power profiles for armory crate if you use the updated driver off of amd's webpage.,"so in this case i saw windows update installed a new intel driver after loading windows and running updates for the first time,  and i did open intel graphics center and it never prompted that an update was available; and again asus's software also did not show any new driver updates.",i will however test the latest driver and will post back if i show any differences in behavior.,"edit... just giving the update, i upgraded the driver to 1743 and the windows mixed reality static texture  glitches and issues persist; not playable.",not only that but the intel driver assistant actually recommended that i use the asus oem driver from the manufacturer!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

intel spec is way below what you actually can do, intel only guarantees 5600/3200, anything above that is overclocking and not guaranteed, but people are pushing over ddr5-7000 or ddr4-4400 even on alder lake which officially only supports ddr5-4800 and ddr4-3200 max

yes the 12900k has more computing power than the 2700k .. is this a serios question or a joke?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is entirely true but there may be more rgb on the next iteration of that board so your would be missing some bling performance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s fine to grab a z690 now and itâ€™ll function just fine on 13th gen but theyâ€™ll release a z790 and then z690 price drops so if youâ€™re going to wait for next gen why not wait and save money,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

because 1440 p is not optimal for competitive fps.,"heck, my 27 inch 1080p is too big.",i need a 360 hz 24 inch 1080 p lmao.,i stream and want the highest fps.,the 3080 ti is one of the few that can do that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"fuck, i didn't even consider that...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all though i do agree with most of what you are saying.,they definitely are keeping the best cpus for the ks from the start now.,my first ks runs 5.6 all core under 1.45v and can top out at 6.1ghz single.,i had several 12900k with a max sp score of 89 yet none of them could run over 5.3 all core and not above 5.5 single.,basically what iâ€™m saying is.. ks showâ€™s potential of 13900k  as far s clocks go.,i bet the best raptors will run 6ghz+ the upgrade in cache and better memory controller are also going to be worth it.,at this time.. buy the 12600k if you need something to get by.,sell it for not much loss and adopt a raptor in a few months.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i know man but i have enough on lagging and frame drop on my last i5 8600k and gtx 1050ti pc and i want some last new pc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i guess youve locked it at your refresh rate?,have you ever unlocked your framerate to see how many frames you get.,i would imagine it would around 300 right?,maybe look at benchmarks for 3080ti at 1440p for the games you play and see how many frames theyre getting.,if its around 180 or 200 imo it would probably be worth it to shift to 1440p because even with a 3070 im considering a shift to 1440p and your gpu is streets ahead of mine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, good luck, then.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i understand alot of the people here suck at fps and play games like elden ring at 4k / 60 fps for looks.,but the highest frames possible / low quality is vital for fps.,u can see people way easier on all low settings and the game is as smooth as possible with high frames/low latency.,1440 p may look pretty but its not worth it when i play on all low and want the highest frames possible and stream.,i have done the research.,i just want the best competitive settings not visual aesthetic settings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you might want to look up what asusâ€™ multi core enhancement does on z490.,"on z690 it just removes power limits, but there were a lot of other cautions about it raising voltages and what not on other platforms, before it was determined that was not actually the case on alder lake.","otherwise, there should be a section where you can specifically change the power limits / pl2 duration to whatever you want.","specifically, when it is â€œdisabledâ€ asus sets it to 4095 watts limit.","and no, any decent motherboard should allow you remove / adjust power limits, although some low end boards with poor vrms may have hard limits to prevent physical damage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what do you need the unlocked power for?,the 10900k typically can do this with no power unlocked.,"1. idle state - 30c to 38c (cpu takes advantage of the ""cold"" state to boost freq for short duration \~56 seconds)
2. cpu senses big load (max 250 watt is required - all core load - freq will now max)
3. cpu will now run at 4.9ghz all core

* it can run 4.9ghz for an unlimited time at this setting if temperatures remain under 70c regardless of power draw except not to exceed 250 watts.","* if temps cross above 70c, the 250 watt max runtime will last for 56 seconds after which the cpu will run just at 125 watts max
* cpu freq may now go lower than 4.9ghz in order to maintain 125 watts.","if you need maximum power, yes mce will unlock that.",the cpu will no longer run at 125 watt capped or have a time limit.,instead it will run at 4.9ghz full tilt and with power draw depending on your motherboard+psu capability.,only thing stopping you is the temperature ceiling.,mce does not raise the temperature ceiling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you're in a situation where unfortunately the answer is now 'both'.,"as you are already aware that some of those games are heavily cpu bottlenecked, while others could use a better gpu.","so the answer of which to upgrade first becomes a question of what games you want to maximize performance on first, and which you're willing to deal settle for the current experience until you can upgrade the other component later.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no.,you need an 1155 board.,z68 or z77.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got that same cpu at launch and it was the heart of my first gaming pc.,cpu still works great to this day and still overclocks to 4.8ghz flawlessly.,still have the same motherboard too.,"only thing that died was the gpu, radeon 7970. still have it even tho its dead just cause it was my first gpu ever.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"okay, why are you upgrading in small increments?","if you can afford a 1660, you can probably afford an entirely new system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm a bit confused.,do you already have that motherboard?,what's your current cpu?,"in any case, 3770k is almost 10 years old, it's not worth it unless you get it as a package for very very cheap.",from what i can tell it goes for around $100 on ebay which is absolutely retarded.,just get an i3 from last 3 gens.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

okay.. so why are you upgrading your motherboard... if you had a 3770k in your system you probably had a good board too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because windows 11 is awesome,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah that is a great price since they normally run around $270 to $320 when it isn't on sale.,$193 open box is roughly $70 off the current sales floating around (about $260 on sale).,that would be worth the gamble to buy and stress test it out to make sure everything is fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"overheating 'can' damage the cpu, but your cpu is rated up to 100c before throttling.",i believe you'll be fine in the long run.,just check your performance numbers over the next few months.,definitely continue to monitor your temps and use a good thermal paste.,no worries.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"itâ€™s fine, cpuâ€™s are decently thermally protected nowadays",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"most of the gaming laptop always runs above 90 degrees,dont worry ,cpu has overheat protection ,when it reaches its tjmax temperature then it will trottle itself to protect itself",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
running very hot in general can shorten the lifespan of the cpu but intel's products should be able to last around 10 years in normal use within normal temperature range.,it is very rare that the cpu fails.,if the cpu actually overheats it will first slow down and eventually just shutdown your machine before any damage occurs.,i wouldn't be worried about that unless you are constantly hitting the 100c thermal limit.,with 12100f that would indicate your cooling is broken.,i once had accidentally pulled the power cable of my cooler pump.,the machine was fine for around 5 minutes when there was still cool water in the cooling block and then it suddenly shut down with just a very brief temperature warning.,the block was almost boiling hot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cpus will shut down before damage occurs (which is at a temperature higher than the 100 degree throttling threshold).,"so no, nothing to worry about.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my 2011 macbook air ran at 100c pegged.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i dont think you have damaged it.,most cpu's have an inbuilt thermal trigger which throttles or shuts down the cpu if it is nearing dangerous levels of temperature.,its not like you used it like that for a few months.,the 12th gen processors have decent thermals.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, all cpus nowdays thermal throttle, a long time ago amd chips didnt thermal throttle, that could result in them catching on fire.",you will be fine though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

basically if you want high performance cpu that's snappy and can handle everyday workloads and even hardcore games anything more than an unlocked i5 is simply overkill, this goes for 12700k users as well as 12900k like myself, i will never use 24 cores for more than unrealistic benchmarks as i never see more than 35% usage even on the hardest games they just pull it from the gpu.. so literally everything i throw at my i9 i never use but 1/3 of its power.. i used a 12600k for 3 weeks while i waited to get another 12900k bc i sold mine and it only took me that long to upgrade to the i9 because i was using an apex and the 12600k i truly noticed no difference until i looked at numbers, you'd never think a new i5 could be that strong but they have come a long way last 3 generations.. save some money and steer away from the i7/i9.",some good ram you'll be in better shape..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

can someone explain the powerdrag to me?,i've seen cpus with the same tdp but with double the cores or more yet still deliver better performance.,this one for example would give 5.83`w to each core but an i5 8400 would give 10.83`w to each core.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>so what ipc will spr have vs genoa?,"per core, they will have similar ipc, though spr may be ahead",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"don't expect intel to compete in server at least until 2025

spr does have better ipc than genoa, but the core count difference is too high (late 2022)

emr is just a slightly improved spr, facing against genoa and genoa x, and could end up facing turin later in it's life cycle (late 2023)

granite rapids should be a huge improvement, but competing against a hypothetical 192 core turin?","(16 core chiplets potentially, maybe even more cores if they increase the number of chiplets).","maybe it can be competitive, but it might also have to compete against turin-x as well....",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
concentrating on core count might not be very relevant when evaluating the product line.,only a small part of the customers want to buy the 96core chips.,epyc is everything from 8 core up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
double the clock speed requires 4 times the power loosely speaking.,so going from an 2.5ghz core to a 5ghz core will take 4 times the power.,which is one of the reasons very few of these skus are frequency optimised.,better to go wide and slow rather than narrow and fast.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
power consumption drastically goes up as you increase clock speed.,"also remember tdp is generally rated at base, which for most of these parts is around 1.8-2.6ghz",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i don't, but they are taking a different approach compared to amd.","genoa is up to 2p, whereas spr is 8p.","a 288 core count advantage is significant in theory, but it will be very expensive and extremely power hungry.","they probably understand they cannot directly compete in 1 chip vs 1 chip for now, so they are trying to make it a 4vs1 situation.",it actually might work if it's priced right and the scalability is reasonable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
genoa is zen4.,"and, even if it has better ipc, its going up against genoa-x.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the list price of epyc 7763, xeon 8380 was roughly same, but that may not be the case with 96 core genoa, 192 core turin

ultimately, arm cpus are the final boss for amd.",ampere is already at 128 cores without using some form of chiplets.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
way more usually since voltage increases are needed as well.,doubling frequency almost doubles power and doubling voltage quadruples the need.,"of course, you won't need to double the voltage since realistically scaling isn't linear but you are still talking about 6x or more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if power consumption is a limitation, then how is a 8 socket system gonna work?","assuming the rumors about 350w tdp are true, then you would need \~2.7kw of power.","that's without the boost clocks engaged, which will drive the consumption even further upwards.","on the other hand, if you limited the power of 4 sockets to the equal of 1 socket, wouldn't the performance be pitiful?",each chip would receive less than 100w if the socket can only supply 350w.,"if the latter is true, why bother supporting so many chips at once then if they are gonna be almost on par with 1 chip?",seems like a huge investment for nothing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i see, that makes sense.",thanks!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just did that bios update i was planning on.,it literally fixed all my problems.,"so to others with this board having any issues at all, i suggest updating the bios to the most recent version asap.",my cpu-z scores are now within like 1% of typical online results and my power draw is 64w during the test instead of 45w.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am guessing you need to remove intel power limits in the bios.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are power limited simple.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i tried changing a few of them.,"no difference (very slightly worse, actually, but within margin of error) anything in particular i need to change, and do you know what it would be labeled as on a gigabyte board?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don't waste your money on any of that stuff.,even just buying a recent intel cpu with integrated graphics will get you significantly better performance.,if you want a pc for games do it right.,i'd say bare minimum save up $500-$600 for parts and go from there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gt 740 would bottleneck a core 2 duo cpu :v,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 3rd gen i3 are pretty bad by today's standards, but the gt740 is... terrible to say the least.","the biggest bottleneck here will probably be the gpu, by far.","seriously, try to find something better if you can, you are throwing money at the trash bin by buying this card.",even a 750ti or a gtx 1050 are eons ahead in performance.,"valorant will probably be playable with the i3, though it will stutter a bit.","maybe you can find a gtx660 or something similar in the second hand market, it was a relatively common card back then and it is quite better than a gt740 at least.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"okay, why do you want all this stuff anyway?",itâ€™s ultra-budget hardware from ten years ago.,"youâ€™d be far better off making a cheap 5600g build for, like, $400-500.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what do you already own out of these?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that cpu would bottleneck my life.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it will be a bottleneck for sure.,first you tell me where do you live?,"if at least a gt 750ti is available in your location, better consider buying that.","one of my friends still uses 750ti and had played few modern kombat games, few injustice games and still does editing in it, as he's a youtuber.",but he's not having any problem with that.,recently we had a nice talk over phone and he told me everything.,"also, gt 750ti was very popular and good for gaming for a huge period of time.","i know you aren't going to play latest games but the point of telling about the injustice and modern kombat are, if these can run easily then the old games you play are going to run even more better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
both are bottleneck :-),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ya that's something i can't really do since my motherboard only support 3rd gen and below and i don't really have enough time or income to save up since my classes will start soon after a month which is why i rushed with i3 3rd gen and gt 740 and rn i just wanna know if they bottleneck,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ik the gtx 750 ti,1050 and 660 are better but they aren't available in my country and i'm not really trynna play the latest aaa titles, only old games like elder scrolls or gta 4 and 5 and some valorant with my friends and i don't have enough of a budget nor time so ya...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which is why i'm just asking if my cpu would bottleneck it or not,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ik it's ultra budget from 10 years ago but i'm not really looking to play latest aaa titles, only a few old games i used to play with poor fps and valorant with my friends",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
an i3 3rd gen with gt 610,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can play gta 4 with that combo.,"not sure about gta 5, but since it was originally built for ps3 era hardware i guess it is possible, though you will probably struggle to reach 60fps.","if you don't mind you can lock the framerate to 30fps, it should run consistently without any major hiccups.",i have seen worse combos attempting to run gta.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whatâ€™s your budget?,you can do better than this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so what's your budget then?,can you able to at least afford something like a used rx 550?,"the gt 740 is kind of meh, i mean i guess it's useable, but it won't play many current games very well at all.",the i3 may bottleneck something like a 550 though at times.,"the 740 should be noticeable better than the 710, but if you can you should save up if possible.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
100 dollars,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my motherboard doesn't support that sadly plus it's not available in my country,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh, damn.",got a console?,pc gaming is extremely hard to get into on a budget that small unless youâ€™re an insane secondhand shopper.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just wanna know if my cpu will bottleneck it or not,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
exactly my point lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i don't believe so, but it'll be coming close.",should be ok as long as you close background programs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you basically have to go the tech yes city route and start trading people for their old dusty parts then.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i was scared that i would somehow fuck my motherboard or the cpu itself, but the installation was quite easy.",just cross pattern 90âº at a time until you feel a bit of resistance and you're done,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have bought and received mine 10 days ago but didnt bother with it since i saw the results are not worth it, even though i had to dismantle everything since i deep cleaned my pc and installed additional ram, and new ssd.","i even reapplied thermal paste and iâ€™d say for those who have the arctic aio you donâ€™t need it, i removed it and the contact was even and there was no hour glass like pattern on the ihs",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thank you very much.,i am trying to upgrade the ram and nvme asap,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ram first.,you need dual channel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok. what about dual channel 32gb (2x16) 3200mhz?,i searched up a bit and my laptop support is max 32gb 3200mhz and it is having 2 dimms,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"getting 32gb of ram on such a low powered machine is kinda useless, i'd say get 16gb(2x8) 3200mhz, this will definitely increase ur performance",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think 16gb is the right way to go, and with integrated graphics, get faster ram if you can (although make sure your laptopâ€™s bios will allow you to run the xmp profile).","32gb is excessive unless you know you need it (sql server often loves ram, so if you know you will have lots of stuff sitting in ram, then it can be worth it,  but you would know if you could use it).",the primary take away is that dual channel memory is absolutely worth it when using integrated graphics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

is there some reason you feel that single threads/processes canâ€™t or shouldnâ€™t be doing that?,"if youâ€™ve got one thread that needs 100% of a core, then thatâ€™s what you get, itâ€™s not like it can be split up onto other cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"two of the cores on your processor are allowed to boost higher than the other six, this is called turbo boost max 3.0. windows knows which cores are allowed to boost extra, and will place single-threaded workloads on those cores first before engaging other cores.","in your case, it's core #3 and #7",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel turbo boost 3.0 does this.,it's normal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can turn off tb 3.0 in bios.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"windows is designed to favor the ""best"" (highest efficiency) p cores for foreground tasks, so that is normal.",run some low priority tasks in the background or with no gui screen attached if you want the e cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for answering.,"i'm just thinking that since i don't really do anything at that time, or any heavy load, e-cores should be working more for background stuff maybe, rather than just one or two p-cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have.,"p-cores still used, but it might also be some other turbo or overclocking bios setting",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it might be background, but that doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s not better served being assigned to a p-core - especially since, at the time, youâ€™re not needing it for something else.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
p cores are way faster for single thread and it has higher clocks as well.,"so for the best user experience it's the p cores that have to ramp up, not the e cores, otherwise the computer would feel slower than the predecessors.",only way to achieve what you are expecting(and erroneously i might add) is to disable the p cores.,"e cores are for adding multi-threaded performance and experience in an efficient way, not to reduce power.","well, in that sense it does as 8 e cores only use 50 of the total 250w.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes and no.,there are b660 motherboards with vrms capable of driving even a 12900k.,but they are not plentiful.,"most have trouble doing above a 12400.

and, for reference, the tdp of a 12700k is up to 190 watts, not 125 (thatâ€™s just the long limit, which no one with a 12700k would actually enforce).","if youâ€™re buying a good b660 motherboard, you would be better served with the 12700, which is also a great cpu and nearly as good as the 12700k using stock settings.","and yes, you can also simply disable that silly 65w power limit on the 12700 with b660 boards and run it without power limits (officially rated at up to 180 watts).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"12700k and b660 is actually a wise idea, u get higher turbo boost than non k counter part and u also don't hustle much about overclocking itching which is practically useless.","bt a good b660 board is needed, msi pro b660m-a / mortar / gigabyte aorus pro/ are best valued board",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes but no overclocking except blockoc on some mobos like mine rog strix b660-f gaming wifi.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm running a 12700kf on an msi b660m mortar wifi.,the board is plenty for the cpu.,it's a much better board compared to any z690 i could find in the <$200 market.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12700 still has an issue with locked vccsa voltages right?,for that alone i'd probably pay the premium for the k if using ddr4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when you talk about valued board where is asus ?,gigabyte is shit man,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hi.. im thinking of pairing a b660f with a 13700k.. what did you mean in your comment about blockoc on this mobo.. what is that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with k u also get higher turbo boost clocks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
forget about it since you are buying 13700k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, by exactly 100mhz, which is 2%.",not exactly significant.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so go with a z690 jnstead?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"gigabyte boards have q-flash plus, which allows you to update the bios without the cpu, and thus allowing you to put the 13th gen intel on their b660 mobos",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah if using the same ram speed they're functionally identical for gaming and most productivity tasks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"bt for same price its better option, currently 12700k is cheap nd similar to 12700",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think that depends where in the world you are.,"in canada, seems the 12700k is $50 more.",but i see newegg us itâ€™s only $8 more and that makes it the better choice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think the missing ""retail"" in the title really changes the tone of the message.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel could not plow their face into the ground harder.,"they are going to release these cards straight into a recession, with disappointingly-bad performance numbers, into a market flooded with old mining gpus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they have a crap card, late and sold only in china and they still brag about.",these guys must really be stupid,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pretty bad gpu that is about to be released at the worst time possible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there are no recessions for data centers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"eh, my quick glance seems to indicate that the 3600 would still beat it multicore, and slaughter it single core.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 3600 likely beats the xeon in everything from multicore and even gaming.,you should have gone with the 3600 hands down.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
power must be cheap where you live.,"but $60 bucks for a whole system i'd call it a win, it's just that i won't go out of my way to build a system older than haswell-ep/broadwell-ep in 2022.


as you found out, unless you need the pcie lanes/memory bandwidth, you're probably better off with newer desktop platforms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

did you reset cmos?,or at minimum apply default settings in bios?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what are the error codes?,they may be important.,"and as the other poster suggests, when changing cpus and thereâ€™s any oddness, you should definitely do a full cmos reset.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the bios recognized that i changed hardware in the pc and gave me the option to apply default settings by pressing f2

"well, just to relate a personal experience, i recently swapped a 5930k for a 6950x in an older x99 system.","first power on the system booted, text came up and gave me the same cpu changed / reset settings message that you sawâ€¦ i pressed f2, it rebooted and, after that, nada.","no screen, no error codes, it just kept turning itself off 15 seconds after turning it on.","had to do a manual cmos reset to even get back into the bios again, and after that it was fine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a lot of those are typically memory related hardware errors.,"i would make sure your modules are in the correct slots, remove and reseat them, disable xmp in bios, and as a last resort try them one at a time.","might also be related to the cpu swap, like if voltages are incorrectâ€¦ or thereâ€™s a contact problem (like bent pins in the cpu socket, dirt on the cpu contact pads, etc.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cleaning cmos didn't work.,"the same happens, maybe there are some new different errors.","tried to clean the cpu and it seems good from the outside, my motherboard pins are all ok, my ram works with my older processor (corsair ddr4 3200mhz, xmp off), tried swapping between rams with the new one too but stills failing, i'm getting random errors in the bsod too, i've seen like 6 different ones",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"when i change the processor my motherboard realizes and gives me the option to apply settings to default, is that any different than doing a cmos reset?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"well, youâ€™re not going to see 5.0* on the 12700 as the maximum single core boost is 4.9ghz.",all core maximum boost is 4.5ghz.,"assuming you buy a motherboard that can properly supply it with power, and remove the ridiculously low 65w long term power limit, and have a decent enough cooling solutionâ€¦ then so long as the workload demands it, you should see 4.5ghz indefinitely.","â€œbase clockâ€ is an absolutely meaningless number, especially once you remove power limits.",ignore it.,"personally, i feel the 12700 is a great cpu and a hidden gem powerhouse for non-overclockers - you just need to get rid of the arbitrary power limits.",(*ignoring bclk overclocking.),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i own a 12700f along with an asus prime z690-a ddr5 mobo, so far i can confirm that you'll see 4.9ghz only on a single core, 2.1ghz is uncommon, probably on idle you would see that.","be aware that the maximum core speed for all cores (if your mobo doesn't support bclk oc) is 4.7ghz and you don't need a very expensive aio to keep it cool, i got a deepcool assassin iii and my i7 is peaking around 65/70 celcius after a 4 hr stress test.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

use a 280mm aio a b660 msi mortar nd u will b good to go with 12700f,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for replying!,what would i have to do in order to change the limit?,i'm thinking of getting a noctua dh-15 along with 5 120mm case fans so cooling shouldn't be an issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"true, got mine last week along with a z690 (got it cheaper than b660) pl was set to unlimited by default in bios  and i was surprised to see how cool it was running while maintaining constant 4.5ghz during long session of gaming.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™ll go further: i think the 12700 is the single best alder lake cpu.,"thanks to intelâ€™s moronic market segmentation, the overall cost to get one of these is almost the same as it is for a 12600k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sry older post, i bought the 12100f as a placeholder and am planning to get 12700f.",on a b660 msi a pro should work i assume?,with maybe put 125w tdp limit or just remove it totally?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have not seen my 12700f go higher than 4526mhz on all core.,how are you getting 4.7?,any setting i need to change?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what's your cooling solution?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've never seen any of my cores go above 4.5ghz.,it will sit at 4.5 when gaming or benching between 40-70c on a 280mm aio.,are my tasks just pushing anything hard enough to force a single core higher towards the 4.9?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"speaking of alienware, have they turned around a bit recently?",i've heard good things about that new monitor of theirs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a few things:
- the nh-d15 was the best high-end air cooler, like, three years ago.","now, the ak620, thermalright frost spirit 140, and fuma 2 all perform the same for *far* less money.","- the msi pro b660m-a ddr4 is easily the best value alder lake board out right now, and can handle damn near any cpu you put on it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s just a bios setting.,"most motherboards will allow you to customize the pl1/pl2 values to anything you want, or simply remove it (ie asus â€œmulti core enhancementâ€, which just sets a 4095 watt limit which is as good as saying no limit).","some very underpowered motherboards may not have that ability, or may limit you to 125 watts or so.",but for the 12700 you do not want a bottom of the line h610 or b660 board.,better b660 as a minimum.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
using a dh-15 myself on 12700f with pl set to unlimited.,running at 72c max during cinebench and around 60 during long gaming sessions.,using a artic mx4 paste btw.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you should be okay to remove the limits with that board.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you have to add some numbers on the bclk, around 102-106 would work, test on your bios settings, any number higher that that would make all cores to be set to a default 4.0 or 4.2ghz

"their monitors have always been fine, but their pre-builts are and always have been unusable shit, to the point that i honestly fantasize about running them out of business.","for all appleâ€™s sins, at least theyâ€™re usually competent on the design front.","alienware just wraps the same shitty dell chassis theyâ€™ve been using for ages in some plastic, makes sure absolutely everything thermal throttles, uses pathetically slow ram, and slaps it with a markup that would be absurd even in the world of pre-builts before sending it out the door.",the result is a rig thatâ€™s often inferior to systems two-thirds its price.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i wonder who even buys alienware prebuilts?,"like i'm sure there's the uninformed millionaires buying them for their children, but who else?",there can't be *that* many people with thousands to drop on a product they don't understand the slightest thing about.,i mean watching a single video or reading single review will dissuade anyone who cares.,"their cases have always been more airtight than submarines, and they've been pulling shit like 120mm aios for the most power hungry chips on the market since they were founded.",maybe they're subsidized by dell?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my area 51 r2 from 2015 with a gtx 980 & 4790k is the best pc i've ever owned.,i've never had problems keeping it cool even under heavy workloads.,granted they no longer sell the area 51 case but this pc has been absolutely amazing for gaming and still holds its own today.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is; msi is doing a good job with their boards.,"the only catch with the b660 tomahawk is it doesnâ€™t support pcie 5.0, in case thatâ€™s important.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thereâ€™s a considerable market of middle-class parents whose kids game who get sucked into this by dellâ€™s despicable marketing, iâ€™d figure.","(and yes, alienware is a dell brand, which is why itâ€™s dogshit.)","basically, unfortunately the answer is â€œway, way more than we thinkâ€, because the average consumer is uninformed and/or misinformed enough that vibes beat any actual rational consideration of the productâ€™s features, and dell knows this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"pcie 4.0 is still more than enough for me, lol.",they're cranking out new pcie versions 24/7 nowadays when 3.0 lasted for ages and ages.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"heh, i know!",iâ€™ve got a 5th gen x99 system from 2015 with pcie 3.0â€¦.,and then that stayed the same until 4.0 with 11th gen??,wtf?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"6.0's already been released, even though nothing supports it.",and apparently 7.0 is releasing in 2025. why tf would any consumer need 242gb/s in 2025?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you canâ€™t even buy 5.0 products yetâ€¦ beyond motherboards and cpus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's just unbelievable how quickly standards are changing these days.,"before anyone even starts using 5.0, 6.0 is already officially released.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think i would go with the 12700k.,but only you can decide if it is worth the extra few bucks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would go 12th gen. even a 12600k would be better than any 10th or 11th gen processor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i only speak for high-fps gaming (>120fsp), 10900k has been widely beaten by 12600k already, let alone 12700k...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
people that already have a 10900k shouldn't upgrade to a 12700k for gaming purposes as it's a sidegrade mostly.,people who have neither should buy the 12700k instead because it's essentially better and on a newer platform with more features.,the 10900k with a maximally tuned high performance ram kit and a cpu overclock can definitely match or beat a stock 12700k (even if it has a fast ram kit) in most games.,"however, if you get an equally ideal setup for the 12700k the 12700k will win in more games.",if you're going to run either one with the same ddr4 3200mhz or 3600mhz xmp profile ram kit the 12700k is going to win.,"there just isn't enough performance to be gained for 10900k owners to justify upgrading, but there is also no reason to buy a 10900k if you aren't already on a 10th gen system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"considering i have a highly tuned 10900kf, id say get the 12700k.",no point buying into an ageing platform.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so you got a 10 core for gaming instead of a 10600 to future proof.,even got it on a locked mb extremly limiting its performance.,"and now, not even 2 years later, you want to buy another high core cpu for gaming.",amazing.,ot : buy a 13400/13600 and a new video card.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
idk man.,i might just go with the 10900k.,"ive spent 3k on the alderlake stuff (3 different mobos, 3 different ddr5 kits) and the platform as a whole is incredibly rushed and unstable af.",they have definitely not gotten ddr5 in a good spot right now in terms of reliability.,id just go 10900k until they update the platform entirely.,"i have owned both platforms the 10900k and the 12700kf, so i know what im talking about.","if you want something that just works, go 10900k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the cores on the 12700k are much more powerful than those on the 10900k, which can potentially mean better gaming performance.",but since you are going to have a gpu bottleneck most of the times there won't likely be a huge difference.,"i still think the 12700k is worth those 100 more, since it's on a newer platform and it's more future proof, but honestly the best choice would be the 12700f,  very close to the 12700k but at a lower price.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 12700k is much faster in games,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, yes it is worth the extra money.","you get an actual modern platform, and the 12700k is considerably more efficient, along with being about 25% faster in multicore.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"10900k is on a dead platform, is it not?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
absolutely.,generally i hate userbenchmark but when comparing intel to intel it emphasizes the performance different [10900k vs 12700k](https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/compare/intel-core-i9-10900k-vs-intel-core-i7-12700k/4071vs4119).,the 12700k is around 12% faster when gaming but lets be honest gaming probably isn't everything you will be doing so that 30% increased single core performance will definitely be noticeable.,"i went from a 10900kf to a 12900k and the performance difference blew me away, in fact i'll probably sell it for a 13900k when they come out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that depends if you have an rtx 3080 or better and playing at 1080p or not.,"if the answer is no to one of those, you'll only see like a 5% improvement.","if both check out, you can see like a 20% improvement a lot of the time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i went from 7700k > 12700f and saw a +20 fps gain to my minimum fps, while max fps stayed pretty much the same due to old gpu (gtx 1080).",i would suggest get a 12700 (non k) with a cheap but decent b660 motherboard and use the money saved for a gpu upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"gaming, work everything 12700 is better than 10900. also if u buy 12700 it's good for the future upgrade too cuz u can get intel 13th gen. idk if 14th gen is supported for it tho",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

> people that already have a 10900k shouldn't upgrade to a 12700k for gaming purposes as it's a sidegrade mostly.,that sounds like something hardware unboxed would claim.,"12th gen is massively faster than 10th gen for games, as [10th gen depends on fast memory to achieve high gaming performance far more than ryzen 3000, 5000, or intel 11th, and 12th gen does](https://youtu.be/e0hidyl7mjk).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just wasn't into pcs or pc gaming at the time i got my cpu so i didn't know, and the plan was not to future proof.",since i have some extra cash right now i planned to upgrade and stick with the new cpu for awhile.,that is all.,i apologize if my ignorance has offended you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"alright, cool.",appreciate it!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gpu bottleneck most of the time?,"does that apply in a general sense, or does it just take a really high end gpu to not bottleneck more modern cpus?",i would also like to learn about/get into overclocking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the question is, if he ever wants to upgrade.","and even if this is so, the question is if it will make sens to get a new cpu of the next or same gen. especially on a cpu like the 12700k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">12700f

do you disable the e-cores?heard  its better to turn them off as you get better and more stable fps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
e-cores off?heard games have higher fps and more stable frametime with e-cores off.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you also could go with the non-k cpus (12700/10900) which means you can't overclock, and then you also could get a b660 for the 12700 or an b560 for the 10900. then it would be even cheaper.",but the 12700 has more for it than just the performance.,it also has newer pcie versions.,"but still, only you can decide if it is worth or not.","edit: how high the difference is, is also depending on the games you want to play.",so look at the games you want and then decide,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i made this upgrade and donâ€™t regret it one bit.,massive jump in single core performance which means higher fps in a bunch of games i play.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you actually running into a situation where the 10900k is bottlenecking in a game with what you already have?,it's hard to imagine that even a 10900k at stock settings isn't adequately performing for gaming right now.,"there are a few situations where switching from the 10900k to a ryzen 5800x3d system makes sense (cache bound games like eft or other memory intensive games) but not really any where the 12700k is just so much better that you have to have it, even comparing stock settings to stock settings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"unless you have samsung b-die memory, are looking at a good z490/z590 board with good memory tuning options (basically asus or msi), very strong cooling, and knowledge of how to overclock memory, don't.","10th gen sees mediocre gains from core overclocking, the big potential lies in memory overclocking, but it does require spending the cash.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
literally said in my post that if you had an equally ideal ram setup the 12700k would win.,the 10900k relies on having perfect conditions for memory latency and bandwidth to beat the 12700k.,if you already have that setup it is not worth going to a 12700k for gaming.,if you have a 10900k with slow single rank memory then it could potentially yield a noticeable performance boost to switch to the 12700k if you also had a sufficiently fast gpu at a lower resolution.,whether or not this would revolutionize your gaming experience or not largely depends on other factors like what games you play and your monitorâ€™s refresh rate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the performance boost is good from 10900k to the 12700k, its just a headace right now.",just really strange bugs.,i cannot even describe to you what is happening.,sometimes your going to just get blue screens.,its gonna happen with xmp on.,all mobo manufacturers are also having issues with the platform.,"im on the unify x now and its a bit more stable, but its exactly the same issues early ryzen had with xmp.",exactly the same.,nobody seems to have figured out the platform yet...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"games are gpu heavy loads, so you will max out your gpu most of the times, which isn't a bad thing, that's in fact what you should try to achieve.","if you have a cpu bottleneck instead, that's not very good, since the gpu is capable of rendering more frames than what the cpu can handle, and you are wasting gpu power.","if you want to learn overclocking find some guide or video that explains the basics, then look for something specific for your hardware since every generation of cpus and gpus overclocks in a slightly different way.",r/overclocking is also an useful resource.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
unless he goes with a z690 an upgrade may not be available.,"if you look at the b460 it only supported the 10th gen and not the 11th, so it is quite likely the b660 won't support a 13th.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's on certain games.,"i play pubg,, lost ark and some other fps games like cod but never had an issue with e cores.",probably by this time most of the games should have been updated with intel 12th gen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've tried both mate.,"with the e-cores turned off you tend to have better and more stable performance than with the e-cores enabled, unfortunately though, the games that produce these results are few and far between.",a lot of users were experiencing lags and stutters when playing star citizen when using e-cores for example.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"makes sense, i did not think about the differences in framerates between titles.",thanks a lot!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's a night and day difference if you use anything needing cpu power,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's not that the 10900k is underperforming in fact i am mostly happy with its performance.,"it's just that i'd like to overclock since i am not making full use of my cpu, and i'm trying to find more demanding titles to play, since the games i'm playing right now are mostly frame based",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also the  fuckery with games switching to e-cores too which is why ppl are reporting games run better with them off.,i honestly wish they didn't introduce these new e-cores or atleast release high end cpus without them.really conflicted if i really want an intel cpu for a gaming rig because i will probably end up disabling the e-cores if i ever get one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, this makes it even more useless to think about if a platform is dead or not.",and thanks for the information.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looking to upgrade to a new cpu and i might just straight up disable e-cores then.seems to be the better option for gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and if you go for the 12700 non-k version.,try to buy the asus b660-f gaming wifi mobo.,it has the ability to bclk overclock your cpu.,"for example i have this mobo and a i3 12100 overclocked to 5.2ghz, making it  a gaming beast for only 100$.",only downside is that it is ddr5 but i see it as a good thing since it futureproofs the system quite alot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depending on what you're doing overclocking would lead to a pretty small increase in performance.,unless you're playing at 1080p on a 240hz monitor and have an rtx 3080 or above gpu you probably wouldn't achieve an appreciable increase in performance from overclocking a 10900k.,if your gpu can already hit 99% usage in the games you're playing at the graphics quality settings you're using you won't get a single extra frame from overclocking the cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just saw today that asus z690 received support for 13th gen no word on b660.,https://wccftech.com/asus-z690-motherboards-receive-official-bios-support-for-intel-13th-gen-raptor-lake-cpus/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's what i've done at the moment mate, yeah.",i can definitely advise it.,"at the moment, i've turned off e-cores, left it at stock (4.9ghz), i could push to to 5.0/5.1 maybe even 5.2 all core but to be honest, the gains aren't worth the effort for the most part.","but yeah, i've disabled all ecores, applied a -0.050mv offset, set a 250w pl1/pl2 and overclocked my ddr5 5600 -> 6000mhz and left it there to be honest.",all stable and had no issues thus far so can't complain.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh, i did not hear about this.",a few months back when i got my cpu it was just suggested by a friend for me to get a z490 so i could overclock.,just took his word for it since he was the pc guy.,i plan to eventually upgrade my 3060 ti to a 3080 or a 40 series card but by then i will likely be getting a cpu upgrade as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i get that gaming at a lower resolution would produce a more noticeable difference when overclocking, but why must i have a 3080+ and a 240hz monitor for the difference to be noticeable?",is it gpu bottleneck when overclocking?,so in my situation it would not be worth overclocking?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it will, i believe asrock is one of the few that already released a bios update on all of 12th gen chipsets",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to simplify greatly, your cpu prepares frames for the gpu to render.","if the gpu is able to hit 99% usage (or close to it), it means the gpu can't draw the frames faster than the cpu can prepare the next one for it to draw.","in this circumstance, overclocking or upgrading your cpu will not give you any extra fps.","the opposite circumstance, where your gpu usage is less than \~95% indicates a cpu bottleneck.","this circumstance can occur because your cpu isn't fast enough, or because your ram configuration is not fast enough and the cpu spends a lot of time waiting for information when it could be working.","this is why in some games, fast ram makes a big difference in framerate (warzone, battlefield, etc).","there are some games where the fastest supported ram is still not good enough for satisfactory performance, even with the best cpus.",the prime example that comes to mind is escape from tarkov.,"this game is very memory limited, and even a 12900k with the fastest ddr5 kit barely gives good performance for people that have a high refresh rate monitor.","in games like this, you need a cpu with a large amount of cache on the cpu.",the only consumer cpu like that which is suitable for gaming right now is the ryzen 7 5800x3d.,"with that cpu, games like eft run far better and the speed of your ram makes almost no difference in performance.","the more cache a cpu has on it, the less it has to rely on information stored in ram, so the less down time it has waiting on information.","you can always create a cpu bottleneck by changing settings, regardless of what cpu and gpu combo you have.","if you play at 720p lowest settings you probably will not see 99% gpu usage, because it is very easy for modern gpus to draw frames with such low detail.",eliminating cpu bottlenecking entirely is not possible.,what you want to avoid is having a cpu bottleneck paired with unacceptably low framerate.,"if your performance is already good in the games you play, don't worry about getting every last bit of cpu performance.",i don't think there's any circumstance where i would suggest that somebody who has a 3060 ti and 10900k should upgrade their motherboard to be able to overclock.,i also would never recommend an upgrade to the 12700k from the 10900k regardless of anything else.,the only upgrade that makes sense is the 5800x3d from amd which requires an entire platform change and that would only be a good upgrade if the only things you play are games like eft or similar games which are highly limited by memory speed.,"unless you have a genuine need for more performance in something you play at a high level competitively right now or your performance in your main game is unacceptably bad i suggest you save your money and prepare to upgrade for 14th gen.  don't go to 12th gen, don't buy 13th gen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if your cpu can already push your gpu to its full 99% usage in the games you play at the settings you play, making the cpu perform faster won't make the game run any better because the gpu has nothing left to give.",a stronger gpu requires more cpu performance to reach this point because the gpu can produce more frames per second.,"if the gpu can draw more frames per second, the cpu has to be capable of preparing more frames per second.","if your gpu is at 99% usage and you overclock the cpu from 4.9ghz all core to 5.2ghz all core, your gpu was already at 99% usage so you got nothing from overclocking your cpu except extra heat and power consumption.",the extra power was not required to drive the gpu to its full potential.,"with a lower performance gpu like a 3060 ti, you don't need as much cpu performance to get everything out of it.","with anything less than a 3080, the 10900k can already give you the max performance out of your gpu in most situations.","there are a few games here and there where you might get a few extra frames out of a better cpu or an overclocked 10900k but those are games where the cpu optimization is so poor in general that you still couldn't fully eliminate the cpu bottleneck even with a 12900k, let alone simple overclocking.","if a game only has 60% gpu usage and you overclock your 10900k as high as it goes (which is probably only 5.1ghz, maybe 5.2ghz, which isn't that much better than the 4.9ghz it already runs at) you might get to 65% usage.",if you upgrade to a 12700k you might get to 70% usage.,you're still not going to get close to 99%.,in terms of framerate maybe you went from 100 to 106 by overclocking.,"are those 6 extra frames worth the money and effort, plus heat and power consumption?",probably not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is all speculation.,"i wont call this a ""news"".",next big event is earnings call.,"we will get some perspective on near time about immediate plans and then we have another intel on event in september where i expect intel to ""announce"" the release of rpl.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
these assertions from digitimes and others are a bit weird.,the fact is everyone has been delaying.,"tsmc 3nm should have been shipping already, itâ€™s not.",that said we wonâ€™t know what their true volume or capability is on that node.,the same goes for intelâ€™s nodes.,intel delaying raptor lake can be simply due to the market slowing down (there are a ton of signs there).,"meteor lake being delayed could be a result of the same reason *or* they need to improve yields on 4nm..  or both..

they speculate a lot.,the same digitimes told 2 opposite versions of this story within 2 days.,they are not reliable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the loihi 2 neuromorphic chip was introduced last year on intel 4 node.,intel 4 is a working node and intel showed meteor lake die shots to the press.,there's no issues with the node.,the concern is only about mass production.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
right but they clearly said its ready for production and there is more than enough time to recognize if it was just broken or had too few tools to ramp.,"the rumors don't make a whole lot of sense unless you assume intel is *explicitly* lying, which even for a company like intel there's a very lawsuit relevant difference between having impossible goals/delivering a mediocre cut down product and verifiably lying about the condition of your business.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not much of an appreciable difference iâ€™d say.,cooling is a bit worse on the 1700 socket without mods due to intelâ€™s mounting method they havenâ€™t changed for years despite evolving cpu size but you should be ok.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

depends completely on the powerlimits you set.,i have a 10850k in a 2u server rack with a alpenfohn black ridge and a 12700k in a sff case with a noctua nh-l12s.,both are with a 150w power limit and quite similar.,perhaps the 12700k is a bit faster in gaming because it has faster single-core ipc and i've disabled the e-cores on that.,the 10850k needs to distribute it's powerlimit to 10-cores after all.,if you set a 150w or lower powerlimit on your 10850k it will be cool/silent.,if you set unlimited powerlimit on the 12600k it will be noisy and hot... so it completely depends on yourself.,"so 12600k might be a bit more efficient, but not a gigantic amount.",maybe 20% faster performance per watt?,imo not worth it to spend the money for the upgrade..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

12th gen (k) is also hot as hell but that's just because there are no default powerlimits.,the non-k cpu's are cool but that's because they set a 65w powerlimit by default.,you just should set the powerlimits yourself.,i recommend just doing pl1 / pl2  as something like 150w / 120w and be done with it.,"as well on your 10th gen as 12th gen.

the 168punds will get you like 20% extra performance for the same power.",you decide if that's worth it to you.,"but stock, without changing settings, it wont be any cooler that 10th gen, because the motherboards literally use 'limitless' power by default on k-cpu's.",so it will just boost until it thermal throttles.,that's the default behavior.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think the c14s would work but you need a deshrouded gpu with the fans reversed to exhaust air out the bottom of the case.,the u9s is compact but i had it pulling fresh air in from the rear and then a 120mm fan on the side panel exhausting the cpu and gpu air out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

in gaming this cooler is ok.  but when you video coding temp get over 90c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for sharing your experience.,i will just run stock frequency.,i don't have any need of oc currently.,"but from what you said, sounds like u12s can be better fit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for some reason that link is asking to open my email xd,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for sharing the info.,i do need louder noise and don't prefer silent things.,because i will be always focused on my pc and maybe sometimes with headphones on.,so how can i know if my components dies or is still alive?,that's why i prefer noisy things.,one of the reasons why i chose nh-d15.,i had heard it cools very well too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1. the aio prices are currently a bit higher so i want to wait till it decreases.,"not double or triple like what happened with gpu and cpu but still, the aio the costs 18900 rupees is now 20k or something.","better to buy at their real price

2. leak.",i know it's not an obvious reason but instead a fear but aio can leak.,if not leak who can say my cooler is alive.,they are so silent that my rgb could be going on but who knows if the pump is ripped.,"if leaks, i can't build another pc as soon as possible.",maybe there are very low chances but not 0% chance.,3. a lot of aio go out of stock easily.,arctic liquid freezer was out of stock for 6+ months.,last year got relisted in amazon.,ofc it happens everyday.,so buying an aio we like can be impossible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ok maybe so, i only use pc for gaming.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i will be using for only gaming too.,no video encoding at all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, i agree u12s should work fine with stock settings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's the first time i see someone complain about the low noise of the component, if the fans of the air-cooler die, your pc will just shutdown from overheating, as you stated your concerns about aio, if it leaks that's a big issue but it's just an air-cooler if it dies you purchase another fan.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if the fan on your cpu cooler were to ever fail.,you would get a warning message since the motherboard can't detect a fan.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"its not aio, its rog strix",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm using noctua u-12a.,in gaming temp is about 50-60c.,no oc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you very much.,then i will go for the u12s,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, that's why i only want to go for air cooler because just need to buy 1 or 2 fans only that can cost as less as 300-400 rupees.","as i haven't used any pc ever, i have no idea about how the coolers behave when something goes wrong",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

might be a better question to direct towards data hoarding and homelab.,they'll have a much better idea on if you will suffer from the missing power or not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m pretty sure both cpus are going to be vast overkill for those purposes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
get the 12700 non-k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"why not a used 3950x or 5950x,  easier to run vm on it, since all core are the same.",cheaper motherboard also.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can get the 12700 non k version.,probably both the 12600 and the 12700 will be overkill though.,"i mean i had a plex server with an fx 8320 downclocked to 3ghz and it handled it just fine, im sure a 12600k won't be breaking a sweat",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the 12600k has 10 cores that consist of 6 perfomance cores and 4 efficiency cores amounting to 16 threads in total.,"30 mb cache

the 12700k has 12 cores that consist of 8 perfomance cores and 4 efficiency cores amounting to 20 threads in total.","30 mb cache

you get 2 performance core and 4 threads more, 12700k  help you out in multi tasking.",go for it.,the 12700f is a decent alternative and works on a stock fan.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you should work for intel and tell them how to do their job.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"can't you just turn hyperthreading off, if you don't want to use it?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
exactly how much additional power are you assuming hyperthreading is using?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in an os that is big.little aware, e cores are used before hyperthreading.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">i mean, it does boost each core by 33%, but at the cost of a lot more power.","hyper threading boosts power efficiency by using wasted pipeline cycles to accomplish work, so if you can gain 33% performance you probably want it since you'll increase power by less than 33%.",this your overall power consumption per work done will decrease.,">it makes more sense if the cpu had 8 p cores and threads, and 8 e-cores and 16 e-threads.",hyper threading on a little core doesn't make as much sense since the lower clock speed and somewhat narrower pipeline mean that there are fewer wasted cycles and thus less benefit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're the only person i've seen who has said they wanted more e-cores while i've seen others disabling e-cores...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i did give intel a few ideas.,"that's how they ended up making a system on a chip, atom.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's just that hyperthreading on p cores costs a lot of power, which could be used for more threads on e cores.","the cpu would make more sense with 9 p cores and 12 e cores with hyperthreading, using the same tdp.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
enough to make more sense to enable ht on e cores instead.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that makes no sense.,"unless you disable ht in bios, jt is always used.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, it only makes sense if your game uses more than 8 cores.",at which case it makes more sense to have 1.5x the e cores vs ht on p cores.,"also, power usage with ht does increase, but i never actually read anywhere by how much.","i presume just the pipeline would be a 10-20% increase, but additional cache activity can easily bring it up to 30%.",hyperthreading on e cores make more sense.,"you're bottlenecking the cache on p cores, since they have to swap out more data.","thus giving more cache to p cores that need it, the performance of p cores goes somwwhat up when disabling ht.","for the e cores it makes massive sense, because you don't really need the e cores, unless it's for small tasks in which cache drop on ht enabled e cores doesn't matter, or in massive parallel tasks, in which the extra e cores matter more than the fewer p cores.","it's like you saying you'd rather have 8 p cores with 16 threads, and 16 e cores crunching data, vs 8 p cores with 16 e cores with 32 threads crunching data.","in massive parallel loads, the more cores the better, as 1 e core and 2 threads finish a job quicker than a single p core.","the e cores get the job done, just slower and more efficiently.",it's better to have 100 turtles finish a race slower than have 50 foxes finish the race faster.,the energy demands are that much different!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because the others probably are using it for gaming.,not parallel processing.,"in which they probably would benefit from disabling the e cores, and get an additional 2 p cores.","if it was up to me, i'd want just e cores for the work i do with them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's cause alderlake being a first implementation has lots of things to fix and optimize.,i also believe the hybrid configuration is the future.,people are dismissing the idea entirely when it's still early to do so.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
he certainly is not the only one.,in fact i would say the majority would agree with intelâ€™s approach in principle.,it makes a lot more sense to make a chip with reasonable number of big cores and large number of small cores than to use the same area for just big cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i am going to call you out on it, until you provide proof.",first atom was not a system on a chip.,it took a quite few years to do so.,and atom would have been developed anyway since low power/low cost was a thing and they really needed a small chip.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
power use inside a cpu isn't as simple as that.,but maybe when the sapphire/emerald rapids xeon processors come along you'll be able to find something that's close to what you want.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hyperthreading helps saturate the p-coreâ€™s execution capacity.,it uses some power but certainly not so much that disabling hyperthreading would improve overall efficiency.,iâ€™m not sure where you got the idea that it uses lots of power.,iâ€™m not sure how the e core architecture would work with hyperthreading.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and where are they going to get extra p and extra 4 e cores?,it costs die space and money.,some of us knew alderlake with 8+8 made more sense on the laptop side and they needed a better desktop chip.,they already decided on the direction they want to go with raptorlake having 8+16 and arrowlake having 8+32.,nothing to do with your desires.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you'd get less out of the ht on e cores then you would on the p as well because p has more resources as a wider uarch and does more pipeline bubbles.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
see [anand's](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16881/a-deep-dive-into-intels-alder-lake-microarchitectures/2) explanation on the topic.,"""that means the system will load up one thread per p-core and all the e-cores before moving to the hyperthreads on the p-cores""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what you are saying likely won't work as you think it does because things are rarely that simple in reality.,if you don't need the e cores then why do you need ht on it?,"depending on the massively parallel task, things like cache contention will come into play whether it's an e core or not.",most tasks that don't care about things like that didn't need those cores anyway.,many consumer applications are in between and have lots of single and multi-threaded code.,or some only benefit to a certain point.,"and yes power does increase when ht is enabled, nothing is free!","but when it can take 30% additional power for 10% perf/clock improvement, ht offering 20, or 30% is a great power efficiency improvement.",also the articles saying it would just prioritize cores in certain order only applies in some cases.,applications will have their own optimization different from it.,there's business reasons for intel to do the way they do it.,what you are suggesting would require intel to make a dedicated lineup just for desktop.,ht is on p cores because it also goes on servers.,the e cores will eventually end up in sff and ultra low power desktops like the predecessor tremont cores did on the jasper lake platform.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">no, it only makes sense if your game uses more than 8 cores.",if you use less than 8 cores you also get the latency advantage from faster context switching.,">at which case it makes more sense to have 1.5x the e cores vs ht on p cores

the e cores are not really useful for games, so in this scenario they're irrelevant.",">also, power usage with ht does increase, but i never actually read anywhere by how much.","i presume just the pipeline would be a 10-20% increase, but additional cache activity can easily bring it up to 30%.",ht uses wasted cycles to get work done.,since these cycles would have consumed some energy for nothing but are now consuming that energy to do something useful there is energy savings.,">thus giving more cache to p cores that need it, the performance of p cores goes somwwhat up when disabling ht.","since performance goes down if you disable ht, you probably mean single thread performance.",it really depends since you're also making things like context switching slower.,"if you look at games some get faster and other get slower, but most don't change at all.",">for the e cores it makes massive sense, because you don't really need the e cores, unless it's for small tasks

i think the 4 way shared cache is the main problem for the e cores.",that trades performance and efficiency for die size.,"they could fix it accommodate 8 threads, but that makes it bigger, which is not what they wanted.",combined with the lower benefit from ht for the e cores it probably wasn't worthwhile in the loads intel was interested in.,">it's like you saying you'd rather have 8 p cores with 16 threads, and 16 e cores crunching data, vs 8 p cores with 16 e cores with 32 threads crunching data.","in massive parallel loads, the more cores the better, as 1 e core and 2 threads finish a job quicker than a single p core.",the e cores are not designed for massively parallel workloads.,they're designed for non-latency critical tasks on low power mobile devices.,"if you wanted to reimagine them as parallel processors, ht would make a lot of sense.",so would wider vector units.,better load/store throughput.,faster cache with more external bandwidth.,these would make them tremendously better for what you're thinking but they'd suck at what intel actually wants them to do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
power use inside a cpu is as simple as that.,p cores waste a lot more than e cores.,p cores with hyperthreading waste a lot more than e cores with hypsrthreading.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sure it would.,like atom cpus also came out with hyperthreading.,"though, i would have preferred the way amd is going.","have a few p cores for the main work load, and offload nearly all work to arm/risc-v cores.",they are buttloads more efficient than x86 technology.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it does increase power consumption & heat quite a bit but i assume that, as you said, that's just because the cores are being more heavily utilized than they would be if they were purely serialized (meaning they would inevitably end up inactive at times waiting for another required thread, whereas hyperthreading means there's far less ""downtime"")",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
now that i didn't know.,makes no sense to have em then.,i wonder how much faster a cpu would be exchanging the ht on the p cores with more e cores?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1- unfortunately i don't know how to respond to paragraphs in my app, but latency is actually more on ht capable devices, because most cpis don't have enough l-cache.",might work on the latest x3d ryzen cpus though.,"2- true, however not everyone wants to game on cpus.","if you make a gaming pc, 8 to 12 cores (no ht), or 8 cores with larger l-cache and ht will be the best solution.",this is an all round cpu.,"for that task, 8 p cores are more than enough for gaming, but for compiling, data crunching, server workloads, the cpu would be better to just have e cores.","to make it an all round cpu, they should reduce ht on the p cores where it's not really needed (save for only a handful of games that use more than the 8 p cores, and where the additional e cores don't benefit, and put it where the demand is for e cores (massive parallel tasks, like database maintenance, servers, compiling, cpu rendering, folding or other scientific programs like boinc that can't be done on gpus).",3 waste cycles don't use energy.,the core goes into sleep mode if no work is done.,this happens on the ns timescale.,4- single core performance is more optimized due to larger l cache available per core.,"disabling the extra ht threads, reduces power consumption, the main limitation on these cpus is heat exchange.","aside from larger cache, disabling the ht threads, also allows the p cores to run higher frequencies, thus better performance in games.","instead of keeping ht, eliminating the threads and building them into e-cores, allows for much more efficient parallel processing of multi thread applications that can and will use the threads.","it's less beneficial if you have to run 24 parallel threads, with 8 on the p cores, vs if you could just run 24 on e cores.",the p cores should not generate much heat since they should be in a sleep state.,"if the e cores are anything like arm cores, they would do the job at 50% the speed of p cores, utilizing just a mere 30% of the power.","hence, if you could increase the e cores to still stay below the tdp, you could do a lot more work done in a shorter amount of time.","kind of what gpus are doing, only with dpp (64 bit precision).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hyperthreading doesnâ€™t really take significant amount of die space.,e cores do.,so you canâ€™t just exchange them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
die space doesn't matter nowadays.,"you see how much people are willing to shell out for cpus, which they used to do for single core cpus 20 years ago as well.","they can get so many more multicore processors out of a wafer these days, than a single cpu core on the 40-128nm cpus of old.","the first cpus, transistors were measured in micrometers, not nanometers.",p cores imho is only good for compatibility.,the e-cores should be arm.,"one can put roughly 200x 3.6ghz cortex a51 cores on a cpu, consuming less than 60w.","the other 90w a cpu can thermally emit in heat, can easily be allocated to a performance octacore cpu, cache and other basic controller systems in the cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

they actually have the same igpu aside from the updated vp9 encoder (gen 9.5 being identical to the gen 9 aside from the encoder).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
worth is very subjective.,do you value the warranty?,"if you're fine spending the $100 then go for it, if you are budget focused then you could spend $100 elsewhere.",the i3 is slightly better for the tasks you will be performing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"probably the v27 driver was 'customized' by dell in some way which makes it preferred, you'll need to uninstall it in device manager then manually install the v30 driver from intel's site.",then turn off updates for that device in device manager,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hello, i have actually done this already.","i have tried installing the latest version and it worked until i restarted/'updated' the driver from device manager, then it went back to v27",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you could try undervolting the cpu.,"assuming they've replaced the heatsink and cleaned everything properly, it really is your only option.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all 11th gen chips will slam against their thermal limit in most models.,"they have 200w+ pl2s, no amount of reseating or liquid metal will fix that.",most laptops have a sustained heat dissipation in the range of 50-150w.,undervolt your chip or otherwise dont worry about it.,my 11800h would hit 105c in games too but it performed better than when undervolted and locked to 4.0 ghz/all cores/1.0v.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

tbh been playing rdr2 last few hours and hasnâ€™t gone over 85c gpu is 75c.,if i undervault the cpu will i lose performance ?,?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so youâ€™d recommend undervaulting ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my laptop with 11800h could do 4.3ghz but i had a msi with advanced bios and small 3% overclock.,i put liquid metal.,88c max temp at 100% all core.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my 11800h would also do that but i reduced the turbo boost on it and itâ€™s temps are much lower now (in the 80s and i didnâ€™t notice much dip in performance),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
im not sure liquid metal will be covered by my warranty ?,?,?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they donâ€™t really work honestly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you don't change the frequency it might actually improve performance side it allows the cpu to boost higher thanks to the reduced temperature,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but what clocks is it hitting?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no interference on your own will be covered by your warranty, you've got a choice - constantly thermal throttle like mad due to how miserable alienware is in general, or fix it easily with liquid metal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m so new to all this stuff what iâ€™ve learnt is over last couple of months.,would you be willing to help me attempt to undervault ?,i have discord ?,achilles1883#7499 if youâ€™re able to help :) greatly appreciated.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that one was hitting 4.3ghz with the slight overclock, the normal all core is 4.2ghz.","msi laptops have advanced bios that let's it undervolt and a small overclock, 3% max.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

itâ€™s really pretty incredible.,this is nearly i7-12700 performance (that chip tends to sit around 21500).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

how are the changes going?,did you noticed any huge performance improvement?,i currently have i7 4790k and planing to upgrade to i5 12600kf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yea it was i had mine ocd to 4.8 and it did great.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s great totally worth it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and what would that prove for you exactly?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
never wait if you need something now !,"i expect the 13600k to be a 6+8 config with more cache, meaning it might have the current i9 gaming performance or more.",but other than that there ainâ€™t much compared to the current gen and coming from the 7700k anything is an upgrade,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep!,"though, that is to be expected considering 5900x debuted nearly 2 years ago in late 2020.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

in the h series class intel won in performance and amd won in battery life.,more news at 11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't get why alder lake with it's hybrid architecture is actually worse in battery life.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
~1% difference in mt at 45w.,at 80w 13%.,doesnt look good for raptor lake ( same node ) vs zen4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just lock cpu usage on intel they almost same- => intel win,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at 80w.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
amd got double the battery life.,i got tired of waiting for the 6900hx to release so i bought a intel laptop.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
windows doesnâ€™t let big cores sleep and fall back to littles.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe if amd actually is willing/able to supply in any meaningful quantity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they win without question in single core performance regardless of power level.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45w still favours intel more often than not.,single thread dominant apps favour intel regardless of power level.,80w just turns it into a landslide in workloads that scale well with core count.,"but not only that, in just about any laptop model that offers both intel and amd (legion 5/5i and 7/7i, zephyrus g15/m16, strix g/scar, alienware m15 r7 and more), the intel model will be able to push a little further and perform further ahead while amd hits a brick wall at 85-90w tops despite having the same cooling module because intelâ€™s larger die size allows for better thermal contact.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or maybe if intel is willing/able to delay meteor lake,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"maybe, who knows.","raptor looks to be on track, though.","zen 4â€™s 8% (as quoted by amd, although thatâ€™s with 32mb l3 cache not the cut down mobile) ipc gain would need to do some serious heavy lifting if they donâ€™t want to  go the intel route of blasting high clocks on the laptop if amd stans hate that tactic so much.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"its a joke

intel should delay meteor lake so that pheonix can stay competitive",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
90% of people worry too much about thermal paste distribution tbh.,i have a 12600k too and i just did a medium sized bead in the middle of the ihs and my temps have been great for 7+ months with a dark rock pro 4. didn't even use expensive paste or anything just the default that came with the cooler.,so yeah it should be totally fine.,only time i'd stress about temps with intel 12th gen and maybe consider washer mod would be getting awful temps and throttling with something like a 12900k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looks perfect to me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its definitely getting pushed down on the edges but if the temps and noise its ok to you maybe leave it as is.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the corner doesnt matter.,thatâ€™s a fine spread.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"pressure itself is on a mediocre side (high pressure in the centre, close to none on sides, but the centre has high pressure, which is very good), so washer mod is advisable, but it seems rather good overall.",what's your temperature and power draw?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well get the replacement if your worried,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a 12900k with a d15 cooler using grizzly paste.,in cinebench i max out at 83c.,"all stock, no undervolt or power limits, no washer mod.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how often should people reapply paste?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, temperature looks reasonable.","i just hate fan humming, which the a14 supplied with my noctua c14s has quite a bit of, from 900rpm onwards.","i replaced it with an a12x25 anyways so that the cooler fits in the ncase m1 and the a12 is quieter and has less humming at similar temps in my opinion

in cinebench (stock 4.5ghz turbo with ~-35mv) with a fan level that i'm ok with (1200rpm for a12), it hits 75-80 deg.",(p core #3 is a little loosey goosey) on the mobo box.,so inside the case the rpm might go up a bit.,"but i'll be gaming and not running benchmarks, so it should be impressively quiet most of the time ðÿ˜",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hmm... but having a certain brand of paste can matter and improve performance.,"use to have corsair paste, changed to silver 5, i saw almost an 8c difference.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75-80 deg.,"outside the case at 120-126w (cinebench, stock clock with slight undervolt).",that's with a noctua c14s and an a12x25 at 1200rpm or a14 at about 900-1000rpm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the input!,"yeah, at least there is some pressure along the long centerline, which is important, since that's where the cores are if i understand correctly.","i think i'll enjoy it like this for a while (in games it should get better temps anyways) and if i wanna tinker with it at some point i'll look into washer mod or cnc clamp like the grizzly ðÿ˜› 
might try a custom loop in a year or two since i have the ncase ðÿ˜‰",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
opinions vary i think.,"it also depends on the thermal paste, since some apparently can dry out slightly.",i assume you can go a couple of years without much drop in performance.,but google/reddit is your friend.,i just repasted mine because it was my first time building a pc and wasn't sure if i had put enough.,also p-core #3 was up to 6-7c higher than the rest.,but it turns out it was just fine.,got pretty much the same temps after repasting and core #3 is still a hot boi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so you max out at only 80â°c in an intensive cpu usage scenario?,why not reduce your fan speed even further then?,if you target 85-90â° under full cpu load you could probably lower the fan speeds to 800 rpm or even lower (will ofc be different when installed in the ncase).,and since you are only running games you may want to set your fan curve speeds lower until f.e.,80â°c so it only only ramps up when the cpu is working under near full load.,doing this with my aio.,gaming temps somewhere around 65-75â°c but just minimally louder than at idle (due to 0rpm idle fan speeds).,fans only audible when video editing and cpu is under very high load.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think most high quality pastes are quite similar +- 2c maybe.,i just used the noctua nt-h1 supplied with the cooler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for the cooler under this power draw?,looks good.,"you still can give washer mod a shot, but you're already in a good spot.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i changed from artic silver, been using it for 20 years, to girzzly kryonaut just this week and it changed -10c.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

but why,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
one of the worst budget boards in existence.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on if you want to wait 3-4 months.,"you can't go wrong with a 12700k, it's nearly the best gaming cpu and nearly the best consumer mt cpu, while being a better price to performance than the flagship cpus.","as for 12700f vs 12700k, it depends on your budget and needs.","the 12700f is cheap at $310, but you can get a 12700k for $40 more, and it's not just having an igp, but overclocking and allows for higher performance ram kits.","the 12700kf would be the equal but without the igp, but it doesn't go on sale so the pricing doesn't make sense.",-- for only $40 more i'd get the 12700k over the 12700f.,but if you're outside the us the price gap may be higher.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wait for 13&700.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would recommend the 12700/f only if you don't care about ram overclocking.,"otherwise it's an incredible deal, ram speed being the only caveat.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think the 12700k is what i am going to go with for a cpu.,suggestions for a ddr4 z690 board?,i've using gigabyte aorus boards for a while with my amd builds so i found them stable but i am open to suggestions to other vendors as well.,"again, thank you all for the insight and suggestions!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you're running linux as the host operating system, then i'd suggest getting something with an igpu.","as i understand it, intel's igpus have better support than nvidia's on linux.","if there's even a slim possibility of using linux, i'd take the igpu.",but it's also handy to have in case your gaming gpu breaks during a gpu shortage.,"and if you do go with the igpu, you'd want a motherboard with 3 or 4 video outputs.",the alder/raptor lake igpus are supposed to support four displays.,there are some b series (or maybe h) with 3-4 outputs.,"higher end z boards usually only have two video outputs, but some of them have two thunderbolt outputs which can use adapters, i believe.","(displayport can use either daisy-chaining or a mst hub to add more displays, but those can be tricky to use and reduce bandwidth/resolution from what i hear.)","as far as raptor lake, if this a high-end system, it might be worth waiting for it.",though it might be even better for budget builders if the base i5 gets e-cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in approximately three months there will be new  ryzen and hopefully intel processors.,the current generation will be discounted maybe more than usual do to the competition.,amd will have a new architecture and intel will press on with more e-cores.,this all means more multitasking and faster single cpu speeds.,of course if you need one now today's machines are plenty fast.,i am waiting to see what happens.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why the change back to intel?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a hand full of lab machines and test boxes.,probably no more than 3 to 4 at a time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

intels better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why would you buy a cpu without checking supported cpu list?,you read it wrong.,that's not anyone else's problem.,"even lga1151 has 2 revisions, incompatible to each other.",am4 is the same.,different bios versions support different cpus and amd arbitrarily declared some motherboards won't support new cpus then backflipped multiple times.,for example some agesa versions support a-series apu but not zen2 or zen3.,some support zen onwards but not zen3.,some support zen2 cpu but not certain zen2 apu.,some support zen3 but not zen3d.,good luck buying things blindly and expecting it to just work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>$50 lost over 1 singular number difference.,"it doesn't help that the number difference was a repeating number, either.",it's a bad idea to buy a motherboard without looking at what cpus it actually supports.,"even if you get the socket correct, not all boards necessarily support all processors that can fit into a given socket.",when you pick out a board take 30 seconds to google the cpu support list and make sure it's not going to need a bios update or something else to work with your cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"no, they did not.","technical accuracy got nothing to do with naming simplicity, especially when newer iterations don't get higher number in name (as in 1151 is newer than 1156, i.e.).","amd got it clean with newer sockets having higher numbers (so am3 -> am4 -> am5) with some wilderness of am3+, but it was still clear the am3+ should be newer.","truth be told, you're still supposed to check what socket your cpu is designed for lol.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or the right glove with the left one.,both have five fingers which might be very confusing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you can complain all you want, this is entirely on you and your error.",you misread the number and you bought a cpu that won't work with the motherboard you have.,intel didn't make you mess it up.,"luckily, it's only a $50 mistake.","put the cpu back up on facebook marketplace, kijiji, craigslist, or whatever and try again.","you need lga1155, which will be 2nd or 3rd gen processors.",the motherboard will have a model number somewhere.,"whether there's an official list or not, there will likely be some sort of record of what processors will work, and which will not.","intel ""names"" their sockets based on the number of pins in use.","lga1155 uses 1155 pins, lga1151 uses 1151 pins, lga1700 uses, you guessed it, 1700 pins.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no what he is saying is you checked the socket which you still got wrong and you also didn't check what the board is actually compatible with.,"like the top comment says there has been 2 revisions of lga1151 its not so much the socket that changes but the faster the cpu gets the better a boards vrm, heatsinks, pcie gens a lot of things need to change so just assuming every cpu with a certain socket will just pop into any board with the same socket is just idiotic.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the dude's advice still applies.,could have googled the motherboard itself instead of looking up your socket alone.,that's his point.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>came with the pc that i received for free.,then its even more important to check.,lots of oem motherboards only support certain cpus.,buying a cpu that the motherboard may not support is a recipe for frustration.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ehhh do you know intel sockets?,"i do it for a living, pcb board components.",intel had made it so simple.,amd be like â€œtr4â€ â€œstrx4â€.,intel sockets just go higher with the more lgas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is a prebuilt hp computer and i donâ€™t wanna dig through serial numbers and model numbers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah.,"now step aside, forget your knowledge and tell me which is newer/better - lga1200 or lga1355?","intels socket naming scheme is confusing af for an outside person, cpus are fine, since they actually go with higher number each new generation.",even subconsciously you feel strx4 is supposed to at least be newer than tr4.,amd really got the naming scheme in check.,"lucky us, we can see what chipset is used, so it's less of a problem.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well thatâ€™s kinda part of the deal with computers- you gotta do that sorta stuff to ensure everything works.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is even a worse case as a prebuilt could have custom bios which is even more limited in cpu compatibility by the oem.,if you donâ€™t want to bother pay someone who can.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if i put knowledge aside then i would do the research to figure it out first before thinking one was better/newer.,in opâ€™s case one came out long before the other.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"but the thing is, itâ€™s not an arbitrary marketing name.",itâ€™s a literal physical description of the socket.,how much clearer can that be?,"(and yes, there are some confusing instances of incompatible intel sockets using the same pin counts, ie.","lga2011 and lga2011-v3, but thatâ€™s not the complaint here.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in op's case op misread ""1155"" as ""1151"", which isn't related to a research for ""this is newer than this"".","and as far as an average joe is concerned, naming should be absolutely easy to understand in terms which is newer/better and luckily he doesn't need to rely on socket naming.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
get the cheapest.,non-k sa voltage is locked so if you get ram that's too fast it might not even run xmp profile.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

iâ€™ve been able to run 3200 c14 dual rank b die w tuned subs on a 12400f with no problems despite the locked sa voltage but the processor doesnâ€™t seem to scale off it very well for whatever reason.,tuned ddr5 on the 12400f (ran it at 6200 c28 lol) has a massive uplift but kind of defeats the purpose of a budget cpu.,iâ€™d say just grab some cheap memory - 3200 c14 2x8 if you can find.,my conclusion is the cpu is extremely bandwidth starved and benefits from highly tuned ddr5 but there isnâ€™t a big difference with ddr4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

do you really need chrome os?,because those prices for 2 or 3 year old cpus does not sound great to me.,"if you can live with windows or anything else, check prices for a complete intel nuc or a minisforum complete mini pc, not the barebones.","you will find more powerful hardware at the same power consumption, and maybe better prices

"no, definitely not normal for just gaming.",you most likely need a better cooler or thermal paste replacement.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for laptop 90-100 degree celsius is normal while gaming but for desktop its not normal
change thermal paste and remember never too tighten the cooler screw,it will push out thermal paste
or change cooler",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i just put thermal paste on it yesterday then took the cooler off to see and it was spread pretty evenly 
and donâ€™t i have to screw the cooler to have it secured to it?",i didnâ€™t screw it to tight either,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i ordered a new air cooler for it since the one i had before was probably rated for my i5 iâ€™m assuming?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i bought it as a pre build from ibuypower but yeah itâ€™s the same air cooler that was with my i5
but i ordered a new one i posted it in the comments somewhere so it should help i hope",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
please check if you still have the sticker at the bottom of the cooler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
donâ€™t listen to that other guy who said to leave your cooler mounted loosely.,you want it nice and tight and snug.,donâ€™t tighten it as much as a truck tire bolt or anything but make it as tight as itâ€™s supposed to be.,the thinner the layer of paste the better.,some will squeeze out and this is normal.,source: been building pcs for 20 years.,100c gaming isnâ€™t normal.,make sure you peeled off the plastic protector from your cpu cooler.,if you have a tiny ass cooler thatâ€™s barely half the size of your mouse that might explain it.,for a 11700 you will need a decent tower cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you reused the stock intel cooler from your i5 cpu?,"yah those aren't rated to handle any of the ""k"" sku cpus which push over 100w.","there is a reason they don't include a cpu cooler with those cpus, you'll need a decent aftermarket cooler to cool them properly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on which cooler you have right now.,is it the one that came included with your i5 upon purchase?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s not there current using the old cooler that was on my old cpu and itâ€™s temps were fine but my new cooler is coming in today so iâ€™ll make double sure to make sure this is no plastic!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i ordered a cooler master hyper 212 evo v2 with sickle flow would this help my cooling??,i hope so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes sir please do that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes that is a mid sized air cooler.,should do the trick.,there are double-tower larger air coolers but this one should be way better than the little round puck shaped coolers intel offers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"little update, i put on a hefty application of thermal paste and my new air cooler and it runs like a dream now!",!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok cool and my pc has a glass panel in the front in front of my 3 fans should i remove it for better airflow iâ€™m assuming,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this pc was originally a pre built but iâ€™ve replaced pretty much everything now except the air cooler and the stock fans it came with so iâ€™m assuming it might need more airflow now that i got some more beefier stuff in it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice i wish you very cold tempsðÿ˜‚,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on the case and how good itâ€™s made.,get a temp monitoring program like hwinfo64 or afterburner if you want easy graphs then benchmark with unigen heaven which will produce predictable results and run it with and with out the front panel and see.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
copy that i have a program called core temp thatâ€™s kinda similar iâ€™ll try it when i get home,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so unigine heaven is a gpu/game bench but if you want a quick way to test just cpu thermals without going nuts download cpu-z then find the benchmark tab there is a â€œstress cpuâ€ button.,that will produce a predictable steady amount of heat.,alternatively just play games and make sure itâ€™s not in the 90s,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

good luck!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
am i reading this right or did the 10100 kinda get trounced in the benchmarks?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

well the benchmarks show i3â€™s from previous gens outperforming the 10100â€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you sure?,from a quick scroll it looks like the 10100 tends to land above older i3s.,the g6900 is newer and on intel 7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's why i qualified my first comment with something like ""am i reading the graphs right?""",lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

high mid settings at what resolution?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what monitor resolution?,the requirements for hitting 60fps is largely based on that.,"at 1080p, an rx 6600 will hit 60 in most games easily, it's considerably more powerful and it'll use less power than a 2060, but a 2060 will still be fine and you can probably find a pretty cheap one on ebay.","you could also go with an rx 5600 xt, roughly equivalent to an rtx 2060 in overall performance and price.","don't bother with the gtx 16 series though, the raw rasterization performance isn't quite as good as the rtx 20 series.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rx580 for medium 1080 gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
used inexpensive 2070s in good condition or 3060ti imo if doing 1080p or 1440p.,otherwise iâ€™d go 3080 for 1440p high refresh or 4k resolution.,depends on your budget and resolution mostly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for 1080p, a 2070 super or 3060ti.","for 1440p or 4k, a 3080 or better.",i was getting 100+ fps with a 2070 regular and an i7-8700k on rdr2; about 60 fps with ac games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"amd rx 6600 is the best value right now, unless you go used.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
doe niet ik ben het nog aan het kijken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and budget?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
okey thanks for your suggestions.,"i might go with 2060 for dlss, better driver support i guess and rtx, 6600 and 00xt are have same prices on my country.",ps: ofc montior res is 1080p.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2k or 4k is not necessary for me right now, my monitor res is 1080p and 60hz :(, ill change it to higher refresh rated one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"im between 3060ti, 3070ti but amd ones are more cheap on my country thanks for the suggestions tho",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for 1080p but cant say exact budget because its diffrent here in turkey.,but i can say its between 1660 prices and 3060 prices (they have close prices in here).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"personally, i would recommend 3060 ti > 3060 = 6600 > 2060 > 1660 super.",go for whichever card fits in your budget.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you are planning a monitor upgrade to 4k in a year or so i would go with 3080. if you are planning 2k/1440p i would go with 3060ti/6700xt and if you're staying at 1080p and upgrading panel to ips 165hz + then even the 3060 or 6600(xt) is fine but i would aim for a better gpu from my bias.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i removed all these duplicate posts as they will not get you any useful information.,"every system has a ""bottleneck"" somewhere so anyone answering no to this kind of question would be lying.",what you want to know is are those components well balanced.,the answer to that is yes.,12100f would in most cases be good enough until around 6600xt or 3060ti level of performance.,that of course also depends on the graphics settings.,the higher your settings the more you demand from your gpu compared to cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"that specialist is fucking noob, you can go with either amd or intel, just choose cpu with more cores like 12900k or 5950x.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its not the cpu i found to be causing unable issues in certain rendering programs after using both the 5900x & 12900kf with 3080's.,its the program version release itself vs the nvidia driver \~ buffer limits (tdrdelay/tdrddidelay),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that specialist is full of shit.,i'm running a 12900k and the thing is rock solid.,i do have to reboot my machine every 20 or so days but that is more a windows 11 thing.,my server is a 12600k and it is equally stable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that guy is full of shit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

with vray you can mix and match cards.,you can combine a 3090 and a 1080ti of you want.,but itâ€™s not sli or nvlink.,there are caveats.,when rendering with the gpu cuda option the second card will show up as an additional device.,the same goes for the cpu .,you can combine videos cards and cpu to chew thru a render using cuda with vray.,it will not combine memory and you need to make the lesser card your display card so the better card is not bogged down by the viewport.,but you are correct itâ€™s 3090 where you can use nvlink and combine memory.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"nah, the 12100 is a great cpu, even though it's an i3",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your goal is to bottleneck the gpu.,in this case you are good to go.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on resolution.. in 1080p gpu wouldnt be utilized at max.. in 1440p or 4k case cpu wouldnt be utilized at max.. but card is not enough for higher res (except some older titles or esport),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
some aaa games maybe the cpu but in most cases the gpu will be the limiting factor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for 1080p yes but 2k , 4k then no.",i paired i3-12100f with 3070ti.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 12100f is a budget beast, itâ€™ll do fine.",have you considered shopping secondhand for gpus?,that marketâ€™s incredible right now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"op, see if you can squeeze a 12400f and a 1080ti instead",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for pure gaming at least 6 cores like 12400 or 5600.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gpu bottleneck.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
any i3 cpu 10th gen and above can work well with the newer gpu's but especially amd,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"looks like a very decent combo, you will also be able to upgrade the cpu to 12400/12400f in the future very easily.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you can extend your budget, the 12400f would be a good step up from the 12100, and will last longer.","but even with the 12100f, i don't think you will be bottlenecked.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cpu wonâ€™t be a bottleneck except in games like fortnight where you can get 300+fps in 1080p.,but letâ€™s be honest gpus have come so far where cpus are generally the bottleneck.,iâ€™d really advise going 6 or more cores if you donâ€™t plan to upgrade in a year or two.,by no means will a 12100f be a problem with a 6600 though.,if you have some spare $ go for the 12400f if not then donâ€™t sweat it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well there is always a bottleneck in your system in some ways but ideally you want your gpu to be your bottleneck.,in this scenario the i3 12th gen is powerful af in single core performance which is necessary to feed the gpu fast enough with information.,so yes it will be a gpu bottleneck and a good pair.,i would look though if you can squeeze the i5-12400f into your budget.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s a good pairing there!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i3 12th and rx6600 is a good pair.,you will not face problems in most scenarios.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'd try to get a rx 6600 xt as they are better value imo.,i3 12100f is still a beast tho.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"what does this mean, you want the gpu to be the unrestrained by the cpu, bottlenecking the gpu means you want a bad cpu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks it was very helpful,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
r5 5600 and 1070 ti combo here (main rig).,pascal is still going strong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 12100 can keep up within %10 of a 9900k in most gaming scenarios.,6 core is nice but not necessary.,the 12100f is the new budget king hands down.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tnx for your opinion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for your opinion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it means that you never want your cpu to be the bottleneck.,because then it leaves gpu performance on the table.,"basically, 60% cpu utilization and 100% gpu utilization are better than 100% cpu utilization and 60% gpu utilization.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i recomend to go for 12400f and 6600 and go for 1080p144hz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
true,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah the 12400f would be a lot better and it only cost a tiny bit more.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"then you need to bottleneck the cpu, not the gpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my budget is limited and in my country the prices are strangely close, which of these two is better?","i3 12100f 2060 12gb
i3 12100f 3050 oc",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

about 30% faster at 15w then the deck and then it keep going up to 20w where its 50% faster then the deck.",after that the gains are less and that is a bit odd.,not sure why.,"so if you use the same 15w setting as the deck, you have around 67% more battery life.",interestingly the deck does better at lower wattage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is extremely interesting.,"intel might end up using three different architectures in one cpu

this is a bit misleading as intel put a 486-class core starting with nehalem \*just\* to manage power.,"the new lp cores in the soc die are for again, power management.",the intel platforms have a difficult time getting to idle and keeping it at idle.,this should in theory make it much more realistic to reach higher battery life without having to shut down all processes and make windows absolutely barebone to even have a chance of getting decent battery life.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"that's 105a at ~1v, not the 5 to 12v you are sending to the board from the psu.","105a at 1v is only 105 watts of total power (not including efficiency losses), a modern cpu can easily use 200+ watts without being a super high end chip with a crazy overclock.",so they have multiple 105a power chips on the board to spread the load and supply smoother current under all loads.,"as cpus get more and more powerful but also using lower and lower voltages, that current requirement is only going up every generation or two.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the power stages never run at 105a.,the 90+% efficiency range for most power stages is at the low end (e.g.,5-25a).,the point is to maximize efficiency across all possible loads.,"at full load, the vrm will turn on all stages, while at idle a single stage may be active.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the same was said about 10th and 11th gen on lga1200, but after a little research it seems that all h410 and b460 motherboards were not 11th gen compatible, but i can also find plenty of z490 boards that were also never updated.","with that said, it looks like the situation should be better for 12th and 13th gen. apparently as rock (who notoriously had very poor 11th gen support on their z490 boards) has already announced 13th gen support on all their 12th gen motherboards, right down to the h610.","and, as you have an asus, i would certainly expect them to offer full support as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

however, 12600k also is a good choice, it have less 2 cores but it have 2 cores boost to 4.9, and it boost more aggressively compared to 12700 single core boost to 4.9 which rarely happens unless run r23 single core test.",k version also allowed you to run higher frequency ram.,"&#x200b;

i changed to 12600k because i got a used z690 board at half price, 12600k and 12700 performance are identical on gaming on stock (from my own experience and also based on review), but oc-ed 12600k will have better performance on gaming compared to 12700 because 12700 all cores frequency at 4.7 locked, but an oc-ed 12600k can do all core above 4.7 depend on your lottery.","on productivity, i use handbrake once in a while, so i don't mind to give up the additional 2 core, of course i have to wait longer during handbrake.","&#x200b;

if you decided to go with 12600k, i suggest you get a budget z690 board like msi pro z690-a, you might dont want to oc now but in future, you can oc it to catch up a bit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tbh i would take the extra cores of the 12700 over yhe 12600k.,overclocking doesnt matter *that* much nowadays because a couple hundred megahertz does not matter that much.,"unless ofc, u have something that does utilize it.",personally the 12700 would be my answer.,get a decent cooler and unlock the power limits,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"pick the 12700

how tdp is defined is changed in 12th gen, so look up alder lake launch articles on anandtech",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
neither.,get the cheaper 12400..... you are not running a super high-end gpu (or are you?),so the 12400 will deliver near exact same performance as those cpus you mentioned.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ddr5 uses two 32 bit channels per stick so unless the intel driver is braindead it shouldn't matter as much as ddr4.,"with ddr4 it is harder to do that since each cache line is split across two channels, and thus two dimms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but in the end the difference in bandwidth is similar - 2x32bit still gives you only 50% of bandwidth.,doesn't that make the main difference?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"two dimms have the same bandwidth regardless of their capacity, so there is no difference in bandwidth, only a difference in how you access that bandwidth (see above).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"however according to intel, a part of the memory operates in dual channel mode (in contrary with the rest operating in quad channel).","https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005657/boards-and-kits.html#flex

the quad channel part of the ram has higher bandwith because it can send 128bits in 1 clock cycle in comparison with dual channel which can send only 64bits.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're missing my point.,i'll try and explain in more detail.,"cacheline size on x86 is 64 bytes, which is the fundamental access size for the memory system.","each ddr5 channel is 4 bytes wide with a burst length of 16, which totals 64 bytes per access.","since each cache line is exactly the size of  one channel burst, if you do a single load with ddr5 you don't get 128 bits per cycle, you get 32 bits per cycle for 16 cycles (which gives a 64 byte cache line).","therefore there is no ""quad channel part"" and no ""dual channel part"" with ddr5.","all loads are 32 bits wide, always, but you have cache lines spread across 4 independent channels.","if you have uneven memory size between channels, then more cache lines are in some channels and fewer in others.","this is a problem if you want to use the entire memory all at once since you'll have to use 2 of the channels much more than the others, reducing bandwidth.","it isn't a problem though if you want to allocate a relatively small texture in the gpu's ram though, since the driver can choose memory that is split between all 4 channels (or perhaps put 4 concurrently needed textures in 4 different channels).",hence it should be a lot easier to maintain good performance on newer platforms.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you don't skimp on stuff when buying 3090. or at least don't go crying on forums why is the gpu underperforming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is putting all the load on the gpu.,you would need 1080p to reduce gpu load and put more load on cpu/ram.,fast ram nowadays has very little impact on gaming performance (look up comparisons) and only gives real benefits in productivity work.,"honestly, you have no idea what you are talking about.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is true for me at least.,i'll be going with a 4090 and top 13th gen chip.,may as well get quality ram.,for my last upgrade i went with a 3080 and 9700k and regretted it because my vr performance has been bottlenecked by the vram and cpu.,"at least by getting quality binned parts i won't be wondering ""what if"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, you clearly don't as you can't understand that already 3080 introduces cpu and ram bottleneck in 1440p.","guy got 3090, even with 4k he will benefit from faster ram, unless he's going to absolutely demolish the gpu with stupid graphical settings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m not going to even argue with you anymore.,"ram makes very little difference at anything other than 1080p with a 3090.

"sorry, i completely forgot 10th gen is still used for some reason, when 12th or even 11th gen are sold for the same price.","if you have zen 2 or 11th gen or newer, then you automatically fulfill all requirements for 6400 to run at full potential and if you have older stuff then you most likely already have a stronger gpu anyway as to not buy it.",if for some reason unknown you're getting a 10150f with h510 motherboard or you've got like haswell with gts450... then just save your money and get a console.,"gen 3.0 and disastrously low pcie lanes available for the gpu makes it suffer tremendously once the vram is full [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ofbdw0awxm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ofbdw0awxm), on top of weakness of the cpu itself.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

bruh.,userbenchmark thinks the  i5 8600k is the be all end all for cpus.,the size of salt required is boulder sized.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't know how they get +8% effective speed when if you scroll just a little lower it says its 43% to 112% faster.,but yeah the other guy is right about the site being run by an insane person that changes ranking metrics depending on intel's strengths.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

seems to me like the big difference comes from the radiator flowing fresh cool air from the outside rather than any specific advantage to having it in front vs top.,curious how a positive pressure setup with both front and top set to intake with rear and/or bottom exhaust will work.,should be good for keeping out dust if nothing else.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
having the radiator in the front of the case instead of on the top will generally provide better temps to the cpu but will sacrifice cooling to the rest of the components.,"also, having the radiator installed the way it is installed in the picture can result in the radiator having issues in the future.","here is a video explaining why that is: [https://youtu.be/bbgomv195sk](https://youtu.be/bbgomv195sk)

"use fans on front that don't suck a deck and with aio on top either remove back fan or make it push air inside the case, the bottom fan is also redundant at best.","anyway, while this test is applicable to aio, you'd need to make it also on a unit that allows refill coolant to make sure you've got liquid filled to the cork and you'd also want to measure the temperature inside the case... somewhere below radiator.","the temperature will tell if it's oven effect inside chassis or if it's fluid mechanics (pump, coolant amount, etc.",).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

likely decompressing/unpacking assets.,if you are using the stock cooler you should consider replacing it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

recheck cpu cooler to see if itâ€™s installed correctly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"read carefully: what happens is this, the stock cooler of the 11400f is designed to dissipate 65watts which is the default power limit of the 11400f but intel in the 11th generation allowed users to choose to exceed the default limit, although obviously more consumption equals more performance and more heat, many motherboards come with the power limit unlocked that is why when using 100% of your processor you reach 95câ°, because it is using approximately 125 watts instead of 65 watts by default and this is much more than the stock cooler can handle.",what you can do to avoid this point is to set the power limit in the bios to 65 watts maximum consumption.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

maybe you didn't attach it back correctly.,my brothers was probably overheating for a week.,it wore out the silicon slightly but it shouldn't cause the cpu to run hotter once you put everything back on correctly.,the wear that cuased over llike a week is probably equal to around 3-6 months of regular proper use.,make sure all 4 screws from the cooler are actually attached to where they should be.,screwed in right.,use a flashlight to help you see.,"i'm guessing you're using the stock intel cooler the 11400f comes with, or some kind of cooler like it, if it's a pre-build.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

wear to a cpu is negligible regardless so it doesn't make much difference what you set it to aside from battery life and performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this can be any number of problems causing your 3d rendering software to crash.,my initial instincts tell me that you are focusing on the wrong solution/problem.,it is not the cpu.,people love to debate cpus here.,"and it usually boils down to who is the fastest, who has the smallest transistors, and who has the cost advantage.",and then who uses more power (baby).,etc... etc... like it goes no where.,it always ends up being an e.p.,thing.,for me i totally don't care what i use.,i even still game on my nintendo 3ds (using 45nm technology) and it works great.,never crashes.,so back to your issue.,i believe it is a problem specific issue with your 3d rendering software.,please contact your vendor first and check with them.,they will likely have you do the following.,1. update your pc/laptop gpudrivers/bios/windows.,2. update your motherboard bios.,3. update your 3d vendor software (sometimes they issue hotfixes - don't use their latest software 2023 until the bugs are worked out).,i think that is pretty much it.,it might be an nvidia driver.,typically nvidia has much better support on their workstation level cards than their consumer level cards.,but it is not the cpu.,it should not be the cpu despite your experience switching from an intel system to an amd system.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it could be numerous things, faulty ram, issues or compatibility issues with your motherboard, bad drivers, etc.",as for performance you'd need to specify which ryzen 5 cpu you have and which intel one you are looking at.,"because for example the i5-12600k is like 50% faster than an r5 5600x in rendering, and an i5-12400 is like 30% faster than an old r5 3600x but a i5-12400 is fairly even with a  r5 5600x.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"lots of missing info here

- what 3d software is it?",- exactly what model of cpu do you have?,- what motherboard do you have?,- what ram kit do you have and are you running it at stock or rated speed (i.e.,"docp) 
- how do the crashes manifest, is it under load, only when loading files, something else?",- can you repeat the crash on the same file or is it random?,- have you tried ddu and then reinstalling your graphics drivers?,- do you get a blue screen or is it just the application?,- have you tried anything to get the crashes to stop?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

can you force the monitor to a lower refresh rate (like 60hz) and see if the problem persists?,"also, note that intelâ€™s igpu capabilities are more limited on hdmi versus dp.",so what works on dp is not necessary possible on hdmi (even if it is on other cards).,"now that doesnâ€™t explain your issue with using the 760, but iâ€™m beginning to think you need to be running dp instead of hdmi.",hdmi is generally not ideal for high resolution/refresh rate applications.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you mentioned the second monitor using an adapter so i assumed you tried that on the main monitor and saw it was limited to 60hz.,displayport tends to have a larger variable refresh rate range than hdmi so it may actually not have the problem.,have you checked the intel software to see if dynamic refresh rate was enabled?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

linus tech tips video on the subject.,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azttf2gi55k

i feel into the same trap and got smr drives (unbeknownst to me) and used them in a raid 1. performance was nothing less than absolutely horrible.",even once i broke the raid array and used the drives as stand alone drives the performance is pretty darn terrible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in a just and consumer friendly world smr would be its own category.,if it can catch people completely off guard with the difference then maybe don't silently group it with a product that has performed in a consistent manner for 30 years.,"eg:  

""speed: nvme > sata ssd > hdd > smr""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you all for the answers !,now i know that the issue has nothing to do with the raid controller haha,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i predict those congressmen won't come to an agreement by the end of this year.,they are a total failure with zero understanding of how important domestic chip manufacturing is.,tsmc and samsung keep receiving huge subsidies from their respective governments.,intel will be better off moving on and focusing on europe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
who is holding it up?,and why is it being held up?,hopefully politicians aren't adding unnecessary unrelated garbage to the bill.,and this shit needs to happen yesterday.,we need them made here not only for logistics purposes but also for geopolitical purposes.,this isn't yesteryear.,these chips are not just for consumer luxury.,there are very real national security concerns with this stuff now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"guessing these tech companies don't pay the politicians quite as much as oil, guns and telecoms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

screw intel.,"the customers want the factories here, let them use the same free market that they used to justify exporting their factories in the first place.",everyone should be switching to a flavor of arm anyways.,intel shot itself in the foot with their behavior.,same as nvidia.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

>so he wants a chunk of the 52 billion subsidy or he's taking his ball and is gonna go play in europe?,"fuck you dude, do it then.",you want to lose the semiconductor industry?,that's how you do it.,literally every other nation in the world offers significant subsidies for the semiconductor industry.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">how about you break ground, and get going on your project to show good faith to show you are willing to invest in usa made semiconductors?","look at their oregon and arizona fabs

intel has made chips in us for decades now

the one in oregon is the one that gets the latest nodes

">let them use the same free market that they used to justify exporting their factories in the first place

intel still has fabs in oregon and arizona

the one in oregon is the one that gets the latest nodes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the government want chip fabs in the us.,intel and other chip makers wonâ€™t bother without incentives.,how these incentives should look like is the only question worth entertaining.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you realize intel's new business model allows its foundry services to manufacture arm chips, right?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"judging by sifive's series c, i would say intel has future plans there as well...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hmmmm...according to that article it seems like there are *extremely* large spending provisions unrelated to semiconductors also trying to be added to the overall bill and that's why mitch and other republicans are taking issue with it.,the article mentions that it's also possible to simply pass the legislation without the spending stuff.,so politics as usual.,"but it seems the issue is a lot more nuanced than ""republicans like mitch.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"usa already ""lost"" the semiconductor industry and personally don't want to see it comeback as envisioned so far.","i'm also tired of intel mascarading as an american company when so much of it's chip design work is done outside the u.s. (shoutouts to all the hard workers at penang, bangalore, and haifa)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what intel were  doing with all these profits??,buy back scam and enrich executives and shareholders?,do usa is a socialist democracy ?,"i donâ€™t want my tax $ to intel, instead all vendors needs to be  distributed to create competition and eco system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel built a fab shell in texas and walked away, which lead to arizona having as many fabs as they do.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you missed the point, they made us vulnerable to disruptions in asia by outsourcing for no reason other than extreme greed.",they chose this on purpose and should be blamed.,"everyone should be happy with the rise of arm, which is also why nvidia tried to buy it to kill it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then let chinese companies do it.,we do not need intel and their games.,they outsourced originally and now wants to be paid to insource.,they can't just be happy with the chip sales themselves.,intel and nvidia are bad actors in the industry and are only offering to do anything because fear that someone else will do it if they don't.,so call their bluff and encourage others to do it who won't complain like intel is doing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so?,the competition is the only thing steering them into any kind of honesty.,"a third party is safer with arm, intel lost trust just like nvidia with their shenanigans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's not arm.,it's risc-v,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is part of my point.,"an ""american"" company that won't use its (compared to any competition) nearly boundless resources unless they get extra money for bonuses from the taxpayers of america.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sure, then just dont cry about intel leaving us when it leaves us",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
happy for your tax $'s go to oil and military companies instead?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean was texas offering big bucks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>they made us vulnerable to disruptions in asia by outsourcing for no reason other than extreme greed.,"companies in general, yes

but intel still has fabs and r&d in us

>which is also why nvidia tried to buy it to kill it.","ah yes, somebody that is not intel spending >$40 billion to kill arm",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what exactly did intel do that was dishonest?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they where and then they tried to reduce the amount after intel started building the fab, they also left a office building in austin half built.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
move manufacturing out of the country over decades and then demand free money for insourcing during a time when customers are demanding the insourcing so intel has to do it themselves for their own customers.,this is just the latest in anti-customer behavior.,"you know everything from history the same as everyone else, playing dumb is dumb.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
who else manufactures inside the us besides intel?,global foundries?,gimme a break.,"if intel wants to make chips as cheap as other companies, it has to manufacture overseas.","this isn't ""anti-consiner"" behavior at all.","you're just attributing random things as ""anti-consumer.""","basically, ""the ceo eats chicken?!","anti-consumer!!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well that is pure ignorance, you have access to google.","but the issue isn't what is already here, the issue is new chip fabs to insource what was outsourced over the years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i work at intel and am leaving for another fab in 2 weeks.,i know how this works.,the reason things are outsourced is because insourcing is expensive.,"for tsmc and samsung, 90% of their chips are made outside of the us.",there's a reason for that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is it expensive because of a lack of us subsidy money?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"subsidy doesn't make it less expensive, it just changes who pays the cost",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a contract is a contract and intel will make their money back regardless of whether the mining units actually sell or not.,intel is just shipping out the unit according to the original schedule just as promised.,"as far as intel is concerned, this just *a time* and not the best or the worst.",that second last paragraph in the article is complete bs tho.,"yeah asics are more efficient than gpus at sha-256, but this is an apples to oranges comparison in mining terms.",they exist in separate markets mining different coins and don't compete.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yo, where can i buy some of those",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yup, intel already locked in pricing and confirmed orders for this bitcoin asics.","it was in their disclosure, but they didn't say what the prices were, though the contract happened like 6 months ago so the prices should be high.","so they will definitely get their money back on r&d and then some, but it likely won't be a long term venture like they hoped, assuming the companies don't renew the contracts when they expire in a few years",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the last part is intel's fault, they made a point of explicitly mentioning the asic vs. gpu comparison [directly in their pr materials](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/opinion/thoughts-blockchain-custom-compute-group.html) and it's just been mindlessly rolled into every article mention ever since.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

one million dollars per slice?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol what?,those are the numbers from apple slides.,and don't forget about cost.,m1 ultra is 800mmâ² of n5 silicon that uses expensive 2.5d packaging and expensive memory too.,it's not some magic/quantum level technology or seismic shift.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's a soc, so it's not really directly comparable.","in any case, the m1 is impressive for productivity work.",not much else though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
apple cpu are joke compared to intel/amd.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel, amd and nvidia are all ahead of apple in pure performance when you compare products in the same weight class, like the m1 ultra is in a device that starts at $4,000, you can build a 12900k+3080 rig for around half the cost.",the m1 ultra has to compete with threadripper and intels hedt coming in a few months.,"the biggest advantage apple has is efficiency, but in terms of performance or price to performance, they are behind.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"looks like in terms of power intel not gonna catchup , because i arm uses less power than x86,but in terms of processing power its already ahead in many things
but due to apple ,intel will gonna release its next generation cpu in early 2023",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
meteor lake will end that debate next year.,"and from there it will be interesting to see if apple  (who relies on tsmc) can keep up with intel 3, intel 20a, intel 18a and beyond.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the apple m1 ultra is also incredibly expensive at a whopping 114 billion transistors.,2 dies each with 432mm2 of area for 864mm2 of expensive 5nm silicon.,12900k is 210mm2 and the rtx3090 is 630mm2.,only 28billion transistors on the 3090 too.,"so despite both intel and nvidia using older and cheaper nodes, they still use less silicon than the m1 ultra.",then there is the fact that alderlake scales super well to low power.,those e cores are highly efficient.,"at 35w instead of 241w, the 12900k only loses 50% of its performance.",50% performance for 1/7th power is almost a 4x efficiency increase.,apple does this because they donâ€™t need to sell the cpu for a profit.,itâ€™s just a component of their product.,"amd and intel do have to sell the processor for profit, so they will sacrifice efficiency to ramp up clockspeeds to create maximum performance for as little silicon as possible.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"don't make me laugh, apple cpu are joke like i said 100 times.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"an m1 ultra based system also starts at $4000, youâ€™re paying for that level of performance as well even though they did integrate it all onto an soc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on use case.,for gaming intel and amd will crush it; but it doesn't really matter because apple is targeting productivity performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the m1 is faster than a 3080 /s,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"barelyâ€¦
the only major differences between x86 and arm is the decoder.",and thatâ€™s a small tiny fraction of the power usage.,almost all the difference is due to design philosophies of companies designing the chips for various markets.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thanks for the detailed reply.,so there's difference between cpu model number (6xxx) and the internal architecture behind it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5000 series naming made sense.,it's because mobile was zen 2 and used ryzen 4000 naming.,but once they brought out ryzen 6000 for mobile; that's when it became apparent amd wanted to compete with intel's mobile naming schemes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they won't send same package and if you give cooler and manuals inside you won't get them back again,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they know whether the cpu is retail or tray based on the identifying marks ('serial number') on the cpu.,"so ce this was a warranty claim, they would've already collected enough info from you to know it's a retail cpu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

well you have no vrm cooling so i suppose that is normal for you?,its concerning that i have a high end b560 yet im still not reaching over 135w and my vrms are cold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thatâ€™s the point.,launch cinebench and examine your clock frequency.,"10700k is supposed to hit 4.7ghz all core turbo at stock settings, and pairing with b560 mobo cannot exceed that value.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"again, the k chip will be ignored by your motherboard, ask msi support why.",then look at 10700 performance.,your b560 torpedo ainâ€™t highend.,stick that 10700k on a z590 and put a decent cooler on it if you want itâ€™s max performance.,"it will get to 95c on an aio without issue if you overclock it, which in your case is removing power limit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i've never played beamng.drive but looking at some posts, the 20 threads of the 12700h would be more ideal for increasing the amount of cars in the game, as it favors increased threads over the performance of each thread, and skylake-type performance of the e-cores should be plenty for a car.","as for ram, for gaming they will perform similarly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

> i heard theres a substantial leap,

it is a substantial leap in raw performance at same power in benchmarks, it also uses a lot less power at same performance in benchmarks than 11th gen

therefore, it is a substantial leap in power efficiency in benchmarks

however, it is not a substantial leap in power under light use or idle, and apple still the leader there

so dont expect better battery life for the kind of work you are saying",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they have new performance cores for high intensity workloads and efficiency codes for low intensity workloads like opening a word document or watching youtube.,efficiency cores are slower but they draw way less power.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"theoretically gen 12 is faster with better power efficiency ,but i saw number of videos on youtube and read many people comments,then i came to know that when 12 gen uses performance core ,battery backup greatly affected,but in normal use when efficiency core works it gives good battery backup",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they are more powerful (specially multi core) but they are not better efficiency wise.,do not expect anything remotely close to apple soc for example.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think itâ€™s because at 4k your gpu matters most.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1% & 0.1% lows should be different,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and with a b660 board that supports bclk overclocking you will notice even less of a difference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your frame-pacing would beg to differ.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at 4k you're gpu bound.,even if the better cpu has the performance to run driver code faster and push more graphics api calls to the gpu it won't be able to complete them quick enough for that to show up in the framerate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"in my country 12100f was half the price of 12400f

i do a fair range of stuff on my pc but it's all fairly light.","basic 3d modeling for 3d printing, some programming and gaming.",12100f value shocked me.,what a little beast.,"don't see the need for the extra cores of 12400f yet, and i'm wondering if the next gen ""13400f"" will fit in my b660 motherboard?",would be a pretty awesome upgrade path for when i have more money,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why the i3 box is so much bigger,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what's the max all core speed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my brother bought the 12400f, it's so much better than my 8700 that costed me almost twice as much",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
come on man thatâ€™s a 4 core against a 10 (6 + 4) core one.,the frametimes and 1% lows will be better on the i5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"at 4k this result is kinda expected, i run elden ring on a 12600k and a rtx 3090. according to riva tuner (msi afterburner) the card sits around 90 to 95% usage while the cpu sits at 20%.",i have rock solid 60fps though.,the i3 12100f is plenty enough for most games currently at 4k and the best buy for budget builds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this is ofcourse tested with cod, apex and valorant with 3800 c14 memory and a 6900xt.",different games might have more of a difference,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wouldnâ€™t use a quad core for gaming personally.,do they work?,sure but give yourself some headroom with the i5.,you never know what else you might want to do with your pc.,"edit videos/photos, audio production, etc.",i have no doubt in the next 2-3 years more gaming developers will utilize more cores since eventually the masses will have a 6 cores or greater.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what gpu?,"i mean, if you are running 4k with something like a rtx 3050 you could be using even an i3 9100 and not notice a diference",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

looking at it for an emulation machine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, because the higher the resolution, the more the gpu matters.",thatâ€™s why there is no problem using a 12100f in games that donâ€™t use cpu much an play it in 4k.,the reason why u donâ€™t see it that often is that people that buy a 3080 ti can mostly also buy a highness gpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ah yes gaming 4k...zero standard.,means what ever a game dev wants it to mean.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tough little chip,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the higher the resolution, the higher the graphics load.","the higher the framerate, the higher the compute and graphics load.","cpu only really matters at higher fps levels for most games, so yes a 4c8t cpu is still fine in 2022 as long as you aren't chasing every last drop of fps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the i3 has always been a solid buy!,i put an i3-8100 + 5700xt in my gfs gaming box and the combo is great at 1080. games can easily go over 60 fps average in high-ultra presets with a cpu that's 4 generations old lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think people fail to understand this concept.,"at 4k, your gpu works harder, and your cpu the same.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not so.,"to push more framerates, you need better cpu, regardless of resolution.","combined with other cpu tasks the game does (mainly heavy hitters like ai, physics, all that stuff) you can have a situation where no matter what gpu you throw at it, you won't get any better performance.","in vr, which is well beyond 4k, with my 6700k i seen absolutely no difference changing from a gtx 1070 to a 3080ti, especially with sim racing.","was 5-7 cars on track with me before it would have my framerate from 90 to 45 on the 6700k, no matter what graphics settings or gpu 

changed cpu to 12700k and suddenly it's 30+ cars on track and gpu can then be put to work.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is what people fail to understand.,"most cpus now give the same average framerate, but 1% and 0.1% lows are drastically different on each one of them, and thatâ€™s what matters the most.",you can have the same fps but have more stutters and jiterry gameplay on a lower end cpu.,"hell, i went from i7 10700k to i9 10850k and even then i felt a bit of smoothness difference in games, then i checked benchmarks and i9 consistently provides +10fps on lows.",thatâ€™s probably why it feels a tad smoother.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
aren't all of them ddr5 though?,sort of defeats the purpose of choosing this cpu in the first place.,"i know msi supposedly was working on one, but i've yet to see it in the wild.",you could just get a d4 board and a 12400f instead for the same money if there are no d4 bclk boards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i would put most people on a 12400f to start.,there are definitely games that need 6 cores and the cost delta is so small.,if you want the most resell value get the k sku's though.,then your future upgrades cost less.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

they are called 12100 and 12600k",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeh i had a 6700k since it launched to this day, upgreaded to a 12900k and i didnt saw huge improvments, but games are smoother becuase less framerate drops, and also i dont have to disable all the shit i normaly run in background",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yea, but this causes the gou to bottleneck the computer and the cou doesn't get worked as hard.",at low resolution the cpu often becomes the bottleneck and it gets pushed to its limits.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can be framerate limited by either your gpu or your cpu.,"at higher resolutions, you're more likely to be framerate limited by your gpu, unless your gpu is a league above your cpu already.",(it also depends on the game),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you try the exact same game outside of vr?,"(lower resolution)

your 6700k was probably just already bottlenecking your 1070 lmao",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why are people down voting this?,this is my exact same experience but with flight sim il2:bos in vrâ€¦.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msi mortar max ddr4 is in the work and.should ship soon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the cpus will improve with the gpus but if anything i think at some point the software side of games will reach a limit.,as a programmer my thought is how much work could you possibly have to do software side in a game?,i mean sure as more powerful processors come out software engineers have found creative ways to make use of the extra power but eventually game engines will top out on how much cpu side code they need to run for most games.,i think the most intensive things run on the cpu nowadays are the physics engine and game ai.,with various libraries even those can be parallelized and moved to the gpu.,physx comes to mind but that's not cross platform so i wouldn't choose it.,"on the other hand, i don't see the graphics side doing that for a long time.","not until we hit photorealistic realtime rendering which is as anyone might guess a long, long ways off.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the 10100f, sure, but the 12100f is a full 40% faster (thanks to intel being idiots and not releasing an i3-11100f), and if the 3300x had actually existed the 10100f wouldâ€™ve been a day late and a dollar short.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to add to this, intel stopped providing stock coolers with the unlocked cpus with the launch of the 6700k, because most users were going to upgrade the cooler anyways, and removing the stock cooler helps with reducing overall package size and shipping costs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you can't enable avx-512 at all unless you have one of the old cpus.,"the old k cpus and possibly locked cpus can have it enabled in old bioses, but tbh avx 512 isnt really a reason to buy those cpus as it takes a lot more power to run that code, and usually you will end up being power or thermal throttled, reducing any gain you got with avx 512.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

still leaves the problem of cost though.,since i doubt they will be the cheapest b660 options.,i feel those boards are much more suitable for the 12400f.,where with oc you are essentially beating anything up until the 12600k.,"since the 12100f is all about making the cheapest setup possible, with retained decent performance levels.","and any cost added on the board side, just means you could have had a 12400f and a cheaper board instead.",while the 12100f with oc will beat out the 12400f in some cases.,more often than not another 2 cores will be better unless your use case is highly specific to st heavy games/workloads.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah, when the 10100 came out, 4c8t on an i3 for under 100 bucks, compared to 3 generations before, you had to pay like 3x the cost for a 4c8t cpu.","though, this is thanks to ryzen, otherwise the cpus would have beem priced way higher (confirmed by an intel engineer that the 6c 8th gen cpus would have been 500$+)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is kind of what i meant by the physics engine.",i feel like destructible environments and especially more realistic ones would need to account for a lot of things.,the way games have done it in the past has been somewhat simplistic.,like modelling how different materials break based on the force applied etc.,i think another one would be real time bullet physics.,the age of hit scan should be over given the computing power we have already.,but again a lot of this is parallel computing and would do better on the gpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which was a pointless refresh.,"intel arguably did the exact opposite of what they should have with rocket lake, which was actually a really solid ipc improvement that brought their dated 14nm process surprisingly close to zen 3 in performance, when it wasnâ€™t a complete firestorm (as we saw with the 11400 and 11600k).","refresh the 10900k at a lower price point and release an i3-11100 and i3-11100f, and you have a lineup that isnâ€™t all that exciting, but would at least be promising enough to call amd on their shit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
busted how?,"even if the os doesn't do it for you you can do it manually, literally just define what cores a thread can use",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"it's hard to know without additional information, but my best guess is as follows:

you're running a low power laptop cpu, and while idle, any tasks the cpu have to do involve one or few cores and don't take that long, so the clock speed can be high for the short period of time that takes.","while gaming, your system has to share power with the gpu, so the cpu has less to use for itself.","additionally, most games use multiple cores, so the lower power budget has to be spread further.","meanwhile, stress testing uses all available cores  and often uses instructions that consume lots of power for a given clock speed.","if this doesn't sound correct, please let us know which cpu you have, what program you're using to measure clock speed, how much power it's using while gaming/stress testing, and maybe even what programs you are using to stress test it.9

edit:  i saw you said you had a 10750h.",my newest best guess is that your laptop manufacturer or perhaps windows placed a particularly low power limit for your cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which cpu?,the 4.6 ghz clock you're seeing might be the single core turbo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
keep your laptop updated.,there are some bugs from certain mfrs.,that also bug out the cpu to 800 mhz all day.,a bios update can sometimes solve these perf issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if theres no apps open while you're afk, that could be why.",or the games you're playing are more reliant on the gpu or another pc part.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if it's not thermal limited it's power limited.,the cpu is designed to go up to 80+ w for a short period of time if thermals allow under load and then drop down to 35-45w depending on model.,after that it would drop to either the designated all core turbo or base frequency,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"thank you so much, i think this is the issue.",i s there any way i could increase the power limit on a locked cpu?,though i fear that would cause my cpu to thermal throttle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you can use throttlestop and try and force a higher power limit.,most likely the power limit is there to not cause the cpu and gpu to therma throttle when both under load.,also some laptops have ec enforced power limits built into the motherboard so you can't increase it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think there are some gaming laptops that have 2 power supplies but idk if one is used for cpu and the other is for gpu or not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sure, but we're talking about 2.1-2.3 ghz here.",i'd be surprised if it couldn't reach that with 45 watts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hmn alr ima do some research later about this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you talking about turbo boost power limits?,"if so, i did change it to unlimited and ran a stress test.","it helped with clock speeds, but now my cpu is thermal throttling, which isn't surprising, but it also said that i'm current throttling, not exactly sure what this means.","my best guess is that my iccmax limits are too low, but i can't change them so :\\",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"bro ,i choosed 1115g4 over 5300u which is quadcore cpu,since i was purchasing just for basic work ,like browsing ,watching movies i choosed i3 because of better single core performance

reason - a good base frequency of 3ghz upto 4.1 ghz on tubro

its single core performance is good ,it score 1250+ on cinebench benchmark

single core performance matters a lot like opening and closing of apps,basic task

but note that its very bad for heavy task ,like if you think you can play games in low settings then it will struggle a lot

if you buying i3 just for browsing or multimedia ,then its more than enough,it has uhd 620 which is capable of playing 4k smoothly offline or online ( around 40% usage,it means we still have some room left for future)
using from last 1 year ,i feel no problem,more than enough,jist remember to use ssd instead of hdd

i3 is weak for editing ,games but good for basic task
1115g4 is 20% than 5300u which is quadcore cpu in single core performance but 50% weaker in multicore performance (because of less core )

try to get i3 1125 which is a quadcore cpu,if you cant ,then you can definitely go for i3 1115g4

yep.,there are holes in case you wish to add a heatsink onto those modules and/or the chokes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"since it is locked, there is likely not much that you will be able to do in regards of unlocking the power limit.",that is what that measurement in xtu means.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you're current limit throttling you need to raise the current limits.,"you can do this regardless of cpu, although it's possible your bios may have disabled it.",download xtu and see if the current limits are locked.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ok, thanks for the information.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks for the suggestion, unfortunately since i have a locked cpu my current limits and iccmax limits are locked.","in fact, the only options that are available to me are turbo boost power limits and duration.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
these are which you should crank up to eleven.,"just put conductonaut on the cpu beforehand, so it can actually draw that much power and not fry itself.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"having a locking cpu does not matter, intel supports adjusting power and current limits on all consumer cpus from celerons and up.",if your power limits are locked it is because either your bios has disabled them or the vrms physically cannot go higher.,"sounds like you already downloaded xtu or throttlestop, but if not, confirm they're actually locked.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ok, then it must be my bios disabling them because i have already downloaded intel xtu and pretty much everything is greyed out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it is totally normal for 11900k in that test!,there are types of loads that exist that are very different from another.,you will never run into this type of thing in games.,"what you have here is the aida fpu test, and probably with combination of avx512 being enabled, which gives extra voltage.",even a 11700k at stock may throttle down in this test.,"you can test this by only choosing the fpu test, and run it with avx512 enabled and disabled and compare.","you do not have to disable it from bios, you can do it in preferences-> general settings inside system stability test for aida64.","the fpu test is spicy, with avx512 it is extra spicy.",maintaining 5.1 is only happening when using adaptive boost and not running huge loads.,all core boost for 11900k is more like 4800/4700 without adaptive boost.,also!,seems like your xmp for memory is not enabled and you are running 2133 memory speed.,will hold back gaming performance much more than having adaptive boost on or off.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think if you enable more than just 'fpu' it's actually using less power...?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well i could see it hitting thermal throttling with that voltage and wattage and that cooler even with all those 4 boxes ticked.,sure that one core at 111c is odd and aida not showing any throttling in graph despite it happening but other than that it seems plausible to me and i'd expect other non tuned 11900k to also get to throttling point or near with that cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the extra $100 gives you more p-cores, more cache and higher default boost speeds.",in my opinion yes this is worth it especially if you want the system to remain relevant as long as possible.,it's certainly not a rip off.,in this video you can see how much the extra cache helps alderlake performance.,"the fps boost from the cache is often overlooked and i would consider it far more than ""slight"" as mentioned by someone else in this thread and others.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwxmyundizy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, â€œonly gaming and workingâ€ kind of covers most intensive uses of a pc.",":) if your work involves any long processing, like video rendering, then i would go for the 12700k.","if your workloads are less intensive and gaming is your highest need, then the 12600k would be enough.","if youâ€™re not overclocking or planning to run super high speed memory, you could also consider the 12700.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that entire setup sounds great.,i'm a fan of asus boards so i always try to stick with them whenever possible.,i'd personally pass on the 12700k if i were just gaming and go for the 12600k.,"with that that said, i'd even more likely just go for a b660 and 12400f to save a bunch of money and still get outstanding performance.",all that money saved could just pay for another upgrade in 2 years that'll trounce the performance of what's available today.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not a big difference get the 126 it can do gaming great for years with a strong gpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

true.,"i'd take a 12700k and wait for the 14th gen, then when the time is right, sell mobo+cpu to upgrade to the next gen since i7 normally has better resale value.","this would be beneficial even for ddr5 (and better i/o connections, pcie 5.0 ssds, etc) because, by the time 14th gen releases, this whole upcoming next generation would be way more affordable, optimized, and well established.","is nice to mention that some z690 chipsets support pcie 5.0 (and even some b660 as the well-rounded and affordable tuf gaming b660m-plus d4), so you can save the money you would spend on 13th gen, and take an rtx 4000 series gpu.","the 12700k won't bottleneck it, and you can strategically wait for the best time to fully migrate to the new gen on the 14th.","so, i would stick the to 12th, wait for the 14th, and invest in the next gen gpus today.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

slight.,really depends on the price of the cpu and the budget.,there were none available when i bought my 12600k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"but hey, even the 12600k works on this strategy, if you're budget conscious today.","but 100\~150$ more today, will also translates in at least +100$ when you resell it (or more if you get a good deal), so +100$ for the next gen. it's an investiment, and of couse you gain the better performance along the way.","keep in mind that it ain't +150$ worth performance in gaming compared to 12600k to be honest, but still a handful % better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the other answer from saratoga is absolutely the correct answer for your question but might as well point you in the direction of some data anyway.,"computerbase's alder lake review (it's in german) has them testing their entire mt performance test suite on the 12900k with various combinations of:

- core counts: both 8+0 and 8+8

- power limits: 88w locked, 125w locked and stock (241w pl2)

>i dont care aboutmobile.,"that doesnt mean that efficiency doesnt matter more in mobile than it does in desktop

>but when a desktop chip with like 24+ cores use so much power my heatsink can't cool it then it becomes a problem.",then just dont buy that 24+ core chip.,"buy i3/i5 or r3/r5

also, power limits, bios settings exist

yea but why would that matter to me?,im not going to purchase mobile.,i am gonig to use desktop towards hedt end and thats what im looking for.,"mobile will be efficient but their clocks sucks, especially with locked bios/firmware that forces pl1 pl2 fk that.",laptop use to be great when we coudl put 9900ks in a laptop and modify heatsink but those days are gone.,need as much cores and as high frequency as possible while less power used.,"meteor lake sounds good but im worried about the frequency limit, i'd be happy with just 5ghz but even that might be too much to ask.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">mobile will be efficient but their clocks sucks,

suddenly clocks matter a lot when intel gets efficiency right

clocks and efficiency are mutually exclusive: you cant have both

8700k is still good.,no idea what kind of cpu cooler you have.,"could be maybe worth looking into/upgrading if cpu can't maintain boost, assuming the cooler mounting dimensions ard standard.",first thing i would check is the power supply.,z370 board looks ok but might be proprietary along with power supply.,it has the usual 24pin but there seems to be an extra 6 pin near the pcie slot.,might make it impossible or very difficult to upgrade which could limit your gpu options.,"if the psu only has a single 8pin pcie connector, you're probably looking at an rx6600xt/rtx3060ti upgrade max.",these would still be a decent upgrade over the 1070 but if your monitor can't do 1440p 120hz maybe you should just hold off and build from scratch when you're ready.,hp also cheaped out on ram a bit so that's some low hanging fruit.,"you could try overclocking the ram manually to 3200, there are guides for that, just takes time, tinkering and patience.","if that's too complicated, you could just replace the sticks you have with something faster but it's not the end of the world.",overall it looks like a decent gaming pc with some corners cut down.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"rough launch for sure, however i think linus is forgetting that the gpu driver rollback bug is present with amd gpus on win10 and 11 as well, so it's not really just an intel thing.","&#x200b;

multiple times with my 6900xt i had win11 rollback to an older driver, invalidate the radeon settings software, then install a new version of radeon settings that started by default, it was an awful experience and while it's not complex to turn off driver updates in windows, it also should not be necessary and is a nice feature for all other drivers on the system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm interested to see how will these work on linux.,"old intel igps work wonderfully with mesa, and very sadly, gpu compute on linux (outside of cuda) is basically nonexistant already, so you might not be missing to much.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i just canâ€™t see them fixing the drivers any time soon.,"theyâ€™ve been at this for a few years at this point, and thereâ€™s still a long way to go.","hopefully the face that theyâ€™ve launched these will allow them to get more information about issues, but even thenâ€¦",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the gpu rollback bug is windows fault.,he is saying that since you need a specific driver version to run handbreak.,that's how buggy intel's gpu driver atm.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had that amd driver issue with my 6800xt.,"windows kept rolling the drivers back to before the rdna2 launch effectively bricking my pc until i added a backup card to ddu 

i made some registry changes and now windows update canâ€™t update display drivers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have a laptop with no dedicated graphics, only i5-1035g1 and windows just keeps reinstalling my drivers.",i install the correct ones and 2 weeks later they are back again -_-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oneapi exists for intel cards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't think so.,"if they patch the drivers to get it stable, it seems to outperform nvidia and amd in the tasks its optimized for.",i think thats incredible for the first launch.,"sure, its no beat-all and has bugs for now, but when these are fixed its the right tool for a specific job.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that wasn't at all the point at all, if the only caveat was the performance they'd still be fine with it if it has it's niches where it shines.","and also, at the end of the video he does clearly says why intel are selling these even with the software being the way it is: because they need to get out ahead of next gen and the faster they get them out, the more widespread testing is there which'll help them figure out fixing things up for future generations.","software isn't easy, it takes time to flesh out a full ecosystem and a stable one at that, and linus is aware of that.","nobody expected perfection, their takeaway is just that even in the areas where the hardware should shine (relying on the hardware media encode fuctionality), the software is just in a really rough state.",and that **really** hurts - they can't even properly carve out that niche i mentionned earlier for themselves yet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they do.,"but with the chip shortage, it made more sense to sell higher end cards due to higher profit margins.",which is why the 3050 and 6400 where overprice given their performance.,"but with apus from amd like the phoenix point (zen4+rdna3) coming in 1h2023, we will likely see laptops and even some desktops that are â€˜entry levelâ€™ gaming to have integrated solutions rather than dedicated gpus.",likely there really wonâ€™t be a market for â€˜$150-200â€™ gpus and we will see intel with an integrated solution as well.,the entry level for dedicated graphics will be mid range card in the â€˜$250â€˜ range.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think/hope they will, since getting stable drivers out is really the make or break for this product line.","sure, as linus said, buyers are for now kind of beta-testers, but intel is behind this and has done massive investments.",i assume they'll get it fixed and have a smoother release with the next ones.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you also need specific unreleased version of handbreak, which isnâ€™t really intelâ€™s software problem.",these things happen when new hardware launches.,it takes time for software to support it properly.,i am a bit disappointed in intelâ€™s driver team however.,they should by now have more polished drivers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"right, i just think he should have made it clearer that the issue on the driver side is with windows.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, but that's a temporary problem imo.","sure - if you buy it today and want to start handbrake, it sucks.",i assume however this will be fixed by a driver release in a few weeks and handbrake will get it's nightly build with arc-support to stable soon.,"for a laptop that you use maybe 3-5 years, sucks atm but whatever",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"really imo ms should just have a feature to block specific types of driver updates exposed in the settings app, it's so lame to have to adjust registry settings and the like for something that should not be an issue in the first place.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"based on the color, they are more likely to be capacitors.",not 100% sure though.,capacitors are supposed to filter out lower frequency noises in the circuit so your cpu may still work without them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

der8auer had problems with the smd components in the bottom.,you have marked the components at the side.,you could also check what values the other smd-components have if they are 3 times the same you could make a guess of the 4th being the same.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is a capacitor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not really sure from this image if green or grey, greyish color could indicate ferrite bead

this is a picture off google images lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably notâ€¦ didnâ€™t try though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just buy another cheapest 12th gen chip, bring them to phone shop and they will swap for you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i probably gonna buy a g7400 and move the component over.,i guess it probably will work.,they are at the same place and same color though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're a capacitor!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is dangerous advice since most of the smds are capacitors between positive and ground.,"since the vrms on a typical 12900k can supply something like 300a of current, just looking at the odds it's likely that shorting two random pads is going to result in a fire.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes but people still can want to delid them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can i have the 12100f...?,id be willing to figure out the repair ive done a few component level repairs before in order to get my brother's significant other a significant upgrade,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok thank you !,i already have the part tho !,the capacitor is still hanging ðÿ˜„,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"key word here is most, that's why i explicitly wrote if its ferrite bead then you could jump it otherwise don't

also no, traces going up to this pads there are too thin to start a fire, you could at worst get poof and a little smoke

well, its hard to start a fire even when silicon inside get shorted, i had few shorted laptop cpus and they just shattered inside from temperature increase, no fire just a little char on the surface",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well they have every right to brick their chips like op i guess,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

lol.,not sure why those little chip so fragile.,but it is easy fix.,good luck ðÿ˜š,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
op posted an update comment stating that he fixed it.,and not everyone who delids will brick their processor.,i never understand people who discourage others from doing something they want with little to no risk.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i am using ek 360mm aio also temperature is below 95c.,and my motherboard is gigabyte aorus  z690 pro ddr5 one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then i wouldnâ€™t worry about it.,"i used to obsess over finding out what was causing synthetic benchmark drops on my hardware (9900k/3080ti) with time spy and cinebench but i realized it was a fools errand, bios revisions and drivers and can swing things a bit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

cb r23 wouldn't pull 300w at stock clocks unless op has a defective cpu.,it has also been discussed in many forums that the small dot method is not optimal for lga 1700.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no 12900k at *intel defaults* should be hitting 95â„ƒ in cb r23.,the op stated they started at intel defaults and only overclocked to see if they could regain performance.,"agreed that an *overclocked* 12900k could easily hit 95â„ƒ on cb r23, but i have a tough time believing any overclocked alder lake chip hitting 95â„ƒ on cb r23 could be stable for most intense all core workloads outside of gaming; cb r23 is not intense and even just compressing a video with handbrake x265 is significantly more intense.","with that said, if someone is willfully optimizing for a specific game at the expense of stability, then that's cool, but people should also call that out in a community forum imo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i mean, people shouldn't generally be using software encoding in this day and age anyways... stock intel power limits on the 12900k are 241w sustained indefinitely, so depending on the cooler used, 95c at stock is quite possible.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

like do you need a new cpu at once?,what do you need a new one for?,are there certain programs you need to run that your current one canâ€™t run?,"i suggest that you should upgrade once windows 10 dies of end of support in 2025. not only do you save some money by maximizing out your current cpu, but when its time to buy a new cpu for windows 11, you will be glad to have the latest and greatest when it really matters.",thats what i am doing at least for me.,i rock a xeon x3450 which is a decade plus cpu and this is enough for me to get through computer engineering classes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you should wait for 14gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"really depends, super desperate or can easily wait october at the latest?",12700k a huge upgrade over your i5 6500 but raptor lake looks pretty good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why wait?,get a 12100 and upgrade to 13600. the performance will be better than any 12gen chip.,and use your curent gfx card until you can buy an rdna3/rtx4000 card ( if you are looking for something better than 3070 performance ).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
go for the 12100(f) or 12400(f) as a placeholder.,they're cheap and you'll still see a world of improvement compared to the 6500 in every imaginable way.,then you can eventually upgrade to the 13600k (6+8) or the 13700k(8+8) either as soon as they release or wait a bit and get them as the prices settle down some.,"both of them will most likely be faster in games than the 12900k/s, not to mention cheaper.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just upgraded from i7-6700k to i5-12600k and would recommend upgrading for sure.,you could also check if you need the i7 atm.,i pretty much just play on my pc and saw from benchmarks that i7 vs i5 gets about 10ish frames more in games so i saved the 160â‚¬ myself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i disagree with this advice, especially if they're a gamer.",most of the 13th gen performance gains will likely be from more ecores and they will need to wait until next spring for prices to come in line with what the 12th gen are sitting at right now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah iâ€™m kinda desperate iâ€™m having a vacation and really want to have fun with a new pc rather than waiting 3 months, iâ€™ll just go for it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not necessarily true as we have seen with ryzen 5 3600 which is even now higher priced than 2 years ago.,waiting does not always equal lower prices,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you think buying i3 12100 until 13700k releases is a good idea?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you should be fine with the i5.,i tested streaming at 1080p 60fps and had no problems.,10cores is plenty enough for this kind of use \^\^,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i mean the 12100 will violate a 6500 in any scenario and contrary to idiots that litter reddit especially, you dont need 12900k or even the 12700f for perfect gaming.","as testing has shown the 12100f has no difficulty maintaining a above 60fps average as well as 1% lows in any game to day with 4c/8 threads, in oart thanks to the ridiculous ipc of golden cove.","but it all depends on what you want to do with the system, is this strictly a gaming system with some university/office work, or is it a multitasking machine with stremaing as well as gaming?",in either case you will loose some value when trying to sell off the i3 but not that much i suppose depending on your region.,but do tell me your intended workload for this pc.,or feel free to dm me for any questions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
even for 2k gaming + streaming,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well iâ€™m really planning on some 4k/60 and 2k/144+ gaming and streaming of course also i want this new reg to hold up with me as long as possible i might be contradicting myself here if i go with something like the 12700k but i donâ€™t think the 13700k will give a big jump when compared to the 12700k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeap i'm gaming in 2k atm.,i have no problems in games like warzone and borderlands 3 while streaming \^\^,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in that case you can always wait for 13th gen to drop and then grab a alderlake 12600k+ a better gpu instead of stepping up a better cpu, its proven  the 12600k isn't far behind the best 12900k and 5800x3d results",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
basically nobody uses intel graphics.,"i doubt you'll get any advice, so just try it out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i googled it and intel hd 4000 and intel hd 2500 are the same generation, the hd 4000 is just for laptops.",i think it'll work,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"threads are threads

if the application can use them, it really can't tell that much a difference between the two 

for a 6p 8e cpu, blender will just see that there a 6x2 + 8 threads and make use of them interchangeably",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"p cores have higher ipc, clock speeds and power efficiency, e cores are just really small.",your system will automatically direct tasks to the appropriate core.,in multithreaded cases like blender youâ€™ll see your system utilize all your p and e cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
um... they are a single chip.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes they can work together,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,the 6 e-cores will 'assist' the 8 p-cores just as much as the p-cores 'assist' each other.,a core is a core.,"the 12700h will probably outperform the 6900hx considerably in just about every multi-threaded workload, including blender and ue5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for gaming, e cores are problematic.","they require the code to be aware of them and use them correctly, if the code is not up to standard, you will get terrible performance.","and likewise, if the code is good, the performance will increase.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so i can rest assured with an i7 12700h?,or will a ryzen 9 6900hx still be better for me?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i am sorry for being unclear, but i meant can both be allocated to the same task at the same time if the task is heavy enough",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pretty sure the windows scheduler is what handles this no?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 12700h should be fine for what youâ€™re doing but i havenâ€™t ever looked at comparisons between those chips.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's automatically done.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes they are,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think the answer to your question is no.,"the big and little cores are two types of cores, and both can run threads, but each thread only runs on one core at a time.",if it runs on a big core it'll run faster while a little core will run it slower.,does that answer your question?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
both the os and the app needs to know how to handle it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i know that the little cores are slower, but can they at least assist the big cores in doing a very heavy task when the big cores are filled to the brim, like in a complex blender scene, or will the application simply crash when that happens ?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's done by default.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"again i think the answer is no, but it could be yes depending on what you mean by assist.","they can ""assist"" the same as any other core can if the software supports it.",applications will never crash in those circumstances.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
check hwinfo for vrm temperatures (if are reported) and reset your bios.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

anyways thanks for the help.,i really aprreciate it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it will pass everything, as it's a stress test, base frequency in task manager can be reported incorrectly too, you can check cpu-z for information about owned cpu.","if after flashing new bios power draw is still reported incorrectly (350 w with abysmally low clocks), then motherboards circuitry is most likely busted.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"judging by the picture, it will increase power limits and therefore improve performance.",thatâ€™s not the same as unlocking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it will raise power limits and nothing else.,consider raising your bclk to 102.96 mhz for free extra performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have that motherboard.,"don't update the bios, it locks the power limit to 100 watts for whatewher reason.",you can't put a voltage offset higher than 50 mv too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

really?,which version are you on?,i'm on v14 and i can adjust pl1 and pl2 fine.,the voltage offset is locked as you say though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this is bios, it won't even know if you'd plug a vibrator or not, how is it supposed to know what did you mount on the cpu?",this is simply a preset that sets power limits and nothing else.,"it will add power consumption as raising bclk is raising clocks of cpu and ram, you do that in bios.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it locks power consumption to 100 watts with v26.,"although i have the b560m pro-e and not the one in the post, they look almost identical, so i assume the bioses are the same",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ah, that makes a bit more sense.","the pro-e has a weaker vrm and no vrm heatsinks, so they probably limited the power draw in order to prevent the vrm from becoming too hot.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, you're probably right.","i can't see vrm temperatures in xtu, though, so idk how hot they are.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the cpu will boost when you're doing something without overclocking.,4.2ghz isnt high frequency either it'll boost over 5.0ghz on its own if you have thermal headroom.,it's a hot cpu lol if your cooler isnt enough it'll get toasty.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this.,"when messing with windows power plans, ""high performance"" will set max cpu state to 100% when it's applicable (which is like all the time on a desktop since they have uninterrupted access to full power) whereas on a laptop that's on battery power, it will try to drop frequencies to help preserve battery life.","""balanced"" mode will allow peak turbo frequency under load, but will be much lower when at idle.","thermals do play a big part as well, so if op has a defective/failing aio pump it could also be causing ""lower than advertised"" boost clocks.",i remember when my cousin had to rma his 120mm nzxt kraken aio due to a bad pump.,poor guy was getting like 78-85â°c at idle (r7 3700x).,"now it's closer to 45-50â°c...i did try to tell him a 120mm was a bad choice for a 8c/16t cpu, even if it's only 65w tpd.",his temps aren't much different than when he was using the included wraith prism.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

interesting.,"my 12600k seemed to be out performing most of them, iâ€™m relatively new to cpu overclocking so iâ€™ll try some more tweaking.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"https://ibb.co/tzb4d05

here is my 12700k on a $65 cooler master aio",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 12600k will probably perform the same anyway (and for gaming i honestly think 12400f + 3080/6800 xt is the way to go).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5.0/4.0/4.4 ghz 12700k with 4000 mhz dual rank ram does almost 25k points in r23.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not bad.,you clearly have yours oc'd a bit more aggressive than me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12400f is a trap card with its system agent voltage lock.,"you will end up severly behind the 12600k, due to much lower ram frequency and lack of e-cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you my good sir.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is exactly what i've got: 12400+3080 12gb.,there is absolutely no profit in my case from having stronger cpu since i'm playing in 4k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™m running 5.0 p cores, 4.0 e cores, manual voltage to 1.35, and llc mode is set to 5. should i adjust anything else?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™ll have to disagree on that one, what you lose with the 12400f is maybe 400mhz of ram frequency from a decent oc at price parity (and even then, you could probably just tighten timings at 3200 instead), and while i think the 12600k is better value overall, gamers should always, always move up a gpu tier instead of a cpu tier.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and lower chace.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"set cache higher, try raising p cores, yeet ram frequency to the sky.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you give up anything above 3600 mhz (and actually have only a small chance of running 3600 mhz at all, let alone with dual rank kit) and even tightass timings on 3200 mhz will lose to xmp 3600 cl17 simply due to bandwidth limitation and going for faster ram by usual yield higher gains than overclocking the k skew https://youtu.be/amaz13-b7zu.","sadly, gamers nexus stick to the 3200 mhz cl14 ram and don't provide full picture, at least now at the end of ddr4 life they should, for the sake of comparison of difference between this and that.","you'll be bound by ram clock on 12400f so you'd obviously want to tighten timings, but on k skew you get higher clocks and you can still tighten timings, topped with cpu overclock and all of that sum up to a point, the 12400f lose rather big.","if intel didn't put this asking-to-be-sued ass move, the 12400f would be absolute banger, but they did and 12400f, while a good cpu, should only be recommended with a huge asterisk, because of the system agent voltage lock (it doesn't even let xmp raise it).","unless you plan to play 4k, 12600k and a good dual rank kit is the way to go for 144 hz screens, 1440p or 1080p.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most people upgrade gpu's more frequently than cpu/motherboard/ram so it really doesn't make sense for most people to bump up gpu when they'll probably replace that part first.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">gamers should always, always move up a gpu tier instead of a cpu tier.",or just do both...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah, the sa voltage lock is a typical moronic intel move, and itâ€™s why i think the 12400f is probably the third-worst alder lake chip, behind the 12900ks and 12900k.","the thing is that extra ram speed, beyond 3600 mhz, costs a ton of money anyway and doesnâ€™t add that much performance, so iâ€™m not sure itâ€™s all that much of a problem.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m speaking in the context of a new build.,"the problem is that above six cores gaming really doesnâ€™t scale that much, so even getting a 12900k doesnâ€™t really meaningfully â€œfuture-proofâ€ you when it comes to gaming.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sure, but like, if you have a limited budget, you canâ€™t really do that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it doesn't cost tons of money as it's granted with 3600 mhz kits of half decent quality (so not the bottom shelf), and it adds more performance than any cpu overclock you'd make.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's what people said in 2014. you don't need more then 4 cores 8 threads for gaming.,i bought a 5820k 6 cores 12 threads and later up upgraded to a 5960x 8 core 16 thread for 100usd on ebay.,still runs amazing and use it as a secondary pc.,can run any game at respectable fps.,unlike the recommended gaming cpu at the time and even ones after...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"all the gpus i had with that rig were 970, 1070, 1080 ti, 3070. 

couldn't have done that with the recommended gaming cpu at the time without severe bottlenecking",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you truly have a limited budget, messing with 12th gen and the need for a new mb are questionable to begin with.","you can grab 12700k cpus at microcenter for $340 anytime, or $320 with certain mb combos.",that's not particularly pricey for what you're getting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"youâ€™re not wrong, but weâ€™ve advanced *so far past* the days of the 7700k, and even the 5820k, that i donâ€™t believe insufficient multi-core for gaming will be a problem for quite a while.","the 12400f has *twice* the 5820kâ€™s multicore, and the same with the 7700k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the devs haven't utilized the 8 cores in consoles yet but will and demos like unreal already push 12900k to its limit.,"future engines will require more, 12400f isn't paired well with a 3080 or higher when a 12700k or 5800x3d can be had plus 3070 for similar money.","my point stands, gpu is king but it's also what most users can resell and upgrade.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"""pump"" is the other 120mm fan that came with the cooler pushing air out of the cooler towards the rear case fan.",sys1 is the rear case fan for some reason it didn't even spin when i first hooked up the pc so i unplugged it (it's the only fan that is a 3-pin) and plugged it where the other pin is empty and it worked... just once so i unplugged it again and plugged it just like the first time and now it works but not before messing around in the bios so i might've changed something i wasn't supposed to and that's why its slow compared to the others ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ipa is a preferable choice, just don't let yourself get ripped off and buy a big bottle somewhere on the internet.",e-cores hitting 80 c gives insight on a terrible pressure on the ihs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"okay, a couple thoughts:

1) you might want to look at the fan curves that are configured for cpu and pump and make sure theyâ€™re the same.",looks right now theyâ€™re different.,"2) the rear exhaust fan is fairly important, and right now itâ€™s not being controlled for speed.","if itâ€™s a 140mm fan thatâ€™s a pretty low rpm for when the system is hot, and if itâ€™s 120mm thatâ€™s a near useless speed.",being 3 pin it wonâ€™t be pwm so you need to configure the header to â€œnormalâ€ or â€œstandardâ€ control instead of pwm.,"all headers might not have that option, so you may need to move it to another.",you might want to consider upgrading that to a pwm fan.,"3) other than the rear exhaust, are all the other fans set up as intake?",theyâ€™re not being speed controlled either.,"although having them at full rpm certainly wonâ€™t hurt temperatures, once the system is managing its thermals better they should be able to ramp down on cooler temperatures for reduced noise.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1)how do i do that, seriously i go into the fan section in the bios but then i don't know what i'm looking at or ho to change it (and you are right the pump fan never changes it's always ~2100rpm)
2)what do mean configure the header to â€œnormalâ€, you mean the fan itself might have some sort of speed knob i could ramp up ?","3) the 3 front fans the came with the case are intake, the 2 140mm fans that i bought and put at the top are outtake and the rear fan is obviously outtake as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1) iâ€™m afraid iâ€™m not familiar with msiâ€™s bios, but basically you can configure a fanâ€™s rpm behavior by adjusting whatâ€™s controlling it (ie cpu temperature or system temperature or vrm temperature) and then several temperature / rpm points for min/mid/max.","2) 4-pin fans are controlled by pwm, which is a signal on the 4th pin that tells the fan what duty cycle it should be at.","3 pin or 2 pin fans are voltage controlled by the motherboard, and if this setting is wrong the fan wonâ€™t work right.",3) are all the case fans 140mm?,"while front/bottom intake and top/rear exhaust is correct, 3 in and 3 out isnâ€™t an ideal positive airflow setup unless you reduce the 3 exhaust rpms to compensate.",i likely wouldnâ€™t have bothered with the top two.,three intakes and one properly controlled output would likely be fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

currently testing with a 12600k with no dgpu.,it can install windows 11 with no issues (secure boot + ftpm).,"https://imgur.com/a/nvbxjkp  
the performance difference is rather simple to explain: dasharo is using intel specified power limits.","pl1 and pl2 are 125w/150w, respectively.","when using msi stock firmware, loading default options put it in water cooling mode (i don't know if with non-k like phoronix 12400 it works the same way).","boxed cooler pl1 241w pl2 241w current limit 280a  
tower air cooler pl1 288w pl2 288w current limit 512a  
water cooler pl1 4096w pl2 4096w current limit 512a  
  
so by default, your power limiters are essencially unlimited.",and even the lowest boxed cooler option would put it at 241w/241w - you would need to manually input 125w/150w to make the comparison fair.,"that is part of the set of tricks that is used to cheat in motherboard performance differences ( https://www.gamersnexus.net/guides/3385-cheating-or-optimized-z390-motherboard-bclk-comparison ), whereas dasharo is plain, dull, stock.","techpowerup reviewed a 12900k with different power limiters ( https://www.techpowerup.com/review/intel-core-i9-12900k-alder-lake-tested-at-various-power-limits/2.html ) and the difference between 125w/241w vs 241w/241w was around 8%, which would be around the performance deficit i see in the 12600k.","there are certain features which after confirming with 3mdeb i know that are or aren't enabled:  
  
intel xtu on windows reports than the platform doesn't support overclocking, so software overclock is currently impossible.",resizeable bar is theorically supported but not enabled because they don't have any compatible card in the lab to actually test it.,"hpet is supposedly disabled by default, but i didn't checked this one myself.","there seems to be a featured called tme (total memory encryption) that is partially enabled, but seems misconfigured.","it is supposed to carry a performance penalty if actually used, and for comparison, it is disabled on msi stock firmware:  
  
x86/tme: enabled by bios  
x86/tme: unknown policy is active: 0x2  
x86/mktme: no known encryption algorithm is supported: 0x4  
x86/mktme: enabled by bios  
x86/mktme: 15 keyids available  
  
i tested dpc latency on dasharo with latencymon but didn't compared it to stock firmware.",and it is rather hard to test consistently.,"on idle, it seems to hovers from 10-30 microseconds.","a few days ago there was an user that reported on chat support channel that his geforce 3050 ti made his computer to not post if secure boot was enabled (which it is by default, so you can get yourself bricked if you're using a f processor and don't have another dgpu to get video output).",no idea why this happens since for other users dgpu worked with no need to add custom certificates.,i'm going to test a radeon 5600xt next.,there is something really off about certain post/boot times.,"i used an usb flash drive made with ventoy to have multiple isos on it, and there is a strange 10-15 seconds delay from loading ventoy boot loader before getting arch linux or ubuntu one.",this is instant on msi stock firmware.,phoronix also reports a systemd total boot time (test: kernel) that is more than two times slower than msi stock.,"that is literally the only obscene bug i found, the other one is where the post slowed down to a 5x slower crawl after a warm reset while booting w11 install iso which i didn't tried to reproduce, but fixed after a power cycle.","edit: also, a fair warning: while a clean w11 install works, i didn't tested anything related to migrating activation status.",i used the dasharo generic binary which uses a placeholder serial number.,"there are instructions to migrate the msi firmware serial number and uuid to dasharo, but they are too complex and decided to omit doing that.","anything involving keys stored in the ftpm is also not migrated, so if you use, say, bitlocker, you must likely going to lock yourself out of that disk.","due to the fact that most interesed users and the developers are linux users, and i have no first hand experience with some windows features, there is a lack of experience dealing with possible issues.","so if you're not doing a clean install, i suggest to wait for someone that test this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
didn't know coreboot was running on modern systems these days.,"last time i messed with it in 2017, it was barely stable on a t520.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"out of curiosity, why are you even interested in coreboot if you run windows?",most people who are interested in coreboot are drawn to it from an ideological perspective (wanting their systems to use as little proprietary software as possible) so they'd be running gnu/linux as their os.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks to google this works on basically all intel platforms, it's just motherboard manufacturers that don't support it.",but there's laptop manufacturers like system76 that support coreboot on intel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"have fun: https://zirblazer.github.io/htmlfiles/coreboot.html?ver=123  
  
when i got interesed in making a build based around iommu for virtualization with pci passthrough back in 2012/2013 (i wanted to make a gaming vm before doing so became cool), i noticed how bad firmware support in consumer hardware was for any feature that was not in the kit of your average windows user.","enabling intel vt-d or amd-vi required firmware support, but in most cases it was broken, and motherboard vendors didn't care to fix their stuff, which ended up forcing me to go proper workstation hardware: https://forums.anandtech.com/threads/lga-1150-haswell-motherboard-with-proper-vt-d-support.2326402/  
so i sweared revenge, and that got me interesed in coreboot.","if your average motherboard vendor doesn't care about fixing firmware issues and/or hides options that serve specific use cases for no reason, your two options are bios modding or purchasing another motherboard that has them.","thus, this is about decoupling motherboard from firmware, since an open source firmware would be able to provide long term support much better than a motherboard vendor where the lack of firmware features are a good reason to sell you a newer motherboard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm not sure if this is true.,it is more a perception then real research confirmed by hard data.,"let me give some examples, but i would not focus on people but use of coreboot and number of deployments:
* [siemens use coreboot for their cnc machines](https://ecc2017.com/talks/u4aqkbomzeakfg3m9cpeyw)
* google use coreboot for their chromebooks and use of those devices in [education is huge](https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/2020-chromebooks/)
* comexpress vendors like [kontron](https://doc.coreboot.org/mainboard/kontron/mal10.html) and [advantech](https://www.advantech.com/products/9b8b13db-5f8b-411e-b9ea-35d8a6d61402/bios/mod_deb1c22c-415f-449d-8c36-61e676d719cc) have their boards with coreboot as optional firmware
* laptop companies like purism, system76, novacustom and many others.",* qubes os devices are used not only for ideological purposes but also because better trustworthiness.,at some point airbus was looking for people with qubes os skills.,there are now only whistleblowers but also admins of big institution and security related companies using that systems.,qubes os hardware certification requires open-source firmware.,"* not saying about server or firewall market ([pc engines](https://pcengines.github.io/) or [protectli](https://docs.dasharo.com/variants/protectli_fw6/overview/)) - this is not about ideology, but about network security.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cool to see all these big companies use coreboot.,but what i meant by _people_ interested in coreboot was exactly that - end users/enthusiasts versus big companies.,"obviously google, siemens etc use coreboot for valid business reasons.",(though i'd say purism/system76 etc fall squarely within the foss enthusiast space since that's the demographic they cater to),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is the perception we want to change.,we want to show that open-source firmware brings value not only for privacy paranoid and libre crowd.,that perception to some extent blocks growth of open-source firmware.,coreboot is used successfully not only by mentioned groups but also by big business and eventually that cnc machine from siemens ends in hands of some customers and some engineers use it.,"maybe they are not aware of open-source firmware nature of it, but it does not matter to them much.",probably the same thing is with chromebooks used by millions of children while learning.,"we want to change thinking that coreboot (or any other open-source firmware) is for hackers, reverse engineers, privacy conscious or free software enthusiasts.","open-source firmware can bring benefits to anyone including windows users, bsd users, gaming industry and graphics designers.",your comment sound like the only value of coreboot is its license.,it is very sad state of mind.,our plan is to prove that perception is not correct and open-source firmware has a lot to offer even if one would not know about license or ideology (if any) behind.,"unfortunately for now easiest way to advertise open-source firmware to users is foss related rhetoric, which i agree with, but as community we should work on changing that perception otherwise we will stay in the same place and industry will not innovate much in pre-os area.",one way would be to make open-source firmware competitive in all other areas in which for now it is challenging for various reasons.,"to make it competitive we cannot put it in pigeonhole of foss rhetoric, but work on showing advantages in other areas e.g.","power efficiency, performance, total cost of ownership, long term support etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"could you elaborate on what benefits open source firmware brings, or could bring, other than being free from an ideological perspective?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it really depends who you are.,"some potential players:
* license is not only about ideology, some vendors or end users may prefere one license over another beacuse of various reasons.",not only ideology.,"good reference to resources explaining why can be found [here](https://opensource.org/faq#which-license)
* let's say i'm cnc operator or creator, what value open-source firmware brings?",i can avoid problematic smi (system management intterupts) which can destroy my project or cnc machine.,[this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq4xsipcweu) siemens presentation explains how that happen.,"* let's say i'm hyperscaler (google, facebook, amazon).",creation and design of servers is part of the way i'm bringing value to higher layers of ecosystem which is eventually paid by customers.,"if i can, thanks to open-source firmware, minimize downtime or mean time to fix critical bugs thanks to the fact that i'm controlling code for firmware i'm earning more moeny.",if i can earn more than i spent on firmware i'm already net positive.,"* if i'm national defence organization i would like to make sure nobody else control my low level software, because otherwise it can lead to compromise of important assets.","you can say, i'm not any of those and i don't care.",i'm regular user.,"well:
* open-source firmware can limit waste, because if old hardware just by firmware change can be improve to work more reliably, support modern hardware and fix old security bugs, then we using hardware longer.","which may be not to the best interest of hardware producers and their supply chains, but on the other side world is big and not everyone have to have access to most expensinve modern hardware and old hardware may be still good in certain situations.",* it can better communicate marketing value of firmware for end users.,"now it is not clear what was fixed in firmware, what works and how.",in setup menu we have manu options about wich it is hard to decide what they mean.,* better support.,if open-suource firmware project has thriving community support there would be better from vendor that has limited resources.,not saying that support can largely exceed regular platform life cycle.,"* in the same way it can protect us against supply chain issues, because we can reuse old hardware reuse instead of relying on new production why may be not so easy to push in some economical  and political conditions.",* we believe that with thriving ecosystem open-source firmware can be cheaper thank proprietary.,why?,less work duplication for basic features.,* open-source firmware can be better on targetting niches and vertical markets e.g.,"overclockers, gamers, audio/video processing experts, soho, wfh crowd etc., becuase in open-source firmware we can reuse code and focus on delivering value in vertical market and niches.","there are probably other benefits, but as i said it relies on who you are and how you use your systems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the ring runs at 3.6ghz with e-cores and 4.7ghz without e-cores which can lead to a higher vid.,and no e-cores means that vcore droops less and your p-cores would be supplied with a higher load vcore.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the e cores probably get assigned some background work that results in less work for the big cores, potentially saving power or at least spreading out the area heat is coming from.","also ring might get to higher frequency with atoma disabled, causing higher power usage",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
interesting observation.,"when you're measuring temps, which sensor are you using?",i assume the package temp?,"also, are you using windows 10 or 11?",have you tried a synthetic load?,"logically, it makes some sense that you would see higher temps on your p cores after disabling e cores, because that's sort of the whole point.",the e cores are supposed to remove some of the load from background tasks off of your p cores.,it's also worth considering that it may be due to [the die layout](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/fcvocnyxiainjhh?format=jpg&name=4096x4096).,"if you disable the e cores, you're putting the entire load on your p cores, which means those p cores are working harder, and the overall load is physically centered in one area of the die rather than spread out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

software name total war launcher

issuethree days after i installed an optional intel driver update on windows my motherboard was fried and had to be replaced.",i am curious is this could be a coincidence.,"when launching a total war game, the launcher pops up, appears to load for a moment, then stops.","30 seconds later the error ""launcher is taking longer than expected to start"" and i can wait another 30 seconds, or launch immediately.",sega support had me update my drivers but that didn't fix it.,"next, i tried downloading two ""optional driver"" updates from intel.","this fixed my issue, however 3 days later i got the bsod and the motherboard was fried.",a month later i get my computer back (i had geek squad coverage) and the issue with the launcher persists.,"the total war launcher provides features like mod management, so i would like to use it, but i want to know if it is possible that the intel driver update could have had fried the motherboard, or whether the times was coincidence.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

so i was able to get it working again.,i had to put the gpu in a different pc (older intel 6700k).,"it had some artifacts on the initial boot, but none of the subsequent boots after.",i was able to install the beta drivers.,i made sure to wait 3-4 minutes after they finished before clicking reboot.,"i think the process is taking longer than the gui would have you believe, and by immediately clicking reboot you're interrupting the process.",i was able to play no man's sky for about 30 min.,i then swapped it over to my 2700x pc that wasn't working and repeated the driver installation process.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's pretty bad when you brick a gpu by just installing the drivers...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, it seems to be there might be a problem with the chipset.","keep in mind that when using a mobile device, such as a laptop, everything is customized by the manufacturer of the computer, they can enable/disable bios settings as well as features and functions of the processor to comply with the functionality advertised for their products.",they also support the warranty support of your system.,"so, the next thing to do will be to get in contact directly with lenovo so they can do, if possible, a physical inspection of the device and, if necessary, provide the warranty options for this scenario.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

oh.,yeah i hit reboot immediately and killed the card.,"on the one hand i feel incredibly stupid, but on the other hand i didn't even know it was going to do a firmware update.",it shouldn't prompt you for a reboot right after installation if something like that is going to happen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yes, this is actually a very strange scenario.","you reported that the processor that you are working with is intel core i5-11400f, but you also mentioned that the model of your device is lenovo t560 3733, which is a laptop.","so yes, the best thing to do will be to get in contact directly with [lenovo support](https://support.lenovo.com/us/en) so they can clarify those details since they provide all the technical support related to the bios of the board.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you can stretch it the 12600k is better.,but the 12400f is also more than adequate if money is tight.,"you winâ€™t be disappointed with the 12400f, but the 12600k is better on both single and multithreaded stuff.",consider the 12600kf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you'll get a bigger upgrade getting a better gpu.,3600 is perfectly fine to hold out with until next gen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as others have said, there really is no reason to upgrade your system.",it's fine as it is.,"if you really want a better cpu, just stick a 5800x3d into your existing motherboard later down the year.",prices of it will drop quite a bit once zen 4 comes out.,"i know this is the intel subreddit, but considering you already have an am4 platform, that is the obvious choice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"youâ€™ll be fine at 1440p with the 3600, hold onto it for a few more years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or 5600x it's really cheap and a uplift.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i completely agree.,no point upgrading from a ryzen 5 3600 for gaming and schoolwork unless you have more money than you know what to do with.,you should be getting outstanding performance already with the r5 3600 combined with the 3060 ti.,"if you're feeling the itch to upgrade, then maybe consider turning that energy toward optimizing the settings you're using in your games.","if you're still getting mediocre performance then maybe it's something else like not having enough ram, or needing a faster, or even that you just need to pc reset your system and start fresh.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's not that much of an uplift over his existing 3600 imo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
true still better then a new platform for almost  same benefit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
current cpus are *amazing*.,itâ€™s the gpus that are horrible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12900k is a beast.,cpus were in stock at launch for 12th gen. in fact i remember people â€œscalping â€œ them thinking they were going to make bank like gpus but forgetting intel has their own fabs.,was sad and funny to see.,there should be plenty of 13th gen this fall.,cant speak for ryzen given they now must compete with nvdia for resources when nvdia went with samsung for 30 series.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"but its still recommended to wait for next gen cpus to launch

the next gen may have higher perf-per-$ than current gen",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the high-end cpus are very underwhelming.,the 5800x3d is fantastic for gaming but bad for anything else.,"meanwhile, the 12900ks is a joke.","next-gen cpus are really promising, with amd adding their cache technology to an actual good cpu.",hopefully intel can bring something exciting to the table as well to make up for the 12900ks.,that's why i wanna know a reasonable estimate for their timeframes.,"presumably intel will come before amd, but specifically when?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13900k says â€hold my thermal paste..â€,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh, definitely.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
about september-october 2022 for both of them.,and i think there are positives to be found here.,"the regular 12900k is arguably intelâ€™s best flagship ever, and nearly twice as fast as the 11900k in multithreading, the 12600k and 12700f are insane ten and twelve core beasts at $250-350, and the 12100f is basically a $100 8700k, maybe the first i3 thatâ€™s fully capable of driving most gpus out right now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">an actual good cpu

if these are your standards, maybe try waiting 10+ years for something that will suit you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what's with your intense hatred of intel?,12th gen is pretty cool stuff in my opinion.,"12900k is around 2x faster than the 5800x3d in multi core, and is just as good in gaming.",12600k defeats the 10900k from 2 gens ago with a price 150 dollars cheaper.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">the 5800x3d is fantastic for gaming but bad for anything else

if gaming isnt the *only* you would be doing, why are you waiting for rtx 40 series to launch?","also, buying 5950x, 12900ks, 12900k, maybe 5900x for *only* gaming is wasting money

i7/r7 is the absolute maximum you look at

>next-gen cpus are really promising, with amd adding their cache technology to an actual good cpu.","lol wut

amd added 3d vcache to 5800x, thats 5800x3d

5800x3d was unquestionably the best cpu in $400 segment if you look only at gaming",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah.,7260's were trash.,"7265's fixed the flaw, but only 8260's were truly reliable.","as long as your laptop doesn't have a bios lockout for branded wifi cards (cough, lenovo haswell and earlier) just grab an ax200 on amazon for 20 bucks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thx.,"it looks as though ax 210 is tri-band (2.4 ghz, 5 ghz, and 6 ghz - which i didn't even know was a thing).",is that correct?,and is the ax 210 newer than either the 7260 or 7265?,"i'd like to get it, but i don't want to waste time and money if possible.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 7260 is relatively ancient, while the ax210 is brand spanking new.",it basically marches with intel generations.,"7260 was 2013, and is 802.11ac wave 1

7265 was 2014 and a mild revision on 802.11ac wave 1

8260 was 2015, and the final revision of 802.11ac wave 1

9260 was 2017, and was 802.11ac wave 2 (much faster on 80mhz-width channels, introduced 160mhz channel width support as well)

ax200 was 2019

ax210 launched 2020, adding wifi 6e 6ghz band

i'd recommend the ax200 over the 210. the drivers are more mature and 6ghz band access points will be prohibitively expensive for years to come.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"12700k + z690-a pro ddr4, more expensive motherboards only bring swagger and no practical difference.",you can go for 12900k but if it's for gaming then you won't benefit much from this i9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just wait until 13th gen and zen 4; your cpu is still capable enough to tide you over for 3 months.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you could upgrade to an i9 9900k and use the same board if you find it cheap enough.,otherwise wouldn't bother until the new gen to see a significant increase in performance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8700k still plenty for an rtx 3080,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"appreciate the insight, that's currently where my mind is at too.",thanks for the reassurance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

my i7 7800x is still plenty for my 3080ti,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes it's cheaper but if that's the case what is the point of an ""upgrade"" from an i7 to an i5?",i bought my i9 for just over â£300 and i've seen it priced lower than that since.,"yes it's newer, but going from 6c/12t to 6c/12t is merely a sidegrade at best and somewhat pointless, the ipc may be faster but i doubt it's worth replacing for this reason.","so if you really was going to consider 12th gen, i wouldn't go for anything lower than the i7 because that's just a waste of money imo

op didn't state their motherboard but i doubt it's a ""b"" board where there is no overclocking, so your ""cheaper"" option isn't really better in this case.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but what about gpu-bound games (graphic heavy ones).,is the difference still noticeable?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
had an 7820x for 3 weeks back in 17. switched to coffee lake day 1 and it was so much better.,7820x couldn't feed the 1080ti lol.,draw crazy watt and reached tjmax in 1s after starting prime.,@ x62 kraken.,8700k never exceded 65 same aio.,x299 was a complete failure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 12400 is faster in st and matches the 9900k in mt.,it is in no way a side grade from a 8700k.,"you shouldn't compare cpus based on naming scheme and core counts alone, as ipc and cache are now making big improvements.",the 12400f+motherboard is also cheaper than a used 9900k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cpus have definitely made a huge leap in terms of performance but going from a more premium chip or a modern medium-tier chip definitely is a side grade in the long-term.,"and yes it is cheaper now but also means it will be worth less in a few years, if i was to sell an i9 9900k from what you have told me it holds more value than a newer ""faster"" cpu and motherboard combined.","but my main point is the 9900k was on option to simply swap cpus, but i wouldn't bother anything less than a 12700k for a build that holds a 3080 and 64gb ram, very unbalanced and losing its full potential",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the cpus that you listed all are supported by hyper-v. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/reference/hyper-v-requirements

you can pick whichever cpu you desire to run hyper-v it should not be an issue at all.",i believe firewalls/servers run on lesser hardware than i9 extreme enthusiast level chips.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"unlike most i have no issues recommending an 11th gen as i was running one for hyper v before i upgraded my system to a 12th gen.  if you are going to need more overall multicore performance go 10th, if you want individually faster vms go with 11th gen as it wins in single core.",the third option to argue would be go 12th gen like a 12700 and get a board that you can disable the e cores in bios.,if the e cores aren't available to the os you won't have issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think you should look long and hard at the software you plan on using to see if any of them benefit from avx-512 extensions on the 11th gen processor.,otherwise it would probably be wiser to go with the cheaper 10th gen part.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, never buy the 11900. never.",10900 beats it every single time.,go for 12th gen if necessary.,"and no, those things that 11900 has is mostly some power management tools.","if you have to have the 11th gen, then get the i7 11700. literally the same chip.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks for pointing me to what i sought to convince me, 

intel avx-512 can accelerate performance for workloads and use cases such as scientific simulations, financial analytics, artificial intelligence (ai)/deep learning, 3d modeling and analysis, image and audio/video processing, cryptography, and data compression.",intel avx-512 can also help data centers more efficiently use available storage resources.,"simply put, it accelerates storage functions, such as deduplication, encryption, compression, and decompression.",it accomplishes this by doubling the number of bits in the register from 256 to 512 (see an illustrative animation here).,"in fact, it calculates storage functions in half the time of the previous generation.","i am getting rid of a synology nas ds1520+ since it is now redendant in terms of speeds since dell 7090 micro supports raid5 connected through a 20 gbps usb 3.2 gen 2ã—2 in combination with i9-11900 i save â£500 by selling the nas ds1520+ since the os on the micro 7090 is ms server standard 2022. therefore, no need for nas as such when there are some great 5 x bays enclosure for less money and giving accesss to the storage space 5 t5 6 times faster and better for a network to share large files.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
agreed with getting the 10th generation over 11th generation.,"as much as i like 12th generation, op should be aware of the fact that hyper-v doesn't currently play nicely with e-cores.","unsure if a fix is coming, or if newer versions (and non-server editions / windows 11) supports it now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"don't buy any 1080p monitor unless you need 200+ fps in games

you may get around 60-90 fps on most games with your setup@1440p",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that depends entirely on the type of games you want to play.,"esport titles like csgo, valorant, overwatch, league of legends, dota all benefit from high refresh rate monitors.","singleplayer games are more enjoyable on higher settings, as far as eye candy goes.","as far as your gpu and cpu goes, it can handle 1440p no problems there at all.",a good compromise would be a 1440p 144hz monitor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1080p and 240hz is the way to go for higher games and fps.,a 1440p would be required if you are wanting a overall better looking game.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just as a side note, the cpu's theoretical performance doesn't really change much when increasing the resolution.",typically the maximum number of frames per second it can handle in any given situation is going to be the same regardless of resolution.,"however, the *gpu's* workload gets tougher as you increase pixel count, which means that you are more likely to hit gpu limits before you hit cpu limits as the resolution increases.",the 11400 + 3060 ti should work well at either 1080p or 1440p.,"if you are playing competitive games or just want more longevity at higher frame rates in single-player games, 1080p may be the better choice, but the 3060 ti can still game at 1440p so long as you keep your expectations for frame rates and settings in check.","take a look at this review:

https://www.techspot.com/review/2155-geforce-rtx-3060-ti/

as you can see, the 3060 ti is definitely capable of offering a good 1440p/60 fps experience in demanding aaa games (and of course higher in less-demanding games), though you will probably want to turn settings down in some games.","fwiw, i game at 1440p with a 2070 super, which is slightly weaker than a 3060 ti, and i find that i can still get a very nice experience in every game with the proper settings and a smartly-chosen frame cap.",>also unsure about hz should i go with 144hz or 240?,"once you have picked a resolution, buy the highest refresh rate you can afford so long as you are not compromising on other things that matter to you, such as color accuracy, brightness, etc.","all else being equal, and presuming you're using variable refresh rate, there is no downside to buying a higher refresh rate monitor.",100 fps will feel the same on a 144hz vrr monitor and a 240hz vrr monitor presuming all their other specs are the same.,all that buying a higher refresh rate does is raise your ceiling for the maximum frame rate you can actually use without experiencing screen tearing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it depends on your choice.,"if you are playing single-player games mostly, you must buy 1440p.","but if you are a competitive player, you must have a higher hertz rate and 1080p.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you easily differentiate between 30 and 60,60 amd 120 ,but you will find difficulty in differentiating between 120 and 144 ,so we can say we are approaching limit

but gamers still prefer 240 
if you are given 2 option 1080p with 240 hz and 1440p with 120 then it would be good to choose 1440p with 120 fps

people will use monitor atleast 5 years,and in 5 years 1080p will be same as 720p today

still its just an opinion",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the most likely explanation is the cooler isn't working correctly, likely with a partially or totally failed pump, and the cpu is throttling under loads to prevent damage, since 100c is the thermal throttle point.",a broken sensor is incredibly unlikely and if it happened would likely report nothing or a nonsensically high or low value rather than exactly at the point the cpu throttles to prevent damage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why do you want to switch to another similar processor anyways?,and why do you want to go to intel?,i am asking because i want to build a system with either the 5900x or the 12700 so i was wondering (sff build).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
alder lake isn't that far ahead.,"if you already have zen 3 then just hold out, it seems like amd might be bringing some new blood to am4, which could mean a drop-in upgrade for your system... intel is already leaving lga1700 after raptor lake.","if gaming performance is what you want, you want the 5800x3d, anyway...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

p cores are getting higher clock speeds plus few % per clock boost on raptorlake.,the big one is going to the successor to that.,"not meteorlake, because it won't have a k variant but arrowlake sometime in the first half of 2024 using intel 20a process and lion cove p cores and skymont e cores.",12th gen is a sidegrade though.,don't know why you would switch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

replace the stock fans on the cooler.,problem solved for half the cost.,"at the end of the day, its a 12900k, so expect heat.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is typical of most 360mm radiators.,"i recommend:  
make sure you get plenty of good thermal paste (mx-5)  
purchase a grizzly thermal contact frame  
try a push pull configuration with performing fans like phanteks t30-120 (3 fans for 90 $), nf-f12 industrialppc-3000 pwm or cheaper nf-p12 redux-1700 pwm, nf-a12x25 pwm, nf-f12 pwm chromax.black.swap.",otherwise i can recommend you upgrade to liquid freezer ii 420 ($ 120-160 depending on offers and rgb if you want) with grizzly's thermal contact frame ($ 40-50).,references: [https://youtu.be/ysb25vsnbqi](https://youtu.be/ysb25vsnbqi),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

u need a custom loop for the ks to not throttle.,upgrading to another aio won't make much difference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh wow so the asus rog strix lc ii 360 is so much better ?,ok then that's what i'm going for then.,thanks for letting me know,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that hasn't been my experience in hands-on use with the 12900ks.,i've seen it easily handle prime95 small ffts non-avx without any throttling when combined with a 360mm aio that's performing properly.,"with that said, the silicon quality of 12900ks chips varies significantly and i've also found one that performed bad enough that i considered it defective because it couldn't run prime95 small ffts at intel defaults without instantly crashing regardless of cooler.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>the h170i for me gave me a red triangle on initial installation on the lcd and i was not ever able to get the lcd working on it after hours of troubleshooting.,with the h170i i would be getting idle temps around 30 c and on cinebench r23 i would be getting temps around the low 90 c. i ended up getting the asus rog strix lc ii 360 which provided me with better temps (idle temps on the low 20's and low 70's on cinebench r23).,"just to give you another reference point, i am using a 12900ks at 5.2ghz p cores and 4.0ghz e cores and in cb23 i am hitting only mid 70s with my h170i elite.",if i were using lower clocks like 4.9ghz on a 12900k i would be seeing in the mid 50s c on all cores.,i would go with the corsair personally.,"[https://i.ibb.co/0s48vwl/screenshot-142.png](https://ibb.co/41v93dl)

for me the asus rog strix lc ii 360 provided with me better temps and i also had no issues controlling the rgb using  armoury crate which is the software from asus.,i really wanted the h170i to work since i love corsair products.,hopefully corsair can get these lines of aio fixed on the next revision.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"have you considered that the problem isn't with your h150i, but possibly that you're running into a problem with it not mounting properly to your alder lake cpu?",[this has been a common issue with the h150i and several other legacy coolers](https://hardforum.com/threads/my-12900k-reaches-85-c-during-rendering-at-22-c-ambient-temp.2016002/)... many of which are still currently being sold as lga 1700 compatible with upgrade kits but have poor lga 1700 performance even with said upgrade kits.,i ran into it myself and ended up moving from an h150i to an asus cooler like u/renegadexg because i didn't want to mess around with troubleshooting whatever issues corsair is currently going through.,the current asus aio's that out of the box support lga 1700 are excellent in my experience.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i see, i really like the h170i elite, just not sure if it fits in my case.",i have corsair h150i pro and i know the fan is bigger (140mm) and that's not a problem but is the lenght of the radiator longer too compared to something like h150i ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
agreed that there is a systemic problem with the corsair aios.,"no doubt some people have them working, but there are enough of us that had issues with them and switched to asus (or other) aios and immediately saw massive temp drops that it can't be a fluke.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you have any experience with ekwb ek 360mm elite d-rgb maybe ?,apparantly it's pretty good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,itâ€™s a much bigger cooler.,you need a big case to fit this cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i personally don't have any experience with ek cpu coolers even though i have heard good things about them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well its a laptop, what do you expect?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
first thing i would do is check to see if theres any dust in the system that could be hindering on the airflow or acting as an insulator.,"after cleaning your laptops insides and getting rid of all the dust, i would reapply thermal paste if the problem persists, and check on the functionality of the cooling fans to see if there isnt any problem with it.",">i tried rendering a video and it would hit 96 & 97.... it would go from 88 - 93 - 95 - 97 in a 5 second span and usually hover around the mid 90s...

does this mean that your computer would be at around 80 on idle?","if thats the case then thats pretty high, and a few things i know that would cause this would be either a virus or other apps running in the background.",i'd run a virus scan with malwarebytes and check task manager to see which programs could be using up a lot of resources.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
brand new system so no dust that i saw.,it's around 47-49 at idle.,"but the second i render/export a video, run a stress test , or start gaming.",it hits low to mid 90's ..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ah okay, well then idk what could be causing these temps.",do you have a warranty for your laptop?,"if you do, i would contact the seller and see if you could get a replacement if all other suggestions in the comments come to no avail",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"unbelievable, making radiator to not heat up inside of a pc prevents temperatures inside from rising.",":p. you should have included average power draw of cpu too though, temperatures difference seem like 80 w average.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
both look totally fine to me and the difference is not life changing.,on the other hand i would say for everyday usage the results are a bit flawed if you let the pump and fans run at 100% because you wouldn't do that normally while it can drastically change the results.,especially for the gpu it can make a huge difference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
additional data: fans 100%.,pump 100%.,same ambient temps (25c).,"there is another fan at the bottom in ""front"" configuration - 4 in total on supply, but 3 in ""top"" configuration on supply.",7 fans in sum.,"thus, we have more positive pressure in ""front"", and more negative pressure in ""top"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for sharing real data!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as with alwaysâ€¦ it depends heavily on case, airflow, and whether ur prioritizing the cpu or gpu temps based on the aforementioned variables.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1. those imo are within margen of error.,"2. push is should be superior to pull, we've seen plenty of test about this from gn and other guys, so test push-front vs push-top, not pull-front.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm looking for case for 420 freezer aio ?,can't put it inside corsair 400dd,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[made the 2nd part with prime small fft.,](https://www.reddit.com/r/intel/comments/vodmdg/for_those_who_interested_in_temperature/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the best thing you can do is get the heat out of the case.,"this means that if you have aio's for both the gpu and cpu, its best to exhaust from whichever one is using the most power.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to be fair these results have been done plenty of times, itâ€™s always a 1-3c worse delta for cpu and 1-3c better for other components, hardly anything worth worrying about.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"9w difference according to hwinfo, but i'd rather not believe those power draw values.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's why i show the build before/after.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no it's not, if you watch carefully, there is minimum difference btween both configurations, but with ome remark: pull config is more effective on higher rpms, while push config is better on low rpms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my setup is like that.,i have heat dissipators that warm up a lot.,"it doesn't make sense to blows cold wind on those heat dissipators.it's more logical to exhaust that heat with case coolers (i have 1x140mm and 2x120mm, all of them noctua industrial), but my aio ( arctic cooler freezer || 420 mm) radiator has a push and pull scheme to pull cold air into radiator  (through 3x140mm cheap aerocool shark) and push (the aio coolers) the hot air inside the case.",the airflow is completed then.,one thing miraculous for me was to undervolting my i9 12900kf in -.088 vcore.,it goes from 77c to 66c in 10 minutes of cinebench r23multi-core test.,"27500 pts for the stock vcore at 1,328v and 27456 pts for the undervolting (adaptive) 1.280v.",270w power for package against 181.5w.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i don't mean difference between top and front radiator placement, i meant average power draw of cpu during testing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nice,  modern components are pushed to the limit to get that tiny bit more performance.",when i pick up a next gen gpu i will likely be under volting because i am not a big fan of giant power usage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and it hurts the chip.,"i had the old amd fx-8150, and i ran it at 5ghz on a corsair aio, then an xspc waterblock, then a corsair h80i with noctuaâ€™s at 4.8, then she got finicky and i had to take her down to stock.","furthermore, most high-end hardware is so over-powered for most uses, high clocks are not so important anymore.","i remember ordering high-clock, high-cache xeons years ago (e7), and now rather basic kit is more than enough (for one use case).","high-end hardware seems less exciting these days, at least how i use it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i've got my four presets ranging from 255, 128, 32, 16. extrangely enough the first one is the one that's giving me more performance in games.","i've disabled turbo and set speedshift to 255 and called it ""battery"".. should have called it ""gaming"" haha.","but when working on daws the story changes, i usually pull the latest preset with speedshift up to 16.","&#x200b;

thanks for your time!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
255 should be pretty much 'never boosting'.,i.e.,0.8ghz.,"could it be dust buildup causing throttling (stutter), or if you don't have discrete gpus, low power limits, so limiting clock to minimum gives your igpu more power headroom?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

highest speed & lowest latency equals win win.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ram speed and latency are not going to be your bottleneck at 60 or even 90fps on modern cpu.,"the gpu or even your monitor will be (non freesync, low refresh etc).","at around 120fps you become bottlenecked by the memory performance of the cpu, either by bandwidth or round trip latency.","faster memory fixes those things, either a little or a lot, depending on how well you push.","zen 3 and higher tier alderlake skus (12700 and up) have enough l3 cache to mitigate unnecessary trips to ram, and the 5800x3d has so much it doesn't give a damn about memory top speed.","finally, 1% lows (the worse framerates that are visible)are stalls that happen during intense bottlenecks, and they tend to be impacted most by ram if cpu grunt is needed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so that won't cause any problems going past intels supported mt/s for the 12700k?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think i would be under the 120 fps hits.,and everything else i would chalk up to engine issues from the developer side.,but i have noticed issues since i do everything at 1440p and try to hit 144fps to keep high refresh rate with gsync.,ideally i'll follow the guide above and try to grab a 2x16 kit of c14 3600 and do some minor manual oc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"fps does not determine bottleneck origin at all, where'd you wound up with this?","""5800x3d has so much it doesn't give a damn about memory top speed.""",- this is just straight out lie.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, intels ram specification for cpus is for jedec full support, anything above is overclocking and you should aim for 3600 cl14 2x16 gb kit with what you have and simply set it to 4000 mhz.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's common sense.,"modern engines are not cpu limited between 60 and 90 fps (on newer architectures,  which we're talking about).",something unoptimized or a 1 off like flight simulator doesn't represent most modern gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so buying a 3600 kit at c14 is best since it's cheaper than a 4000 kit at c14.,then to manually overclock it 4000 correct?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's not at all common sense, it is entirely not true, [that video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amaz13-b7zu) is the first fastest normie-level video that debunks your part about fps dictating hardware specific bottleneck and this is [my vid](https://youtu.be/yhxe1sar-le?t=803) (for a contest, but don't mind about it) that also debunks it.","you are >not< going to get 10% of performance in skylines by upping core clock by 125 mhz and ram clock by 100 mhz, it's almost all memory timings related.",your claim is simply false.,"it does not work like this, fps does not determine hardware specific bottleneck, it's a resultant of multiple factors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,"you can also buy 3200 cl 14 kit, but you'll end up with noticeably higher timings, than what you'd get on 3600 c14 kit, or even not hit 4000 mhz at all, though the latter is highly doubtful.","for starters once you get the 3600 c14 kit you should just set system agent voltage to 1.25 v, vddq to 1.4 v, vdd to 1.45 v, 4000 mhz, gear 1, cas latency 15, trp 15, trcd 15, tras 32, trefi to 65000 and trfc to 320 with command rate of 2t, as these will be pretty much guaranteed to work flawlessly.","there >might< be a possibility you'd need to step down to 3900 mhz, i honestly think you will run 4k mhz easily with no issues.","this is basic set of timings for an average 3600 c14 b-die kit, just make sure to get 2x16 gb, not 2x8 gb.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wouldn't sell your current ram to do this upgrade.,"see if you can manually tighten the timings or increase the speed on your current kit, but price to performance, it's very hard to justify swapping out your already fine kit for one that's a bit better but won't yield much performance gains in games.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so you think you need 4ghz ddr4 cl16 for 60fps on zen 3 or alderlake?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for the thorough response.,so ideally i wanna buy a b die kit at 3600 c14.,and this won't have any issues with intels processors or not syncing issues?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's strongly justifiable due to much lower end latency he'll end up with, which will yield noticeable improvement over what he'd achieve with current garbage hynix kit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do i think you need these for 60 fps?,no.,i say your claims are wrong - and they are.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, not at all, make sure it works in gear 1 and you're golden.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"speaking of which, i did look at some b die kits.",but because lower latency kits are fewer and far between pricing seems all over the place.,i found kits of 4000 at c14 standard.,if i'm able to find kits like this for the same price.,this would be equivalent to 3600 c14 with a overclock right?,i agree with the user above but usually i sell my old parts to my friends and i agree that the latency increase would be noticeable on my end,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how about 90fps?,"do you need 4ghz cl16 for 90fps in the majority of today's games, on a zen 3 or alderlake cpu with 25mb or more of l3 cache?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
got it.,let's say i didn't want to do any manual overclocking and just run xmp.,what would be an optimized kit.,would a 3600 c14 kit be fine and make sure xmp is running gear 1?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"like for the same price, sure, else it's kind of a waste, unless you're going to overclock the snot out of them.","4000 c14 is higher bin than 3600 c14, same bin would be 4000 c16.","what's the most important is for you to get 2x16 gb kit, for the dual rank boost.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"man, fps does \_not\_ determine what is bottlenecking, give it up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it will be fine, but it will be much better when overclocked, even with the basic oc i presented.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i meant realistically i'd grab a 3600 c14 if the price is there compared to the rest.,but if they all check out the same (only checked a few rn) and 4000 c14 is there in terms of price.,then i may just grab that instead and xmp or oc that even further.,and yes ofc i will grab a 2x16 kit.,does the higher bin make a difference?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what do you think forces a game below 120/140fps when the gpu is not the bottleneck?,pure ipc?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in overclocking, yes.","guaranteed higher clocks and lower timings, though 3200 cl14 = 3600 cl16, 3600 cl14= 4000 cl16 in terms of bin quality.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if you have 144 hz monitor - yes, you should.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you could look into a 9900k which will fit that platform if they are cheap enough.,8 cores will last another couple years.,6 is still good now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"while ofc it depends on the games, users on the anno forums have posted a minimum frames uplift from 25 to 40 just between switching from a 10900k to 12900k in anno 1800.

my old 8400 and 3070 was maxxing at 80 fps on new world and tarkov with the lowest settings.,"on a new 12400 im atleast 100 fps on high or low settings in tarkov, and 120+ fps on high in new world.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what kind of frame rate are you getting?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it all depends on what frame rates you want.,if you want 144 @ 1440p then a new 12th gen cpu should get you there with the 3070 however if your happy with current performance then wait to raptor lake and re assess,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i went from 8700k oc'd to 5ghz to 12700k mildly oc'd, no regrets.",the 12700k + 3080 combo is perfect for 1440p gaming on 165hz monitors.,rarely if ever drop below 165fps now even with settings maxed out.,remember 5ghz on the 8700k doesn't compare to 5ghz on the 12700k.,drastic increases in both ipc and cache size makes a very large difference in single thread performance.,"edit: i like watching tv on my other monitor and the 8700k was struggling with stuttering while gaming, no issues now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you should get an amd 5700 or so as you'd need a new motherboard anyway.,"might as well get something that is power efficient, well priced and, very fast.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i use a 8700k.,it is completely usable.,if you feel like it is a bottleneck you can overclock it to ease it up a little bit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
absolutely !,9th gen i can accept.,no reason to have a 7th or 8th gen in 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's a 165hz but i locked the frame rate at 83fps (1/2  refresh rate),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for the cost of a used 9900k you can get a 12400 + mobo combo which will outperform it and be on a newer platform,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i am a little bit skeptical when buying second hand cpus, especially something like a 9900k",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wouldn't.,8700k and 9900k doesn't bring enough differences for the cost and hassle.,especially if your 8700k is oc'ed.,which can be easier to oc than 9900k if.,bonus easiness if you delid since it cools much better.,"factoring in the cost, a brand new 12400 would already outperform a 9900k even if you have to buy a new motherboard.",really no reason to upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
from what i saw my cpu runs at 50-60% usage so i don't think it's a problem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what cpu did you get?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends.,somewhere between 70-80 at ultra settings.,some games run at 100+ but they're locked at 83fps (1/2 refresh rate).,the majority of games are aaa so i don't need the high fps,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in general somewhere in the neighbourhood of 85fps.,in some games i get less than but i guess i can lower the settings a little bit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i hope next gen will be at around the same price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

and which games?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'll stay with this cpu then.,thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
am4 is a dead platform.,it makes no sense to get am4 now when you can get a b660+12400f for the same price.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in my country they're priced almost the same.,maybe a 10-20 euro difference,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you overclocked your cpu?,i'm asking because i tried an oc to 4.9ghz and i had some problems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i you're locking your framerate at 83hz you don't really need more cpu power.,it's when you're trying to push high framerates that a new cpu would benefit you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"you really shouldn't be, especially when it comes to a cpu.","this is by far the most robust component of any system and considering the money you would save not having to upgrade motherboard and possibly ram, it seems to me to be your most cost effective option.","i'm sure some people will tell you to go all out with 12th gen and if money is zero issue, then sure, go for it.",you will definitely see further advantages but i believe you would be happy with a 9900k.,it's a beautifully capable chip that would pair nicely with a 3070. good luck whatever you choose my friend!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cpus are the most lasting pc component.,take a look of people using old intel server cpus (xeons) that have been running 24/7 for more than 6 years.,"a gpu has more failures parts: memory, capacitors and whatnot and a lot of people don't think twice of buying them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2 extra cores does help in certain games and applications.,i would go so far as to say there.are.certain situations where a.9900k will outperform a 12400. just not benchmarks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for 1440p theres still improvement in the majority of games, but in most cases its less than 5 fps to minimum fps, but say you ever decide to get an ultrawide or 4k screen, everything will be gpu bound at that point.","i technically 'downgraded' from a 10900k to a 12600k for my new 4k rig, but theres nothing that the 10900k runs better at that resolution gaming wise, and the core performance was better.","but then again i like to keep my pc up to date, just that i decided i dont need any higher than an i5 now.","also in regards to that, even the 12400 would give a significant boost over an 8700k, but if you are happy with the current performance, then you would be better off waiting for a 13th gen in a few months, or even the series after that with the next die shrink.","the longer you can wait, the better the improvement you will get.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
got the 12700k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you need more fps, turn some of the settings down from ultra to the next lower step.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"on amd side it's going to cost more not just for the cpu but the board and ram, intel might end up looking like the budget option when compared.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the problems are quite minimal, i haven't had any issues yet with my 12600k in new or older games.","the only thing is that the e cores do little for gaming, unless you are running loads of background apps, but in that case its worthwhile considering that 13th gen will double the number of e cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it has some bumps along the way but which new idea/architecture doesn't right?,i know they are fixing things and optimizing others so maybe in raptor lake we should seeing some improvements.,i'm not saying alder lake is bad because is not but in your case i don't think worth it... 8700 still a good cpu and can keep up for couple more years especially with 3070.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iracing, acc, warzone, world of tanks so pretty much all cpu relying games.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes i did.,i am also not good at overclocking and i am leaning to overclock pc components so i used the preset that they have in asus motherboards,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"manual vcore 1.350 v

done",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mainly i play aaa games on high/ultra with rt on do i don't get high fps (like 100+ fps).,this way i don't stress the gpu so much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you very much for your advice.,i will have a look on the second market,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
one last note.,that 9900k would carry you another year or more until this intel process has more bugs ironed out giving you the option to go 13th gen or later.,i think it's a wonderful drop-in upgrade in your position.,that is all lol.,âœœï¸,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what resolution you play at?,i'm thinking about upgrading my current 8700k as well.,just not sure what to get.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the fps itself is fine for me, at least for now.",i thought this cpu is somehow holding back the gpu because it has a lower ipc and 4 pcie lanes are used by the ssd.,and also the cpu doesn't have pcie gen 4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i grimaced imagining how much the new amd are going to cost after seeing how much the 5800x3d cost.,"i have a very ailing 3700x pc that has the apparent widespread ""ftpm"" issue... it's very depressing spending a lot on a pc just to have games lag, stutter, and fps drop...

the ftpm bios fix venders released in may didn't end up fixing it, and myself and others noticed worst performance after the update...really trying to hold out for 13th gen but if stuff deteriorates more, or if it finally angers me enough to, i'm very close to just pulling the trigger on a 12400 and h670 ddr4 combo to ride out for a couple years, i'd imagine a 12400 would be fine for the rest of this console gen. the last intel i had was a 2600k i got as a cheap used upgrade when my initial 3570k 4c4t ran out of steam years ago on bf1 multiplayer nonetheless trying to stream and multitask.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i saw that almost if not really new idea had it's problems but after some iterations they worked really nice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'll give it a try when i get home.,thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why are you concerned about stressing the gpu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol what?,this is a first for me.,you're pretty much restricting your whole pc setup.,"from your monitor to cpu, and gpu.","if you're going to have lower fps due to higher demanding graphic options, then just leave it that way.",don't lock your framerate to 83hz.,"and if you ""don't like"" high fps, then there is no point for you to upgrade your cpu.","or have your current 3070, even for 1440p gaming.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i also upgraded from 8700k to 9900k and it was the best thing ever for my wife (who got the 8700k, upgrading from her old 2500k), but i really appreciated the extra speed too :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"9900k owner here, definitely one of the best purchases of my pc imo.",i own a 3080 and they compliment each other well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mind the tdp of a 9900k though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i play at 1440p.,i think an upgrade now would be pretty substantial,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as long as your hardware renders more fps when lowering graphical details and/or decreasing render resolution, it is mostly gpu bound or gpu limited.","if you are unsure, that's the way you can test if a cpu upgrade might increase performance or not, as it will give you a rough idea on whether your system is cpu or gpu limited.",of course those results will vary between games and are not the same for different hardware combinations.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in some cases the gpu gets as hot as 80c.,i don't know if it's ok for that card.,the one i had before (1060 6gb) never went pas 60-62c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm not the op but i don't like to stress the gpu either because then it heats up and fans get noisy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am really concerned about stressing the gpu.,in general i like to have a stable frame rate.,not stressing the gpu is a bonus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thinking about getting a z690 board and a 13700k.,i also have a 3090.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80c is fine.,above 100 is worrying.,but keep in mind most of these parts are rated for a fair bit over 100.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
change thermal paste.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you have good airflow in your case, it shouldnâ€™t be much of a problem.",i also always set a custom fan curve for my gpu thatâ€™s 10-20% higher than stock to prevent higher temps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there's literally no reason to be concerned about stressing the gpu, it will die regardless of your efforts and if it dies - you've got warranty anyway.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks a lot.,i thought it was i little bit too much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this gpu was bought like a month ago so i think it's not the case,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i know.,i just don't like to have fluctuations on the fps,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"might as well be the case, especially msi and gigabyte's thermal paste distribution on gpus tend to be abysmal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"140-110 fps fluctuation >> stable 83 fps, but it's me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i will give it a try later to see.,thanks for the idea,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wonder does the laptop have an ssd?,if not it could be that page file usage slowing the system to a crawl as it tries to swap in and out of memory for your game or other processes which could be why its not an immediate slowdown.,what games are you trying to play and have you checked your temps with 3rd party software such as hwinfo64?,btw the cpu being locked has nothing to do with the cpu downclocking to save power or save itself from overheating.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'd start with using ddu (display driver uninstaller) and installing gpu drivers again, the beta drivers to be precise.","it certainly is not thermal throttling, and while page file size and usage seems big, it would create stutter, not low performance if that was the case.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nope i don't have any ssd.,"it usually occurs playing any game like fifa 22, minecraft, etc.","but.. for few times, i force closed my game with alt+f4 and in throttlestop, i saw my temp above 90+",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, stutters are present in the gameplay and audio ngl.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i would argue then itâ€™s a combination of high temps, no free ram, a dual core processor and lack of an ssd.",just overall not a machine that is going to be very successful in playing games.,"upgrading your ram and your hdd to an ssd may help, but otherwise you may struggle to get any kind of acceptable performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this did not used to happen in the first few months after buying this computer.. anyways is there any possible fixes from within the computer rather than upgrading or something, its not really possible for me to upgrade this rn.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you could follow the other commenters advice and wipe your display drivers and install the beta ones, or you could also do a fresh install of windows to see if that alleviates the issue.",otherwise i'm not sure what else could be done short of upgrading or buying a new system.,you should be able to go to the manufactures page for your laptop and grab all the latest drivers from there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you run anti virus?,"you have something like core temps installed so you can see idle temps etc, maybe heat sink needs to be reseated.",did you move your computer recently anything that would jiggle it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

only difference is the f version lacks the igpu.,"even if you have a dgpu, an igpu can come in handy if something happens to your dgpu or maybe an issue pops up with pcie x16 slot.","if you already have a dgpu and don't care about having the igpu then the 12700f is perfectly fine, especially if there's a large enough price difference.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rule of thumb i never buy an f processor.,firstly their resale value if you decide to upgrade just sucks in comparison.,and secondly if your gpu dies and you need to debug things having an igpu is handy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12700f is 12700 with defective igpu that didn't pass stability tests and had been disabled.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

igpu = 12700 (with integrated graphics)

yes i wouldnt go for -f processor too but when i read in a link that the f one is higher in performance and the igpu is generally in laptop pcs then i was a bit confused even when i had watched comparasion videos so it doesnt make sense for me - it was why i would ask here to get help but otherwise yes the default one with non-f or with -k (overclock) should be the mose useful right?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yup and i was also more to the non-f,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i will go fot the default one without anything (non-f),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you have a dgpu, the dgpu will be used always regardless of whether you have an igpu or not, and the igpu will be idle (note: there are some software that allow you to use the igpu instead for some apps).","if you don't have a dgpu, your pc will use the igpu (if it has one), or it won't boot.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"normally the igpu is disabled when you plug a dgpu in, although you can just reenable it, years ago i plugged one monitor into my dgpu and one into my motherboard (igpu) to run dual monitor back when i was using my i5-6600 (my dgpu, like almost every other dgpu out there, only had 1 hdmi port, it was quite a while before i bought a displayport to hdmi adapter, back then neither if my monitors had a displayport connection).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yup i always get a k processor even though i don't overclock.,the k processors have better memory overclocking so you can use higher performance ram with them.,but if you are looking to upgrade i'd potentially try to wait out the 13th gen in novemberish.,i'll be upgrading my 12900k to a 13900k when they come out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as performance i see the non-k with integrated graphics is higher than the f one, that is true right?",i would actually go for the default one without non-k/f or both and i havenâ€™t overclocked before so i dont think i would have something to do that way either but you could learn how to do by watching yt videos i think?,so what i had in my mind and would go for was actually the 12700. the cpu i have right now is also non-k/f so the 12700 should be fine i think..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah, it still blows my mind that this is nowhere in the official specifications, and yet itâ€™s really the most meaningful number (and is certainly the number everyone will see the first time they run a benchmark).",and why do enthusiast review sites continue to mention or compare â€œbase frequencyâ€ as if thatâ€™s in any way useful to their readers?,"like, a 12700k has a p-core base frequency of 3.6ghz, but the 12700 is just 2.1ghz.",wow that 12700 must suck!,or maybe just turn off those arbitrary power limits.,"conversely, the 12600 has a base frequency of 3.3ghzâ€¦ so itâ€™s seemingly way faster than the 12700?","without knowing what that number actually means, itâ€™s more confusing than useful.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i find it bewildering that intel doesn't publish these all core frequencies and that most reviews don't mention them either.,"i located most of these through personal experience, reddit posts, and reviews.","these numbers aren't flashy like the single core max turbo boost numbers, but they're important to anyone doing creative work, rendering, compiling, etc with these processors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well my 12700 has all core boost 4.5ghz, now other users can help here with their info so you can complete table.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this chart makes me wonder what will intel do with the e core frequency for raptor lake.,"there is definitely room to increase clocks, but if they do it they essentially defeat the purpose of the e cores, which is die efficiency and to a lesser extent, power efficiency.",though a hypothetical 13900k running all p cores at 5.5 or so ghz and the e cores at ~4.5ghz would be huge.,multithreading monster.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thanks for this.,i have to look at reviews to know the stock frequencies.,"wish intel would just publish them with the specification, instead of just tvb or single core because they are higher numbers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you have the same table for raptor lake?,"edit:
bought 13700k: 5.3 p core all core/4.2 e core all core

"i run 5.5 p 4.3 e, sp103",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
completely agree.,i also think the all core frequency is a good indicator of the average silicon quality intel intends for you to get based on their binning as you go up and down the range.,"you obviously can play the silicon lottery and win a fantastic i5-12400, but intelâ€™s stock all core frequencies illustrate what they actually intend for you to get out of these chips when ran 100% flat out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>and why do enthusiast review sites continue to mention or compare â€œbase frequencyâ€ as if thatâ€™s in any way useful to their readers?,do they?,"anandtech, tomshardware, techpowerup,............. dont talk about base frequencies when reviewing cpus, at least iirc

- the speed of a cpu in a given task is roughly equivalent to ipc (instructions per clock) x cores used x clock speed (on all active cores).","the last two are easy to find on the product page (intel lists all-core boost explicitly on their product slides, and the all-core speed of amd chips is generally about 400mhz below the listed single-core boost clock), but the first requires more knowledge (you basically have to keep track of the generational ipc uplifts amd and intel list and multiply them together).","- laptop chips are always thermal throttling in one way or another, so the all-core turbo for them will vary from device to device.","- computers also usually have gpus, and there are similar ways of measuring the performance of those, but itâ€™s a bit harder.","in productivity workloads, the cpu is the primary driver of performance: in video workloads, itâ€™s the gpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

so let's be straight: the i9-12900k can be quite difficult to cool in certain workloads.,"i've tested 15 coolers with the i9-12900k, paired with a msi z690 a pro motherboard, and only 5 of them stay under tjmax in cinebench r23 testing.","as far as undervolting goes, what settings did you use?",i generally run a -0.1v offset on my 12900k.,but each chip will respond differently.,"start slowly, with something like -0.05v and slowly increase your offset.","if you see your scores dropping, the undervolt isn't stable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got up to 0.085 and after that it wasn't stable.,i would still be throttling 3 of the p cores at any point in between.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

then replace the gpu in 2/3 years and u are goood to go.",by that time prolly the i5 will hold u back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have just got the i5 12600k and it blasts through everything i do and is brilliant for gaming.,its very solid.,i upgraded it from a i7 9700k and i have seen a noticeable difference in everything do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12600k.,you can upgrade to raptor lake later if needed.,12700k only adds 2 p-cores and is only necessary if you are going to be streaming or other core-heavy workloads.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"13600k, we should be pretty close to launch.",that's the cpu i'm not eyeing at least.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12700f much better than the 12600k.,you are like me you keep stuff around for a long time.,get as much cpu as you can afford.,iâ€™ve been thinking about a 12900 myself weâ€™ll see.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on resolution.. but you will be fine with 12600k.. but that extra 2 cores on 12700k are sweet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"12600k no doubt, the gain from upgrading graphics card is much more visible than cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if youre going to keep this new one for another 7 years, do you really mind paying an extra 125 ?",i would def go for the i7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
either one would go just fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you want to hit the highest framerates, the extra cache and cores of the 12700k will come in useful.",but it all depends on what games you're playing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
idk i dont have money and intel left russia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thank you all for your help, so far i think i'll get a 12400 with a ddr5 b660 and upgrade the cpu when raptor lake comes out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12600k.,i just bought this with a msi edge z690 mobo an ddr5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you have zero reason (or stated reason) for 32gb of ram.,"16gb is still more than enough, and if you ever do have a reason to expand it, you can pay for another matching 16gb kit at that time.",(paying far less since ram prices go down over time.),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 12700f looks great.,"i was thinking about that motherboard also, but my current microatx is giving me a headache everytime i adjust something, so i promised myself to get a full size atx and higher end mobo this time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 12700f one is around 350â‚¬, the 12700 is 400â‚¬, and the 12400 is 215â‚¬.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12600 isn't the same as a 12600k.,"it lacks the e-cores so it performs a lot closer to the 12400, though it has the full 2 media engines on its igp which is why some people prefer it over the 12400.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i bought one of those gigabyte aorus z690 ultra lites for 150 and i think i'm gonna take a route like this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a 12600 is not the same as a 12600k.,there are no e cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i found that there is not a big price difference and it's probably better for resale value.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i find myself ram limited in some games, like tarkov and icarus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"then just get the atx version (b660 pro-a) and said 12700f (or non-f if the price difference is small, the igpu can be a life saviour for troubleshooting purposes)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
try for 12700 then you will be pleased with its performance and igpu has been huge saver for me unless you want to save some money.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think he meant the 12600k, and even if he didn't a 12400 is good enough for a 3060 ti",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if op is not on a severe budget, then why has he got a 3060ti?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you might just be vram limited, having to swap from gpu to system memory.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah it's the only one of the lineup where the non-k is drastically different than the k. if the 12600 was 6+4 it would be insane value at $230, it would still be better than the 5800x which costs 40% more.","there also in no 12600f, as the big reason to buy the 12600 over the 12400 is the 2 media engines for encoding, while the 12400 only has 1.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i not on a veeery severe budget, but it took some commitment to get it instead of the 3060. also the prices are horrible here, for example the 3080 starts around 1060â‚¬",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you could be right, but the games that i think about usually(but still rarely) freeze without gpu error logs and ram usage is constantly 15800mb.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you can remove power limits with b660.,"non-k cpus have a locked internal clockgen, so you would need a motherboard with an external clockgen to tune bclk.","they also have locked vccsa, which is problem for running ddr4 3600 and above.",both of these issues are specific to the cpu and not the chipset.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"pro-a, there's no practical difference between these two and audio in tomahawk still sucks hard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tomahawk i guess,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"depends on if you need wifi, really which ever is cheaper and spend the extra money elsewhere in they s",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would go with the tomahawk.,"mainly for aesthetics because if i can remember correctly, thereâ€™s not that much of a difference between the two.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i used to have a b550 tomahawk motherboard and not have a pro-a z690.,"the difference in weight between those two is amazing, the tomahawk is much heavier.","but still, the pro is the most recommended board because it does the job, it can run a 12900k without overheating and is as fast.",you will get less accessories in the box and the bios may lack some overclocking features.,"also, you will have wifi, better sound card, etc in the tomahawk.",it all depends if it worth the money for you but you will not see a difference in performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
both good i guess.,are you water cooling?,i am but regret not buying a water cooled mb for z690 as it would take a load of heat out of cpu package.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the tomahawk has a better vrm (16 phase/70 amp vs 14 phase/55 amp), better onboard audio (alc4080 vs alc897), and comes with wifi by default, which eats up some of the cost difference if you compare with the pro-a wifi version.","the pro-a is a great board, so if you donâ€™t need/want those features, itâ€™s a fine choice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is a wifi version of the pro a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sorry i shouldâ€™ve specified,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"don't get it for the wifi, but the much better bluetooth than a usb dongle can provide",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the pro a is $60 cheaper and i donâ€™t really care about aesthetics also seeing as i have a dark tint side panel so i think it should be fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[https://hwbot.org/submission/5028261](https://hwbot.org/submission/5028261)

well the pro a is $60 cheaper for me so iâ€™ll go with that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok iâ€™ll get the pro,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no i am using an aio so technically no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for me the tomahawk is 60 more dollars so it might be worth just to spend more on a clearly better board,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i canâ€™t even imagine the heat generated by a 12900k at that frequency!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"having a beefier vrm is never a bad thing, but both are good boards.","if youâ€™re now going, â€œbut what about the z690 edge for a few bucks moreâ€, i figured out what the differences were versus the seemingly identical tomahawk in this post:

"well, it's single core after selecting a specific core and for validation only, so heat isn't an issue at all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™ll go for the tomahawk,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

>will upgrading really make a difference?,cpu utilization typically stays low.,absolutely.,and the reason cpu utilization stays low is because those games arent very well threaded.,"the single threaded increase, faster ddr4 ram, and more cache of newer cpus will make a big difference.","but if you're just playing old games, just get a 12400f or maybe even a 12100f.",the cost of upgrading can be as low as $200-$250 (12100f+h610+ddr4) though i would recommend the 12400f more if you ever think youll play never games/have a more demanding workload.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

so the thing about the e-cores is that they aren't actually power efficient.,they are just space efficient.,you get more mt perfomance per mm\^2 of silicon with e-cores than with p-cores.,"golden cove is great at everything except mt/$

the e-cores suck at everything that isn't mt/$.",server customers are more than happy to $$$ for just p-cores.,the average consumer isn't.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the little cores are designed to be efficient while running at relatively low to moderate performance levels.,"high end servers generally demand high performance, making the little cores a poor choice compared to golden cove.",there are actually servers (for things that don't need much cpu power) that use little cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"e-cores are a die space efficient way to bump up multithreaded performance

not across the entire range though.,"granted, golden cove is more efficient at majority of the usable perf/watt curve but gracemont is actually more efficient at the lowest end of the perf/watt curve.","we won't be able to see that though, with the way these chips are clocked and boosted so aggressively..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well actually golden cove would be better at multi threading for apps that can fully take advantage if pure parallelization.,there is only 8 of them so they are not going to be as good at multi threading as more slightly weaker zen 3 cores or even much weaker zen 2 cores.,"&#x200b;

but equal core count of same type, the more cores, the better multi threading.","&#x200b;

so i would think 8 golden cove cores with smt/ht on would beat a zen 3 5800x at same clock speed.",and it would slaughter it given that golden cove can clock all 8 cores to 5ghz easily where as 5800x all 8 cores struggle to get past 4.6ghz all core.,"&#x200b;

so equal core count compared to other architectures, wouldn't golden cove also be the multi threading champ??",its just that they are stuck at 8 and going to struggle against weaker archs that have much more cores that are stronger than those trash e cores like even earlier gen ryzens.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don't server cpus still have to be energy efficient though?,"and yes high end servers demand high performance, but isn't it primarily high multi threaded performance?","yes there are probably still some uses cases where high st performance is still necessary, but isn't high mt performance still the majority use case for servers?","and to my knowledge, the zen 4c and sierra forest cpus are for efficiency rather than performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you don't have to think that 8 golden cove cores beat a 5800x.,they just straight up do.,"clock for clock, core for core, golden cove > zen 3.

the e-cores are on the 12900k to make it compete with the 5950x not because the 12900k needs help beating a 5800x.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>don't server cpus still have to be energy efficient though?,"and yes high end servers demand high performance, but isn't it primarily high multi threaded performance?","no, the x86 server market actually demands relatively high single core performance as well as multicore performance.",niches that don't care about per thread performance tend to use cheaper or more specialized hardware (such as intels atom xeon processors or arm).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how much better ipc is golden cove compared to zen 3 at same clock speed.,"&#x200b;

i have heard 20%.",some have said more.,some have said only 12%.,"&#x200b;

per that above it says golden cove is better but not a knockout punch and that zen 3 still has better brach predictor and cache latency.",like how much better would you say golden cove is clock for clock than zen 3?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have a feeling that the guy who had own it before was a modder.,"iirc that fried pin usually got short circuited with the one right next to it to the left to ""fool"" the bios in the early day of the coffee lake mod for skylake/kaby lake motherboard.",later on the micro code  of coffee lake cpu was added into the mod bios and you usually don't need to short circuit these pins.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you have a single friend with an 1151 mobo?,ask if you can try installing it on their pc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would chalk this to a loss and go for a different build... sorry dude..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's not looking good man!,you can download the cpu datasheet to locate  the burnt pad function at least,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if the pad is burned it means there is current passing through, most likely power delivery.",this cpu is almost certainly gone.,try to see if you can ask for a refund.,if not i'm afraid you will have to cut your losses.,do not put a dead cpu in a working motherboard to test it.,it may have unexpected short in the cpu and ruin your other components.,i learned it the hard way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
reasonable chance the cpu is fine given that there are hundreds or power/gnd pins in parallel.,i would be worried about whatever the previous owner did to make that happen though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there are dozens of redundant power and ground pins where the high current is run through.,odds are it's a redundant power pin location.,i would at least get a motherboard and try it.,take back the board if it fails to boot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its kinda funny how fragile and at the same time durable hardware can be.,sometimes the smallest scratch can cause the whole system to go into flames and other times your graphics card looks like you ran it over with a car and it still works because all thats broken is not even used lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks for the input, i really don't know what the previous owner did, i assumed overcloking, cheap/inadequate cooling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"don't really know what most of'em have (besides wives, kids and mortgages) and i wouldn't take the risk of damaging their motherboards just to check if the cpu would run.",i'd rather buy a cheap second hand mobo and try my luck or resell it as defective/not tested.,i wanted to build a second rig for my kid since i have most components to do that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s awful advice dude.,it would be terrible bricking a friends computer by testing a cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks for the advice, unfortunately i can't return it.","oh, well, lesson learned, i guess...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"okay, i'm not an electrical engineer or anything but isn't a current passing through each and every one of those pads?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pushing voltages they shouldn't,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sustained heat doesn't burn out contacts, arcing does.",most overclocking damage is caused by short circuits while bad cooling causes processors to throttle for safety reasons but causes no real damage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you don't mind me asking.... how much did you pay for this used chip?,"i keep telling users out there that no point in buying any used cpu chips and mobos, unless they are really cheap.",because right now for brand new parts you can get them for prettty much the price you paid for this used chip.,something like a 12400 or a 12600 with a budget mobo will outperform this 9900k chip.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no kidding, i would even have mixed feelings about testing that on a spare board that wasn't mine let alone a rig someone's using.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
an already broken cpu literally cannot break a motherboard.,"if you overvolt an already working cpu that will most definitely have a chance of bricking someones computer, but there is practically a slim to zero chance that an already broken / damaged cpu has the potential to brick someones entire computer, let alone a motherboard.","motherboards damage cpus, not the other way around.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you buy it from kijiji or facebook or from a friend?,"edit: no response after 22 hrs, must have been from a ""friend"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sorry about the loss bro.,that shit sucks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, there are reserved pins which as the name suggest, they are only used as reserve for future cpus.",there are also data pins.,"while those pings do have current, they are nowhere near as much as power pins.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it literally can.,"it happens both waysâ€¦ 

itâ€™s amazing that you are talking about voltage changes but do not know that a faulty cpu could damage a mobo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
reserve pads on a chip layout that isn't even used anymore sounds kind of odd to me...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
motherboards have built in vrm and other applications which 99.9 percent of the time would stop a faulty / broken cpu from bricking a computer.,just because there is still a minuscule chance of something going wrong doesnâ€™t make your point right.,i have literally done this exact thing before on my z390 board with no issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is extremely common for chips to have extra pins.,"they may have been intended for functionality that was removed, used for test during production of the cpu or added for mechanical support.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most cpu's/sockets have large amounts of unused pins.,"on the layout they are marked as ""rsvd"" (reserved) i believe.",it's useful to have unused pins because it allows companies to add extra features on future cpu's without having to create a new socket which would then require people to buy new motherboards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all it takes is a short between two pins in the wrong place and that could be the death of a mobo.,itâ€™s a very well know thing dude.,itâ€™s happened to my old z97 for one.,death by faulty pentium duo 3ghz when testing to see if it still worked.,"edit- to add, it was also a burnt pin.",i think the connections bridged but iâ€™m not 100% sure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"contrary what others have said, you can use the 12900k in windows 10 just fine.",windows 10 process scheduler is not set up for efficiency cores.,all it sees is just cores.,"so it could send your game to a slower e-core, and that would obviously significantly reduce game performance.","to fix this and continue to use windows 10, you can either a: disable the e-cores for gaming if you don't need them.","or b: you can use a free program called ""process lasso"" and send your lower-priority tasks like discord, etc.","to the e-cores, and keep your games strictly on the p-cores.","this video shows the program in action with a 12900k:

"no it wont, gaming dont need bandwidth over latency",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the latency can be calculated by: cas latency*2000/transfer rate.,"and also because you need to set your imc in 2nd gear


ddr5 has a faster transfer rate than ddr4 but have more latency.",you'd have to get some 8000mt/s ddr5 dimms to achieve what ddr4 is curently doing.,"gaming dont need bandwidth so optimizing your memory controller for low latency is really important


alder lake will got to 4000mt/s in gear 1",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that thing is optimized in win11, as said by intel.",but the thread director is a module at hardware level that has already been integrated inside the cpu.,test results also indicated that win11 didn't show feelable improvement for its claimed advantage for thread director... so it is quite debatable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you can run the 12900 just fine in windows 10 by either disabling the e-cores, or using a free program called process lasso that can manage those cores for you.",there's an excellent video on yt on how it works and shows it working with the 12900 on win 10.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[this article](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16959/intel-innovation-alder-lake-november-4th/3) explains it quite well.,basically all os have a scheduler who is in charge of which thread goes where.,"the scheduler works with alder lake's thread director but the final decision is made by the os, not the cpu.",windows 10 doesn't understand e-cores.,"for win10, e-cores are just cores with lower clock speed.",the windows 11 scheduler does understand e-cores and can put low level workload (background workload) on e-cores.,intel demonstrated that by starting a render benchmark on the foreground (p-cores) and putting it on the background (e-cores) by minimizing the program and starting another program.,"the new program ran on p-cores, the render benchmark on e-cores.","another example (for gamers) would be your game would run on p-cores while discord, running in the background, would run on e-cores.","in win10 the game's thread could accidentally run on e-cores, which is not ok for obvious reasons.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is your recommendation regarding which os i should choose after putting this build together?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they test the memory chips to binned them.,"dominator is better binned than vengeance... its gonna determine the speed, the latency and the voltage of the ram.",usually the one with the most voltage from the manufactuer are gonna be the best overclocker.,they trying to keep a limited amount of different kits so sometime you might buy a lower binned and still be able to have a decent overclock on them because they didnt quite reach the next step for the better kit.,"if you got the 5600cl36 at 1.25v you wight be able to get 6000cl36 or 5600cl32 at 1.4v... but no many ppl are secure to overclock ram, and ddr5 is so new that there is no guide for it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah, but have you ever seen a cpu with a detached capacitor that is still there next to where it was supposed to be?","broken off and missing cap, highly unlikely but ok i'll bite, but sitting there completely loose held by gravity?",it would have fallen off as soon as you removed it from the socket.,"this here is what it's called ""mechanical damage"" and i'm very surprised he managed to have it replaced it free of charge.",i'm not buying his story.,he's a fraud.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"well, it's not proven, but when alderlake launched intel claimed the reason avx512 had to be dumped was because they couldn't work out a mixed instruction scheduler solution with microsoft on time for win 11.

could microsoft have fucked up this badly?",it's happened before.,when w11 launched microsoft broke amd's cache performance to the point where people claimed it was a conspiracy to make intel look better.,it also might just be that dell is the only one willing to implement early unorthodox tweaks from intel.,"they have a history of a tight... antitrusty relationship with intel, so it could be case where these fixes are in the early stages and will be applied to other systems/windows in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the e-cores aren't actually any more efficient than the p-cores.,they're actually less efficient when run up at high clocks especially.,its only more area efficient.,you can look up der8auer's video on testing the e-cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a lot of things do not work well with windows 11...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"some claim it's uncore power draw being high for some reason, like 3-4 watts uncore just idling",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
reviewer is wrong.,alderlake platform has problems reaching low idle power and also staying at low power.,think about this.,how can what he say be right when in light workloads the battery life is determined by idle power and power management features and both p and e cores have the access to the same technology?,is zero different from zero?,they messed up in this area that's all.,"icelake regressed, tigerlake stayed the same, and alderlake regressed further and much more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
windows 11 definitely has issues even if its not alder lake.,i see system gets very slow at times and reboots needed more often to fix it.,hopefully they get it better with future updates.,"if its a software issue, i hope intel is furiously working in the background to resolve it with microsoft.",poor battery life is not something you let in slide.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think it's a lot more nuanced than that.,every core design has its own voltage/frequency curve and perf/watt curve.,none of which are ever linear.,"if i remember correctly, the e-cores are more efficient than golden cove only at very low power levels.","anything higher, then yes, golden cove actually yields more performance per watt.",it's just a shame that intel chose to overclock the hell out of both gracemont and golden cove.,they are both way out of their efficiency sweet spot even at stock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it can use less power for the same work if its light enough,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
battery life has little to do with efficiency at load.,alderlake somehow has a problem reaching low idle power and keeping it at idle.,both p and e cores have access to ultra deep c states and power gating so idle is same for both.,the e cores are used for efficient multi-threading gain and not battery life improvement(which doesn't make sense since in light load it's all about power management which is available for both cores).,they screwed up a bit that's all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've heard if you're using one of these new cores for a dedicated gamin rig you're better off turning them off because games that use or switch to these e-cores tend to run worst and there's also benchmark showing proof of it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yea which is exactly why they're pointless.,they're never run at their efficiency point in any of the chips out because then they'll be so slow they're useless.,golden cove is more efficient at the performance targets they're aiming for.,but if they used all golden cove cores the die size would be much more massive for the same multithreaded performance and therefore price too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yea but again gracemont is not more efficient than golden cove at all at the clocks that intel runs gracemont at.,its just more space efficient.,just saying its pretty unnecessary and intel's peddling it as an efficiency core for low power and that doesn't even work because of said issues reaching low power states.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes exactly.,"aside from being slower performance per core they also cannot communicate data across cores even in the same complex, any data transfer has to go through the ring bus first then back to the complex then to the cores.",this just congests the ring and usually also severely lowers the possible cache/ring overclock.,considering how sensitive games are to memory/cache access latency/speed its obvious why it doesn't help games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can easily see that from various notebookcheck reviews.,it's a regression in both wifi battery life and idle.,also while icelake did great on idle it was mediocre on idle.,so the idle benefits weren't realistic.,alderlake gets the worst of both worlds - high idle coupled with the inability to reach idle as often.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no and that's what i want to point out.,e cores are there to increase multi-threading performance because otherwise you'd have needed many more p cores which would have put the power use well over 300w.,reviews have demonstrated 8p alone can use 250w all by itself.,when the e cores are active you get a whopping 30%+ improvement in performance for the same 250w.,now the power is split between 200w for p cores and 50w for e cores.,considering how much power the 8p cores take something like even 12 would have been crazy.,"if you see the power versus performance distribution, 4 e cores are roughly equal to 2 p cores which makes it very worth it.",raptorlake will demonstrate this further because on the same intel 7 process it'll have roughly similar standing in terms of performance compared to zen 4 raphael and with the latter having the advantage of moving to 5nm process.,some of us readers at anandtech have speculated that originally alderlake would be an optimal mobile performance design but bad scheduling regarding 10nm meant they had to push that to desktop and 8+8 wasn't optimal.,something like 6+12 or better yet 8+12 would have been much better.,you are confusing battery life with load power again.,battery life which is under light load work is mostly idle and power management.,it doesn't care about what cores you have because modern power management system is supposed to be that effective.,what alderlake screwed up is in the power management and idle which is why battery life sucks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"well since 4 e cores uses the space of one p core, same die area would probably be 10 p core i9s which would be worse multithreaded wise so 12 p cores would definitely be needed for same multithreaded performance and it would use more die area.",still would prefer a 10 p core i9 12900k personally.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
might be a faulty pump in that aio.,that model of nzxt aio in particular i believe is kinda notorious for it.,but i dont think the paste pattern is anything significant.,edit: just because the bios shows its working does not mean that it is.,"regardless, if youre unsure of the source of the issue, the best way to identify is to replace and test.",request an rma on the aio and go from there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i would try with an air cooler and see how it goes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the paste might be a *tiny* bit thin in the center but i don't think it should cause that much of an issue.,in your bios you should be able to see if your pump is running and check its rpms.,you could try moving the pump connector to sysfan header and setting the rpm to max manually and see if that helps.,or just grab a 12700k and you'll be 12000 times happier ;),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"assuming every component in the build is fine, this looks like a case of applying too much mounting pressure.",try re-applying the paste + aio but do not tighten to the point where you need to force it.,also double check if the cpu/aio pins are in the respective slots.,"if the issue continues, double check the cpu voltage to ensure the motherboard isn't doing anything funky.","and as someone else suggested, have another exhaust fan (top of the case).",you can simply move one of the intakes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

cheap chinese intake fans?,my cousin had an issue with fans that look just like those not having enough air flow.,120mm radiator maybe its good enough but i'd never recommend anything under 240mm for modern cpus even the lower end ones.,"my guess if its not the aio itself giving you trouble via the pump, then it is the size, with this, you will want to change the fan curve, try something like running them 100% straight from idle then monitor when it spikes see how high it gets.","if it sits at 70-80c then you are fine to set a proper curve, if it goes higher i'd look for a bigger aio & better intake fans, you can get cheap 3 packs from lain-li e.t.c.",that still work well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

one of the reasons i moved away from aio coolers and reverted back to air coolers.,aios pose a lot of problems being lack of coolant incorrect radiator placement on the chassis the pump not working efficiently.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you using new or old paste?,what's its use by?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

may want to get another aio pump may be in its way out.,also is your board pumping too much vcore into the cpu?,that aio while working properly should be cooling your chip.,"pump could be going out, using the wrong mounting hardware, or tightening down the aio too much.",are about the only things i can think of.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
120 mm radiator.,a notoriously hot architecture.,average at best airflow.,are you surprised?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you need to clean the back of aio perfectly if its not!,some times in  the rare situations your thermal can be expired(and get 100c to cause the thermal cant to connect cpu and aio)!,using thermal in x form is the best!,if you did all of this and again you get 100cdeg you should get a new aio or going to fix it!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dead aio.,always is with stuff like this.,everyone eventually comes full circle back to air for these reasons.,it's not the application of paste or the mounting pressure or any other little voodoo magic thing.,aio pumps die.,"they wear out like fans which is to say usually they are fine out of the box, but they will wear out and stop working.",go back to air and forget about it.,"i know it doesn't look as cool, but reliable performance with minimal maintenance is pretty damn cool",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that's perfect paste contact.,you have shitty rgb fans with i assume a choked front and then all that gpu heat going through the cpu's radiator.,that's why its getting hot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ok, a 120mm aio is absolutely fine for a 11600kf, certainly better than intel's stock cooler, but, your config isn't optimal, your case airflow is configured for postive pressure since you got 3 intake fans on the front and 1 exhaust fan on the back, which happens to be blowing hot air through your aio's radiator, your psu fan is acting as an exhaust too, and this is bad cause you're overheating it with hot air, rgb might look cool, but a psu should always be running while receiving fresh air, this is a matter of safety.","what you really want is a slightly positive pressure config or at least neutral, so i'll give a list on what to do to make your config as optimal as possible:

&#x200b;

1. reinstall your aio in a push / pull config on the front, same position as it is now but rotated to the front, it will be on the same position as the topmost front rgb fan, the rgb fan will remain at the same position but now acting as intake (push) for the radiator, and you'll invert the aio's stock fan to exhaust (pull), thus making a sandwich, the stock fan on the same position but inverted to act as exhaust (pull) and the rgb fan on the other side as intake (push).",2. rotate the pump 90âº clockwise when you reinstall it.,3. flip your psu so that it gets fresh air from the bottom of the case.,4.,"(optional): lap the base of your heatsink / pump, use wet sandpaper, there's an old rule when sanding that to calculate the next grit you should add 50% to the one you've used first, but you'll be fine if you use 80 / 240 / 400 / 600 / 800 / 1200 / 2000, if you're not that patient 240 / 600 / 1200 should still give you a really good result, a nice mirror finish.","follow these steps and i'm confident you'll get a good result, but all of this will be useless if the front of your case doesn't get any airflow, is it a solid front or mesh?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you could try a thermal pad if you find nothing else.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"from what i know of aio faulty pumps and issues in general, you would see temps much higher than 40 at idle.",i've seen up to thermal throttle temps of around 100c when an aio goes bad.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the block isn't supposed to be flat.,"the cpu usually takes on a u shape under the pressure of the loading mechanism,  which is why companies don't make flat plates.","your thermal paste spread was perfectly centered,  which means that's where all the contact was.",the pump is broken or there is mineral deposits inside.,that's all there is to it really.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"single core will be similar, unless the program is sensitive to the amount of cache.",the 12700 and 12900 will be faster then the 12600 in cache sensitive games and programs.,if you are only looking for single core performance then probably should look at the 12400.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i said i know the 12900 is faster but is it way faster in single core progs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well i would expect that even though the 3930 is still a monster for most programs i know its outdated which is why im updating im comparing old i5s and i3s and old i7s not the new stuff by saying the card is a monster 

 i always said i wouldnt upgrade until i seen the need i said this to myself 3 years ago when i got the chip i didnt do research then so i just thought it was used which was why it was so cheap turns out months later when i looked it up my chip was from the year 2011 i got it from amazon for like 200",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the 12100f would be fine for the games he's playing, but not for streaming too.","so yeah i'd recommend the 12400f, plus there are definitely games that will take advantage of the 6 cores and more cache of the 12400f",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you didn't get impatient and shut it down before it was fully complete did you?,because i had similar problems before.,you are going to need to stick your ssd to a desktop computer and use a data recovery software to get your data back so if you have easy access to both don't worry about losing data.,there might be a possibility to get it operating again without such measures but with computer issues there isn't a single answer to all problems.,in case yours is the worst case scenario where data recovery has to be done the way to get functionality back is just search to find how to get it back to factory default settings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no....it can't even run my 12400 properly...as i'm poor... can't upgrade the board rn...but i would suggest you buy a z690,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"assuming youâ€™re dead set on vga, maybe the msi pro b660-a would be better?",thereâ€™s also an asus prime b660-plus.,and youâ€™d probably be better off with the 12700 vs the 12700k with those boards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

avx-512 is a vector instruction set extension that extends avx 2.0's 256 bit simd operations to 512 bits.,i've heard it was a result of intel's experiments with larabee.,i think they were trying to make a gpu using modified cpu cores extended with wider vector instructions with the gpu stuff implemented in software.,the project was supposedly abandoned and they instead turned it into a high core count coprocessor card instead that features the 512 bit entensions to avx and from there it made it's way into a variety of server cpus.,generally consumer cpus neither had it nor needed it.,but apparently golden cove cores have it built in but intel apparantly decided to fuse off the functionality recently and disable it in microcode updates for cpus already out in the wild because they don't think consumers need it and because it can't be used with the gracemont e cores turned on in the system firmware because they don't support it.,from what i've heard amd's upcoming cpus will have avx-512 support and that may spur intel to bring it back and keep it active in consumer products with meteor lake if they decide to add it to the next gen crestmont e cores.,like someone else said you would know what it was if you needed it for any of your programs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the video spent an entire section talking about how the ilm applies **more** pressure to the right side and threw at least two segments of disclaimers about how easy it would be fuck up the torque with the mod and not post or get worse memory results.,people hit a 3866 wall because the imu on alder lake doesn't want to run that fast especially in dual rank which is required if you want 32gb of b-die.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wow, *this* is interesting.",i read many reports of even ddr4-3200 not working with xmp.,one of the suspects was that non-k cpus had something locked that prevented xmp from working normally.,which would mean that k cpus should not be susceptible to this problem.,but now we have yet another suspect... hmm... at least itâ€™s something worth considering if you canâ€™t get your ram working at its advertised clock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for me the $6 frame and a 12700 on a artic 280 aio is under 80c for 164w (20 threads at 100%).,i didn't even bother with the bullshit intel clamp.,i think the 35$ frame is just marketing.,the thermalright one i got came in 4 days and does the same thing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the problem with non-k cpu's is that you're limited to 1.05v vccsa (system agent/memory controller).,"some ram kits, especially samsung b-die and even more so dual rank/4 dimm kits are pretty hard on memory controller; those kits require 1.20v+ system agent voltage and since you can't adjust it, you have a problem.",you need a hard volt mod to overcome that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

iâ€™ve got a 12700k sitting on my desk.,still pretty satisfied with my 6850k though since i donâ€™t game.,"starting to question whether itâ€™s worth the $, esp with the cost of ddr5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i did the same in february.,my workstation was 12years old.,"i gave it to my car mechanics, for playing mfs on lower settings, it's still able to do",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i upgraded my 3770k to ryzen 5 5600x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"good for you, now you'll have to show us the full build once it's done :d

 i upgraded from a i5-2500k to i9-12900k last year, i know it feels pretty good :d",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuge upgrade.,happy for you man.,congratulations and enjoy your pc for another 6-7 years at least !,i also recently ( a year ago) upgraded my amd fx8350 to the 9700k.,"it was another yuuuge upgrade for me and it felt amazing
also went from a 960 to the amazing beast rtx 3080 ðÿ¥°",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hey thatâ€™s pretty cool.,reminds me of when i upgraded from my 3770k to a 9700k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
huge,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
reminds me that i still have the same 3770 thats still in use for past 8.25 years.,nice upgrade,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i thought i was slow going from a 4590 to a 12700k lol.,welcome to a whole new world.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
change?,big change!,!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
return it right now.,this guy really spent 1k on a past gen cpu when new gen is around the corner.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i went from a 6600k to a 12700 due to a motherboard problem, so i chose to upgrade my system.","was still very happy with my old setup, but holy there is a big difference.",glad i did it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i went from a 3770k to 12900k earlier this year as android apps were taking to long to build in visual studio.,"other than that the 3770k, at .5ghz, was still great for gaming at 1440p when combined with a 3080 e.g.",cp2077 gave 45-capped 60 fps with everything maxed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and here i am still on a i5-2500 ðÿ¥²,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"congrats!, i recently upgradedfrom a 2500k@4,5ghz ->12700k
  
honestly, the sandy still pull his weight on everyday normal tasks, but some times i do heavy workload and alder lake now blazes through that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
grats mate!,i went from a 3770k to 3900x.,this upgrade will be huge :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do yourself a favor now and get thermalrightâ€™s or thermal grizzlyâ€™s 12th gen lid correction bracket.,i upgraded from my i7 970 es & i7 4770k to a 12th gen i9 and could not be happier.,yet you are going to want that lid correction bracket to keep the cpu lid from bowing to keep temps & vcore down to sane levels and to keep the temp sensors from cutting out from the bow pressure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah.,the 3770 was a great cpu for a long while but it was time for  a upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a 6700k overclocked to near 7700k levels and can feel it starting to get sluggish in certain tasks.,"i have a 970 evo m.2 which makes it very usable in general, but i think i'll make the jump on 13th gen. the only thing is i have always bought right before something new/amazing comes out (except for my 6700k, the 7xxx series wasn't that big of a jump).",like i bought a p4d 3 months before core2 launched.,then i bought an i7 920 shortly before 2600k came out.,"so if i buy the 13th gen, your 14th gen purchase will be a beast for sure :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh man prepare for a jump, i upgraded from a 7700k to a 12700k, it's literally another world",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i went from a 7700k to the 12900k and it's been a pretty night and day experience (with a 3070).,i can't imagine the comparison to the 3770.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i went from a delidded 7700k@5ghz to a 5950x a year ago.,tuned pbo to perfection and if i'm to be fairly honest it's a mixed bag.,navigating through windows was already fast and i haven't noticed a difference there.,of course seeing all the huge multi-core bench increases was fun and seeing obs cpu encode at the highest setting was cool but the biggest gains was in gaming.,despite not hitting 5ghz much in games and the top fps not really changing the _frame pacing_ increase really made a lot of games look a ton smoother.,if i were you i'd hold out a bit longer too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
skylake user here.,i only upgrade when there's a big memory generation upgrade.,"before this, my pc is on core2duo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you thought that was a long in the tooth.....i went from a core 2 duo e6600 to a ryzen 5 3600.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is this a reference to something?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
currently its going to be a 12900k + a 1060 3gb while i wait for rtx 4000 to launch so that i can get a 4080,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a 4960x and it feels like ddr3 ram is holding my system a bit back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you heard about our lord and savior linux?,it's just the thing for the kind of person still holding on to 7 with a 12(?),core cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, as a follow up...  it looks like i might get a loaner 11700k or 12700k from work and then will be testing one of the new intel arc cards.",should be interesting.,:-),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you could go straight to 14th gen next year, will be again bigger jump since 14th gen is supposedly going to be more than 50% above alder lake in performance + it will be full ddr5 platform (ddr5 will already be a standard next year)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i heard there are affordable models now

they came out after i bought cpu+mainboard, so i just went ddr4",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same upgrade for me.,3770k with a 1060 6gb to 5600x with a 3080 fe.,so many frames!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>d the trigger on a upgrade from my 3770 build.,"3770 -> 12900k

at least 3\~4 months wait is not 'around the corner' i think...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what a load of bullcrap,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm currently on a gigabyte aorus master z690 with a 12900k and i've not had any such issues.,"on stock with a 360mm aio from arctic, i'm getting 33c idle and 60-65c under load?","so idk man, maybe different motherboards have different issues?",i'm not sure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 3770 is old enough that i used one last month to [build a ""retro"" pc to run windows xp](https://www.vogons.org/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=87872) ðÿ˜š

that is going to be a serious upgrade.",enjoy!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the honest impression.,i already knew based on single thread old game benchmarks that zen 3 was out of the question for me.,i'll be keeping my eye on zen 4 but honestly i expect even that to just barely play catch up to alder lake.,"and with 13th gen only being a refresh, it really looks like at least another year wait for 14th gen which should hopefully deliver some nice improvements in ipc and maybe even return avx-512 (which i desperately want for rpcs3.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think they mean that itâ€™s *easier* to rob when you have a gun,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is awesome!,"make the 12900k rip and make the 1060 keep up :d

i hope you get the 4080 this year for it!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you able to grab any of them lol, i would personally get a high end 3000 as the prices are good now",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, i've heard of it...  spent at least 8-10 or so years as a unix (mostly hpux, solaris) and linux (mostly rh and sles, though more recently ubuntu) systems engineer.","i like linux for certain things and windows for other things, but for my gaming system, i like windows.",:-),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
could i ask you some questions about linux cause im curious about it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we have same spec lol 3600mhz 16gb?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thats the definition of around the corner.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
agree.,i had 12900k and now 12900ks.,just get a decent 360 aio and undervolt a bit and you'll have no issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

just because you can spam links where its discussed doesnt mean its actually needed.,"igor, der8auer and buildzoid all show that its not needed for people with properly constructed aio or tower coolers (coolers that are convex because ihs have been concave for years).",its only really useful if you have a flat (which is rare) waterblock.,"https://www.igorslab.de/en/german-engineered-bend-aids-for-intels-lga1700-thermal-grizzly-cpu-contact-frame-and-alphacool-apex-backplate-thermal-testing/5/

* first custom waterblock with a *1080mm custom loop*, stock bracket 70c, tg 60c
 
* second custom waterblock with a *1080mm custom loop*, stock bracket 66c, tg 59c

software scheduling works fine.,"there are some nuances, with it that can either be helpful or slightly annoying depending on how you want things to be.","like if you were encoding a video, when the window is in the foreground it gets 100% performance, but when it's in the background it only gets 100% of e-cores.",this slows down the encode but let's you use your pc to do other things without lag.,so it's a tradeoff.,"but you can always force an application to use all cores with stuff like process lasso, so you can 'override' the default scheduler.","i've had my 12700k for like 6 months now, and only had one application i needed to tweak to get it to run as i wanted, everything else is scheduled well enough.",for games it's a non-issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah in the future it will get better i am sure.,but will it be an issue for today's modern software or any software released in the last 5 to 10 years.,i mean software released in last 5 to 10 years is still very relevant and modern and good in lots of cases unlike 5-10 year old software 20 years ago which became obsolete so much faster.,law of diminishing returns it seems for things these days except for running very high end games or staying up to date av software.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's the default behavior, but it's controlled by the power settings.",lots of discussion on the topic related to handbrake.,it really makes zero sense as a default with 8+4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so for games it is a non-issue.,cause i have seen that most games from benchmarks seen to run faster with e cores off.,has that changed now.,"can games heavily tax the p cores while antivirus, msi afterburner and hwinfo64 and the like programs touch the e cores only unlike 6-7 months ago when reviews tested this.","&#x200b;

this in theory should make an ever smoother gaming experience as no cycles at all for those programs to compete with the games on p cores, even though those programs in background use little resources anyways?",?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
only the operating system needs to adapt for 99% of use cases.,"most software will use lower priority for unimportant threads, so kicking those off to the e-cores makes sense.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
really?,i tried setting power mode to high perf but didn't notice any difference.,is there an article or something that explains how to change it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hardware unboxed found a 1 percent lead for e-cores turned off vs e-cores turned on.,"and that was months ago, so i'm sure at least some games optimized their software to stop those regressions with e-cores turned on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

for anyone wondering the turbo boosting was the culprit.,everythingâ€™s running super smooth now.,just the sff build wasnâ€™t very compatible with the turbo boosting on the cpu.,i lost about 7% capability.,but itâ€™s a negligible difference from what i can see,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you have a bad mount on your aio, plain and simple.",reseat it until temps are within reason.,"my 12900k doesn't reach over 60c in games, prime95 or linx will push it up to the 80-85c range but its also overclocked pretty heavily.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you get 90c in csgo imagine what you will get when you actually use the cpu.,bad mount.,btw 12900k for games??,?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
above 90?,wondering if your aio is dying?,or dust blocking the airflow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in gaming my 12900k paired with a lian li galahad 360 aio and the preset ai cooling option set up doesnâ€™t go over 60c.,i would check your aio or mounting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably bad mounting like everyone else is saying.,you could also try a different thermal paste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
try undervolting your cpu.,"i did this, in bios: 1- choose adaptive voltage mode.","2- start with vcore offset in negative increments: -0.025, boot and test stability in windows.",stable?,change to -0.050 etc until it gives you a bsod.,then you go back to the last stable undervoltage number.,"if you pc refuses to boot, remove the cmos battery and put again to revert bios to default.",i have vcore offset of -0.100v.,"it solely was responsible from my temp going from 77c (27500 pts, 260w, vcore 1.328) to 66c (26456 pts, 181.5w, 1.288v) under 10 minutes of multi-core stress test in cinebench r23.",another thing is case cooling.,i have 1x140mm + 2x120mm noctua industrial pushing hot air from my galax andromeda case.,my aio water cooler is arctic cooler freezer || 420mm.,i installed +3x140mm to its radiator to do push and pull setup.,"these 3 last coolers are cheaper, but do the job.",it is desirable to have different coolers from the ones of aio to do the push and pull more efficiently.,"my cheap coolers are aerocool shark edition with less rpm and air pressure than the ones from aio water c. important: if you do undervolting, pay attention to the signal.","it's -0.xx, not +0.xx what you want for you vcore.","it's silly to reinforce it, but if you do +0.xx vcore adjustment you can damage your cpu, since it will be an overvolting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
