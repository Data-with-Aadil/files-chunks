thank you too :) and this was also my concern.,i play on a asus 1080p 180hz gsync monitor and i still don't have the need to upgrade my monitor ( and if upgradable than as the last thing and not anytime soon ).,it still just runs great for me.,the 3 series is also not a new series for me anymore ( released mid 2020 ) and the only modell with the best option as an upgrade would be a 3080ti or higher.,and if a gpu ist expensive than this is also a reason for me better to wait for the 4th series.,"even if i don't know if this brings a lot more, but i gonna have a gen5 board now, so i also wanna have a gen5 gpu instead investing in a gen4 card now.","i just could now spend more on better parts of the whole system and i now start to save up for the next gen gpu, atleast this is my plan so far.",i just hope that my gpu doesn't die ðÿ˜… but i don't think it will happen anytime soon ðÿ¤žðÿ˜š,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a good example is the ac origin benchmark.,it shows frame times for both cpu and gpu.,"by faster cpu response, it helps to reduce the overall frame render time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how much vram are you anticipating?,i feel like 12gb is pretty solid at this point in time and should last for another 5 years like the 6-8gb has so far.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
unless ur playing heavy ray tracing...that 1080ti is still a weapon.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, i'm holding out, but i'm also playing some games i haven't had time to get to yet.","i figure i'll play some newer ones once i upgrade, but the 3xxx is 1.5 years old, and the 4xxx should come out in september.",i also have to stick with nvidia since i got an early gsync monitor that has a physical module.,"i will say, a better screen really is worth it.",why spend all that money on a gpu to watch it on a lower res and no hdr.,"if you want pretty, a good 1440p or 4k monitor really is a nice upgrade.",get one with variable refresh rate.,it really does smooth out the games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i agree, that 12 gb is solid, but that is on only the 12gb 3080 and above.","i don't want a 3070ti, just cuz it only has 8 gb of vram.",so i'm hoping the whole product stack gets a vram upgrade from the 8gb it currently has.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"god bless me, that i can't use ray tracing on a 1080ti, so that i never have the experience until now if i need it or not.",my old 4930k is just getting really old and meanwhile also very loud.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 3060s right now have 12gb i believe.,"but iâ€™m reading that the 40 series are going to have a much higher tdp, so most people are going to need to upgrade their psu as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your gonna feel like the system is supercharged.,1080ti was not the bottleneck.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"buys 12900k top cpu then scared to get a decent graphic card..........

listen i want to be real, 1080ti was still a beast on 1080p before i switched.",but its nowhere close to my 3080 strik in 1440p+dlss,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if gpu use was at 99%, it was clearly a bottleneck too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's not about a decent graphic card.,"i now bought a gen5 system, so why spending money on a gen4 gpu if i will even have more out of it if i wait and don't have to care about buying two gpu's in one year if my new system is made for gen5 cards.","if the prices stay high than ok...than it doesn't matter, but if a 4th series card will be also very expensive than i

b) if the 4th series cards are more expensive than the 3rd series cards will get cheaper.",c) not everyone has an unlimited amount of money just for computer parts.,i now updated my rig and like in the topic...i just want bridge the time till the next gpu series comes out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think your missing the above point.,your headline question is silly and makes no sense.,thereâ€™s no such thing as gpu made for any generation of cpu.,or vice versa.,they are independent and universal.,the only consideration is if the cpu will bottleneck the gpu and itâ€™s highly obvious that would not be the case for a new high end cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i also switched from a 1080ti to a 3080, and while the step-up is immense, it is rather vr where i feel the impact of brute force.","at 1080p, hell even 1440p the 1080ti is still an awesome card, it will easily serve you well till next gen gpus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have a 12600k with a 3080 and play at 3440x1440p 144hz.,in most games the load is on the gpu and my 12600k is not even close to being maxed out.,so i have not yet tried any serious overclocking.,i have tried things like multi core enhancement and gigabytes easytune in the gigabyte app.,this ran my cpu at 5 ghz all core.,i imagine that if i tried a manual oc i could easily achieve the same but with a lower voltage and therefore use less power.,you probably donâ€™t need that extra power connector as the 12600k isnâ€™t that power hungry compared to a 12900k for example.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're probably better off not overclocking until you feel the extra performance is valuable.,right now you probably won't notice the difference between stock and oc seeing as your cpu is the strongest part of your system right?,i'm going to assume you aren't using the pc for cpu intensive workloads since you haven't stated as such.,unless you want to learn the ropes of alderlake oc right now for an easier max oc later on in which case i'd understand tinkering with it.,"as another guy mentioned undervolting would probably be more beneficial for you right now, cooler quieter system and all.",if you don't care about rgb the 5 pack of arctic p12 fans (black or white) are amazing value for money.,they are good for case or heatsink use and perform excellently.,i find the p12's to run quieter even at higher rpm than the p14's after using both.,so i'd recommend them even if you have to increase the rpm to match the airflow.,although p14's are good too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

officially intel supports changing or removing power limits on all processors and chipsets.,"however, your motherboard has to be able to actually supply that much current without melting, so if you have a super low end board and try to draw 200 amps it's going to throttle anyway.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

is there a way to tell?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can have unlimited turbo in pretty much any mobo as long as the vrm's can handle it.,most decent b660's can handle a 12600k or maybe a 12700k in regular tasks.,avoid the cheap b660 and h610 motherboards and you should be fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes.,"i'm not sure the board you're talking about but 12400-12600k will likely be the limit for that board as the vrms will throttle, but it's probably power limited too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i read about the vulnerability and the patches.,the vulnerability only exists when unprivileged users are able to run their scripts in a privileged sandbox environment like ebpf.,this is why the linux 5.16 patch is to remove unprivileged ebpf by default and the 5.17 patch is to issue an warning if unprivileged ebpf is enabled and retpolines are disabled.,"there is an option to turn on retpolines now for spectrev2 if you must have unprivileged users run sandboxed scripts in the kernel, but that's not the default for a good reason.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

load line calibration.,your cpu will loose voltage when under load.,"if you manually set 1.3v, it might go to like 1.28v when actually under load.",it depends what the *default* llc setting is.,llc compensates for this voltage drop.,"so the default might be doing enough to actually maintain that 1.3v, or it might overshoot 1.32v or so, or go under.","depends on which motherboards, and brand.",you can manually change llc until the board gives roughly the same under load as you set it to.,every board maker has different llc settings.,just because on gigabyte you set it to 5 doesn't mean you do so for asus for example.,might add way too much.,i would test using software to check what the voltage actually is while running something like cinebench.,get hwinfo and check what the core is actually running at during a heavy load.,set it to like 4.7ghz to start and see what your 1.3v setting produce for voltage when under load.,you usually need pretty extreme voltage settings to get 5ghz.,especially on a 4 year old cpu.,"would not shock me if you can't get 5ghz anymore, unless you put in unsafe voltages that will degrade your cpu faster.",i would not go above  1.38v under load.,"it's  still a great cpu that shouldn't really hold you back in any games, unless you're obsessed with getting 400 fps in csgo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

with the same cooler and power limits increased, the 12700 is <1% slower than the 12700k in gaming, only way you'll see any difference is if you were to overclock the 12700k.",https://youtu.be/ydgn4w97esk?t=1154,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the gr8 thing about the k version m8 is that in the future when u wanna get some more juice u can overclock it but the cooling u are running should be well enough.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks.,i've heard that the k's can't be overclocked to the same extent as previous gens whereby the gains to be had aren't as high as older gens.,this makes me think the difference is relatively negligible whether stock or oc between the two.,im no expert though!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's really helpful to know, thanks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
agreed but not sure how oc works on new 12th gen and how effective.,i also swapped cooler for h150i elite.,still 240mm but better fans so slight uplift in airflow for additional heat management,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had to do this too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah im running an i150 and a overclocked i9 9900k,  and it runs fine , urs will be more powerhungry prob but cant really see it beeing a problem:)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sorry meant to say i swapped for h100i elite cooler.,"the h150i was 360mm and couldn't be top mounted in my corsair 4000x case so went for the 240mm h100i, with x3 front fans and x1 exhaust",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"good to know as a comparison, thanks.",hopefully heat production is better in the 12th gen as believe oc is handled differently,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
quess im stupid aswell mine is 240mm so i quess i have the h100i aswell ðÿ˜… hard to keep count of all part names,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hi!,just to say i decided to unmount cpu heatsink and change the thermal paste.,so far so good.,went from 95â°c to almost 70â°c at full load.,are laptops always this hot?,edit: room temperature 23â°c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dell laptops run hot..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
those are nice temps.,my old i7 4810mq hitting 80c just opening chrome!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is turbo boost running?,"why is the max clock around 3.3ghz, with boost shouldn't this go above 4 ghz....

also what score did u get in cinebench r23?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hi all.,"i have the same laptop and i'm looking for some upgrades, my like ram and ssd.",i wondering if: * it's compatible with xmp functions?,wich is the (real) maximum top ram that it's supported.,dell says it is 32gb.,crucial at their website argue 64!,"i may say similar thing happened to me with my macbook pro, apple said it was a 8gb maximum ram meanwhile it was capable to support wonderfuly the double!.",what you think?,thanks pals!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"damn, my 11370h runs at 95â° c at full load too.",thanks i'll give repasting a go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dang!,didn't know at the time of buying.,did some research but not enough it seems.,btw i'm in argentina,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so i should not be worried, right?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i will perform another test as i can't recall the score.,also i'm gonna check turbo boost settings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh man i never saw this.,i'm so sorry.,yes it is compatible.,keep your bios up to date.,i would stick to 2x16 3200mhz as it is overkill for almost everything.,you'd sureley benefit from more memory but only in heavy tasks like video editing or rendering where you also be limited by gpu.,adressing ssd i bought a wd black sn750 gen 3x4 and it works lovely.,this is merely my opinion.,dell cites 32 gb in dual channel as max memory config and i think it's plenty.,happy cake day btw!!,cheers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i used artic cooling mx-4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same my 11370h goes above 90 just by opening chrome or playing youtube.,did u find any solution for it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
buy a cooling pad.,maybe that will help,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as per notebookcheck.net, 11300h max temp is 100c so your temps are pretty much considered ice cold.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hehe that happens sometimes, isnâ´t?.","the important is your answer, i appreciate.",thank you.,have a nice day!,and see you next time.,cheers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don't use mx4 on laptops.,use thicker paste like gelid or kryonaut,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i thought 100c was like an absolute max before breaking.,not working temp.,great then!,thanks a lot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
indeed.,"you too, cheers!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm kinda lost here.,can you elaborate?,will i get better temps with a thicker paste?,is there any issue with mx4?,am i going to have to repaste more often?,tia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
arctic mx4 has a very high flow rate which means that in laptops with tight heatsinks they tend to flow off the dye very often (has happened to me many times) this means u will have to repaste more often while wasting perfectly good thermal paste every time.,getting thicker thermal pastes for laptops are often far better.,sorry for the late response,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

or its top binding chip that can get desktop 125watt performance with 90 watt?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a good ~2.5kg gaming laptop (such as asus strix 17, legion 7, zephyrus duo/s17, alienware x17) can sustain around 90w for the cpu, plus the desktop die has a larger die area to lower thermal density.","itâ€™s doable to cool it under load, the issue is just idle draw aka battery life.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they can sacrifice mobility by adding more fans i guess,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good bot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this.,too many people consider binning to be difficult only for max performance without considering how their high voltage helps lesser chips.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had the s17 briefly.,and it could do upto 130w max without throttling under max fans.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the s17 is very unique with the lift up design.,"the duo is the same, but ryzen would only do 90w no matter how much cooling you throw at it.",it does 90w at lower temps than any other ryzen laptop with max fan though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"usb and fan wise, itâ€™s fine.","you can use a fan hub without issue, just make sure itâ€™s a pwm hub since theyâ€™re pwm fan.","if you find you need more usb ports, there are headers to add in expansion cards.",ocâ€™ing i donâ€™t care much about.,these newer cpus already run close to their limit.,you might gain 5% performance from an oc.,"the vrms on the board are the biggest issue, they seem to run really hot on long workloads.","if you can ensure airflow is reaching the area, it should be okay though.","if it gives you peace of mind, iâ€™d spend a little extra on a better board.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what specific 3dmark benchmark are you comparing?,timespy?,firestrike?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hopefully this will help at least somewhat.,thanks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"new results on 3dmark (time spy) after installing the newest driver

graphics score 1827

graphics test 1 11.84 fps

graphics test 2 10.54 fps

not much of an improvement, sadly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i hadn't paid much attention to it at the time, but it was timespy for iris xe and night-something  for 520. i'm sure the results would be more or less consistent across the board.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's not how the 3dmark benchmarks work.,the night raid benchmark is intended for testing laptops with integrated graphics and is a lighter workload.,"the timespy benchmark is much more geared towards testing more powerful pcs and is a heavier 3d workload under directx 12.

you can't compare scores across different benchmarks.","for a true apples-to-apples comparison, you should run night raid on laptop 2 and/or timespy on laptop 1.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so yeah... you should be comparing firestrike.,the reason the iris xe is shown to be performing lower is because it's a ray tracing capable gpu (albeit terribly) while the 520 is not.,so timespy scores between a ray tracing capable gpu aren't comparable to one that isn't capable.,3dmark doesn't do a very good job of illustrating this or make it apparent but yeah.. that's why there's such a discrepancy there..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i've done a driver reinstall and am currently about to run time spy on 2, hopefully to see better results",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in the end, i've done night raid on both and iris xe ultimately came out with better results.",i suppose i've done all i can from software point - the other solution would be to mess to ram.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"gaming benchmarks on a xeon w part, i'm not too sure if anyone is benchmarking that today.","for content creation/compiling, check [puget systems](https://www.pugetsystems.com/all_articles.php) for performance.",you might have to switch between two articles/blogs to get the performance of the core i9-12900k vs any of the xeon w-3300 processors.,hope this helps!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
first off the e cores are about equivalent to the 7700k cores without hyper threading.,on the desktop parts e core really means space and not performance.,any build that will include gaming would be the 12900k as clock speed is king.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
w-3335 would probably be quite a bit slower unless you have a workload that utilizes avx512 and **lots** of memory bandwidth.,"the mesh interconnect utilized in intel's hedt parts make them poorly suited for workload like gaming, especially ice lake which is simply unable to hit high clock frequencies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"definitely the 12900k, just saying.","itâ€™s a whole $400 cheaper than the w3323, and given it almost matches the ryzen 9 5950x in multicore, it should have no problem beating the w-3335, which has the same core count but substantially lower clocks and ipc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why not get the b660 and the i5 if youâ€™re not going to overclock anyway?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have the 12600k and msi pro-a with a 3080. it is a very capable cpu and if you are only gaming there is very little difference between the 12600k and 12700.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i probably wouldnâ€™t get the f in case you need to rma your video card for any reason and need onboard video while waiting for your new one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
asus prime b660 would not be a good board for a 12700 if you want the max performance.,it has mediocre vrms.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a oced i5 might get a few more avg fps but still have lower 1% low because less cache,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have the asus prime b660-plus board paired with an i5-12400 and i face freezing issues in every 24-36 hours which require a hard restart.,not sure about the cause yet.,but i would definitely suggest you not to go for that board because there is a fair chance that it could be the board or the bios.,rest of the parts were working perfectly fine on my old overclocked 8700k system from years.,i regret for not going for a cheap board instead and spend those $100 on a 12700f.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12400 or 12700,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 12700f has no overlooking and no graphics, the latter of which could come back to bite you should your graphics card break and you don't have a spare pc.",the 12600k has fewer performance cores than the 12700f which would reduce your multi-threaded performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you get that 55% better single core and 113% better multicore.","\-----

anyhow, if you want to put a bit more money, then the i5-12400 is probably the best low-mid budget cpu at the moment and the 12700 (non-k) makes for a great higher end cpu, but based on your original listings i guess those are out of the price range you are targeting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
buddy of mine upgraded from a 6600k to a 9700 35w.,even that lower power version of the i7 was a huuuuuge difference in performance even though the 6600k was overclocked and drawing probably 100w lol.,core count is more important in 2022.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

10400f yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"get i5 10400f if u need more cores and threads and better ipc and cannot wait

i3 10105f is more like sidegrade, i3 10105 does not offer any good features like its still on pcie 3, same 4 core, same arch but with better ipc so not really a upgrade from 6600k

i feel like you should wait and upgrade to intel 12th gen or amd 6000series that will truly be upgrade in terms of features and performance also.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m still using my 8700kâ€¦ i donâ€™t get why everyone loves blowing money constantly on new shit that comes out literally every month ðÿ˜‚,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have just made a similar move from an overclocked 6600k (@4.6ghz) to an i5 12400f and do not regret it for a second.,appreciate it is slightly different but i think you wouldnâ€™t be happy with a 10105f coming from the 6600k.,the extra cores will impact positively.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you do any gaming at all get the 10600k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
either is a big leap in ipc and gaming performance.,the i3 gets you a better ipc and 8 threads.,you'll get much better multitasking performance on the i5 with more cores + threads.,if all you do is game then the i3 would be enough,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"difference between getting 4 extra threads or 8 extra threads, the choice is obvious when the total cost difference of mobo + cpu is â‚¬120 or â‚¬170.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"double the gens, double the fun.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is too simplified.,"4 extra threads, or +2 cores and 6 threads, are both good upgrades over the 4c4t he has now.","of course, for just +4t he should contider a used 6700k rather than switching platforms.","and the 12th gen should really only be considered if he can afford e-cores in the 12600k or higher, which by the sounds of it he can't.",the non-e-core 12 series performs about on par with 11th/10th/etc.,gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

> either is a big leap in ipc and gaming performance.,"except they aren't, skylake and comet lake have the same ipc, although the extra l3 cache on the i3 (8mb vs 6mb) should help in certain scenarios.","he'll see a *slight* performance increase in single thread from higher clock speed *if* his current cpu isn't already overclocked (6600k can be pushed usually to a minimum of 4.5ghz and a max of 5ghz), the main gains will be multi-threaded performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great work!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'd pay 50 for that extra 2c4t, but 120 just for 4 threads (and 4 years of architecture improvements) ain't bad either.","with a chip as old as the 6600k, it's honestly difficult to go wrong in replacing it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they're both skylake uarch so parent is technically correct.,"each gen from 7-10 was a refresh of 6, only adding cores or threads, but the same core.","some things benefit, some don't.","but on 12th gen, *all* things benefit, and it's cheap now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

can i ask how come you are looking to upgrade?,10700k in a z590 board is very much a modern system.,have you tried overclocking to get what you are trying to achieve?,if not the 10850k have great overclocking options.,and i hear that the 11900k have even more overclocking features.,with gear 1 and gear 2 memory configs to play with.,but these chips are already outclassed by chips built on a newer process node.,if you stick with the 10700k you can likely upgrade again when intel and amd move onto intel 20a or tsmc n2 nodes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for what scenarios do you think you need to replace your 10700k?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i do not really see the point of upgrading within generation.,you also did not state any reason why you want to upgrade.,"based on these two factors i would say ""no, you should not upgrade"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">3070ti performance is lacking in 4k especially with raytracing

you omitted this crucial part of information from your question.",you are playing in 4k and raytracing.,"to simplify things a little: 

* your cpu dictates what is the maximum frames per second you can display in the lowest possible resolution like 320x240
* your gpu dictates what is the highest resolution you can play with about the same fps and you can play on that 320x240 resolution.",at 4k and raytracing you will always be gpu limited with any of the modern cpus.,you could probably have an i3 from 2 gens back and have pretty similar fps than you have with 12600k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'll believe it when i see it.,we had these double performance leaks for the last 2 generations and in the end it was a 25-40% gain.,"they can make a card twice as fast on tsmc 5nm, but if it ever comes it will be a flagship product for 3k+ dollars and it will be very power hungry.",the midrange lineup will be much more conservative.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i've been running my 12700k at 65w (for both pl1 and pl2) recently.,"if you're mainly gaming, you probably won't notice a practical difference in performance in most games.","on my gpu (3070 ti) and screen resolution (1440p uw), i found that there's no meaningful performance loss at 65w compared to stock.","for example, in cyberpunk 2077, the 12700k only draws around 81w in the in-game benchmark in my current settings.","setting the power limit to 65w had no effect on the fps (the difference, if any, is less than 1 fps).","in far cry 6, under a setting that is about 120 fps, the difference between 100w and 65w is 3fps.","on the other hand, 65w results in a big improvement in thermals and fan noise.","if you have a small cooler with low heat capacity, you'll also avoid sudden spikes in wattage that can result in the fan rapidly spinning up and down (which is undesirable noise).","this is for the 12700k, but it should be similar with your 12600k.","in multi-core productivity workloads, you'll take a sizable hit, but given that you're asking this question, i'm assuming that maximizing multi-core productivity performance is not the primary objective.","in any case, at 65w, you'll still be far more efficient than comparable zen 3 cpus.","in cinebench r23, i get around 15k at 65w on my 12700k, which is approximately on par with the 5800x at stock (which has a default ppt of 142w i believe).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thanks for such a detailed response.,mind if i dm you?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
where did you come up with the value of 65w?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"can you confirm something for me: if you set 12700k power limit to 65w in bios, does that make the actual total package power consumption 65w in hwinfo?",or would it still go over that (bios power limit maybe for cpu cores only etc)?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">just set thermal throttling at 95c

is this a specific function within bios?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for the use case the op gave, a sff pc, i don't recommend this approach as just letting thermal throttling regulate the heat will make it dramatically louder and may result in lower overall performance because you are likely going to heat the entire interior of the case if you use this strategy, causing the gpu to throttle as well.","setting a smart power limit for the cpu will result in a much better acoustic profile, and possibly better gaming performance too depending on the exact case and cooler used.","i'm not sure what the idea wattage is, it might be better to go a little higher than 65w if the cooling can handle it, but capping the power draw at a level you can cool instead of letting it constantly thermally throttle is a much better idea.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sure thing.,feel free to dm.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's usually the stock power limit for intel chips (at least was) so ig there?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, for me, the power limit is exactly reflected in the total package power in hwinfo64.",at least this is so on my motherboard (asus b660-i rog strix).,"cyberpunk 2077 actually shoots past the limit a bit, and causes the total package power to spike as high as 72w when pl2 and set to 65w.","however, cp2077 seems to be an anomaly, since every other game i've played so far respects the power limit in terms of the total package power.",maybe its code is just extremely cpu intensive to the extent that it is able to fool the motherboard's power limits to some extent.,"i can confirm that cinebench r23 multicore stays at 65w maximum for the total package power, with no spikes above 65w.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sometimes.,it depends on your specific board.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's cool.,what sort of performance degradation compared to stock do you get at 65w?,"i saw in tpu's power limiting article that the 12900k seems to lose a lot of performance if you try limiting it to less than 100w, but i figure the 12700 can go much lower since it has fewer cores?",and do you lose st at all when limiting or only mt?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
st maxes out at 37w for me in cinebench.,"so a power limit at 65w only affects mt and not st.

as for performance loss, i believe i benched around 22k in cinebench multicore with stock power limits.","so from 22k at stock wattage to 15k at 65w, the difference is -32% mt performance.","i have some additional data on the [pcpartpicker page](https://pcpartpicker.com/b/n63tt6) for my build (at that time, i used 75w, but later switched to 65w because cyberpunk was shooting over the power limit).",that's all the data i have.,i've read that tpu article on 12900k under different power limits.,"it looks off to me, because they only got 11.3k cinebench at 75w and 14.9k at 100w.",this seems too low.,"[hardware unboxed/techspot](https://www.techspot.com/review/2391-intel-core-i7-12700/) tested the 12700 non-k and got 16k at pl2 = 65w (they used stock power levels for pl1 and ran for 10 minutes, i believe, so their 16k test result is a little higher than if pl1 is also at 65w).",i tested \~16k at 75w and \~15k at 65w (using the same value for pl1 and pl2) for my 12700k.,"a [post on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/qwn1j9/core_i912900k_performance_efficiency_at_various/) on the 12900k tested only a 32% performance loss in mt at 75w, but this is on a different benchmark.","it's possible that the 12900k has inefficient scheduling at lower power levels compared to the 12700 k/non-k, but this seems unlikely to me because intel does have low-powered variants of the 12900 series.",maybe tpu got a sample that was unusually weak at low powers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"with stock specifications, on paper, the difference is quite minor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's 5% more performance for 12.5% higher price, and you'll have to get a beefier cooler too, especially if you want to take advantage of the overclocking potential.",but you probably won't see a performance gain in games or most applications unless you're using like a 3090 on 1080p.,"but if you want ultimate performance, the 12700k is kinda the best, a lot cheaper than the 12900k and most of the power.",and i'm pretty sure you can do an oc on the 12700 with bclk on some motherboards.,look it up to see if your mobo can oc a 12700 non k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
both of them have same core and theat i think non k better you can save 40$ to buy your game that you like,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the two big differences between k an non k are: 1) overclocking 2) unlimited boost times.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i assume you ran the integrated memtest in the bios and it passed all stages long before installing an os so the ram is stable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this sounds like the more likely situation (if it's not just a software bug) as it could've been a poorly binned 12500 that just couldn't meet the extra frequency & thus was used for the slightly lower clocked 12400 and the eus might've been forgotten/overlooked like you mentioned.,"stuff like this has happened for the longest time now; amd's old ""3 core"" cpus were actually defective quads and could sometimes be able to enable the extra core and have it run stable.",as well as current gen ryzen skus being basically determined by how many cores are functional on a single ccx.,"if any of the 8 cores are ""bad' that die gets used for a 5600x or 5900x.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what cooler you got on it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you made any adjustments in the bios at all ?,at a minimum i would suggest a fan curve for silence and peformance plus pump speed.,then xmp ?,is the cpu on auto settings.,usually the motherboard supplies a little more power than the cpu needs so you can undervolt a little or overclock.,i would do a simple undervolt start small negative offset 0.05 to 0.10 until you get whea erros in hwinfo64 running cinebench r23.,then go back up 1 setting to where it should be stable.,"or


llc its better to run a more droopy line.",medium or low even.,that would drop vcore a little so temps will drop as well.,still check for errors tho.,other than that it could be the weather or maybe dust build up where the intakes are.,if all that fails check the pump itself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i just had the same issue on my 12700, get a better cpu cooler, the stock cooler can only cool the 12/11700(f) if it's using the low 65 watts power, once it boosts and uses up to 180 watts the stock cooler cannot cope anymore and you get the 90-100 degrees, if you really want to use it now and can't instantly buy a better cooler you could temporarily limit the cpu to the 65 watts pl1 spec, and unlimit it again once you have a better cooler, i'm currently doing just that, it does decrease performance by a bit, but depending on the game it might be acceptable for the time being until you can buy a better cooler.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

itâ€™s the default intel cooler that came with the processor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did switching to a higher amount help lower the temperature?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then there's uh... not much you can do.,"you can undervolt (and/or underclock the cpu a bit), but it is recommended to change the cooler.","the stock coolers are capable for cooling something between 60-100w (before the gpu starts producing heat in games), but the 11th gen cpus can use 80-120w in games, sometimes even higher.",it is not sufficient for something like a 11700f at default speeds,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
set pl1 and pl2 both to 65w.,you're putting 100w into a heatsink designed for less.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, the opposite.",you'll need a new cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the heat comes from the power usage of your cpu.,"so if you increase the power limit, the cpu can only get hotter.","after you get a new cooler, you can try increasing the power limit.",you can gain more performance by allowing your cpu to use more power to boost higher and for longer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah made it worse lol.,but the cooler wasnâ€™t that hard to get.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's fair, at least it means there's nothing wrong with the processor itself.",still it makes me wonder why intel would knowingly sell their cpus with underpowered stock coolers.,are there any cooler recommendations you can give me?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i don't know what any of that means, can you dumb it down for me?","ps: i got it, you are talking about undervolting the cpu so that the heatsink can work properly.",thats a good solution that i'll be trying next.,"if that doesn't work, i'll look into buying a new affordable cooler.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that stock cooler is fine for someone doing basic office tasks, or browsing the internet.",i think the assumption is that the enthusiast market will install more capable cooling solutions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the intel cooler is designed to cool 65w with short bursts to 125w (that should be the stock setting of the cpu).,however many motherboards use different power limit or don't use power limit at all on default - this is mainly a problem with rocket lake which hasn't been solved idk why.,"rocket lake was probably the worst intel generation in last 20 years by the way :d.

so go in bios and set power limit to 65w , you should have temperatures under 90â°c with that, otherwise the cooler is badly mounted.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they don't.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
get an aftermarket cooler.,stock fans generally aren't very good for unlocked / higher end cpus.,"noctua makes the best air coolers, they're dirt cheap and perform as good as aios most of the time.",they also have better mounting systems.,noctua has a steel plate that really does a super job.,i'm pretty sure intel just has plastic bits you plop in and call it good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"depending on where you live, low cost solutions are usually stuff like the cooler master hyper 212 (or 212 evo), thermalright ak120/ax120/true spirit 120, id-cooling se-224-xt, proartist gratify 3 etc.","if your case won't fit these 150-160mm tall coolers, look for 90mm fan coolers which are usually 125mm tall.",stuff like the id-cooling se-914-xt or noctua u9s (there should be other stuff cheaper than the fairly expensive noctua coolers),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's not really undervolting, it just detects the amount of power being used and reduces frequency on purpose, until it uses less than the value you typed in.","(in fact it will still try to give the voltage for unlimited boost speeds, so for productivity work with relatively constant power usage it can be less efficient than manually limiting cpu speed.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
will that reduce perfomance by much?,and after i buy a better cooler can i restore the settings back to normal?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they certainly do.,their stock coolers have been totally inadequate for many years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you so much!,iâ€™ll start looking into it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s pretty neat!,so basically setting a limit to the maximum voltage instead of negatively offsetting it completely.,how do i do that?,i downloaded throttlestop and tried to undervolt following youtube tutorials but it didnâ€™t seem to make much difference.,can you teach me roughly how can i achieve that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yes of course after you buy better cooler you can probably set power limit to unlimited because the cpu won't take more than 150w(that is, if 100% loaded with for example 3d rendering, games never use 100%) with the limit removed.",if the cooler you will get is good then it should cool that down just fine.,locking to 65w will decrease the performance yes but it depends on the game.,in worst case it should decrease only 20% performance though which is worth it i'd say instead of boiling the cpu at 100â°c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
agree with the guy below.,"look at the scythe mugen rev 5. i built an 11400f system for my wife and the case is a lani li 205m, but the width is like 155mm.","the evo 212 is 160mm, so it didn't fit.","just make sure before you buy any cpu cooler, you check case compatibility.",also make sure you check ram clearance.,"if running two sticks, you'll generally be fine.","if not, then you might want a direct air downflow cpu cooler.",personally i like all in one (aio) water coolers.,"they are easy, less stress on the mobo, and cleans up the case.",noctua makes great coolers as well.,"keep in mind larger fans move more air at least noise, so if you get a 92mm fan, it will be more noisy than a 120mm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"do at least check out all options, pricing can vary a lot (depending on import costs, who is the local importer for these brands etc.).","the tall coolers you can also check out noctua's u12s/u12s redux/c14s, scythe's mugen 5/fuma 2.

the intel coolers are supposed to work with the claimed 65w tdp, but pretty much every board you get for building a pc defaults to unlimited power, so the stock cooler essentially became 'proof that the cpu functions' to the 90% of people who don't touch the bios.","&#x200b;

btw, although 2666 ram sounds like the green 'value' ram in 2022, in case you got these from an older pc, you might consider checking out if you really are running at 2666 in the task manager.",older ram might need to turn on the xmp factory overclock profile in the bios.,"(new ram with overclock profiles pretty much start at 3200, but back when ddr4 was new 2666 might be the standard for 'gaming' ram)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you have to get in bios, there find some setting related to cpu power limit and set that to 65w.",the cpu will then be limited to consume only 65w of power which means it will heat up less.,intel stock cooler is basically designed for cpus to run at 65w.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the difference in undervolting isn't as big as you think unfortunately.,"also frequency is not voltage, in case you happen to get it wrong.",you can view it as 'you need a minimum of x voltage for the cpu to do a specific frequency.',"if power limits are reached, it will still give the same voltage, but frequency is artificially reduced to reduce the power draw.","&#x200b;

(edit: a slight underclock, such as manually limiting frequency to 4ghz can also reduce power draw/heat, because the voltage supply drops.",however it will affect gaming experience if cores are 'not fast enough' to do the work provided by the game...),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it doesn't seem to do that in my case, it keeps giving something like 1.3v on my 11700f even at 3.5ghz",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh, i thought the frequency and the voltage were kind of the same thing (the amount of power that goes into the cpu).",iâ€™m pretty new to the pc building world so sorry if i misunderstood some concepts hahah.,how do i set the frequency as you say?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in throttlestop you can go to the 'fivr' tab and set it on the lower left corner, where you will see numbers like 49, 47, 46 etc, these are the clock speed multiplied by 10 basically.","you can try lowering it by a few ticks at a time, say -4 for all of them, and see if temperatures go down.","i think you can also change that in the bios of your pc, but i haven't built a pc so i have no experience on these 'detailed' bios menus",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"by the way, if you apply a undervolt and/or underclock through throttlestop i think you have to open throttlestop every time you reboot the pc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would be nice if you included ambient temps voltages and clock/ring values with temps underload in like linpack.,it's just because it's idle temps which is almost meaningless to a certain extent of course but it would be nice if you included more info.,not trying to be a twat btw and say it's not impressive i'm just interested to hear the rest of it that's all ðÿ‘œ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

all that says is the readouts are wrong.,temps canâ€™t be below ambient without exotic cooling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i can confirm.,"my room is usually 17â±1 â°c, and that's the kind of idle temperatures i get on my 12700k (though i have an nh-d15 with a custom fan profile).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"temps aren't accurate at low values, it says minimum 15c for me but my room temp is above that",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is not possible to have lower temps than ambient... unless you use exotic cooling solutions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

something isn't right with these readings.",it is not possible for your cpu to be lower than ambient.,"it defies physics (obviously unless you're using some very funky cooling methods, which you are not).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then any temperature below 24c means the numbers are incorrect.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is thermodynamically impossible to run lower than ambient without some source of external chilling.,your numbers are off.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"asus for the looks, bios, rgb works better than other two, mobo software is also better

one thing where is gpu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i went with rog strix 690 a only because i didnt want to buy ddr5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
go with an asus rog maximus-which depends on how much power you need-12900?,at least a hero imo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
where is the _gpu_,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the only thing i can afford on this picture is those noodles.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have the asus z690e with a rog strix 3080 with the same aio but all my fans are ql120 and i have to say the pc runs beautifully and my temperatures for cpu stay at about 35 degrees c when gaming and my gpu is at 65 degrees and i get minimum 144fps in all games i play with all settings on high,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i was gonna recommend the tuf z690, but you got ddr5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm running the z690 aero d - ram support has been painful, but basically every atx z690 board in their lineup can put more juice into an lga1700 socket than any cpu currently using that socket could actually put to use.","this is probably more of a z690 thing than a gigabyte thing, though.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

did you have to use an old gen cpu to update the bio?,been reading reports that you have to update bios to work intel 12k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i can see my bug report in the pdf release notes, on the ""known issues"" part (last one).",but nothing about the windows explorer 10 and 11 memory leak caused by the intel graphics driver  unfortunately.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
youâ€™re probably set to the maximum performance power plan in windows.,thereâ€™s no reason for that.,use balanced.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
clear cmos.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
c-states that's it.,if you're running a 10900k for gaming purposes then keep it disabled you don't want it to idle at base clock speeds,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
uninstall whatever overclocking app that you have.,even msiafterburner can mess with clock speeds.,sometimes intel chip speeds get stuck in intel xtu for whatever reason.,try to reset the bios defaults and if necessary update to the latest bios versions.,check what apps you have running in the background.,"if this issue still persists after disabling all these apps, i am out of ideas.",maybe reset the cmos battery.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good suggestion.,checked it and it was on balanced.,"reset to defaults and no change, still at 4.9ghz.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"c-states were all set to ""auto"", which i think for this board is disabled.","to test this, i set them to enabled but still no change.","based on the suggestions, i think the 10900k should be able to idle down, but i need to figure out the bios on this motherboard.",i'll take it to a different sub.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just get the i7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"12900k is going to be mostly useful over the 12700k for long intense calculations, like rending a video, or shorter intense calculations where 3.5 seconds is desirable over 5 seconds.","i mean, youâ€™re not going to go wrong with a 12900k.",but is your budget more comfortable with the 12700k?,then you kinda have your answer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if using windows 10 then go for the i7 and disabled e-cores because a lot of games still having problems assigning the task to the right cores (i have heard windows 11 helps).,if you plan on going windows 11 then go for the i9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12900k for workloads and 1080p gaming.,12700k for 1440p-4k gaming only.,for your situation it's looking like a 12900k would be more beneficial.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
diminishing returns.,are you prepared to spend twice as much for a 15 percent improvement?,if you want the best of the best then go ahead.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
get the i7 12700k.,the performance delta between the i7 and i9 is really small compared to the price increase for the i9.,you can further oc the 12700k a bit to bridge the gap even further.,"if you're not doing ""crazy ultra 4k gaming"" or really super cpu intensive tasks on a regular basis then it's unlikely you'll notice a difference, but, that extra $200+ or so can be spent elsewhere in your build.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'd save your money and use it towards a gpu- just get an i5-12600,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
general advice: get the best cpu you can afford.,ideally you're going to keep this thing for years.,it could last you through 2 gpu generations or more.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12600k overclocked.,impressive cpu + igpu perf.,"easily pushable to 5.1~5.2 ghz without causing heat issues, igpu can be overclocked to 2.2 ghz.",and the bonus is ram overclock.,more than ideal for aaa games,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my budget probably would be more comfortable with a 12700k.,"however if the 129000k would be substantially better for my usage, than i'd be able to get that too.","by the sounds of it, the i7 is probably my best bet, especially since it seems that the performance is too far off by the sounds of it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not trying to be overly pedantic, but 12600 is a pretty pointless sku imo.","12400 makes sense as a value option, while the 12600k adds e cores and is overclockable.","12600 has no e cores, no oc, and doesn't offer a significant enough clock speed improvement to justify the price.",overall i agree with you.,"for only gaming op should get an i5, and upgrade in the future when they actually need more processing power.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you either get 12400 or 12600k.,not 12600,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™m not familiar with the demands of heavy weather modelling, so could you describe what that would entail?",is it like long grinding calculations that end up producing a model you then study at your leisure?,heavy real-time calculations for a live simulation?,or more like photoshop grade crunching with short intense bursts as you change parameters?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"from my understanding, it is sort of a combination of the first two that you mentioned.",leaning more towards real time calculations though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a 12700k is likely going to be adequate.,"youâ€™re only really losing out on 4 efficiency cores, and the software may not be able to use that many threads anyways.","if youâ€™re not overclocking you might also consider a 12700 and removing the power limits, which causes it to bench pretty close to a 12700k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you also have to think about cooling.,the 12900k is *hot.,"* while coolers like the nh-d15 and 360mm rads will stop it from thermal throttling, they are quite expensive for a cpu cooler, which may break the budget.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"weather modeling software will most probably be heavy on single thread performance than multithread ... 

get the i7, the i9 only gives you additional 4 little cores and that's not really much of an improvement unless you're gonna be rendering stuff",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, i had actually worked the nh-d15 into my budget.",i also got a really good airflow case as well.,the temp though is my biggest concern.,i like everything about the i9 except for the temperatures.,"i suppose if i can get results close enough to the i9 with the i7 without dealing with the high temp, then the i7 is probably my best rout.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i suppose you can go ahead on the 900k.,"it might not live as long, but its still very compelling for rendering, even against the 5950x",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"upgrading from a i5 to a same generation i7 or i9 is financially pointless, unless itâ€™s 4 years from now and you still have the same system and the cpus are now dirt cheap.","upgrading from 9th to 10th also seems pointless, especially since you need a new motherboard.","i would stay with what you have and look at what else might be more worthwhile updates, like how much memory you have, what your storage is, or your gpu.","if you insist on spending money on a new system, donâ€™t go for anything less then 12th gen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would there be a noticeable performance boost with a 12th gen chip?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"passmark shows your 9600k having a score of 10,800 multithreaded and 2770 single thread.","even the absolute bottom of the line i3-12100 scores 14,600 and 3560. an i5-12600k scores 27,000 and 3970.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lmao wtf.,okay noted gonna look into that.,thank you ðÿ™ðÿ¼,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
could you please compare 8700k and 12700k in the same way?,i looked at the passmark website but all i saw was software for sale..?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

120mm aio is not enough to cool the 12900k.,you want a 240mm at minimum or a beefy air cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lmao what the fuck is cyberpower smoking.,"120mm aio is awful, not going to cool a 12900k at all.",yeah you 100% need to get a new cooler.,this clown case is silly.,i'm not sure how feasible it would be to replace the front with an aio+fans.,i can't imagine much air flow between the glass and the front grill.,i can't even recommend a good air cooler like a u12a because i have no idea what the height clearance is allowable in that case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"friend , i got custom loop, 2x360 rad (40mm ) and i can hit around 95c in linx ( 330w tdp ) 5.2 , so 120 it's not enough",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you should never hit 100c in gaming with an aio.,"if you are, i would personally rma.","i wouldn't worry about hitting 100c in cinebench (if power limits are removed), this is going to happen with most coolers if you don't undervolt.","i test coolers, and only a few can keep it under tjmax in cinebench.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
holy cow a 120 is not a proper match to the 12900k.,"if you canâ€™t fit a bigger radiator, youâ€™d be better off with air cooling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you have an 240+ watt part with around maybe 65-85 watt cooler maxed even a nh-d15 can't keep the 12900k at bay in workloads and it supports around 185 watts.,see if you can set you cpu to 65 watts until you get a new cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just to be clear, when you post ""appears to be another 120mm slot"", is there not a top exhaust fan in your prebuilt?",did they sell you this in current configuration or did you select pieces and they built it?,curious what psu was added to the mix.,maybe aio needs remounting...i'd rma and let them figure it out.,"you have the core hardware for a very nice rig, yet you need a better aio and perhaps case to match your cpu/gpu down the road.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

set a power limit.,"the extreme wattage on these things was to hit a mark in a benchmark for a press release, and provides very little incremental performance for most people.",however your aio is still probably inadequate.,"if you want to try air, the u12a handles 12900k with a pl of maybe 190w and perhaps a slight undervolt.","d15 should also handle it, just huge and harder to fit around ram, etc.",noctua has measurements and a pretty good database of which cases fit each fan or not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep.,360mm aio or a noctua nh-d15.,"120mm aio is nowhere near enough, even for a 12600k/12700k i wouldn't use a 120mm aio.","that was like when i used a hyper 212 evo v2 on my i7 12700k and was surprised it was hitting 100c in every bench, xd.","and compared to the i7, the i9 is a heat monster.",definitely get a 360-420mm aio on that bastard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"am i better off doing the adaptive undervolt like i have been, or just setting it to a wattage max?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

have side panel off right now - in general 5-10c cooler.,"that being said, the cpu still spikes up to 97c randomly, and really fast, which makes me wonder if the aio or thermal paste wasn't applied correctly, as it should take a lot more time to ramp up to high temps right?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you have any hq thermal paste on hand?,"if so, iâ€™d take off the cooler, clean off any paste with alcohol and a microfiber cloth.",reapply and reseat.,"if they applied way too much paste, which is likely, itâ€™s gonna act more like an insulator which does not help the case for a 120mm cooler.","if you need to buy paste, iâ€™d blow a small desk fan toward the interior of the case to help cool it down in the meantime.","on top of the hot air just being trapped in the case, they are relying on that air with a 120mm radiator to cool down the processor?",what idiots!,when you get a new radiator make sure itâ€™s at the front to make sure itâ€™s getting cooler by the ambient air getting pulled in.,how hot is your cooler liquid?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"hi,

it is a common behavior that the temperatures reach higher while a prime95 run than in gaming scenarios, because the cpu load in prime95 is a lot higher than in gaming.",70 degrees celsius in gamign situations are totally fine.,"br, nexocgaming",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that is high, you probably applied the paste wrong.",or over/undertightened the ihs connection.,"just take it apart, examine it and reapply.",cooler master if i remember recommends case airflow 40 in/50 out (the remaining ten is from leaks and for pressure).,when you run a benchmark does the temperature jump or increase gradually?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
prime95 small fft: yeah it can easily hit 100'c on one core alone.,"this actually goes down as you add more threads and the power budget lowers each core clocks, while overall chip temp goes up each added core.","there are a lot of temp sensors around 12th gen, and some very dense heat outputting silicon.",but small-fft is an unrealistic scenario you'll never run in the real world.,if temps are fine for your use case (gaming) carry on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a 12700k and a scythe fuma 2 i'll check what my temps are to compare to yours later,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there have been reports of cpu bending due to socket/motherboard or cooler factors, causing suboptimal contact with the cooler and high(er) temperatures.","it may be your case, or it may not.","i'd really like to see a statement from intel or motherboard manufacturers about such reports, by the way.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it jumps quickly.,from idle temps in the mid-20s to 80s.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you very much for your patience.,we have not received reports of 12th gen intel core processors running outside of specifications due to changes to the integrated heat spreader (ihs).,our internal data show that the ihs on 12th gen desktop processors may have slight deflection after installation in the socket.,such minor deflection is expected and does not cause the processor to run outside of specifications.,we strongly recommend against any modifications to the socket or independent loading mechanism (ilm).,such modifications would result in the processor being run outside of specifications and may void any product warranties.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"id say its a paste problem then... you may have overtightened or undertightened the heatsync, which will be exacerbated when you set the pc upright as well.",take apart and reapply.,"no need to wipe the paste, just gather it up and spread evenly on on surface, leave the other surface be as long as the goo isnt coming over the edges.",i like to se the cpu as the primary surface.,also check that the aio cables and radiator are positioned accorting to the instructions.,people shaft that up because they work on the internals with the pc lying flat on its side.,happens all the time.,"when screwing back down do it in stages, tighten all the screws, then tighten to the same feel to final position - go from screw to screw diagonally in a criss cross pattern to avoid spreading the paste in one direction.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for addressing this matter.,"is it known if some motherboard or cooler models are better than others, with respect to deflection?",(preventing/minimizing deflection),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks.,i loosened all the screws and then did the x pattern when tightening them.,dropped the temps on cinebench to low 90s.,"(finally got my hands on a 3070 ti this afternoon, so spent some time installing that.","will run more tests and may reseat it completely, but it seems like i may have overtightened.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"based on current data, we canâ€™t attribute the ihs deflection variation to any specific vendor and/or socket mechanism and our coolers do keep the processor under the specifications; therefore, if you are looking for a better cooling than ours, you will need to contact the oem (original equipment manufacturer) for advice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2 things.,a you asked about a ryzen build in i tle which i just find fun y but preformence wise it matters.,you don't have a dedicated gpu and you are basses of a igpu so gaming will be rough even if it is a ryzen apu.,but workstation wise you only have a ryzen 5 5600 so it will be ok but on the lower end.,overall for basic use of windows fine but it would be crappy for gaming and eh for professional work and 3s rendering that uses the cpu but also crappy for anything that needs a gpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"couple things:

1) the integrated graphics on ryzen apu's are very responsive to ram since they share system ram as their buffer.","i would try for a lower cl rating if possible, maybe cl16 for 3200mhz but the lower the better.","2) honestly, in the current market i think a laptop is far superior value for your dollar for a gaming pc.","for instance, [this msi gaming laptop is about 3x as powerful for graphics as your ryzen 5600g and costs the same as your build](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/msi-gf63-15-6-gaming-laptop-intel-core-i5-nvidia-geforce-gtx1650-256gb-ssd-8gb-memory-black/6492566.p?skuid=6492566) but includes a mouse, keyboard and screen plus you can take it to your friend's house or anywhere and still game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hi,

if you want to use the internal graphics of the r5 5600g, you should choose ram with better timings like 3.600 mhz cl16 oder 4.000 mhz cl18.","the ram you used is 3.200 mhz cl22 which is pretty weak, especially because graphics performance of apus improves a lot from faster ram.","br, nexocgaming",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"im only gonna be using this cuz right now i have an intel core i3, all im gonna use the pc im building for is just gonna be for low end gaming like roblox, minecraft, fornite, and valorant which is about it, and a little bit of youtube videos here and there, once i get on my feet with youtube hopefully, im gonna buy a new pc, i kinda have to build this pc now cuz i ordered 2 parts",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ah ok. then it should be ok for it but you probably will need to play on the low settings but i am not sure.,these days apus can be pretty good compared to nothing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
will it run gta 5 on low graphics or medium?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think so but i am not sure.,if i were you i would look on some videos online and see some videos that benchmark that cpu in games.,edit: i looked atlnd at all normal you can get around 80-90 fps but sometimes lower.,it is playable tho do that is good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

are your dimms qvl for 4x?,"i was skimming a random board qvl the other day and it seemed like a lot of ddr5 was rated for 1 dimm per channel operation, probably because the insanely high clock speed on ddr5 makes 2 dimms per channel really hard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

in my time in packaging at intel i had to do a lot of failure analysis.,try using acetone at first and let me know your results.,you might have to lightly scrap with the acetone degrading the film.,i normally would use epoxy to hold the die in place and used a rotating plate with sand paper and a variety of slurry's.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there are many b660 motherboards, so that depends.","as seen in a recent youtube video, some of them aren't even capable of running the cpus the manufacturer claims they should.","i think, as long as you pick a decent one, you'll be fine.",one thing to look for is good vrm and cooling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you have a 3090 and a seasonic 850w prime.,it's not uncommon for those particular units to trip with gpus that have high transient spikes like higher end ampere and both radeon vega cards.,run occt power + furmark and spam press the spacebar.,if the pc just shuts down after a while then your psu is one of seasonic's affected units.,newer seasonic psus like the evga g6 don't have that particular issue anymore.,otherwise it's probably just a windows thing maybe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i don't know that tool, but varying clocks is the default behavior, and seems the most reasonable.",5.1ghz should be the all-core (p-core) turbo for the 12900k.,"at least in earlier days, people who overclocked their cpus usually picked fixed frequencies to be sure the machine would be stable.",in particular they would disable any turbo.,"generally, higher clocks means more power use, although 35w isn't terrible.",my 12400 is currently using about 10-15w though.,"edit: as someone said in reply to another post, the power plan settings in windows can affect this behavior.",it might be that this tool changes the setting to performance mode.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i think 12th gen and ddr4 will actually depend a little more on the specific motherboard, as well as what xmp speeds you're trying to run, and which gear mode you want to run at.","some boards will allow for getting higher speeds than others in gear 1 mode, but i think a lot is going to depend on what the expectations are going in.","running 4 sticks of memory at xmp has never just been a guarantee, especially higher speeds... on either intel or amd.","these ddr5 issues of not being able to just stick four sticks of ram in, set xmp, and have it boot kind of give me flashbacks to early ryzen memory compatibility.","i remember back then, in the early months after ryzen launched, when even just getting 3000mhz or 3200mhz xmp profiles to even boot with only two sticks of memory was hit or miss, let alone getting four sticks running.","heck, even getting four sticks to run at decent speeds was still somewhat rough for the first couple gens of ryzen as well, and some of it would depend on your particular motherboard (the memory topology, bios updates, etc) among other things.","or, while i wasn't really following it at the time, but early ddr4 didn't hit anywhere near the types of frequencies we got with later revisions of memory and with newer cpus with better memory controllers.","even with newer/better ddr4, i don't think the earlier ddr4 memory controllers (like ones you'd find in haswell-e or skylake) could hit the kinds of frequencies we see now with later generation ddr4 memory controllers.",i think the main issue that is presented in the j2c video is that basically trying to run four sticks of ddr5 at the kinds of xmp profiles we're getting off the bat are basically just not able to be run on the current memory controller and motherboards.,"if you don't plan on populating all four sticks nor or at any point in the future, this should not be that much of an issue, and you should mainly just be looking at how running just two sticks will work and whether that will be stable at the speeds you want to run, which comes down to picking the ""correct"" motherboard and memory.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

coz it's not actually stable at all instances.,"like when running full tilt your cpu may be fine with -.100v to drop down to 1.2v from 1.3, but when you transition to a lower load state and it drops down to 0.6v that -.100 is making a mess of things coz your cpu can't run at 0.5v.","the instability might not be enough to crash the system, but there are likely errors going on in the background.",does event log show any whea errors?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"don't apply an overall undervolt, use the v/f curve to only undervolt the clocks where the cpu is actually getting hot.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's a pretty huge undervolt that's why

i run 5.1ghz all core turbo sustained (bclk 100, multiplier 51x), 5.2ghz single core turbo, -0.015v offset and it's rock solid

you don't really need to undervolt much if you disable all your motherboard vendor's ""multi core enhancements"" and the like which are basically all overvolts.",intel does design these chips very well and they will run cool at 'stock' voltages,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can you tell what temperatures did your undervolted cpu have when running cinebench?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i agree with this as the most likely.,i'd say drop your undervolt to .075v 75mv or 85mv and test or run you cpu in max performance mode as it will keep the core speed up.,idle temps may increase by a few c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh i see, that makes sense.",whea-logger is showing a lot of instances of errors on advanced error reporting (pci express).,iâ€™m unable to go back to the previous day to check for errors as there are too much instances of this error popping up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah, i think there's variation in memory controller quality.",i think buildzoid had a video last month where he showed how his 12600kf's memory controller seemed to do better with memory frequency than his 12900k by a decent bit.,"i think there was also a situation where in general, gigabyte's ddr4 boards didn't clock memory that well closer to launch.","i'm not sure if those issues have been resolved, or if some of their boards are still problematic with memory frequencies in gear 1 with ddr4.","just curious, but have you tried 3700mhz in gear 1?","i've run into a quirk with one of my asus boards and with a locked cpu (so a moderately different situation as yours) where my system will be unstable and lock up if i run my memory at 3600mhz, but it runs seemingly fine with both 3500mhz and 3700mhz.","something i hadn't really tested at this point, but i think it may have potentially have been related to running on one of the 100:133 memory multipliers, rather than running the 100:100 multipliers (since it may be grabbing a 100:133 one when running at 3600), but that is just speculation until i do more testing.","also, just checking, but what memory kit are you using?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can you be more specific about the ram?,"this is most likely due to your ram being made with ics that don't overclock well (for example, samsung c die).","after that, it could be board issue as ddr4 gigabyte boards had many training issues which may or may not have been resolved.",it is almost certainly not cpu as even the worst imcs should be able to do 3733-3800 g1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"donâ€™t forget that alder lake is only officially rated to run ddr4 at 3200, and that doesnâ€™t specify g1 or g2.",anything else is gravy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"could be a gigabyte issue imho

also there have always been strange incompatibility issues that arise from time to time.","not every ddr4 stick will work on every motherboard

your cpu oc's also affect mem oc's and vice versa - the tolerances aren't big so even a few millivolts here and there can cause instability

my 3000mhz cl16 crucial ballistix kit ran fine at 3300mhz on my z370 with i9-9900 but i can't get it stable past 3100mhz (without dropping cl from 16 to 22) with my z690 gaming x and i7-12700kf.","performance wise, 200mhz on the ram won't make much difference imho

my 2 cents: find out whatever runs stable on your mobo or try on a different motherboard",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's 4x16gb crucial ballistix ddr4-3600, rated 16-18-18-38, micron e-die.","runs at 3600 and higher without an issue in gear 2.

i'm leaning more and more towards it being a gigabyte issue, since the cpu is great otherwise.","i may theoretically be able to solve the training issue since the board does post at 3600 gear 1 (it's memtest86 that fails), which means i can play around with subtimings manually, but i think i'll just accept 3500 for now, and see if gigabyte comes out with a better bios.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you're trying to run four sticks of dual rank memory (16gb sticks of rev.e), that may be one of the root causes of the issue.","that's quad rank, and in general, running quad rank isn't as easy to do in general, even at modest frequencies.",you could try running just two sticks and see if it's able to run that at 3600mhz (or higher) in gear 1 to see if it's possibly just an issue of trying to run four sticks of it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm running ballistix max rev b single rank bit 4 sticks so it's effective dual rank.,stable at 4100mhz gear 1 with  sa at 1.35. i'd try 1.4 and see if that helps or remove 2 sticks just to see if that's the problem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's the 4 sticks of dual rank i'm afraid.,i guess the imc just can't handle 8 banks (quad rank) very well.,i have some dual rank cjr that can stabilize at 3900 on gear 1 (and over 4200 on gear 2) with just 2x16gb but cannot stabilize past 3500 with 4x16gb on my 12600k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, that's what i've been reading, 4 sticks is hard on the memory controller.",it's just interesting how everything is completely fine at 3500 at stock voltages and just goes nuts at 3600 even with much higher voltages.,the frequency wall is real.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, i have a system that's running the same memory (four sticks of dual rank rev.e) as you're trying to run, and i couldn't really get it to run more than 3466mhz without running into eventual errors running various memory tests, granted it was on 10th gen, and i didn't try *too* hard, since that was still good enough at the time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ballistix here also (2x16gb), but asus board.",runs fine at 3500mt/s here.,games crash otherwise.,some others have to go lower to even boot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"now people will start flooding their customer support asking for the same, showing an internet thread discussing it as proof, and as a result, they might tighten their price matching policies if this gets too much attention.","any time that a customer service rep goes out of their way to make an exception for you, you should keep it to yourself for that very reason.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i did this about a month ago with the 12600k.,they matched microcenter to $249.,i do live within driving distance of one though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
best buy is a coin flip on microcenter match.,"you can call in and get someone that says no, call back a min later and get someone saying yes.",some of their people will say no even if you live near one.,some will say yes even if you live 1000 miles away.,ymmv.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12900k is going to be 13700k anyway.,so yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i actually tried this last month and got lucky over chat.,"i donâ€™t have a microcenter in my state, but the person i chatted with honored the price match.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i did the same with the 12700k.,"i'm about an hour away from one and i was 100% going to buy the majority of my build from there but several of the things i needed were out of stock and couldn't wait, a little to far to drive just for the cpu.",i would shop there more often if it was closer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 wtf really?,!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"funny.. 
best buy wouldnâ€™t match micro center for me thru chat,they told me to go into best buy and show them the microcenter catalog.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
interesting.,i tried price matching for a 10850k at best buy and was told no.,micro center definitely had a better deal.,micro center needed to be within a 25 mile radius for them to actually price match.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm pretty sure they just price match a certain list of vendors.,i've gotten amazon price matches on hard drives at best buy before.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there's practically a weekly thread for their cpu sales on /r/buildapcsales where this exact topic comes up *in every thread*, going back years now.",cat's out of the bag for a long time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol i'm just sharing the love man.,i don't live near a microcenter so for me i had to try something.,the deal is awesome from either store no the less.,i hope it helps others.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea that's why i did the chat.,he didn't care about any of that like where i live.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea it's $549 now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe it's because i'm an elite member,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you do it at the store?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they will price match amazon only if sold directly by amazon and from their warehouses......not 3rd party.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you can match at microcenter, but you must have one close to you for them to apply the  policy (i forget how close); the cs rep was clearly being lenient with op, since he himself admitted to ""not living anywhere near close to a microcenter"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
over chat as well.,i then called the customer service line for best buy and was told the same.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so that's the thing i would have bought from microcenter but they say in store only.,so for me there was no choice but try and get bestbuy to price match.,i did the chat because either they'll price match it or not.,"per the price, being about $109 off (actual retail) i think for them they were ok with that.",he never asked where do i live to do this.,"he just said, ok yea we can do that.",i do believe on products sometimes where margins are out of line they may become more disagreeable about the match.,i've definatley seen that.,but meaning if it's ok and isn't ridiculous then i've got them to match ebay before.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok i'll call again tomorrow and if they say no then maybe the policy really is flimsy.,let me ask you.,what was the price delta.,what for what,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the point here is not that you did something wrong in price matching, it's that the unspoken rule of discounts/deals is not to publicize it when a customer rep does something good for you; best case scenario?",nothing happens.,worst case scenario?,"you get them in trouble and policies get stricter as a result, so there's no upside to mentioning any of this, especially when it's the worst kept secret in online shopping.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't think you realize how best buy works.,i'd normally 100% agree with you but best buy has a price match policy.,observing it and sharing is either going to provide a couple people here with similar results or not.,"again, the cpu is being discounted and best buy wouldn't do it if it wasn't worth it to them to do it.",i've literally seen them do this before.,it's like saying don't share that black friday price because they won't have black friday deals anymore.,i don't see the same logic sorry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are just that dense aren't you ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
explain to me how i'm dense?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4.4 ghz is the max ***single core*** boost clock.,"the max ***all core*** boost clock is 4.0 ghz, so the behavior you're witnessing is entirely within spec, unless i'm misunderstanding your question?",you won't see 4.4ghz in cinebench multi-core load because that software utilizes all cores at full usage which will limit the 12400 to 4.0ghz.,"if you go up in the top left and select a 'cpu (single core)' test, you should see your 12400 boost up to 4.4ghz.",the difference between a 12200 and 12311 is so insignificant i would consider the performance identical.,if you ran the test a thousand times there would be times the test jumped above (and back below) 12311 regardless how your cpu c-state is set.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ohhhhhh thanks for the explanation.,but do you know why cpu c state off allows me to reach higher frames?,since you mentioned the performance is insignificant.,do you recommend to keep the 4.4ghz or 4.0ghz?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"what are you using to measure ""higher frames"" ?","cinebench is a rendering benchmark tool to give you an idea of your cpu's capability in threaded workloads, not necessarily indicative of performance in gaming.",the general consensus around cpu c state is to set it to auto.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would like to use forza horizon 5 benchmark but the game is gpu based.,games like valorant in practice mode on 1 same scene i could reach 1k fps without c-state it could reach 900. or is this a bad measurement?,thank you kind stranger for taking your time to help me on this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes it should work, but i don't think ddr4 ram prices will decrease, if anything they will start going up as manufacturers transition to ddr5, prices increase due to inflation, etc.","obviously this won't happen overnight, but i wouldn't be waiting months to get new ddr4 at this point, especially when they are already pretty cheap.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sell those and get 3200+ sticks (16gb+),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"itâ€™ll work, but it will be a serious performance hindrance.",you really want 3000mhz minimum to prevent a bottleneck.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you try oc'ing the sticks you have?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think you guys convinced me that i need to update it if the bottleneck is going to be that severe.. but prices for 2x16 at 3200 will make me spend another 200â‚¬ of my budget at least, is it worth the upgrade?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sell the kit.,do not even bother gaming with that... it will work fine but you are leaving a lot of performance on the table.,if you are on a 12600k the minimum memory speed you should aim for is 3200mhz cl14.,nothing less.,"ideally, you want ddr4 4000mhz cl16 now that's the good stuff lol.",but seriously i would not even bother using a 12600k with 2133mhz ram.,it's like getting a bugatti and then having it limited to 30mph.,it will work but you will be seriously crippling the beast.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

70c is your spike?,thats really coolâ€¦.,your idle temps are a little high yah but not gonna hurt anything.,"you could add a second fan so that it is in a push pull configuration, that will lower temps and lower noise",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"none of the temps you described are â€œhotâ€, they are completely normal.",stop worrying and enjoy your cpu/system.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i read that it should run about 35 â°c idle and power package should be around 20w but for me it's 50-70w.,maybe you all are right and i'm worrying to much.,"the main problem is sound, i have airplane under my desk.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seems normal.,"im running a 10900k with a noctua nh-d15, thermal grizzly kryonaut and 7 120mm case fans.",i see 60c ish while gaming and around 80c benchmarking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
make sure your aio has enough mounting pressure on the cpu ihs.,too little pressure leads to higher idle and spikes and load temp.,"70c is not too high overall but i do wonder if you should see that with a 4.9ghz,but depends on the voltage too and what application is causing the spike.",run a cinebench run to see what temp it maxes at,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hi so i mounted extra fan, checked mounting pressure and switched fans to the front of aio.",and temperatures are lower 35-40 idle and while playing valhalla 60 max.,still have problems with fans -.- it's tornado... system fans are running quiet but cpu/aio fans are loud and doesn't respond to msi dragon center controlls.,what should i check in bios or in motherboard to fix it.,its showing 4500 rpm all the time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i agree with you!,i also have an i9 9900kf but i tuned it down to 4.4ghz with the intel xtu software despite everyone told me it was meant for overclocking.,i installed 6 additional fans but they couldn't cool down when the max factory boost was on to 5ghz.,now it's a good band-aid to ensure durability isn't it?,plus it's a total overkill for what i need to use a pc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ive got two fans one on the top and one on the back.,it should blow air outside ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe 35 when you first boot up in the first 30 min to a hour if sitting in windows but 40-50 is normal idle temps now adays.,these chips are way more energy dense nodes than 5 years ago when 30 degree idle was the norm.,it's really nothing to worry about and also 63 degrees gaming to 70 degree spikes is way under anything i'd be worried about,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
push pull means one on each side of the radiator.,"one pushing air into the radiator, one sucking air out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
throttling might be a good place to look firstly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the intel 1035g1 is 4 core 8 thread running between 1ghz to 3.6 ghz.,the i5-8265u is 4core 8thread running between 1.6ghz to 3.9 ghz.,both gpus are intergrated gpus.,i think the difference between the cpu performance as in the 10th gen cpus being less speed then a 8265 is causing the gpu performance to be stalled down.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
both are 15w cpus but that does not mean they are running at 15w.,"your 8265u might be configured to run up to 25w or even more on turbo, but your 1035g1 might have a strict 15w limit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel gets a bad rep for this

but it's really all about piss poor thermal system design that doesn't allow adequate cooling

i suspect that you've bought a thin and light or a lenovo, both of which will have terrible thermals designed by a monkey

to intel's credit, their mobile cpus are very scalable with wattage and temperatures.",but don't believe me - check out notebookcheck reviews of several laptops with the same cpu and you'll see that there's a huge variation in performance with identical silicon because of poor thermal designs on the part of the manufacturers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, thereâ€™s only a year between them, and theyâ€™re the same basic specification and price, so i would expect the same or maybe slightly, but in no way significantly, better performance from the newer chip.",userbenchmark shows about 7% better for the 1035g1.,passmark shows 6118/2127 scores vs 7763/2310.,"strictly speaking, if thermal management is the same between systems and thereâ€™s no throttling or excessive power savings going on, the 1035g1 should be marginally faster.","so i think it might come down to the rest of the laptopâ€™s design, quality, display resolution, and other components.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is exactly why people were bashing intel those days.,they were launching new generations that weren't any good compared to the previous ones.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ark.intel.com lists tdp-up as 25w for both cpus but i guess the manufacturers implementation could vary and could be a factor with the specific cooling systems perhaps.,â€œ configurable tdp-up is a processor operating mode where the processor behavior and performance is modified by raising tdp and the processor frequency to fixed points.,the use of configurable tdp-up is typically executed by the system manufacturer to optimize power and performance.,"configurable tdp-up is the average power, in watts, that the processor dissipates when operating at the configurable tdp-up frequency under an intel-defined, high-complexity workload.â€",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"both have a '7', two zeros and '12' is completely divisible by 3, perfect match.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12700k is essentially the fastest reasonably priced gaming cpu you can buy.,"the 12900k eeks like 3% more fps at stock, but its overkill for a gaming cpu.",so yes the 12700k is a good choice and will last you longer than the 3070 will.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
based on what?,"generally, the 12700k is a very capable processor, but how sensible it is for you depends.",the rtx 3070 is likely a good gpu for quite some time.,any gen 12 cpu is going to work fine with that.,"even the i3s, i reckon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 12700k won't bottleneck any gpu currently.,especially not an rtx 3070. if you're thinking of buying this gpu now i would caution you that prices likely will keep falling and next-gen will launch in 4-5 months.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good mix.,"i have the i7-12700kf and a 3070 ave 3080 and can't quite decide which to keep and which to sell on

as others have said - don't expect to be able to actually buy a 4000 series in 2022",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seen some benchmarks and for 2k gaming the i5 12400f is enough tbh.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> next-gen will launch in 4-5 months.,"i'd also caution that just because there will be a launch this year, doesnt mean those cards will be easily available to buy.",there are a lot of people that have been trying to wait out crypto pricing and holding off for next gen. i dont think next gen will be sitting on shelves and not sold out until late q1 2023.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would be cautious of giving advice to people about gpus when they are available.,before 3000s launch people stopped buying and even sold their gpus for low to be able to buy 3000s and 6000s gpus and we know how that ended.,"my advice to op if you have the money buy it because nobody got anu idea what could happend in the future with the current gpus and the future launches, miners are scalpers didn't disappear, they are just waiting to jump to next big thing that will give them money.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why is that even a question?,just keep the better one.,so the 3080?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
amd and nvidia both claimed on conference calls that they expect supply to be available for their next-gen cards.,combined with intel's launch of arc and ethereum taking a nose-dive along with pos potentially happening i can see supply being pretty good for this launch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol look at the date i posted this.,gpu shortage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but would you ever expect a competitive partnership phone call to let one another or the audience hear bad news?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also don't forget the huge increases in energy cost across much of the developed world (most felt in europe - my bills have tripled in 3 years) which makes mining totally unprofitable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
obviously the 12900k will outperform the 12700k in most tasks because it has more cores/threads.,whether itâ€™s worth the extra cost is up to you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"what is ""productivity""?",it's hard to give meaningful advice based on so little information.,"generally more is better, but if you need that extra or not depends on many things, and for most people there is price v.s.",benefit to consider.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it depends on your needs.,"if ur working and doing productive stuff a lot of the time, like if its a profession, the 20% extra multicores may help.",do check if the benefits apply to your use case.,"however if its pretty light and casual,  i'd say the i7 is pretty solid and you'll save like 35% of the i9's cost.","if u just want the best and can afford it or want longevity, then the i9 with 20% more multi core could probably give you an extra generation or 2 of use.",so maybe the i9 would be more effective in the long run.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
productivity is a meaningless term.,if you are frequently doing lost of heavily multi threaded tasks like rendering it is worth it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
right now there's practically no difference between the chipsets themselves except for the slightly higher frequencies which don't give as much perf improvement as they should.,"so imo, save yourself the money and go with 12700",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
barely though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just push the pin in and then turn it so it locks.,if you still dont get it then theres a million tutorials on youtube,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qczgr4kmny

should be the same as these older ones.","and as for:

> should i just buy a cpu cooler

that time frame fits with the motherboard having ide and sata support and the whole thing looks fairly similar to my first gen x58 motherboard (2008).,"it isn't x58 because they had triple channel ram, and anything more modern wouldn't have ide.",by 2008 ide was already becoming uncommon on new motherboards although you could still get it without much difficulty and i did on my i7-920 so i could reuse older drives.,"if it was older than the core 2 line, it probably wouldn't have sata support.","in core 2 times, support for both was ubiquitous.",the foxcon part number for the motherboard is visible and searchable and confirms it is a lga 755 motherboard.,"supports core 2 quad, core 2 duo, pentium dual core, celeron dual core, celeron, pentium dual-core e5300, e5400, e5700, e6300, e6500, celeron dual-core: e3200, e3300.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

chances are high it's not the ram sticks that's at fault here but rather your motherboard and/or your cpu's imc.,"xmp is basically ""auto overclock"" for ram, and the primary component that determines stability is your cpu's memory controller.","the higher the capacity, the more dimm slots you fill, and the higher the clock speeds, the harder it is to attain stability.","64gb is a lot, and it sounds like you're filling all 4 banks with ram.","that's not going to be easy, even at a low speed like 3200mhz.","i would suggest looking at what your vccio and vccsa voltages are set to with xmp enabled and if they aren't too high, perhaps try adding some more voltage to them and see how that does.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what motherboard do you have?,did you try each kit separately to see if xmp works?,did you keep each kit on it's separate channel when trying all 4 sticks?,did you up the voltage of the main 3 for memory?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"general xmp/imc issues aside, 2 kits of 2 sticks is massive ymmv for memory and not working out of the box is normal.","easiest way to maybe get it working is add some voltage, failing that you have to start tweaking timings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the number of sticks and density matters, it is said.",i'd try two sticks as you suggested yourself.,3200mt/s should be default.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"update: i've manually set the clock speed and timings to the xmp profile for the 3200mhz model (my sticks are the 3600 model) and bumped up the voltage to about 1.38 and it's running stable so far, though i've only done a short stress test with aida64.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for such an elaborate response!,i'm going to try playing with these variables today.,"i am filling all 4 banks, because silly as it is i love the way these sticks look with the banks full and this is sort of a ""dream build.""","i do know that it's an auto oc and i've actually had this problem before, but that was in an fx series chip and i expected a lot more out of 12th gen intel than fx problems lol.",can you elaborate a little on vccio and vccsa voltages?,i will do my own research of course but it's always nice to have a starting point for what i'm looking for.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that was on ddr5 not ddr4

which makes perfect sense as ddr5 is much more sensitive to signal interference.",if you follow buildzoid's videos you'll get a perfect explanation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah i was seriously hoping this was only for ddr5.,i actually watched his video while assembling haha.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i should have mentioned these are qvl sticks.,"i know this will sound silly to some, but it's an aesthetic build and i really want all four slots filled.",i may have to wait until a four stick kit comes out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i haven't touched voltages because i really wanted to believe i could get rated speeds on such a new build.,asus rog strix z690-a.,"the sticks are slotted correctly (kit 1 to a1+b1 kit 2 to a1+b2)

oh ok!,i think this is really the comment i was hoping for now that i read it.,"i won't mind messing with it a little, but since i so carefully selected all my parts i was bummed thinking i ran into an abnormal issue.",i had been running on an overclocked fx for forever and just assumed i could plug and play if i spent a lot of money ðÿ¤–,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can you elaborate on both of those things?,this is the first pc i've built in almost a decade and i'm catching up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sure, i remember seeing numbers thrown around like ""try not to go above 1.2v and really try not to go near 1.3v+"" so see what it's running by default and then work from there.","if it's already touching these numbers or higher (motherboards tend to over volt to try and force stability) then maybe try reducing them as strange as that sounds, it can help sometimes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is op using ddr4 or ddr5?,"i just read the ""3200"" as frequency.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no this is false info.,"i'm running 4x4100mhz ddr4 gear 1 and they can do 4800mhz gear 2. 

lots of variables.",most likely both kits are dual rank which is harder on the memory controller.,could be mismatch memory chips even though they're both from the same company.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is.,ddr4 has nearly no issues on z690.,even gigabyte got their act together,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they're qvl for all 4 dimms?,not just 2?,"if so, it should work.",rma and try again?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you overclocking your cpu too?,this can change your memory overclock (and vice versa) and be a source of instability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i can't elaborate much, because i don't know the details.","but if i was to guess, the frequencies of signals have come up to levels in recent years where the circuitry simply doesn't function as well.","it's very technical, but peculiar effects happen to high frequency electric signals.","the problem has become particularly apparent with ddr5, but it seems to be partially there also with ""slower"" ddr4.","at least with 12th gen, people have been experiencing issues with ram, as it seems you have already noted.","also, enabling xmp is technically an overclock, and the processor's memory-related circuitry has its limits.","even though 3200mt/s is the default speed, actual results may vary with a combination of these things.","also, keep an eye out for bios updates, which can sometimes help.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ah, so rank might also be a factor.","wow, what a mess.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm considering buying a higher speed set and just adjusting to get 3600. can you explain some of the concepts you just mentioned to help me get closer to making it work?,specifically dual rank and gear 2/1.,what should i look for and avoid?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
eh.,i'm struggling to get xmp running with 4 banks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably just two unfortunately.,they don't sell any 4 dimm kits ðÿ˜­,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, i'm not running a cpu oc.",i had hoped not to oc anything,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
perfect.,that's what i was hoping for.,there is a b-die version of this memory i can get.,it's much more expensive so i went for slower latency but i would be willing to try a faster kit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm guessing that's higher than 3200mhz ddr4

12th gen officially supports up to 3200mhz, and any higher is very ymmv - ram is never guaranteed to work with every motherboard and it's likely you'll have to try a few different pairs to get things just right.",i have seen posts of 3600mhz running fine.,"i got my 3000 cl16 to run at 3100 cl16, but at 3200, 3300, and 3400 it runs stable but only cl22 (also needed to up the voltage).",imho you won't get much performance benefit with slightly faster memory anyway.,your best bet is to go with the right cpu with the right gpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
qvl will generally list if all 4 dimms are supported or only 2. if they really do list only 2 supported that means someone tried it with 4 and it didn't work.,"in that case you really want to look at other options, probably with lower rank per dimm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you tried running the ram one stick at a time with xmp enabled?,if that works try two dual channel.,then try the other two dual channel.,"run memtest86 too and see if you're getting any errors

usually running 4 sticks gives you a slightly lower overclock than 2 but at xmp they just work most of the time.",last thing it could be is an memory incompatibility.,it's far better than in the old days when it was a major issue.,nowadays it still happens but is far more rare - you might just have gotten the short straw,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i wouldn't bother

i have very basic corsair ballistix sport lt 3000mhz cl16 ram and it's more than fine at xmp+1.36v (a 0.01v increase for stability) at 3100 mhz slight overclock vs xmp

">you might just have gotten the short straw

everything is looking toward that right.","in single channel, this ram is on the qvl list for single channel.",they don't sell dual channel kits.,later today i will begin the arduous process of testing every stick and running memtest86.,"right now i've got it working at 3200mhz with the timings set to the xmp spec for their 3200 kit and voltage at 1.38.

i'll report back.",thanks for the tips!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"fast 4x16 gb kits are no longer really available at high frequencies, due to the difficulty of binning them.","you're more likely to find them somewhere in the 3,000 mhz range, or with higher cas latencies.","that means you'll have to either settle with 2x32 gb (which would be ideal as z690 is daisy chain and works best with two dimms, but also means that the maximum frequency tends to be a bit lower than their 16 gb or 8 gb counterparts), or finding and mixing two single rank 2x16 gb kits together and rolling the dice.","ideally, if your goal is to achieve *over* 32 gb *along with* high frequency *and* speed, you're pretty much forced to buy micron 16 gb b-die.",which is quite rare and in limited supply.,"without the speed factor, then you could probably go with hynix.",but i don't know what rank they are.,"mixing two 2x16 gb samsung b-die kits is possible as well, but lottery is involved, and they tend to be dual rank kits, not single (especially with g.skill).","if you're willing to go with micron, then you'd have to scour around second-hand markets for the rare 4x16 gb corsair kit, or buy two 2x16 gb crucial ballistic max kits.","both at 4,000+ mhz.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there are two companies that provide b-die; samsung and micron.,but they are vastly different from each other.,"you will likely have trouble trying to run high frequency samsung b-die at 4x16 gb, as they are likely to be dual rank dimms.","since g.skill is the primary company that sells their dies, chances are, if you go with a 4x16 gb g.skill kit, it'll actually be hynix, not samsung.",and hynix dies tend to have loose primaries (which means they are bound to be slow and not really overclockable).,"this leaves you with micron, which, aside from one single corsair 4x16 gb kit, is only sold as 2x16 gb currently.","that's either the crucial ballistix max kits, or the corsair vengeance kits.","https://pcpartpicker.com/products/memory/#u=4&s=4000,6400&z=32768002,65536004&sort=-speed&m=11,12&page=1&l=30,190&f=6000000,9473684",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

is the chipset the same as the socket?,also would it perform better to get one with an igpu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> f - no igpu (integrated graphics)

just to nitpick for anyone interested, in most cases an f model *does* have an igpu, but it was flawed in manufacture and is hardware-disabled, thus you get a price discounted chip.","say you buy a 12900kf, you're actually buying a 12900k that came off the line with a cpu that passed but the igpu failed in testing.",intel can improve yields by disabling the igpu on those models and selling them as a kf to people who don't need an igpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
definitely not for the newer 9900ks and 10900ks which were special binned/pre-overclocked version,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh yea haha i never realised he included that in the post so thanks :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so, the chipset is a part whatever mobo you're using.","depending on which one it is, you may or may not have any option to overclock or use xmp for ram so a cpu with a k at the end possibly wouldn't be worth it.",the socket is determined by what gen cpu it is.,"with intel, 8th and 9th gen are compatible since they use the same socket but 10th and 11th gen are different.",12th gen just also released on a new socket entirely as well.,"so for your current mobo, you'd have to stick with 9th gen cpus for any kind of ""upgrade"".","you could get a i5-9400 or 9600, for 6c/6t and better stock clock speeds.","the 9700 would be the ""best"" choice for any entry level mobo, as the vrms, power delivery, board quality, etc may hinder performance with something on the higher end.","&#x200b;

getting an igpu really only helps with certain types of media encoding/decoding honestly.",if you don't do anything other than play games/basic computing then it's totally unnecessary.,you usually save money with the ones that don't have the igpu also.,"so, for all of the choices i mentioned you'd want to go for the ones with an ""f"" at the end of them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's a common misconception due to ddr5 being super scarce at launch that it is still wildly expensive.,ddr5 5600 cl36 is $335 (32gb).,with the msi-pro-z690 mine runs at 6000cl32-34-34-36 memtest stable.,it is straight up better than say a ddr4 4000 cl14 kit at xmp.,"my aida64 reads/writes: 97gb/s read, 93 gb/s write 91gb/s copy 61ns latency.",vs ddr4 4000 cl14: read: 60 gb/s write: 56gb/s latency: 65ns.,if you get a unify-x you can get that same kit to say 6800 and have even better performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes sir.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"assuming you both use the same specs (minus gpu), its likely your ram is running at stock speeds.","while the cpu is indeed a bottleneck (in newer titles), a lot of the people that commented forgot the game is r6s.",hyperthreading goes out the window here because of the game engine and would not be the reason why you are getting lower frames compared to a friend with similar specs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is your friend using the same settings as you?,"same version of rainbow (iâ€™m not very knowledgeable about it, but isnâ€™t there a vulcan version?)","if they are, only thing i can think of is your memory isnâ€™t running at full speed - is xmp on?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 9700k is not a powerful enough cpu to pair with a 3080 for 1080p.,"there could be other contributing factors that lead to this problem, like not having dual channel ram, having a slow ram kit, or not using xmp.",addressing any issues with your ram configuration could alleviate the problem somewhat but it will never fix it.,"letâ€™s say hypothetically you have an ideal setup, like dual rank dual channel ram at 4000+ mhz, low cas latency, manually tuned subtimings, and a hefty cpu core and cache overclock.","you could get more frames than you get now, but youâ€™re never going to get your 3080 to have 99% usage at 1080p.",iâ€™m not even sure you could achieve that with the latest i9 in r6 (although you could definitely get more frames than you get now).,i highly doubt there is actually anything wrong with your system that could be fixed (unless you have single channel ram or are not using xmp).,the problem is just a typical cpu bottleneck.,you get 100% usage because the 9700k lacks hyperthreading.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if your ram is good spec wise (dual channel config, 3600mhz or higher, low cas, etc), then it may very well be the lack of ht.","i would've figured 8c/8t is enough for a 3080, but the lower resolution you go the more work the cpu has to do.",it's also why there's *usually* not much variation in cpu performance at 4k cause then you're typically gpu bound.,"intel was a bastard for the longest time with their cores/threads, but amd finally seems to have made them pull their head out of their ass.","if you're on a budget and you can find one for a good price, the 9900k is a decent in-socket upgrade, since you'll at least get ht and better silicon to push a higher stable oc.",but if you can you might as well go for a 12600k or something else from alder lake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hyperthreading absolutely matters if your goal is to push out as many frames per second possible for competitive reasons in a aaa fps that isn't csgo or valorant and it does contribute to not hitting 100% cpu usage.,maxing most games out is a misleading statement as there is a huge difference between trying to play r6 siege at 300-400 fps and being worried about low gpu usage + high cpu usage vs playing a game on ultra settings at lets say 144 fps.,"maxing games out inherently lowers fps by increasing gpu load, requiring the cpu to prepare fewer frames per second for the gpu, which ultimately lowers cpu usage.",it is possible to be maxing out games and not maxing out the 9700k but it's not applicable to the situation the op is in.,the reason the op has low gpu usage and high cpu usage is because he's cpu bottlenecked in a game that scales well with higher core counts and is using a non-ht cpu.,it's extremely unlikely that the source of the problem is anywhere other than ram configuration or the need for a cpu upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you need more memory.,"the apps themselves to ""help"" could be the cause of the stutter.","no magical cure, unfortunately.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

so there is no solution other than increasing the ram itself?,can increasing paging file work?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh dear im extremely sorry for being late.. i sadly cant upgrade my ram because i upgraded it quite soon and my parents wont allow another one anytime soon.,not that i think in need a ram upgrade or cpu upgrade as the games ran absolutely fine.,so should i try removing one of my antiviruses?,i'd like to have the things which are possible without doing any upgrades from outside.. i just don't understand why is this problem occurring only after a particular update.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'd give that a go before relying on applications that claim to help.,"edit: noticed you included that 4gb of it being used, i guess, after closing an app with plenty of space?","yeah, i suspect the paging combined with whatever third party app is your issue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

so these cards can work by injecting the vbios rom?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

any system with a bios that supports dg1 will support it.,most coffeelake & cometlake bioses do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
both of them have the same undervolt applied.,"to reproduce this, you can either use the throttlestop 'tpl' page and limit multiplier through the 'speed shift' bit, or directly limiting turbo limits inside 'fivr' (if you can)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because by default intel has internal voltage readings of what it thinks your cpu needs to hit x frequency.,you manually modified it and thus it now acts differently from stock.,it works both ways btw intels adaptive voltage will ignore any user voltage settings (unless manually specified with llc etc.),up untill it goes past stock (aka 4.7ghz all-core for a 12700k..) then it interpolates the voltage based off the voltage you set in bios.,this is my rough understanding of it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean when boosting it generally applies a bit more voltage than necessary than off boost at a set frequency.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"looks like it is, which seems like a problem when you have thermal-limited environments (like my prebuilt) or stuff like the 10875h with 4.5-5ghz turbo but something like 45w limits when the gpu is working in laptops, so it barely reaches 2-2.5ghz when the voltage is jacked up to something used for 4.9ghz",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i am thinking why the logic won't try to find a better point in the voltage/clock table, instead of just mindlessly pushing the voltage for max boost, as the power limit is constant.","wouldn't it be more efficient if it can:

reduce voltage and increase clock until it reaches a point close to values in the voltage/clock table -> regularly check if power headroom is present, then finally try to boost again?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because intel's boost logic isn't as advanced as amd's.,"where amd's takes into account power, thermal, current, time, etc to get a floating turbo at the best voltage it thinks is stable.",intel's boost is more like just a voltage vs clock table against load which is boosted across the board for when it is boosting.,only limited by max power and thermals.,at least that's from my experience when messing with these cpus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i was running intel burn test on the default settings, it would reach the temps in about a minute sometimes a little more, and after letting the aio reach a steady state in temperature the temps were about the same.",i am more concerned about the difference core to core than the max temp.,"i also should probably note that i have tried other test to see if ot was intel burn test just being hotter than the rest, and it was not.",even an online one was getting getting just as hot with the same spread.,"and thank you for the last bit, it was just weird for a nearly 20c difference to be there, when it was tops 5c difference when i did the same test when i first finished the computer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there is no corner on secrets sauce that amd or intel has.,"for years intel has process leadership, manufacturing scale to make choices and with process leadership could easily have both performance and performance / watt advantage, yet many times they maker poor or bad choices and barely were competitive.",monopolistic and market share dominance does that always.,now it looks like you got the arm camp with apple and others riding tsmc for a one node advantage.,make the right choice and they better be best or their designers should be fired!,as to amd on tsmc 7nm and intel now finally getting a reasonable process on their much delayed and ill conceived 10nm things should be pretty comparable and all about the choices their architects made.,"intel came late, has tons more resource, of course they should best amdâ€™s last design.",i fully expect amd on tsmc 5nm to retake the lead.,"competition is good and keeps people honest, we all got screwed and the leader totally fucked it up for a decade, consumers are the winners now, tax payers will pay as they go for a hail mary",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"maybe - intel has an even more efficient chip for that space now than 12900hk -- the i7-1265u and i7-1280p:

notice this (intel) chart shows 1280p faster than m1 pro at 35 watts, where intel's other chart (this reddit post) shows 12980hk slower than m1 pro at 35 watts.",it looks like enough of an improvement where intel is probably equal or better than amd down to about 20-25w before the table flips.,there is another chart out there showing both 1280p and 12980hk on the same graph but i can't find it :/..  anyway it showed 1280p more performant at lower power levels than 12980hk (up to about 35w iirc).,and yes the benchmarks could be different between the two charts but 1280p is definitely more focused at lower power performance than 12980hk.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not necessarily.,under 35w itâ€™s a different cpu pair for intel and amd for which we donâ€™t have any benchmark done yet.,however there are some early leaks for i7-1280p that shows much better efficiency under 35w than the h series chips.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
go over 50w and you will see amd crumble.,"biased fanboy, admit one is better for high power, and one is better for low power.","basically, for gaming laptops and desktops, itâ€™s stupidity to buy amd, but for thin and lights, itâ€™s stupidity to buy intel",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the requirements you described can be done on a core 2 quad from 2009 just fine.,"or literally any pc with 4 cores, or even dual with hyperthreading and 8gb of ram.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my core i7 2600 machine does all this and more.,just find a minimum of a quad core machine.,16gb ram would be better if you will have many tabs or large excel files but 8gb should be plenty serviceable.,ssd is pretty much a requirement if you want any zip.,can add a sata ssd to pretty much anything.,just need to get the os installed to it.,can use a hdd for bulk data storage if required.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the initial issue with drm games should be solved according to intel.",was a drm issue.,see statement below for fix.,"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000088261/processors/intel-core-processors.html

"amd 5xxx now on up to 25% discount permanently, really strong product, but yes, those are the last cpus for that socket",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if you're referring to their heterogeneous big.huge architecture, i don't necessarily agree.","the reason why it looks bad is because it's always been homogeneous on the desktop and consoles, so it will take a lot of effort to normalize it, but there's no reason it should always be bad.","just a lot of scheduling work, and work to figure out how to categorize apps so they don't bleed from one core cluster to another.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"neither did i, but those efficiency cores are really a work of art.",i love the idea of having more cores available for stuff that really doesn't need a normal performance core.,the fact that it's bleeding edge is why so many people are bothered by it.,"not trying to dismiss the issues brought up by you, so many are valid, but i genuinely believe it won't be an issue in the future.","first of all, the tech is pretty old right now, with phones juggling between big.little/big.mid.little architectures for a long time.",there's plenty of experience/testing from this fact.,"secondly, we're talking about intel.","their hubris might have resulted in a big loss in lead over the past few years, but they're a giant.",their r&d budget is ginormous and i can't fathom that a bad architecture (assuming huge.big) could pass into mass production and future adoption in next architectures.,"they know they can fix, it takes time, money and effort is all.","and if i'm wrong, so be it, i'm the last guy to take sides, this is simply how i view things logically.","remember, they're a corporation, their goal is profit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can use stuff like project lasso to reserve or allocate certain cores to certain tasks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if we get the right tools to target all cores exactly how we want as developers, maybe i can live with it, but i donâ€˜t want to be at the mercy of a thread scheduler moving stuff around more than they already do and between cores of different architectures.",i have no desire to put architecture checks into my hot loops etcâ€¦ maybe at thread startup but then i need to be able to glue them to a set of cores etc.,in the end itâ€˜s also just a lot of change to existing code architecture which will only happen if itâ€˜s really exploitable for a lot more performance.,"running a few os threads on the little cores, sure, why not, but thatâ€˜s only the simplest application.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a perfectly valid concern.,sadly i am unable to continue the argument because i lack the necessary knowledge due to my nature as more of a dilettante.,i wish that your concerns regarding the matter are answered by intel.,either that or they revert to a homogeneous architecture or one that mimics homogeneity similar to amd.,cheers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah, but this is what i mean when i say it requires quite a few changes to your code.","dealing with affinity masks and cpu sets was not something that was recommended, the general consensus being you let the scheduler figure it out which now is not an option anymore.","if they start shipping cores with different instruction sets, that will get even more complicated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

let me tell you having gone down that road with the 4790k that in my opinion it isn't worth it.,"i ended up incrementally replacing parts when i could have bought a budget modern system for a bit more money that was twice as fast, only to end up doing that anyway down the road.","it is worth it if you can keep the cost really really low, but if you're talking spending even $200, you can get a 12th gen 4 core, a budget board, and 16gb of cheap ram and have a far better system that will last much longer for not an insane amount more and reuse the rest of your components.","i3-12300 = $150 (hard to find, you could get a store to price match the 12400 at $170 to microcenter if there isn't one nearby).","b660 mobo = $140 to $200

16gb ddr4 = can be found for $60",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah that was my thinking as well.,im not trying to give too much of an upgrade.,"just been running a bit sluggish and based on everything ive checked, the cpu seems to be the problem.",but i could be wrong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if it's sluggish due to having the cpu maxed out at 100% all the time, getting a cpu with hyperthreading may help out a little bit.","without having z series board, you're going to be somewhat limited with cpu frequency with any of the cpus, unless you spend a moderate amount of money (considering the cpus' ages).",other slightly faster of the locked haswell cpus that you could drop-in upgrade your system with are probably going to cost more like $50-80+ used.,that particular one i mentioned is probably one of the cheapest with hyperthreading.,"there are others with slightly higher base frequencies, but they're only going to be maybe like 100-200mhz faster, but for a moderately large jump in cost.","if going with newer hardware, getting something like the [i3-12100f](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1675540-reg/intel_bx8071512100f_core_i3_12100f_desktop_processor.html) for about $110, a basic b660 motherboard (maybe like [this one](https://www.newegg.com/p/n82e16813162048) or [this one](https://www.newegg.com/p/n82e16813145375)) for about $110-120, and then a 2x8gb kit of 3200mhz ddr4 for about $60 would be the current ""budget"" option that would be somewhat close to that $250ish price point.",it should be substantially faster than your current i5 setup now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well if you don't have an ssd then get one asap, it'll have way more of an improvement than a cpu ever could",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

did you use the 12400 for synthetic benchmarks or gaming?,because gaming in a given generation with current-gen cpus is a more fluctuating load than a 100% load synthetic test like the cinebench one hu used for their video.,the motherboardsimply gets enough time to cool when the cpu isn't at 100% power draw so you can expect it to never thermal throttle during gaming.,"the same can't be said for gaming in the future, if a cpu ages enough as games become more cpu demanding the games become more like synthetic tests for the cpu because the cpu spends more time at 100% power draw, frequency and usage.",especially if you combine it with a newer more powerful gpu that removes the gpu bottleneck.,then the motherboard becomes more likely to bottleneck a 12400.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's definitely possible but you'd have to be running 1080p low settings while fps hunting in esports titles.,otherwise a 6700 will easily keep up with a 3060ti on most titles at normal frame rates.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just get a new cpu later,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah iâ€™m not like a crazy competitive gamer or anything.,i mostly just wanted to upgrade from my 1050 ti to play elden ring lol.,plus itâ€™ll probably last me a long time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cpus nowadays have configurable tdp and adjustable power based on chassis temps.,"you don't really need to undervolt, but undervolt could give you more performance, better sustained and better temps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so even without you wouldn't worry about an i9 in the x15 r2 even without undervolting?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
main difference is lga 1700 has 78x78 mounting hole locations which lga 1200 has 75x75.,i don't think it's impossible to fit the rh1 if you filed away 1.5mm toward the centre at each mounting point and used an lga 1200 backplate from another cooler.,other question though is are you sure you want to consider this - it's been tested on a recent ltt video are pretty crappy being in the same league as the rm1 cooler.,"if you are going to do this, make sure it's on a 65w part.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why even bother?,just get a better cooler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sure, if you make a custom bracket and backplate for it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
forget that cooler.,buy a other one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for an elaborate comment.,i donâ€™t like the look of bulky cpu radiators and aios are too mainstream - right now iâ€™m using the 11400f processor with a stock cooler so i guess it wouldnâ€™t make a difference in terms of performance.,it just looks cool to me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm afraid i can't make one myself as i'm not an expert by any means... is there any place that i could get them from?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"plenty of third party, high quality coolers that aren't huge.","and ""too mainstream""?",are you being an obnoxious hipster about pc parts?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
aio is mainstream?,thanks for the laugh.,"for every aio you see, there are 1000 air coolers being used.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"doubtful, almost nobody would spend money to make an lga1700 cooler fit on an lga1200 socket, because if you have the cooler, you should realistically have an lga1700 cpu and board, unless the cooler was given to you by someone who does

it's not worth spending time and money on, better off with most be quiet!",or noctua air coolers.,"it's not worth it for manufacturers to do what you're asking, it's such a niche thing, and would waste everyone's time and money.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my taste is none of your concern tbh.,"let me remind you, the question is whether there's any chance the new rh1 cooler can be installed on an lga 1200 motherboard.",i don't remember asking for your opinion.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no one is obligated to answer you either.,that's how you respond?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're very welcomed to not like aio (i'm with you on that).,"but ""too mainstream"" isn't a taste statement, it's a ""i don't like it because it's popular"" statement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i should really start a research on why some random dudes on reddit be so rude,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
even more of a waste.,there are better looking coolers that don't suck.,they're still worse than the wraith coolers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seems like a perfectly fine statement to me.,i donâ€™t like it because i see it everywhere and iâ€™m sick of it - this applies to any other area of life.,think of a car or even a jacket that you think looks nice but everyone already has the same model - unless you donâ€™t care about standing out from the crowd.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you care so much about standing out from the crowd that it affects your taste, my statement about you being a hipster is gaining steam ðÿ˜‰",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"standing out from a crowd is near impossible on a planet of 7,930,938,300 people.",now factor in only a couple hundred different models of cpu coolers.,"you're going to see what you pick everywhere, no matter what.",you'll never be that special one off snowflake.,"you can try, but thousands will have that same part.","just be you, because of you.",not because you want to stand out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i'm imagining the second hand market after raptor lake/meteor lake is out: ""hey.",i'm selling my 12900k.,"it will be 100$ plus than the usual 2nd price as my chip is among those first bins with avx512 support""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"hey so....

whats avx-512 and to who would it be deal-breaking for their system to not have it ?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh, intel.",was it so naã¯ve of me to think you would be half as cool as your products now that those are good again?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very poor decision making from intel's crappy marketing team.,i recommend people to go with amd's zen 4 chips if they need avx-512 on a consumer platform.,unless meteor lake e-cores are avx-512 capable (which i doubt they will as they need to be space efficient) we won't see proper avx-512 support on intel hybrid cpus anytime soon.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well you still have the option to buy a 12th gen cpu that still has avx-512 and a z690 board from a vendor like msi that has the avx-512 toggle in the latest bios as of now.,"also avx-512 runs much cooler on 12th gen, even cooler than avx2.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i bet itâ€™s cutting into server chip sales ; ),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this seems like a strange decision if it's already there, but are these instructions of any use to most users anyway though?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
jerk move pat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
will sapphire rapids have avx 512?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i can see amd sales pitch "" no pay wall for out customers """,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well that just sealed my decision to go zen 4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i also just found out that intel crippled its drivers after 10th gen to not install on windows server.,they really hate consumers.,"yes, i run a dc at home, and upgraded my old i5-2400...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have an early alder lake and i haven't updated my bios - is there a way to check if i have avx-512?,does cpu-z report it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am a bit confused.,they will disable avx512 in new batches of cpus or they will remotely turn off avx512 modules in the existing cpus?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i mean i get it that it's relatively difficult to advertise avx512 in alderlake because you need to disable e cores for it to work, but is this really necessary?",unless there is some serious bug/issue with current implementation i really dont see why would you go out of your way and fuse it off.,just the moment when intel start to look serious again they do this shit lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wonder when it will come back if ever.,the way intel operates the e cores need to support it too for them to consider bringing avx 512 back for desktop but that could be years away.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not sure if this might be related, but after a recent bios update my cinebench r23 scores crashed to  more than half the previous score.",https://www.reddit.com/r/msi\_gaming/comments/tj8ovy/12900k\_crippled\_after\_bios\_update/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sounds like they didn't fully validate it and now anyone who would have been working on it has moved on to future designs.,easier to just fuse it off instead of worrying about any potential bugs that might show up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"some (like linus torvalds, dad of linux) are against the idea of introducing the advanced vector set.",the instructions are not useful in daily usage and introduce more power consumption and bugs.,and i believe that physical simulation and complex algorithms can be run more efficiently when deployed on specific platforms such as asic or gpus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great my i7-12700k is worth more than the i7-13700k haha!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
even with a 8700k i don't get cpu bottlenecked at 120fps.,i imagine the 12th gen cpus wouldn't need avx-512 to further boost its performance right?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
glad i saw this comment.,was going to build an alder lake system but this seems like a dealbreaker.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, turns out the main selling point of 11th gen was avx512 and pcie 4.0",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
\> turns out 11th gen for those that need and use avx512 will remain the best generation until ipc and brute force can recover the difference\*.,or maybe wait for zen 4 which will have avx512.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
avx-512 is a new extension of the advanced vector extensions instruction set.,it's optimizations for various vector math operations.,basically it makes hard math faster.,if you're into big number crunching avx-512 has shown massive improvements for numpy(software for crunching numbers).,"if it got mainstream support it could become used in physics engines, simulations, or whatever else.",intel killing avx-512 delays mainstream adoption of it.,it's also a backwards step as 11th gen does have support.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"literally the only time i've ever seen it used is for a performance uplift in rpcs3, a ps3 emulator.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,"yes it was

but amd is not cool either

both are companies driven by profit alone",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nobody knows if the silicon has been validated, so you could very well have a defective avx 512 unit.",11th gen is your safest option if you are relying on it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pointless when you can't take any updates for security.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it also works with asus boards (atleast on my z690 tuf gaming) on older bios version, even though there is no explicit toggle for avx-512 it gets automatically enabled when the e-cores are disabled.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they are useful in the rpcs3 emulator for example, they give a good performance uplift.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it honestly seems like a decision made by marketing that the engineers didn't want.,it'll continue being a niche instruction set if intel keeps the install base low.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i couldn't care less if i need it or not right now.,i was going to buy an i9 just because it has the same number of p and e cores and thus would work with avx-512.,this generation felt like a halfway point between the last gen and where they are going.,now that there is no way to avoid shenanigans.,i'll be waiting for the next processors.,my 6700 can keep on going with my 3080ti.,i was going to upgrade with the 3080ti i just got in the shuffle.,not anymore.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sapphire rapids will have both avx-512 and the brand new and much faster amx instruction, but it seems like intel's new ""software defined silicon"" strategy will be to make customers pay more to have their xeon chips supporting these advanced options.",intel's crappy marketing team is behind these awful decisions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't believe it's activated automatically.,"you'll have to go into bios, disable all e-cores (if there's any) and toggle a setting to enable it, provided your board offers this option.",yes it shows up in cpu-z or hwinfo64 summary view.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
asus boards activate avx-512 automatically when the e-cores are disabled (at least my z690 tuf gaming does),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it seems to be for new batches of alderlake cpus only.,altering the product permanently when it's in customers' hands seem to be a very expensive lawsuit waiting to happen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think what people were hoping for was avx512 becoming available on all new consumer-level cpus, which will make it worthwhile for developers to optimize popular software for it.","now that it's being phased out on consumer cpus, there's no chance of avx512 being supported by most developers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you get 120fps on rpcs3 with an 8700k?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is a massive performance difference between your 8700k and the 10/11/12th gen processors when playing really demanding ps3 games like red dead redemption.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"have a look at some benchmarks, i'd imagine alder lakes are fast enough that avx-512 probably isn't as much of a performance increase compared to older intel cpus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

how do we know zen 4 consumer will also have it and not just epyc?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"also have to keep in mind, a program has to be specifically coded to take advantage of this instruction set, it's not going to magically make intense workloads go faster.","99.9% of the people reading this headline aren't going to get an advantage from it, especially having to disable e-cores just to use it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

absolutely agree.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cool.,thanks.,that's the same board i'm using.,"and i don't really need avx-512, but it's kind of curiousity but i do use cemu every once in a while and avx-512 is supposed to really improve cemu performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if intel keeps this up and you want avx 512, zen 4 might be your only option.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why are you still using intel?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't think amd would lock that out for no reason especially when it's a potential selling point given the current 12/13th gen situation.,intel probably didn't _want_ to do so either (otherwise they wouldn't make avx512 into icl-u/rkl-s/tgl from the beginning) but it looks like they are just prioritizing their p/e-core strategy more than avx512 on client platforms and avx512 on e-cores is simply not ready yet.,"they certainly can't let 12400 beat 12900 in some benchmarks from a marketing standpoint, and this wouldn't be an issue for amd at all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>how do we know zen 4 consumer will also have it and not just epyc?,"we don not, but amd has no history of keeping features softwarewise specific to some processors to increase sales revenue.","usually if it is in the silicone, you can use it, period, whether you get official support is another issue.","example: on the amd side checksummed ram can be obtained from the lowest models however official support is only given in higher tiers with specifically certified ram, they never locked that away.",a feature is there or not and has been like that for ages now on the amd side.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is not entirely true.,a program could use underlying libraries/code which have been programmed to take advanatage of these instructions without the program itself (potentially beyond a configuration/flag in the library) being coded to take advantage of them.,"furthermore if targeta cpu with avx-512 instructions the compiler might emit them, if it finds that it would be the most efficient thing to do.","although generally compilers prefer not to use avx-512 instructions (at least the full width 512-bit ones, note that avx-512 also contains various very useful instructions on 256-bit vectors/registers).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hopefully it comes back for 13th gen with full support.,since there are already certain workloads that can take advantage of it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"no, it would assign the work to the p cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"one reason is the latency to transfer stuff over the pci bus, it's better nowadays and somewhat feasible, but you also have to take into account that the software needs to run on anything out there, so cpu simd will at least always be the fallback.","another reason is that it could well be slower to send data to the gpu, compute it and send it back to cpu if you have an algo that can't run on the gpu alone and just parts of it benefit from simd.","another reason is the abysmal state of apis to actually use it, cuda is ok but nv only... opencl is a mess..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

xmp is technically oc.,"the 12th gen support ddr4-3200 and ddr5-4800, but these are jedec profiles.","xmp is never guaranteed to work, and whether it's likely to work or not is normally determined by looking at various reviews.","if it works for most people, then it's likely to work for you.","which is why getting xmp ddr5 kits is a bad idea at this moment: it's simply too unpopular yet, not mature enough to make any estimation on whether xmp works or not.","even most ddr4-3200 are technically oc because they usually have latency around cl16 when the fastest jedec profile for ddr4-3200 is cl20, i believe.","and i've read a few times that the 12th gen has issues with xmp in general, even at lower ddr4 speeds.",just google for something like z690 xmp issues and you'll see a lot of them.,"it still works fine for many people, though, at least in the 3200 cl16 range.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"rma the ram, g skill will send you a replacement kit.",i got g skill 6000 mhz running on my 12900k w/a z690 aourus master.,probably just a bad kit.,i have heard about samsung memory (what g skill uses) giving problems w/xmp on asus boards so finding a kit with hynix ram would be my next move if the rma kit didnâ€™t work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ok thanks, for the tip.",got the ram from newegg and they already approved the return.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had a corsair 5600c36 kit with samsung chips.,"never had a problem with xmp on maximus hero board and 12900k  
it's curious as most of the time whenever i hear of xmp problem it will be a gskill kit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh i wouldâ€™ve suggested going directly through g skill manufacturers warranty only bc newegg has recently had that rma claim nonsense w/gamers nexus: but they should be trying to avoid any more fiascos so you should be good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
got the same kit as you and xmp worked!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have the corsair 6200 and it comes with hynixâ€¦ and having issues since i updated bios from f6.,i am going to try ti flashback.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i heard about that.,hopefully canada newegg is a bit better but thanks for the warning.,might get the corsair vengeance since i believe it uses hynix memory.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
worth a shot.,thatâ€™s the cause of a lot of these instabilities for some boards the samsung/hynix/micron can make all the difference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ill try to bump 100 mhz more, maybe it'll be okay, hopefully ,i wouldn't get my head in subtimings because i dont even know whats going on even with the primary ones lol, i know lower is better and lower/tighter  like 15/15/15 or 15/16/16 means i have to lower frequency ?","i tried going best of both worlds  (3200/14 and 3600/16), felt like 3400-15-17-17 should mean the same perfomance as the original ballistix 3600 cl16, although intel surely benefits more from 3200/14 right but thats expensive.","and thinking i cant get 3600 to work, 3400 with those timings would be ok. got 66 ns or something in userbenchmark compared to 85 ore something with 3600 cl16 gear2.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you should be able to go just below 60 ns latency without issues but it's only a small difference from what you have now if you dont want to bother with subtimings.,"as for the question, yea tighter timings (lower) are harder to achieve with higher freq, so you generally loosen them up as you increase frequency in order to be stable.","i'd say you are 90% where you should be, it's up to you to decide if its worth it to optimize them further.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ambient room temperature is currently 6c (i'm in the uk and its a colder evening).,i have done a couple of bios resets.,"so it was all delivered last friday so is approx 5 days old, initially as mentioned it wouldn't boot and kept flashing the dram and cpu led's on the motherboard which according to the manual indicates an issue with those components.",i used the clr\_cmos jumper but no change so then did the no cpu bios update procedure of putting the latest bios on a fat32 usb stick and pressing the qflash button on the motherboard.,it powered up with an orange light flashing for approx 15 minutes then powered down.,i fired it back up but again got nothing.,again i tried the clr\_cmos jumper and this time it fired up and told me the bios settings had been reset.,the only thing i did from there was to enable the xmp profile for the ram then installed windows 11. i ran it most of the evening then shut it down.,"saturday morning i tried to fire it up but got a black screen again with the vga led flashing at me, this went on for approximately 10 minutes before it kicked in and booted.",since then its fired up first time every time and has been stable.,i have been in ark survival evolved for the past 30-40 minutes and cpu temps are reporting 31c now during gameplay.,i suppose could order a separate thermometer and check it manually.,i guess what i'm trying to ascertain is whether this could be a faulty motherboard and i should get it replaced by amazon so i don't have to rma it at a later date and wait a few weeks for a replacement,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"okayâ€¦ by ambient you mean your room temp, right?",not outdoors?,"well, i guess if itâ€™s 6 in your room then itâ€™s certainly not much warmer outdoors.",my main question: why?,"iâ€™d understand maybe 14 or so, but 6 doesnâ€™t seem like a good indoor temperature, and they have invented ways to bring those temperatures up (like, running a pentium 4 or two in the room).","at any rate, as another poster mentioned you do not want to let it get too much colder than that as frost and condensation could be an issue, since if thereâ€™s little or no heating occurring then iâ€™m guessing humidity isnâ€™t all that low either.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

look up the washer mod.,the ihs gets slightly bent from the pressure of the retention system.,i dropped nearly 10â°c when i did the mod.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
spread it evenly?,?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea spread manually and maybe look into videos regarding this washer mod for lga 1700,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you basically can't.,"it seems like it's a cpu issue, the left and right sides seem to be higher than the center, and the concave shape aio manufacturers put on their coldplates won't help.",you might want to lap you processor for the paste to get more even.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just add more,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i do it like this - apply paste as per cooler instructions.,make preliminary build of pc.,"after checking it boots ok take everything apart, remove cooler, add/reapply paste if some is missing.",you should see the cpu through the paste in patches.,this is fine.,it should be obvious after removing the cooler what's going on with your paste application.,"if you want to get it right the first time, ask a bunch of people on the forums, they will have the answer for sure :p

seriously, just check - even if you're using the paste that came with the cooler, preapplied or not, you're not going to lose any by taking it off and having a look.",cut up a bit of plastic and respread where it seems necessary.,do this on one surface - cooler or cpu.,still worried?,repeat for peace of mind.,i recently removed the cooler from a 4470k installed seven years ago (from the time before the oceans drank atlantis) and it was fine.,i could probably have scraped the paste up and reapplied it...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
either use more pressure or hit it with your purse,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when enough (even) pressure is applied to the cooler the paste will go on the sides by itself.,what board/cooler/retention kit are you using?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that happened to me too, i just used a lot more paste the second time around and spread it with my fingers and a little spatula",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

recommend the rice method rather than the pea,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i like to spread it manually to at least cover the center portion of the ihs but i try to keep the very center of the ihs with more paste than the surrounding area to avoid air bubbles.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don't over tighten the screws.,you have the arctic cooler liquid ii aio with vrm cold plate?,at least that is what it looks like.,just place the motherboard/computer flat so that the cpu ihs is facing upwards.,manually spread the paste on the cpu ihs.,now manually spread the paste again on the aio cold plate.,you can even do a test run in order to find the edges/outline of the ihs to do a good spread on the cold plate.,place the aio with no pressure onto the cpu ihs.,and just tighten as slowly and as evenly as you can.,alternate.,"once you feel resistance in the screw, that is finger tight.",just leave it finger tight.,check the temps see if there are improvements.,repeat as necessary.,"you can even reuse the thermal paste, add or remove.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

didnâ€™t you know?,people need instructions for the simplest of things these days,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is definitely bad advice... what if there's not enough paste?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is what i was going to say,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"what can i spread with, without having to order something?",old credit card?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is the way,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not the ihs.,"the whole board, socket and chip itself gets bend.",not to mention the long-term effects this has.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's risky business for most people.,i would attempt a washer mod first if temps turn out to be bad.,replace the cooler second.,lap the ihs as a last ditch effort as kiss goodbye to resale and warranty.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it voids the warranty and for someone just worried about their thermal paste application that's going a step too far.,for general users its a bit much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in all honesty it might be good for some people but knowing me i'm bound to fuck it up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
er in general gaming scenarios no but when applying a small overclock i get thermal throttling in cinebench multi core test.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is also a possibility.,"i have seen several incorrect screwing techniques though, so it did feel worth mentioning at the time",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
true.,old coolers have wrong offset.,"sometimes they work great, sometimes not..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dude thereâ€™s plenty of paste.,proper thermal compound application is just to put a small goup in the middle and let the heatsink spread it.,"the only exceptions are two: 

1. laptops/delids with laptops youâ€™ll want to evenly apply the thermal paste with a credit card.",same with a delided cpu.,this is because they are exposed dies.,also applies to graphics card repasting.,2. server/enthusiast cpus.,"threadripper works well with an x, and with intelâ€™s former x79/x99/x299 cpus it was good practice to put a slightly larger sized amount of thermal compound in the middle.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
too much thermal paste is not good and can actually cause higher temps as it's not going to allow the heat to get to the cooler.,you just need enough to fill in the small gaps between the heat spreader and the base plate that the pressure doesn't fill in..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
worked for me too!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
use a piece of stiff plastic - the ram packaging is perfect.,"cut it to a desired size, use the machined straight side to spread.","i just work the cooler about after applying a few drops evenly spread without screwing it down, works great if you're careful.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes..thatâ€™s what ek says to use too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"this was taken from quora since this is not my area:

there are microscopic gaps and crevices that exist on any metallic surface.","these gaps are known as â€œcontact resistance,â€ and they are filled with air - which has a thermal conductivity of approximately 0.02 w/mk.",thermal paste will typically have a thermal conductivity of approximately 10 w/mk.,"copper, on the other hand, has a thermal conductivity of 400 w/mk.",this means that you do not want to apply so much thermal paste between your devices that you end up creating a distance between the metal-to-metal contact points that would otherwise be connected.,"if you use too much thermal paste, youâ€™ll be trading that 200 to 400 w/mk of the metallic contact points for the 10 w/mk generated by a thick gob of thermal paste.","and the thicker the gob, the more material the heat must travel through, making it even more inefficient.","\--

that said,  because of the way hsf/clc are screwed down it probably helps reduce any serious over application since it will squeeze out overflow.",imo it's still not a good idea since if people don't screw them down properly (or even forget to remove the plastic film from a clc based on posts on reddit) it's not going to be optimal.,people are welcome to disagree and i don't really have any issues so downvote away!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"for a 12600k, yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what are the downsides of using one?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no cpu overclocking.,you dont get to utilize the unlocked cpu.,locked ram overclocking apart from xmp.,only 2 slots of memory.,"and the most important bit, the vrms on the h610 will probably be very bad and reach 100c trying to handle a 12600k that can use upwards of 130w",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
only single dimm per channel is the main difference.,"just look at this: https://respawnfirst.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/112121212121.png

"i know from experience that asus boards will try and run up to 1.5v, which is excessive but shouldn't break anything in the short term.",i would not expect them to program anything higher than that but you never know.,it's also possible you just got a dud cpu.,however if intel finds out about the oc they will deny any claims on this cpu regardless of the actual cause.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"> bothers me the most is tha

we have many users consistently running without issue you can see real-world user feedback in our pcdidy group.",as noted you should will a speed like 6400 is not going to be guaranteed i would be surprised to see if you can reach speeds between 5600/6000.,especially as you have only 2 dimms.,if you are running 4 dimms but did not detail that then you should not expect to see 4400 regardless of uefi updates as the limitation is imc-based.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
xmp is an overclock and not guaranteed if you carefully read the information on g.skill and any high frequency quick you will see as you have noted and i have previously detailed the imc is the limiting factor.,most cpus will see 6000mt but speeds beyond this will trail downwards relative to their % of success.,the xmp profile just means the ic is validated to be able to run at that speed it does not guarantee that your imc or your board will be able to.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have dual 3600mt/s sticks and running them at that speed only causes crashes in games.,"that ""others"" are running their ram in the 5 and 6 thousands doesn't help me, and there are many like me who are experiencing the same.",some people can't even run 3200mt/s sticks.,this seemingly on anything from the i5-12400 to the i7-12700.,it doesn't help any of us to hear of other people's success stories.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"agree, but i can still be disappointed ddr5 doesn't xmp as reliably as ddr4.",":-) 

i was spoiled by the halcyon days of ""just set and go"" ddr4 xmp.","ram vendors have the luxury of selling kit marketed at certain spec, and if it doesn't xmp to that, blame imc or the board knowing there's no easy way to prove it's the ram.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"population, density, rank and ic matter.",3600mt is not a lot of information to assess whether or not your experience is indicative of a normal experience.,if you want to share more information that is fully detailed i would suggest you submit a formal service and support ticket to our service team so they can work to debug and collect information and if needed supply it to our hq team.,beyond this if you want more asus specific support and other users who are running the platform you can join our pcdiy group to have easy to reference comapirsons relative to the board/uefi/kits.,"with this in mind, the board does not come too much into play as the base topology and current autorules and tuning are very consistent and as such offer a similar experience across series.",the main determining factor will be the items i have noted above and critically density/population.,an example of this is shown below ( this is based on wide scale cpu sample testing ) of course all speeds over 4800mt are overclocked.,"4x16gb â€“ 4000-4400mt_x000d_  
2x32 â€“ 4400-5200mt_x000d_  
2x16 â€“ 4800-6800mt \*all speeds over 4800 are overclocked and whether manually defined or defined via xmp still qualify as an overclock.",my recommendation still holds that as you are running a divider than is a greater range of not being supported on the largest range of imcs you drop it.,as such load the xmp profile ( again assuming you only have 2 dimms ) and manually setting the divider prior to rebooting.,you can first try 5600 and then work your way up.,we have found 5600-6000 is in the range of 85% if not greater likelihood on k series cpus.,speeds exceeding this are possible when will have a lower % this has always been the case just like cpu frequency when it comes to scaling but is also affected by the items i have noted above as well as other operating parameters like cpu centric overclocks.,you should ideally always test your dram oc in an async fashion.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"considering i speak from working on with xmp, motherboard and memory across every modern enthusiast chipset in the last 20 years and at this point thousands of builds and hundreds of boards and engaged with users across all segments the challenges faced are not new for ddr5 compared to ddr4 and i can confidently say the maturity and scaling of dd5 is far superior to ddr4.",the overall experience i would say is actually impressive considering how new ddr5 i. it took ddr4 years to reach this level of overall maturity and scaling.,while on the outskirts ddr5 is essentially already offered double the max speed as the base that is officially supported by the imc.,it is actually impressive that for a large percentage users can purchase 4 classes of xmp memory and generally have 80 to 100% effectiveness ( 4800 up to 6000mt ).,"if you take ddr4 experience during the same time  ( first 6 months essentially ) ddr5 is offer smoother operation, superior scaling and overall better experience especially as the base speed that is intailized is 4800mt.",whereas for ddr4 the base is 2400/2666 and to even reach officially supported speeds you have to manually enable a higher divider or enable xmp.,this is a far better out of box experience for the user even if they do not oc.,beyond this the quality of xmp profiling is far superior.,"ddr4 even at this stage still has the same challenges resident to the number of dimms, rank, density and ic that ddr5 has; this is inherent to the architecture of how memory and scaling for memory works.","furthemore, the imc and platform heavily play into this as amd differs from intel and they both can use ddr4 and that does not even bring in hedt which had numerous challenges users struggled to fully understand regarding density/rank and how it affected scaling or how mixed kits affect scaling.",you can readily find users who think there are issues with a board or kit or something for amd when they think that 1:1 if speeds alongside overclocked memory should be expected when both are exceedingly the validated specifications designs for the highest stability/reliability.,then there are ddr4 intel z590 users who expect/want/ or do not understand the differences between gear 1 or gear 2 relative to dram scaling.,as to the ram as long as it details that the imc is part of the evaluation there is no fault to the memory unless it is a faulty ic or weaker ic compared to others(this can happen).,it is useful to have pre binned and sorted ics and corresponding profiles but it can be expected that you can readily expect overclocks to be perfect for every permutation.,if this is what is to be expected you need to be more conservative.,this is also why the range of kit offers aligns with this.,"you could purchase xmp 4800, 5200 or 5600 if the goal is to ensure the highest possible likelihood of ""working"" beyond that higher speed kits ( just like they were in ddr4 ) are going to be dependent on the quality of the imc which changes per architecture.","for example, on z590 which was ddr4 i have a kit of 5300 ddr regardless that it is xmp you cannot expect to run this on a 9th gen cpu where the imc did not have that type of scaling support even in 10th gen the scaling of the imc was not generally strong enough to run that and evenf or 11th gen where it was possible you could there was a large enough percentage that it was not a consistent guarantee a user could by that kit and expect it to work regardless that we as board vendor design our boards physical topology and develop firmware tuning to complement the xmp profile/validated dimm.",the unknown will always be the imc and at this time there is way to pre screen an imc.,"in most situations, most users are generally not going to be too affected outside of those who make assumptions( like the numerous cases where i seen users take two kits to have 4 dimms and assume the xmp profile will work for 4 ) this type of assumption/issue would still be the same for ddr5 or ddr4.",wrapping this up we are looking into to some options for our next generation of asus aioc implementations to include memory and a predictive table to better communicate to users the % of likelihood in regards to memory divider they are targeting.,we are in a unique position to offer this as opposed to conjecture from many sources on singular results as we test hundreds of cpu samples.,whereas an end user whether the result is good or bad can report a value that while valid could or could not be represented as a true average.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm sorry, mate, but it's hard to get past the jargon here.","i might be an educated computer technician, but half of what you're saying makes little to no sense to me.","to be fair, i said nothing about my situation and parts.","i was simply pointing out that lots of people are having issues, and most of these have to do with xmp.","people expect xmp to ""just work"", as i believe was the intention of it.",most people have no notion of what even overclocking is.,"this leads to people getting annoyed, disappointed and might even return the products they were looking forwards to enjoying, regardless of who's fault it is.",i shall consider opening a ticket.,"anyway, there are several people, including here on reddit that are experiencing these things.","some of them with the same parts i have (b660m-plus d4, i5-12400f, crucial ballistix) : [https://www.reddit.com/r/overclocking/comments/s7lv4n/12400\_with\_asus\_tuf\_gaming\_b660mplus\_d4\_wifi\_xmp/](https://www.reddit.com/r/overclocking/comments/s7lv4n/12400_with_asus_tuf_gaming_b660mplus_d4_wifi_xmp/)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"xmp is overclocking regardless of how it is marketed, this is why the official speeds for both intel and amd are clearly detailed.",if you want the highest likelihood of it working you should adhere to those speeds.,"for 12th gen the max official speed is either 3200mt or 4800mt  


xmp is designed to aid in reducing the complexity of overclocking but cannot eliminate the inherent limitations/challenges that come along with overclocking.","you will find the same information i noted generally in detailing on memory mfg websites, indicating that the cpu ( imc ), alongside the board, is critically part of the requirements to achieve success relative to xmp profiling.","beyond this, there are of course ways to improve the likelihood but it does require correctly edifying yourself.","as i noted with population and density, regardless of you picking an xmp kit if a user decides to mix kits and thinks that it will work that is not the fault of the kit, the motherboard, or the imc.",it is due to the user assuming that they can mix kits when the profiles were designed for a specific set of memory and their respective ( size/density ).,"in this respect, i have seen many posts that does not prove a fault just an end user mis configuration.","with this noted this does not me asus and intel are not committed to improving upon the experience when possible but there are limits to what can be achieved when it comes to ensuring an overclocked ""out of box experience"".","my suggestion would be to   


1. update your uefi   
2. test the memory at stock values ( non xmp )   
if it i passes   
3. proceed to enable xmp but do not maintain the default divider defined by the xmp profile ( 3600 ) but instead manually set the divider.","the recommended value would be 3200, from there you can attempt to see if the system post, boot and passes testing at that divider.",from there you can scale one divider at time to see where the instability comes into play.,you can also attempt to try an alternate gear in the event the gear is affecting scaling.,"generally, 3600mt should be able to be achieved on gear 1 but you may need to try gear 2.  


you can find this value - dram frequency ratio option",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thank you, this was much clearer.",i appreciate that.,"it confirms the notions i had, more or less, and matches what other people are saying.","unfortunately, this is more than one can expect most people to understand.",perhaps intel could have been more lenient in regards to memory support in their design and decision to lock the much discussed sa voltage (although exactly how this is locked isn't explained anywhere).,perhaps marketing of memory and xmp is also partially to blame.,"also, recommendations by various folk without making it clear that it might not work out-of-the-box.","what i would ask, is that this ""issue"" is better conveyed, so that people don't get so frustrated.","if they understand the problem better, they would be more forgiving.","oh, and stories based on ddr5 isn't relevant to most people, just simply based on the cost of such a system.",it's in enthusiast+ territory.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"understand, thanks for your feedback but these challenges are not new and not ddr5 specific and have commonly been a point of end user experience in ddr4 especially on amd and hedt platforms which increases challenges due to the density and number of dimms.","the voltage is not of consequence as whether ddr4 or ddr5 the scaling of the imc and limitations resident to dram population, rank of the memory and ic all still apply.",the only time it is of consequence is the pre defined value is too conservative and needs to be increased and this is generally not the case with xmp although it can happen if the imc is weaker.,"we work to communicate with our users via a variety of communities and through content like our weekly streams and more but in the end when you enter in an enthusiast level of use you need to be aware of aspects, if not as noted there is nothing wrong with going with stock relative to the dram all performance values communicated for cpus are achieved at stock so again it is overclocking.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

little cores on steroids.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what a horrible time to buy a 10w nuc.,rip,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is really good news for intel 4(euv).,mtl will be a monster for sure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so 24 atom cores with better than skl ipc running at 4.5 ghz+ and 8 cores with colossal ipc running likely at 5 ghz or more.,this is massive all core performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why would this be?,"no process is ever the most efficient at 4.5ghz, so what is the point then?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"based on the timing of this, and that ian tends to not discuss rumors or products far from release, i would assume this is in regards to raptor lake.","which if it's accurate, that's going to be huge mt gains paired with the doubling of the e-cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel atom.... that's a name i haven't heard in a long time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if the 2018 core architecture roadmap is still relevant, next mont will bring frequency increase.","gracemont peak freq is 4ghz, so 4.5 for next gen is plausible unless 7nm doesn't turn out like 10nm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
each 4 core complex of atom on 12th gen uses 30 watts at 4ghz.,i wouldn't worry too much if power savings are your goal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this honnestly seems to good to be true, there must be a catch",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
beef up the mt performance to compete with amd.,these efficiency cores seem to be more about mt efficiency per die space.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, intel 4 is still not exactly out so we don't know how good it performs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
he said next gen atom cores.,raptor lake uses the same small cores as alder lake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't see that happening with raptor lake.,"until intel moves to euv process like the upcoming intel 4 process for meteor lake, i don't see small cores clocking beyond 4 ghz.",the non euv process is the main reason for higher power consumption at higher frequencies.,with intel 4 there is going to be a huge jump in power efficiency and it makes sense for intel to clock their e cores in desktop products beyond 4 ghz or even 4.5ghz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
current e-cores are atom based.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30w was also typical for gemini lake under full load.,but those were 4 cores max.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very high latency between e and p core complexes is the catch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, based on chips & cheese analysis of gracemont, pushing it to 4.5+ ghz would be very stupid, huge amounts of power draw for little gain.",interesting they're pushing little cores this high though.,makes me wonder what they plan to do with them in the future.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the next generation of small cores is rumored to be called crestmont, and be used in meteor lake.","if this is true, and meteor lake does end up having it's small cores pushed that far, i would suspect intel 4 is performing better than what many of us would have expected, or that intel is not pushing past 16 small cores and instead pushing clocks and increasing ipc a bit for their small cores for meteor lake.","if clocks are pushed this high, it looks like the small cores really were not there for power efficiency as much as they were there for increasing mt performance in the same amount of die space compared to big cores.","the clock speed gain alone from the 3.9ghz for the small cores on the 12900k to 4.5 ghz on next gen could be a 10-15 percent gain, though we don't know what the all core boosts are.",this isn't even counting potential ipc gains as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, if this is true, we're looking at a significant performance increase for meteorlake / arrowlake (whatever comes after raptorlake).",not to mention the big core improvement.,i love competition.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
their next nodes are looking healthier than i expected.,"i mean i expected them to just delay everything euv by 1~2 years because they are so short on euv machines, so the bar wasn't high.","looking healthy doesn't matter if they don't ship on time, though.",hope they've got their act together because their roadmap looks pretty good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i expect volume might be a problem.,"something pretty interesting i found is that according to the intel node roadmap from anandtech, intel 7 was ready by the start of q3 2021, and alder lake launched near the end of q4 2021. 

intel 4 is supposed to be ready by the start of q3 2022. however, we already know that raptor lake is the 2h 2022 product.","this would give more time for the ramp up and fabbing of meteor lake chips, since they would be launching in 2023. i suspect they are doing this to make sure that they have appropriate volume for meteor lake, potentially because they are limited in the amount of chips they can make per day because of the lack of euv machines.",this was only made more likely when gelsinger also announced that intel 4 was greatly simplified and the use of euv in the intel 4 node was greatly increased (announced that the same time intel renamed their nodes).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel has enough euv machines for intel 4. no issues on that front.,this will release on volume for sure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, its essentially confirmed that the volume isn't there yet now that granite is delayed.",from what they've shown it seems granite is small and tiled design so large die defects are probably not the problem.,staying on 7 for enterprise gives their 4 node some breathing room to deliver.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it depends if you are planning on overclocking or not and your budget.,personally iâ€™d go with a z690 board from msi such as the pro-a or the tomohawk.,the carbon looks pretty good too.,iâ€™d avoid gigabyte if i were you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'd probably go for a msi one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

a 4 pin cpu connector isn't rated to provide enough power for a 9900k.,you run the risk of that cable getting really hot and catching on fire.,"you could limit it in the bios to be safe and not start a fire, but you could also get a cheaper processor, save money, and get the same performance.",also a 300w psu isn't enough.,you're going to use up most of that psus rated capacity on just the cpu.,"again you could limit stuff in the bios and maybe make it work, but why waste the money upgrading when you'll just be limiting your performance down to the same level you have now?","no way in hell your motherboards vrms could handle a 9900k, definitely going to overheat and your mobo will throttle the power.",an intel stock cooler style design is nowhere near capable of handling a 9900k.,is this a prebuilt or something?,there's a good chance they never released the bios update you'd need to even run a 9900k in your motherboard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,iâ€™m not sure how you even managed to get by with the i5 8400 and only a 300w psu.,"also, the cpu cooler you mentioned will absolutely not be able to handle a i9 9900k.",even at stock speeds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
300w psu..what a joke.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"looking at a comment you made down below you mentioned ""barely any vrms"", throwing a 9900k on a low-end board is a very bad idea.","your psu would be very questionable for a 9900k, unless you don't have a dgpu, and even then it'd still be a bit questionable, although with a low-end board (again, a very bad idea to put a 9900k on a low-end board) it'd probably never be able to even push a 9900k enough for the psu to be an issue.","as for the cooler, which cooler exactly?","""slightly beefed up intel stock cooler from cooler master"" doesn't exactly mean a while lot when (iirc) the 8400's stock cooler was barely enough for the 8400, a slightly better one likely wouldn't be anywhere close to good enough for a 9900k.",have you already bought the cpu?,"if not you should definitely consider just going with a newer platform, for example a 12400 on a b660 motherboard, unless you're using your pc for something that's heavily multi-threaded, although you didn't mention what you're even using your pc for.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you might just get away with the stock cooler if you are not planning on overclocking the 9900k (depending on your case airflow) but a new psu is definitely required.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so, everyone in this sub so far is pretty much wrong.","a 9900k would run on this, albeit not great.",everyone telling you that you need a new psu is wrong.,thatâ€™s not an issue actually.,at stock clocks youâ€™ll be fine.,"itâ€™s 300 watts yes, but i assume no graphics card so thatâ€™s fine.","your issue here would be motherboard vrms, the cooler, and potential motherboard bios incompatible issues.","simply put, a 9900k would overheat the vrms and itself and thermal throttle.",itâ€™d still outperform a 8400 though that way.,"as for the motherboard bios, youâ€™d have to go to acer website and get the newest one.","now, again i wouldnâ€™t put a 9900t in there.","a i5 8400 is a good cpu chip, thereâ€™s really no reason you should need to upgrade.","if you do, then itâ€™s itâ€™s probably better and easier to just build a whole new pc.","now, you *could* buy a i9 9900t i guess but those are expensive.","you could also downclock a 9900k, but with a locked down oem board thatâ€™s not really an optionâ€¦

bottom line.,you need a new psu.,650w or 750w is the way to go.,for â€œfuture proofingâ€ (although you really canâ€™t do this completely) 850w.,and you need a new cpu cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just start from scratch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they most likely only have a cpu and no gpu with a 300w psu.,an 8400 just by its self probably doesn't pull anywhere near that.,but a 9900k on the other hand would be right near that if it could run full bore but the mobo op has probably would not let it anyways.,best bet for op is probably an 8700 if they are only using a the igpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

have you tried using windows 11?,i fixed my random freezing by upgrading my pc with an asus board to windows 11. maybe windows 10 has issus with e-core.,if that does not work.,it might be better to just return the board and buy a msi board to avoid all the troubleshooting.,it took me 3 months of troubleshooting before i decided to upgrade to windows 11. i been seeing people having freezing issues with asus and gigabytes board.,i haven't seen anyone complaining about freezing on msi board.,*update: sorry i guess windows 11 did not fix my freezing issue.,my computer froze after using it for five days.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hey, i ran 30 minutes powe stress test of occt and had issue.",so i don't think vrm overheating and ram as tested with 12hr continuous memtest86.,i'm thinking maybe this issue is due to uneven intel stock cooler pressure?,(i don't think it's installed evenly but no matter how i try it always seems slightly off at one side.,though it doesn't wobble when checked.),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have tried reinstering in both slots.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have lowered the ram freq to 2133mhz to test and cpu voltage is at auto.,i will observe it for the issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hi, yes i have replaced the motherboard and still having issue.",currently i installed hwinfo (with remote monitoring) to see what voltage the cpu gets when it freezes.,"now only the psu, ram and cooler needs to be replaced but i doubt it will fix it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no i don't have ram overclocked.,also tm5 test didn't show any errors either (ran for 10 mintues),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah same in windows 11 & linux,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my pc froze with msi motherboard ðÿ¥²,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
check your cpu and vrm temps while running cinebench for 10 minutes.,if they're fine then it's definitely your single channel ram.,you should get a kit or another stick.,"if possible, return that ram and get a 3200mhz cl16 16gb kit",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>i'm thinking maybe this issue is due to uneven intel stock cooler pressure?,"that would cause overheating, not random stability issues.",it's almost certainly your ram.,have you done bios updates btw?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same cpu though right?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
update: i bought a new ram that is also in motherboard supported list and it still frooze.,now i'm replacing this cpu to see.,though unlikely it will fix that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's not ram as i tried with a new ram and it still frooze.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes same cpu.,i'm not sure if it's cpu issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have a noctua nh-d15 cooling my 12700k and the temps are great even when i was just using 1 fan.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there was a discussion about the 12700 (non-k) just a while ago.,the conclusion was that it's more than enough.,"by extension, if you don't plan to oc, it should be enough for the 12700k.",it's an awesome cooler anyway.,"i suggest adding a second 120 mm fan, though.","it comes with a mounting bracket already, so just get something like nf-a12 or arctic p12 and call it a day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iirc previous tests have showed about a 1.5 deg diff between the 15 and the 15s.,i have a non k 12700 and a twin fan 15s.,a short stress test went up to low 70s.,if i was op i would definitely keep it all noctua if a 120 were added.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
return it asap,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looks like they put it in backwards but also everything is wrongly packaged,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that is not how it is normally packed, this is an opened item",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ihs is normally facing out that window and intel would not tape it to a piece of cardboard.,normally in a clamshell.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is backwards.,most likely an opened and returned item.,"slight chance that somebody bought a low and high end cpu, swapped the cpu headspreders, and returned one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that isn't even an lga 1700 cpu.,lga 1700 has keyed inlets around the top and bottom in each corner to fit into the motherboard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wtf?,"yeah, don't even open it.",whoever accepted this return should be fired.,that's not a 1700. you just bought what looks like a 15xx at new prices.,let us know how the return goes so you don't get newegged.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is that plastic saran wrap?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
best buy has had problems with selling returned opened items with swapped parts.,"i've seen it with hard drives, obviously no one is minding the store quite literally.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they used cellophane wrap to reseal the cpu send that shit back.,already looks untested and def an open box item,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whoever picked that curbside needs their head examined.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel cpus come in a transparent clamshell a d the etching with the model, year and country should be visible not the bottom side of the cpu.",it was tampered with do return it asap.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
return it asap!,it may end up popping and destroying the motherboard!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"when new, the ihs faces the outside trough the window, not the pads, and it's not wrapped in plastic film, but a clear plastic case made of harder plastic.","the fact that they hid the ihs from the window, makes me think it's an open-box item that may have been swapped for a lower end part by the previous customer.","go back to the store and return it, get it exchanged for a new one",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm scared!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wtf ?,this ain't normal give it back and get a new one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the one i bought from bby was straight up loose in the (unopened) packaging.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is that a sticker on the ihs lmao,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have a 12600k, sadly that the box.",at least the lya cpus have contact pads with the pins on the mobo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

factory sealed (with cling film).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you got a return item,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i returned it for a shipped replacement and they didnâ€™t give me trouble, thank you everyone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i dont know the law in america but if you could get money by sueing them for selling you a faked and opened cpu because this isnt even the alder lake series and not even the i7 12700k.,probably would be a great amount of money that you would get,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
am i a sucker for paying for my cpus look like this guy got a free upgrade,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this is why i go in and grab the item myselfâ€¦ i donâ€™t think itâ€™s a company issue, itâ€™s more of an underpaid employee that doesnâ€™t really know or give a fuck issueâ€¦",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you seen the scams?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
return this item asap.,someone scammed them and it seems like they are trying to scam you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
normally the heat spreader faves the other way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it looks extremely reliable))),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what the fuck.,i've seen it all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it is backwards, but that is normal packaging, depending on the gen. 10th/11th gen chips have that packaging.","people saying it's not normal are talking outta their ass, and as i said (and another guy did too) it's only weird because the cpu itself is put backwards.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"take it out, put it in your oc and see if it throttles or even boots properly.","or, return it and wait.","cpuâ€™s can take a lot and still be ok. iâ€™d be more worried about cases, motherboards, gpuâ€™s or monitors before iâ€™d worry about a cpu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"> newegged

lol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the warehouse employees that do customer picks typically have no clue what a cpu is or how it should look in the box.,source: worked at best buy for almost two years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the microkey punches so far above itâ€™s size as far as keybed goes!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
definitely not,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lmao yes it is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its not even the i7 12700k.,thats an older cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's not even the same shape as 12th gen processors.,clearly not a 12700k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
look like someone bought a 12700k and returned a pentium from 2010,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
always look when youre there and then post on here while still there lmao,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dark spots on the pads can be normal.,"that is not the issue, it's the fact that it was repackaged and sold as new that is the issue",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's not what's sus to me.,it's more the fact that it's backwards.,"they were hiding the ihs, probably to hide the fact that it's not the model it says on the box.",dark spots on the pads are common,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i looked it up, the backside is the same as on the first generation of core i7 processors.","so, op technically got an i7, but it's comparable to a modern pentium.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i donâ€™t blame them for getting played with a different cpu but itâ€™s not cool that this entered the loop for a new item sale.,i definitely should have looked before i left but i never even considered it and havenâ€™t bought a cpu in the past.,lesson learned!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was making that comment speaking as someone who does work in a warehouse picking those products.,myself and my coworkers would notice a factory seal broken and also know what a cpu is.,donâ€™t know what kind of shit best buy you worked at or what kind of slap dicks inhabit it.,donâ€™t think you have to be building pcs to be able to identify new in box productâ€¦ sounds like you just worked with some trash kids who canâ€™t handle even the simplest of jobs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"just crazy how these ""established"" stores don't have some sorta pc tech guy just testing the returns.","here in canada, we have a store called.... well... canadacomputers.",which has about 90% of the pc hardware market.,"i never had an issue buying returned used items or new items, and if i do return an item.",i always see their tech guy testing it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, first generation i7s were on the lga 1366 socket.","without further information, it could also be a xeon, since they are also found on the same socket.","some of those are better, and some are significantly worse than the contemporary i7s, and many of them have the same capacitor layout on the back of the chip.","without further information, it's hard to say which which it actually is.","many of those low end xeons are basically not even ""worth"" the cost to ship them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™ve seen so many people return prebuilt gaming pcs claiming it didnâ€™t have a gpu in it.,interesting how cyberpower seems to forget putting the gpu in all of these pcs.,people are scum.,not to mention the people who walk out with multiple consoles that wonâ€™t allow us to complete their pickup until theyâ€™ve verified the condition of the packagingâ€¦ such scum,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the cpu you're seeing in the picture is very clearly not for socket lga1700.,the pad-free rectangle of lga1700 is more elongated.,"the keyings, pads, marking and capacitor arrangement are consistent with lga1366 ([reference, left-most cpu](https://images.anandtech.com/reviews/cpu/intel/lynnfield/review/chiptrioback.jpg)), which means this is a bloomfield (first generation i7) cpu.","return immediately, /u/thevisi0nary.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

china is not russia.,and china will not likely be invading taiwan.,china's economy is mostly well developed and well balanced.,they have the world's 2nd largest economy behind the us in terms of gdp.,"and as both chinese and american citizens have witnessed these past 2 or 3 years, any tariffs applied towards chinese made goods has a reverse effect of hurting the american economy.",this is because our economies are very much intertwined.,it's like shooting ourselves in the foot.,and currently china hasn't brought up the issue of needing to take back taiwan.,at least in any measurable sense.,there isn't a big propaganda campaign or pretext necessary for invasion basically.,and both the chinese and taiwan people have done an excellent job of intertwining the two economies.,foxconn relies on chinese labor for its factories.,taiwan motherboard manufacturers all have factories in china.,etc... attacking the country by force will hurt both economies.,and i just don't see china hurting economically anytime soon.,the us china tariffs enacted by trump's regime did more damage to the us economies than it did the chinese!,https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/china%e2%80%93united_states_trade_war#effects,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that will not help the regular russian citizen and likely does not hurt russia the government one bit.,i think thats why these computer chip sanctions target just government sales.,the people of europe need to ween themselves off of russia oil and gas.,that hurts the russian government way more than not buying a russian doll or whatever.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"potentially, the main thing here isn't about computer cpus.",it's probably a bigger deal that bigger process nodes are going to be prevented from being sold.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they can buy as long as there is stock.,anyhow for intel at least they are making a lot more than just consumer cpus and not having access to those other products is also going to be huge.,both companies are also the backbone of the server industry and not having access to expansion and replacements is potentially also big.,not having access to tsmc is also additionally terrible because they make all kinds of chips based on demand.,the effect of a ban like this starts more slowly and gets exponentially more crippling pretty fast based on demand.,with the current chip shortage i would be hard pressed  to think that russia has any significant stock of anything of these at hand.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

pretty sure the drop is coming from using liquid metal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would imagine that the cost of production of pure copper ihs is higher than a nickel-plated copper alloy ihs.,"intel already has low margins on their desktop cpus, i donâ€™t think they would want to unnecessarily cut into that anymore than they have to.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"water pipes in houses are usually made of copper, i don't think a thin sheet would cost that much.","but when you have shareholders, every cent counts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you're correct.,the ihs is already nickel plated copper.,the reduction in thermal resistance is coming from replacing the solder layer with a very thin liquid metal layer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'd pay more for a cooler chip.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i believe you can hire the same people who sell them to do it for you.,"not even all ihs's are soldered, and you want them to give out copper ihs; doubt.",but luckily there's a way to get what you want.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"please google super sample antialiasing, dynamic super resolution and virtual super resolution before arguing any further.",rendering a game at a higher resolution than your monitor is one of the oldest and most effective forms of antialiasing that exists.,"the tldr is that your graphics card doesnâ€™t know or care how many pixels your monitor has and will just downscale at the end to match, taking the average colour of the multiple samples per pixel, resulting in less aliasing.",now stop being a child and downvoting everyone who knows a little bit more than you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and you think it is more reasonable to assume that op was insisting that the driver was able to change the properties of their display, rather than comparing with the features of the nvidia driver which they mentioned by name becauseâ€¦?",stop talking such crap.,if you canâ€™t answer their question about downsampling in the intel driver then do the next most helpful thing and leave without flooding their thread with rubbish.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for providing the only useful response in this thread.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ignore them.,ssaa is something that has been done for decades at this point.,"itâ€™s not â€œimpossibleâ€, and youâ€™re right that nvidia and amd both support this in their driver.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's not what he asked.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm very familiar with these features.,still can't make a 1080p monitor have 1440p resolution.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah.,because you immediately understood the ops nonsensical question and didn't need to read further posts to narrow down what he may be referring to...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so, there is a way to do the same as nvidia and amd?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes it is.,he wanted to set an internal resolution of 1440p and downsample it to output at 1080p from his driver in the same way you can with the nvidia driver.,you insisted that this wasnâ€™t possible.,"stop backpedaling, take the l and stop arguing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can absolutely have an internal resolution of 1440p and downscale it to a 1080p monitor.,if you were familiar with the features you would not have talked such crap.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, it was immediately obvious what they were talking about, itâ€™s the only reasonable and logical interpretation of what they asked.","youâ€™re the weird one for assuming they were asking how to manifest a bigger pixel grid with a driver, especially as they referenced dsr in the nvidia driver.",there was absolutely enough information in the op to interpret without being the colossal arse you have been.,"reading further on wouldnâ€™t have helped anyway as everyone else itt was just insisting that antialiasing wasnâ€™t real, like yourself.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i donâ€™t know, sorry.",i donâ€™t use integrated graphics.,i was just getting frustrated by people arguing with you and downvoting you for acknowledging that this 30 year old antialiasing method even exists.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you are literally the only person arguing this.,you are the only person who doesnâ€™t know what internal resolution means.,you are the only person who seems to think that you canâ€™t play a game at a different resolution to your monitor.,the funny thing about your previous example is that if you turn vsync off your ingame fps *can* and often will exceed your monitor refresh rate.,literally none of this is dependant on your actual physical monitor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

from personal experience - i couldnâ€™t get my pc to boot with gskill 6400 set at anything higher than 4400. this is on an asus z690 hero with latest bios.,iâ€™ve seen many similar complaints online.,so personally i think youâ€™re much more likely to use ddr4 at its full potential than use the current ddr5 at its full potential.,right now i just donâ€™t see ddr5 as a benefit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ddr5 by far and it's not even close.,the kit you posted has at at stock xmp a read of 109 gb/s and a 58ns latency(in aida64).,that ddr4 kit has maybe 58gb/s and ~50ns.,if you fix the ddr5 kit bad subtimings on a unify-x you could get ddr5-6800 cl32 with a 50ns latency and absolutely bonkers performance.,"https://youtu.be/zn0uxb6jf1q
you could probably get 1t command rate to work too and get like ~45ns latency lol.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
motherboard selection matters as much this generation as it ever has.,"there also haven't been very many revisions of various ics, so winning a good bin on ddr5 isn't hard.",i am currently running dual sided hynix from dell.,the sticks are so basic that they have green pcb and there is no xmp profile.,"when you plug the sticks in they run at 4000 c40, but i have managed to overclock them to 6400 c 28.  that is a more than 50% overclock on some very basic dram.","my point, i guess, is that instead of blowing the budget on a 6400 kit, you should invest in a high end board and get more out of every component attached to it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the evolve x actually had an improved front panel and it helped the temps a lot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've seen shit from the 1980s that looked better than this all you apple fan boys only like it because of the logo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ok,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your cooler is good.,however these things can cause high cpu temps.,"1. poor case air flow
2. warm ambient or room temp
3. improperly mounted cooler
4. overvolting cpu (bios may be doing this automatically)
5. dust inside blocking air",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"those chips run hot, 70-80c is alright especially while gaming.","just keep a eye on it, if it starts to hit 91,92 i would start to try to figure out whatâ€™s wrong.",it could be improper mount.,shitty thermal paste applications.,low quality thermal paste.,not enough air flow in the case itself.,what also happens is once the gpu starts getting super hot the air inside the case starts to get hot and if you donâ€™t have good enough air flow.,youâ€™ll see cpu temps slowly rise as well.,undervolting could help tame the temperature if you donâ€™t want to try to remount the cooler and apply like thermal grizzly kyronaut paste.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looks like a bad cooler mount to me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[removed],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>no oc.,stock with turboboost and adaptive boost.,"adaptive boost is intels auto overclock, so you do have oc if you have it on.","still, those temps are safe.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nothing to worry about.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">if it starts to hit 91,92 i would start to try to figure out whatâ€™s wrong.",this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"not by themselves, no.",but theyre encroaching upon dangerous temps.,so long as they dont get higher than 87-90 theres nothing to worry about.,if they cross over 90 then definitely time to reseat your cooler and give the whole case an airflow lookover,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how do you know?,what is the temp.when idle?,or when in bios upon boot?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[removed],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"youre fine insofar as the cooler mounting then, yes.",check voltages and/or try to manually set them towards the low end/undervolted side of things.,that can and probably will prevent the temps under load from getting into the 80s.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[removed],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lower the voltage for sure.,i'd be willing to bet your mobo is auto overvolting during load.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

holy shit have you been talking about a laptop this entire time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the cpu will almost never run at base clock.,what is the boost clock?,if it is around 3.9 or 4ghz then that's what it'll run at,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sorry where are you seeing it say your cpu is running at 3.9?,you said task manager is saying the speed is 2.8?,what mb you have?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh i'm sorry, task manager says the current frequency is 3.9ghz, but at the top it says ""intel i5-8400 @2.8ghz""
edit: what is mb?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">it says on the box and in task manager 2.8ghz, should i be worried?",what can i do to get it at its normal frequency again?,2.8ghz is the base frequency.,the cpu can turbo to 4.0ghz on a single core when needed.,"it will vary frequency and has some sort of all core turbo that it will hold under load as long as you're below temp, power and current limits.","your cpu is acting as designed, no need to mess with it.",[https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/126687/intel-core-i58400-processor-9m-cache-up-to-4-00-ghz/specifications.html](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/126687/intel-core-i58400-processor-9m-cache-up-to-4-00-ghz/specifications.html),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mb is mother board ðÿ˜š,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so this won't break the cpu or damage it, right?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks xd, i feel everyone is talking to me in disgust or something",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ask yourself, if the cpu is designed to turbo and vary frequency up to 4ghz by intel, why would that damage the cpu?",no you are not going to break a cpu that is running stock and as per spec.,it will last for many years running at full speed all day if you needed it to.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just make sure it doesnâ€™t get too hot and you have a good cooler on it.,there should be some oc software you had run.,probably a software either intel or the mb that you may have selected something to that boasted the speed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
computer language lol.,by the way oc in the last message mean overclocking if you were wondering.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
alright thanks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
uhd bluray support is not available on 11th gen as well.,if you have compatibility issues you can just deactivate the e-cores in the bios until they are sorted out.,the only reason to go for 11th gen is if you need avx512,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12 gen definitely.,11 series silicon and multicore performance is terrible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 12th gen is far superior in every single respect.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks for the replies guys, i made up my decision regarding the purchase.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a rocket lake cpu (11600k) and it works great and i have had no problems.,"also, z590 boards are significantly cheaper than even b660 let alone z690.","most importantly, i donâ€™t experience any bottlenecks (about 10% usage) in games when paired with a 3060 ti and 16 gb of ram and an asrock z590m pro4 motherboard",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no way to modify bios now to get avx512 working with 12th gen?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what did you decide on?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there are some boards that allow that on certain bios versions.,but i wonâ€™t count on it.,itâ€™s still an unsupported feature,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in early versions of bios you can turn avx on after turning e-cores off.,"overall 12th gen are good cpu, faster than previous ones.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i use avx 512 with my tuf d4 mobo on 12900k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is legit.,i just ordered my i7-12700k not long ago.,"if you read, this is the new logo they are going with, as well as the new qr serial.","as quoted from [here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005609/processors.html) (and also a picture of the new logo, you have to hit down on the boxes): ""starting q1 of year 2022, new intelâ® desktop processors will feature a second 2d matrix and the new intel trademark (intel trademark) on the top of the processor.","the second 2d matrix will have the same full serial number (atpo) as the first 2d matrix that is located on the outside edge of the processor.""",[here is a picture.,](https://imgur.com/wsea6xw),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"also, just run a benchmark on it and compare results.",or use cpu-z and see as what it's recognized,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the logo on the left top is different compared to those i see on reviews etc.,usually itâ€™s a circle but mine has this rectangle.,"now i am concerned, did they change it?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is the logo for the p cores and the e cores,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just check with the sn https://supporttickets.intel.com/warrantyinfo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hmm not sure on this one.,i also have a 12600k and didn't have that logo.,however i did buy it when it first came out so maybe they've changed it since then but not sure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s legit.,"iâ€™m working with engineering samples that have this logo and it confused me at first, but theyâ€™re most certainly from intel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is an intel program to check if it is a intel cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it seems different.,who did you buy it from on amazon?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that looks just like the packaging for my 12700k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its the new icon.,look a bit higher and you will see that new icon flipped!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's legit!!,!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just got mine what motherboard are you going to pair it with?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">the icon on the left is different

nice dude thats a really good cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for confirming!,i appreciate that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think op's idea is identifying if there's something wrong before opening the box.,"&nbsp;

that way it's easier to get a successful return as an unopened box rather than trying to justify a return that could be pushed back because of the box being opened.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looks in line with the new intel branding,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

do you really think that does not happen ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
amazon re-sells returned cpu's.,swapped out cpus are a fairly common problem because of that.,"scammers have gotten fairly advanced with their tactics too, they can swap the heatspreader or even laser on a new marking.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wouldn't be the first time for amazon to sell counterfeit or return scams as new.,"it's not done with malice, it's just how amazon system work.","everything that is the ""same"" product is stored together, so you could have 100 genuined cpu from intel, 10 from a shitty scammer, all mixed in the same shelves.","you buy genuine from intel on amazon, the dude in the warehouse grab a random product from that shelve, you could get a fake product if he grabs one of the fakes one.","it's rare on eletronics, way more commong with clothes/accessories like handbags etc",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am in the electronic components industry and sell intel chips every week.,i would not trust amazon right now and would not buy any chips from.,the rampant counterfeiting that goes on is insane and if it â€œworksâ€ and the user doesnâ€™t know what itâ€™s really supposed to do then the counterfeiters get away with it.,counterfeit= anything that a seller is providing as new and original but is not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, its just new intel logo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no problem brother!,i hope you enjoy it.,i sure am!,"i came from a ryzen 7 1700. big performance increase, and better temperatures.",i have plenty of room to overclock and don't even need to.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i will say i wasn't happy too happy with how amazon (or, the courier at least) shipped it.",they left it in my mailbox.,and the cpu was flopping around in the box.,â˜¹ï¸,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
amazon doesn't care.,the return policy is so lax that's one of the cause of common scams.,"people buy expensive eletronics stuff like a 12900k, return their intel celeron from 2004 and amazon will stil accept it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you!,i checked it and i seems legit!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is the website legit though?,can you check that?,ok in just joking,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that they were the center of the universe?,basically it was just a simplification of the â€œintel insideâ€ marketing logo which i would assume was done just like someone writing â€œintel insideâ€ on a box and circling it in marker.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

on their  website i doubt it is not legit",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that would make sense.,i just got an i7-11700k and the heat spreader had the old logo bit the sticker has the new one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's so rare it's unbelievable and to quest a box design?,"if you're this skeptical, why even buy off them in the first place?","i've bought 10850k, 10900k, 12700k, 12900k and so off amazon, i bought amd chips, i've spent thousands with them and i have never, ever, ever had an issue.",maybe it's different in the us but over in europe (at least for me) i've never had an issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"right, but they are listed on the amazon marketplace here in the eu.","like used: like-new, used: good, used: very-good.",it's illegal to relist a used item as new.,are you referring to the marketplace here or?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you had any experience with yourself?,i.e.,"you've bought a cpu, it's arrived and it's a scam cpu?",how did amazon treat you in regards to this and what not?,"is it a simple case of you report it to amazon, they arrange a replacement and that's that?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"fair enough then mate, i mean, i've never had any issues but i guess a lot of people have based on these comments.",i'll have to be more careful then i suppose!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
he asked if it was scam because the logos presented differently,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the good thing with amazon is returns are super easy though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i can confirm, i bought a processor from amazon that was listed as new.",got an open box one.,i know it was open box because the seal was broken and the processor was in the box backwards.,"it looked like the same one i ordered but i went ahead and returned it anyway because i didn't order an open box item and i'm unwilling to take the risk whoever opened the box damaged it, determined it was a bad bin, or swapped it for some sort of counterfeit.",amazon gave me zero pushback and shipped me a sealed box the second time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i am in europe.,i had 2 personal bad experience with amazon ordering intel cpu's.,one was missing chip from the box (i don't know why intel keeps putting the chip visible/reachable from outside the box).,the other was extremely damaged box that i had to return.,"yes, its note experience with fake cpus, but when you get people snatching the cpus from the box, it's not impossible to have others swapping the chip with another one (putting a fake or one with lower specs in place).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for me it happened with my ram.,"bougth a 4000mhz kit, received the correct box, which was open, and inside there was a 2333 mhz kit

disgusting that people do that.,"buy the item, return it under the guise of ""oh i didn't want it"" knowingly fuck over whoever buys the item again, pathetic.","makes me wonder, does anything to these people who do this?",surely there's a way to track it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the vrm's should be enough for anything up to a 12400. i guess it will work fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i need to correct you friend, the h610 chipset supports dual channel, intel passed wrong information on the slides which confused everyone a little, but yes it supports dual channel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no idea.,but people who buy a cpu with value in mind are also the kind of people that would and should buy a motherboard and ram with value in mind so shouldn't be an issue.,op shouldn't be some dumbass that buys ram that costs close to the same price as their cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is likely an issue with hps embedded controller.,unfortunately there isn't much that can be done to circumvent it.,if you have intels dynamic thermal and power framework drivers installed then you could try disabling the device associated with it in device manager to see if it'll release the power limits from the ec.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
anytime the power limits are changed the new values can be made permanent until next reboot.,it's a bit in the settings register.,if the bios wants to it can flip that bit during boost up and the cpu will ignore all subsequent changes to the power limits.,this is pretty common on laptops where the cooling is only designed for a certain max power level.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

okay there's a lot going on here.,> right now i have msi pro b365m pro-vdh lga 1151 ddr4-2666.,"and i have a i9 9900k

b365 is an entry level locked chipset motherboard, while you have a top of the line unlocked cpu.",right off the bat you're shooting yourself in the foot with an inadequate motherboard.,"if you can get your hands on a z390 board you will very likely see performance increases due to better power delivery and higher boost, even before you consider overclocking.","you have a d15 so you should be taking advantage of a conservative overclock, or at the very least mce.",> i want to upgrade my almost 5 year old 16gb ram i had in my old prebuilt but my current motherboard only supports 2666 ram speed and i heard i need more than that to go to 32gb of ram.,"b365 does only support up to 2666. that's not a huge deal, something like 3200 or 3600 would be better, but the difference isn't huge.",your memory speed has nothing to do with the memory capacity.,if you need 32gb of ram (do you actually?),"you can add more 2666mhz memory, or you can replace it entirely if you get a new motherboard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at this point just hold off the mobo and cpu.,get 13th gen altogether,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"okay so i for sure need a new motherboard, i figured that.",ill try to find a z390.,any specific you recommend or just any will do?,unfortunately when i upgraded my prebuilt i didnt know much about this stuff and went for an i9 and cheaped out on the motherboard bc i didnt think it mattered.,and i probably dont need the 32gb i just thought if im gonna upgrade it id go all out for it.,but if i end up spending too much on the motherboard ill just wait on the ram for a little while.,you think maybe i should just try for the motherboard and hold onto this ram until i can upgrade later?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you have a 2x8 kit of memory right now, it would be super easy to add another 2x8 kit for 4x8gb.","ideally the second kit would be identical (brand, speed, latency), but that might be difficult with 2666.

i don't have any particular recommendations for the motherboard.",with an older end of life platform like z390 i would say just get anything you can find for a reasonable price.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the thing is this ram is some shitty green ram from a really old alienware prebuilt i had and its super old so i figure ill keep it around for a little longer and just get all new later on.,but ill look for a good priced z390 to upgrade.,im pretty sure my case can fit a full atx board.,another reason i got the motherboard i have now is because i thought i could only fit a micro atx and i dont think thats the case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and also as im looking for the z390 it seems all the ones that overclock to higher than 2666 are $200+.,you think this one will be good for what im looking for?,[link](https://www.newegg.com/p/n82e16813144216?item=9sib5ccgzv2164&source=socialshare&cm_mmc=snc-social-_-sr-_-9sib5ccgzv2164-_-02252022),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah most new in box z390 boards seem to start around $200.,you might consider going with something used.,"all brand name z boards should support memory ""oc"", which is what intel considers anything over 2666. that just means you need to use xmp, which they should all do no problem.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it will work yes.,"the vrm on that board is pretty wimpy, which isn't ideal for a power hungry 9900k, but if you don't plan on overclocking it should be ok. i would personally try and find a bit better one like the msi mpg pro or asus strix e in the similar items section.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

intel doing it too does not change my opinion about it being misleading/confusing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
more around 70% ... the 8e cores add about 50% more performance on the base 8p cores scores.,"so if you substract that performance from the 12900k, its around 70% performance off the total.",technically those 8e cores have the performance of a ryzen (zen1) 1700.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they do more if you take the power limit into consideration.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"doesn't matter, a core is a core, regardless of performance.","if the bulldozer's ""cores"" were sold as real cores, then the gracemont cores have the right to be called cores as well.","bulldozer was a pile of crap, yet amd advertised it as 6-8 core chip, despite lacking in everything bar mt performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"mobile chipsets has 1+3+4,4+4,2+6 & 0+8.",they called them 8 cores,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how does e cores compare to say a core 2 duo?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh wow i did not know that those e cores were so powerful.,thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh yeah.. i did not take that into consideration.,my bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
amd settled a class action over this.,"that said, at least as far as i know, intel is much more legitimate in calling an e-core a full core compared to amd calling a bulldozer core a full core.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sure there are 16 cores, but this is not what i am complaining about.",i am not saying that what intel does is illegal.,"i am just saying that this is confusing as a consumer, i do not see how you could argue against that.","it would be like selling a house without mentioning its area, or in very little at the end of the ad.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which is even worse,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol ... that is way too old cpu to compare with.,"think of it more as a ryzen 1700, as the performance seem to overlap.","if a e core is 1000, then a p core is 2300 based upon my calculations.",processors have evolved a lot when amd started pushed intel in 2017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"> i agree, regarding the house analogy i'd say a better example is counting a 1/2 bathroom as a full bathroom.","1 + 1/2 should not equal 2 bathrooms, same with cores.","the analogy can't really be used, a half bathroom is missing things that wouldn't make it comparable to a full bathroom whereas an ""efficient"" core isn't missing anything that would no longer make it a full core, it's just slower.","i'd say better analogy would be comparing cores to vehicles, let's say ""performance"" cores are comparable to a sports car whereas ""efficient"" cores are comparable to something like an ""economy"" car with a small engine that's good on gas, are both going to get you where you're going?","yes, however the spots car will get you there much faster, however it will be burning more gas.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i can't even imagine how something like that happened, my guess is that the cpu was falsely named as something else and the ""bore"" typo instead of ""core"" was a mistake when they renamed it.","the reason the driver won't install properly is because it's some completely different product to what the name claims to be, thus installing something incompatible.",i'd recommend downloading cpu-z and posting a screenshot of what the program identifies the cpu to actually be.,that'd help figure out what driver you really need.,[https://www.cpuid.com/downloads/cpu-z/cpu-z\_1.79-en.exe?utm\_mediu](https://www.cpuid.com/downloads/cpu-z/cpu-z_1.79-en.exe?utm_mediu),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not sure what you guys are on about.,"p4's were dogs, and their netburst architecture put out more heat and used more power than any prior generation.","p3's ran at [43 watt max,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_cpu_power_dissipation_figures#pentium_iii) for comparison.",p4's turned out to be such inefficient shit that intel [had to bail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/netburst_\(microarchitecture\)#successor) on that design and instead evolved older pentium architectures to become the next generation.,edit:added links,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the problem with the williamette was:

- it performed worse than the high end pentium 3 cpus.","that performance regression was a huge deal in the early 2000's because that was back when new cpu/gpu generations easily had double digit performance gains, and even within the same generation, you would see a cpu arch being clocked at 33 mhz at launch, and end up being clocked at +100 mhz by the time a new cpu arch is introduced.","- it was tied to the expensive rdram, and that caused the price to be high enough where someone could buy two pentium 3 systems or a single williamette system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looks like it.,(2001),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
indeed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
got one too- now it sits in the garage lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
100% agree on rdram being a boat anchor for the launch of p4.,intel really failed there.,at launch williamette performed a little worse than the highest end pentium 3 cpus on integer code but when it fully ramped on 180nm - the 2.0 ghz was significantly faster than the fastest 180nm pentium 3 - 1.13 ghz.,for fpu and sse code though the p4 was much faster as the fpu essentially performed like a p3 but at higher clock speeds.,intel should probably have waited until yields allowed a launch at 1.7 ghz initially..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i don't have i7, but i got the same issue time to time with an amd 4700u cpu w/o dedicate graphic card.",it looks like a software bug to me.,i ran the game in 720p and medium graphic quality.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i also play it on my iris xe.,sometimes horse turns invisble.,however what's worry me the most is the artifacts.,like green and purple flashing.,i think they happen the most when there are lightning effects or rain.,you noticed them?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what issues are you experiencing?,list them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in the linux community we use the open source amd drivers which are built into the kernel.,they are excellent and much better than the official drivers.,amd could save costs and give users a better experience just by open sourcing their windows driver under a permissible license and then letting the community take over.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"linux drivers do this, and games seem to run fine.","there are a few edge cases though, where the engines were ""sponsored by nvidia"" aka nvidia engineers provided some wacked shader or tesselation code that only ran well on pascal.",the closed amd driver shortcuts those shaders through a simpler pipeline for performance reasons.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"games do stick to standards like directx, but they're written by game developers and not hardware engineers with an intimate understanding of how each gpu works.",optimized drivers actually include alternative compiler settings or even optimized gpu assembly routines to squeeze more performance out of the same hardware.,"obviously hardware companies don't have to put the effort into optimizing games to run on their hardware, but it's really nice that they do or we'd have slower games.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

>intel and amd release documentation to the open source driver teams.,amd/intel are pretty good about this (although everyone has trade secrets) but nvidia is secretive as hell.,much of what we know about how to optimize for their gpus comes from reverse engineering.,entire scientific papers have been written on teasing out what their hardware is really doing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if you want a recommendation i recommend the arctic freezer 2 series.,any size is good.,i have a oced i5 12600kf and in games it so8get hotter than 47 and under full load pulling 180 watts in cinabench with the oc it doesn't pass 70. it is really quiet and just overall a great option.,best part is that it is fucking cheap considering the rest of the aios.,like a few dollars over a nhd15.,i was going to get a nhd15 but saw it was like 10 dollars more but that there was a big difference so i went for it.,i went for the 360 mm but the 240 and 280 are also really good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"imho go for the i7-12700kf

oc's to 5.0ghz on air or 5.1ghz water cooled, it has single core performance similar to the i9-12900k and multi-core performance that's 10% better than stock i7-12700k (which is already 10% better than i7-12700 non k models) - you're looking at a completely different class of chip with the i7-12700kf vs non k

the i5-12600k is a also great chip and can be overclocked past the i7-12700 non k 

i'm biased because i own the i7-12700kf, and i've always bought a new high end intel cpu every 2 years (i7-6700, i7-8700, i9-9900, and finally i7-12700kf) and the performance i got out of the non-k models was good but not quite good enough.",resale values on the k models is also better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

do you want to oc or not.,that answer will rule out 1 option.,i bought that one cos i donâ€™t want to oc and performance is pretty close to the k version anyway according to reviews.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"look, the best value here is the 12700f no discussion.","but things you have to keep in kind: 1) the f means that it has no integrated graphics, you'll need a discrete gpu; 2) the k means that it is capable of oc; 3) only 670 and 690 motherboards can do intel's oc; 4) certain 660 motherboards can do an ""unsupported"" oc, but you need to search if the motherboard that you have can do it, search for non-k oc and there you'll find what motherboards can do.","but as the name suggests you can also do it with non-k cpus, so the 12700f is still ocable, though it could be that it is of ""improper"" silicon and it will not have the same oc heights of a k model.","however oc while is technically free performance, it is not as much as it used to be and it produces a lot of heat.",as of nowadays you can live without it.,in summary: go for the 12700f kts the best option.,if you really wanna oc search for non-k oc and buy the correct 660 motherboard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the newer generations (around 9th gen or so) are a much different beast compared to skylake and whatever came before it.,practical everyday overclocking is on its last legs if not already dead; boosting algorithms have gotten to the point where they will get you 90%-95% of the way of what you would by manual overclocking as long as you cooling is good enough.,"as long as op doesn't cheap out on the motherboard or cooling, the 12700f will be essentially just as good as the 12700k(f).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

at the very least the 12700 because premiere pro can use the igpu of intel chips to accelerate rendering.,"however, non-k chips do not have unlimited boost windows.","so, getting a k-series chip would remove those limited boost windows and allow you to get the full performance of your chip 24/7, if cooling provides, of course.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh.,thought ocing the 12th gen parts isnt as beneficial as it used to be.,you'll get max 200 mhz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i just read it somewhere also not sure if it does help, i mean its an extra gpu might as well use it right beside being a backup gpu in case dedicated gpu gets faulty..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh goodness yes.,and i have even found that most modern motherboards will do pxe boot (booting over network) even if that was not the primary use (usually that is a server motherboard feature).,i just did this with an old 4770kf and the msi gaming motherboard that i replaced when upgrading to 12th gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"just a small correction, the msi pro z690-a, tomahawk, and edge all have teamed power phases.","so their phase count is 7, 8, and 8, but the amount of power stages is 14, 16, and 16.

here's what i would do to keep with your theme.,"i want to change out the cpu cooler because you can get a comparable cooler for $120-150 less, but clearly you want the aesthetics.",[https://pcpartpicker.com/list/xlzw9r](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/xlzw9r),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this looks great bro i appreciate it, i wouldnâ€™t mind changing the cpu coolor, i just wanted a cooler with the ability to change the lcd display and play little gifs or stuff yk, is there a cheaper alt ?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
corsair icue h100i would work and fits your style.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you already have z590 motherboard.,i5 or i7 11th gen cpu should be good.,just a suggestion if you can sale the z590 motherboard at a good price then use that money to buy z690 and grab 12600k.,"with z690, you will have the option to get 13th gen cpu down the line.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, definitely the 12th gen i5 and i7 have 25-30% more performance than the 11th gen counterparts.","though i would search for a 660 motherboard, seems like you're not interested in oc and for gaming those are usually more than enough.",but try to make it a good 660.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you already have the mobo then dont get the 12 gen, you should buy a better 11 gen tho",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"like others said, go for the 11th gen as you already got the board, the 12th gen won't make much sense at all.",the 11600k is enough for gaming but you can get those 2 extra sweet cores with the 11700/900k then do so.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
doesnâ€™t sell well.,due to the new egg shuffle bundling the board with everything.,the market is flooded with this board.,i am active on r/hardwareswap and listed it for 225 shipped and no one wanted it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah?,what should i get?,i donâ€™t follow intel like i do with amd.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

whats ur budget?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah no point on selling it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well i was ready to buy a 11900k for 450. but the 11600k looks better for the price to performance.,not looking to oc tho.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 11900k is literally a slightly better binned 11700k.,the difference is 0.2 ghz stock and overclocked.,nothing else of significance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what will u use the pc for?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11th gen is supposed to be really interesting to overclock!,try it out!,11900k will have the most features and be the most interesting.,but 11700k is just as good.,so is the 11600k.,check out this article by splave.,splave is regularly top overclocker on hwbot.,"https://www.tomshardware.com/features/core-i9-11900k-overclocking-record

here is his take on 11 gen!",tldr he loves it!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
99% for gaming.,which will be the most intensive thing the pc will do,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then yea go ahead,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
should i go for the 11700?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think that if you are up for it you should spend the 100$ more and get the 11900k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
only hk can do that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can lower pl2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can most likely undervolt it with throttlestop,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
according to customers that have bought 12700h and 12900h laptops you can't undervolt them anymore.,intel themselves said during the q&a that you can only undervolt the expensive af hk model now.,market segmentation at it's finest.,honestly intel has been doing great to be more open and putting out good products and then they go and do something very anti consumer like this.,it's a shit move from intel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can we flash it to a 12900hk or unlock it somehow?,it's not like many consumers buying a laptop these days are have the choice or are equipped with the knowledge to whether they are buying a 12900h or 12900hk.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
k allows for higher than factory frequencies.,"to lower it sub-factory doesn't, requires the right mb though.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nope.,most cpus on laptops can do that unless the manufacturer locks them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i want to undervolt so it boosts higher for longer also heat management on every day is considerably better when you can undervolt .100 to .125,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is locked with thorttlestop or intel xtu.,the bios doesn't have the option.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so... is there anything we can do if software like throttlestop and xtu won't work?,"my max temps hit 92c, i came here hoping to find some sort of work-around?","well, besides a cooling pad that hits 12,000 rpm and stuff like that :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're joking.,"if you aren't equipped with the knowledge of knowing whether to buy the hk or h, you definitely shouldn't be thinking of even tweaking any processor related processes.","and no, you cannot just flash it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm by no means an expert, but you can't flash something that can't be flashed.","for example, a gpu has its own (v)bios that you can flash to obtain a higher power limit.",like flashing an rtx 3070 130w laptop card to an rtx 3070 140w tgp.,"cpus don't have any sort of ""bios"" or other related feature, hence you can't flash a cpu (turn an i7 11800h into an i9 11980hk).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"lower frequency with stock v/f curve is allowed, but k is required for voltage tinkering for this generation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"unfortunately no, there is no work around.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm not joking.,a consumer is not equipped with all the knowledge he will ever poses at the moment they make a purchase.,"additionally, there was a short time ago that letter difference didn't matter and god forbid they not follow intel press releases or your reddit posts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
absolutely agree.,but hardware and software limitations are a thing with cpus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i know that, i'm talking about what you said specifically",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
go read how processors work buddy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"right, but (correct me if wrong) i don't see how you can completely adjust the ""software"" aspect of the cpu, if there is such a thing, without using laptop or motherboard bios to enable / disable certain functions.","if a system bios doesn't allow for it, you can't do anything to the cpu.",just the cpu by itself has no software.,"on my prior lenovo legion, you needed to modify / unlock the system bios in order to gain access to undervolting the cpu.","hardware limitations, if i understand you correctly, would be an inability to turn a 6 core cpu into an 8 core cpu, which obviously can't be done / can't magically create cores.","similarly, you can't change the architecture / power regulation of a an ""h"" cpu and turn it into an ""hk"" cpu.","undervolting / overvolting isn't done on the hardware level (unless you shunt mod, which i don't even know if possible on a cpu)?","the system bios has to recognize the ""unlocked"" hk series cpu and enable the voltage adjustment features.",that's what i meant re: no real independent software component to cpus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and i'm talking about what you said specifically.,perhaps you could contribute to this conversation by explaining for us how the hardware difference prevents voltage adjustments?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm not your buddy pal.,and i've been under volting processors for likely your entire life.,still waiting on your valued input to the topic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are on the right page.,updating bios can and historically has provided added functionality to cpus.,flashing bios in this case being the changeable firmware.,"again, not to argue a point, can you or someone show me the hardware difference in these two models at the hardware level?","my follow up question would be, if this cpu received a different voltage how would it respond?",unless we are assuming not being a hk model the voltage is always the same.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you get an h model hoping to ""flash"" it to the hk, i wouldn't be trying to get into an argument especially when you don't even know what you're talking about.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
keep waiting.,not wasting my time on something you wouldn't even understand,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's an engineering question, i think?",aside from comparing each cpu on intel's site.,"an engineer i am not, ha.","it would also depend on the allowable tdp intel sets for the cpus, which is hardware, but again, motherboards read the info and can limit or push as far as they want.","(example, when under full cpu+gpu load lenovo limits power sent to the cpu, whereas msi lets the cpu unleash its max performance with more supplied power).",same idea behind some laptops limiting the 11800h to 65w while others set to 90w.,it's software making that determination despite the cpus being identical hardware-wise.,"to answer your specific question, i cannot tell you the physical hardware differences between the 11800h and 11980hk, at face value (layman terms) they both look identical aside from differing tdp and voltage config.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what you are insinuating is there is no future bios changes that will grant the ability to do so.,i'm just interested in the basis of your knowledge to make that sort of conjecture.,i think you are full of shit and just regurgitating the initial answer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"weird i thought this forum and topic were to help each other learn, not try to get the last word in.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok we are getting somewhere.,"so if a motherboard bios allowed for a lower voltage, would it boot?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel locked the msr on 12th gen and claims that due to efficiency gains there's no need to undervolt.,"however, the k variants still have this ability due to the unlocked multiplier, the msr must be accessible.",i've never heard of flashing microcode for one cpu to a different cpu.,i don't think this is like vbios for gpus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes it will boot, depending on silicon lottery.",if you lower voltage too much you'll get bsod or freezes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
heya :) did you ever find a solution?,"i have the 12900h, 92c max temps",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
never purchased one here to try.,best of luck to you though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
x299 is weak because it has basically been abandoned.,"it came out in 2017, and hasnâ€™t seen new cpus added since 2019.

all rumours of replacement platforms have been vapourware.","the z399/x599 replacements were shown off in 2018, but vanished.",the rumoured 10990xe â€œlast gaspâ€ in 2020 never happened.,"thereâ€™s nothing definite on the roadmap either, which means if there will be a replacement, itâ€™s not happening anytime soon, so donâ€™t hold your breath.","hey, iâ€™ve always been a hedt guy too, for as long as it existed.","but iâ€™ve moved on to 12th gen z690, and besides feeling cramped in terms of expansion options due to limited lanes, itâ€™s a worthy replacement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
both x299 and trx40 run basically on last last generation architectures.,both havenâ€™t been updated for a while.,unless you need pcie lanes you are better off going for higher end mainstream chips.,5950x or 12900k/s,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hedt is where intel sells excess xeon dies.,"they're currently struggling to meet demand for 10nm xeons, and that is unlikely to change until well after sapphire rapids launches.","haven't seen any leaks, but hard to imagine a new hedt launch before late fall.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sapphire rapids might be a good candidate for a future intel hedt platform, but so far itâ€™s reserved for xeon (although itâ€™s certainly possible that an enthusiast platform might appear)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think i am going trx40 this time.,"the z690 platform is awesome with the hybrid cpu and stuff, just not exactly what i need.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wait, hedt and xeon are different?",i thought xeons ran on x299?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but there is nothing on the books yet?,x299 seems kinda weak when you compare it to what amd has on the table currently.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
trx40 also doesnt look like it will have anything other than zen 2. hedt is dead until further notice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, they're different.",the current xeon chipset is the c621.,x299 is only for hedt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> x299 seems kinda weak when you compare it to what amd has on the table currently.,x299 is weak compared to z690.,the 10980xe doesn't compare favourably to the 12900k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how long until trx40 is absolute?,"the only thing i donâ€™t like is that it doesnâ€™t have ddr5 support, anything else is still legit on trx40 i think.",i know a guy who bought a titan rtx and now i think he gets beaten by a 3080 or 3090 in performance.,"so i donâ€™t want to invest allot in a platform that might be blown away by the next platform, it will lose all it re sell value too if that happens",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

can you point me in the direction of what would be neccessary to ensure quality and longevity?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
noctua d15 or 15s with 2 fans.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for the 12900k you really need a noctua nh-d15.,"if you donâ€™t have room for it or if youâ€™re going for a 12700k you could try the nh-d15s or the nh-u12a, but they donâ€™t perform as well under extreme load.","even the mighty d15 cannot typically cool the 12900k under maximum stress test load, but with proper pasting and case cooling it does handle cinebench r23 and any real-world workload or gaming you throw at it.",especially if you mix in a little undervolting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have no intention to oc/undervolt/do anything besides turn my pc on and off.,what do you recommend for case cooling?,again i just want maintenance free longevity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as many fans as it will hold is usually a good goal.,if you can plug them into motherboard headers then they can be kept quiet until needed.,"iâ€™m running a fractal define r5 which is a older solid front quiet case with low airflow, but iâ€™ve got 3 x noctua nf-a14 and 2 x noctua nf-a12x25 to maximize what airflow it has.",never had a noctua fan fail before.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nice, if i'm loading the thing with fans i wouldnt mind paying more for them to be quiet.","so my pc now, the panel just isnt even on.","it's kind of sloppy looking but i've never had any issues with it, let alone temp issues, and it's been going strong since like 2016. if i just have the tower open would that help cool a 12700?","barring a ridiculous deal on a 12900, it's likely going to be a 12700, couldnt be happier with the 6700 and want nothing less than an i7",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"itâ€™s weird, but i donâ€™t necessarily find that open towers cool all that well.","i built and stressed tested my 12900k system open, and i was kind of dreading closing it up (especially in such a closed off case) and seeing how much hotter things got.","but oddly enough, the temperatures didnâ€™t get worse, if anything they got a few degrees better - likely due to the airflow actually getting to work, sucking in cool air from the front and bottom, and expelling it out the back.","indeed i can definitely feel more of a concentration of heat coming from the rear exhaust now when itâ€™s working than before, where it just kind of generally dispersed.","oh, and you will pay for noctua fans!",man do they make you pay.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that looks like improper contact between the ihs and the block.,are they flat?,concave?,convex?,flat on flat should progide the best contact.,with concave on concave being the worst.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the water block has been lapped so that's pretty flat.,the cpu on the other hand has a little bit of a hump out in the middle i forgot if that's convex or concave.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
concave.,"lapping the block might made things worse, as, say, if the block was convex, it would have made a snugger fit in the concave ihs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it has similar shaping to a 12700k that i had before the 12900k and the differences in core temperatures on that one was only three to eight degrees not 20.

"til people still play metin 2.

this is going to sound weird but try replacing you thermal paste and making sure your power supply unit is tightly plugged into the motherboard.,i had this same issue and it fixed it for me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"that might not be your processor , it could be a gpu glitch",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes using the stock cooler and with a limited power draw so the cpu doesnot exceed the 2.6 ghz base clock and the cpu thermals doesnot exceed the 50s,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what's your cpu utilization at when you run multiple copies?,and how many do you run?,does this only happen if you  have more than 6 or 12 open?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it happens regardless of the number of tabs also regradless of the usage , it may occur when i open 6 tabs and some times when i am opening 2 tabs ,but i noticed that it occurs when i reach a certain part of the game though the past 2 days i was entering that exact same part of the game with no issues while opening 8 tabs no problem",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as far all i know this is a game related software issue as it was not designed to run multiple instances simultaneously.,what might help to prevent stuff like this from occurring too often is to reduce background processes in windows and to avoid areas with too many mobs / other players -> use almost empty channels if possible.,also switching between tabs of the game too fast is also not good.,"giving the cpu more power will not significantly improve the situation, but upgrading the stock cooler and unlocking the power limit is always a nice quality of life thing to do if you can afford it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the nh-d15 alone should be sufficient to generate the airflow you need in pretty much any case imo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you run the 12700k without thermal limit (pl1, pl2) it can easily go over 200w

a 5700g should be a good second option.,i have a 12700k and it's a beast but it's not exactly the coolest thing around.,"i reccomend be quiet cases for music production, and their silent wings, or noctua fans",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you.,"i was reading up on cases and kept seeing people say that getting a case with a mesh front and lowering the fans was the best way to go and that a closed case may be too warm, but those are always regarding builds with a dgpu and wasn't sure if that was relevant in my case.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"deff not doing anything like that, i just didn't know if a closed case would be hot if i ran at a reasonable power limit and not using a graphics card.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"does your case have an intake fan at all, and a way for air to get out?","you'll be 100% ok. even some of the worst airflow cases do fine, like nzxt's default ""1 exit fan only"" config.",it only has to yeet the hot air.,"100% of the ""trick"" to case cooling is merely keeping the internal air ambient temp low for the heat sink fins, then evacuating the hot air.","and it takes a surprisingly minimal amount of airflow to accomplish that, than general ""pcmr wisdom"" would have you thinking.","my 200w 10850k is kept under 80c by a d15s with the case fans operating at 500rpm only, and the d15s fan operating at 900rpm.",but the d15s fan points directly at an exhaust fan so all that heat dumps out of the case immediately.,extreme airflow cases are for adding 300-400w gpu heat on top of 200w cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"well, first off noise is subjective and varies person to person.","there are a lot of factors when it comes to fan design if there is any obstructions, your planned air flow, how it interacts with the case and other case fan (if at all competing against another fan/placement), the application you are choosing (ie: simple intake no obstruction, or exhaust no obstruction... is there a radiator, filters, mesh, etc...)

usually, a lot of noctua fans (pun not intended) would recommend staying on the safe side and jumping on the nf-a12x25 (reg or chromax) because they are a well rounded fan to be able to use in either situation of a radiator or case (intake/exhaust).","some people like to mix and match s12a and f12 or f12+a12...

double check your mounting.,9900k runs really hot.,you can also try undervolting a little bit and disable multi core enhancement.,set the default pl1 and pl2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"update: went into bios and set the tune to ""normal"" and went into xtu and set the profile to ""default"" - seems to be better based on xtu testing but will have to check within game.",appreciate all the responses and help - great community.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can you check the power consumption and vcore reading with hwinfo64 while gaming?,100c while gaming if you've ruled out mounting pressure problems/paste replacement/functional aio doesn't sound right.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
make sure the pump on your aio is running.,some of them require software to run the pump.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ordered list of what i would check.,* go into the bios and make sure there is no auto overclocking being done by your motherboard.,i had an asus board when i ran a 9900k.,i used to have a maximus formula with mine and the auto-tune was super aggressive.,i would thermal throttle just playing csgo.,* try a new cooler.,i've seen a lot of aio's fail lately.,i dont know if there was a bad batch but in the last 6 months i've personally cut open 4 that had chunks of stuff plugging up the block and rad.,* make sure to get the cooler on tight enough.,"don't overdo it, but a nice hand-tight usually is enough.",i go hand tight and maybe another quarter turn.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

aio is on and functioning, sticker off.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cringiest comment ive ever seen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1. if you have a brand new aio that will minimize the chance of aio failure.,"but still need a double check, mounting pressure, thermal paste contact... everything.","and... sound like stupid but don't forget to peel ðÿ˜€
2. mce on asus motherboard only remove the power limit.",i don't know what it does on another brand.,"you are already in thermal throtlling so you need to disable it, i.e cap your power consumption and maybe sacrifice a bit of turbo boost clock to see if things can be improved.","also, i forgot to mention a thing but i've seen in some comments below, try turning off all kind of auto/ai overclock features.",they usually tend to over volt your cpu.,3. you can look up on intel ark.,i personnally set pl1 = 95w and pl2=131w.,because the vrm on my mobo can't handle too much current so i have to undervolt it and set all core boost @4.2ghz.,i got 5% loss at cbr 23 score but it holds up pretty nice inside a laptop chassis.,in your case you can try a little bit higher for pl2 like 165w (max power consumption according to some benchmarks),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"do you hear it running, if you put your ear to it?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah it's brand new arctic freezer ii 240. it is weird because it doesn't have an aio pump cable separate from the cpu fan, it's all ran into 1. but my mobo is reading it functioning at 100%

my mobo is a tuf z390-plus, i'll make sure it isn't being oc'd by the mobo in the bios.","&#x200b;

have you updated the bios yet by any chance?,if not try that first.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
large rtl delta can be an issue.,typically delta is 2 or less.,try setting them manually to be closer (f.x.,"set the 79 to 75), assuming you have msi's rtl training on (i think it autos to being on).",if you happened to turn that off then can try jsut turning it back on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's either down to bloatware or what you're comparing to has simply just better timings or maybe even a different cpu?,things to point out tcke 8?,**(understandable if you left that due to ppd being disabled same with txp)** also twtrs/twtrl left on default?,maximum ring clock?,attempted any rtl/iol modifications?,"&#x200b;

and of course have you verified stability on these values?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah updated to latest,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm not at my computer right now so can't check but i've just changed all that the ddr4 memory overclocking guide on git hub has suggested.,if its not suggested in there i haven't changed the setting.,maybe there is difference in latency across the different alder lake cpus.,i cant see how it would be bloatwarw as its a fresh clean install of windows.,im guessing it's down to rtl/iol training which is new to me.,in my msi motherboard bios there is no way to change these values so they have to be trained by rhe board.,will have a go tonight training them.,and i tested this overnight and seems stable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"looking at my settings now, twtrs/twtrl are on default, tcke is default.",haven't changed ring ratio.,"don't think i can change rtl/iol, at least when i change the values nothing seems to happen",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"try 2 sticks first, using all 4 slots usually introduces instability in ram oc",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"makes sense why your latency is higher then, disable ppd then configure twtrs/twtrl, also what board are you on?","&#x200b;

almost forgot oc your ring last, bear in mind it will most likely make your cpu oc unstable unless you put more voltage in than needed",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
doesn't it depend on the topology?,i've read that with t-topology 4 sticks actually give better results.,"assuming the cpu memory controller can handle it in the first place, but afaik it can cause problems only with more than 2 ranks per channel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm on msi z690 mag tomahawk ddr4 wifi.,shall i keep lowering till unstable for twrts/twtrl?,ppd set to 0 as it only allows numerical values,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just try it and rule it out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i just disable power down mode as a whole which disables ppd but either wat works, and change iol comp to 21 and then check the values.",personally i have mines at 26 so i'd keep adjusting until you can't boot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm on the same exact board and would kill for assistance, it's like every boot it trains new settings smh",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
these are single rank sticks so won't using only 2 dimms in single rank each ruin performance and fps in games like warzone and battlefield 2042?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

drivers are pure software that is able to talk to hardware.,"if you remove sata drivers, your os won't be able to accsess sata drives, resulting in an os crash (i never tried it)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to add to this if you uninstall your gpu drivers your pc will default to a windows graphics driver.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which is still a driver.,"if windows wasnt smart enough to use those drivers, it would lose access to the gpu and wouldn't provide display out",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well yeah but that's not something that should be allowed to happen.,it makes sense to have a safety mechanism in place.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah.,but op's question stated what if drivers were removed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and all i did was add to the original answer that the removal of some drivers is totally fine, not all of them will cause crashes.",i only mentioned it because it was something that the comment i responded to did not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it depends.,did u got it at a good discount?,"now all the stores are clearing inventories of the 11th gen, you could find amazing deals.",12th gen is supposed to come maybe more expensive than 11th gen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
usually the price of the older model goes down when the newer model is released.,"if you got your thinkpad for a discount, i would just keep it.",the rating is the rating that it got from whatever reviews that you looked at.,most devices don't change much year over year.,we don't see substantial jumps or leaps in performance like 2x battery life unless there is an error.,"or

in the case of the apple laptops jumping from x86 intel chips to arm64 apple chips, that was a 2 node jump along with a completely different architecture along with refresh apple arm based chip.",so we saw substantial jump in performance.,but!,"windows 11, intel thread director, and alderlake big.little may see an improvement?",who knows?,you can wait for the reviews or wait until msft & intel and the vendors figure out how best to pair these new things.,maybe there is a benefit others say there is no benefit to this big.little noise.,all i know is msft is a big company and they are backing this technology.,it must be important as we were originally going to stay on win10.,but now there is a win11.,either way.,i would keep your device if it was at a discount and wait a bit.,raptorlake may show improvements.,time will tell!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'd return it.,"as far as i see it last gen (11th gen) intel is dead, here comes 14+core p+e cores that actually make sense.",it will probably turn into 16 cores soon as standard for i7 and i9 by 13th or 14th gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's probably worth it for the additional cores.,"4 is not future proof enough, even if many programs are still single core performance dependent",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which is insane since its just a refresh compared to alder lake generational jump.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nope 12700h still beat every rembrandt laptop in cpu perf.,but remdbrandt is much more efficient and strong igpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s ryzen 9 compared with i7 not i9.,yet the i7 beats the ryzen 9 in both efficiency and performance.,also the 6000 series ryzen 9 is released after the 12th gen i7.,yet it canâ€™t beat it.,that is embarrassing given the recent amd hype.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the igpu comment is partially true.",the ryzen 5 only comes with 6cus.,the ryzen 9 has better igpu but most laptops with this chip will equip with a dgpu anyway.,so the igpu wonâ€™t be used at all.,the better igpu shoild have been on the ryzen 5 which often donâ€™t come with dgpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

because amd priced every weaker cpu $50 dollars higher than the equivalent intel cpu.,i've done 5 builds for friends and family and its all intel.,amd is too greedy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

amd is not necessarily too\* greedy.,but it is market forces driving up tsmc's costs.,"despite record investments into tsmc, tsmc cannot just spend share holder money willy nilly on 100 billion dollar fabs and not expect a return.",they had to increase prices.,and 5nm and beyond only more and more expensive.,hence why down to three major companies able to produce at leading edge.,i just wanted to add that in.,you cannot say an amd is too greedy or an intel is too greedy.,"intel fell behind same as how nokia, msft, htc, motorola, blackberry could not predict the mobile phone explosion extravaganza... not because of greed.",but because they just failed against their competition.,competition is very very fierce in the mobile phone space.,look at what the us did to huawei.,its freaking fierce.,5g fierce.,similarly amd is not greedy in that they have to pay for leading edge foundry services.,that is the name of the game.,pay to play.,apple arm64 switch from x86 is another another issue.,what that mean in the future is that all future macs would be arm64 based.,and they could potentially completely cut off all older intel x86 based macs.,if you want a mac you must buy all new apple silicon.,so they need the capacity to make this happen.,nvidia has no foundry and only does gpus.,they have the market share and command big bucks to be able to purchase the best nodes.,"for amd to match nvidia in the gpu space without software ai help, they must go best process node technology.",and that costs dollars.,cold hard cash.,tsmc is just a foundry player.,that is their entire game.,they must raise capital to keep playing this game.,and right now all the major players are coming to tsmc's door.,"(intel, amd, nvidia, apple 2.7t, msft 2.1t, qualcomm,  many others) they have limited supply.",who do they give the supply to?,it is obvious.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think it's a good move by amd.,they know that they lost enthusiast market and will have to lower the prices substantially to retain market share.,and they know that server market is right now the best place to sell products.,and they also know that they have the opportunity until sapphire rapids comes out and they want to utilise that opportunity.,once sapphire rapids comes amd will have to lower prices and try to compete in every market possible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"not necessarily, you don't expand your facility only to end up having to charge more for your product, increase capacity should mean lower cost on their end, it's more about inflation and tsmc seeing the opportunity to make money (because, well, there's more demand than their supply capacity)

same reason for amd basically.","they saw the opportunity to make money because there's no competition then (which arguably isn't a bad decision for their high-end part, but they probably should have released some low end and midrange parts more aggressively to not be in this position where they have nothing to compete at that segment)

5800h is irrelevant because it has worse efficiency than 6900hs which itself has worse efficiency than a 12700h.,"your comment is insinuating that somehow intel has worse efficiency, which is factually false based on this plot.",6900hs comes close to i7 efficiency near 35w but above 35 w it has worse efficiency than an i7.,that means an i9 12900h would be more efficient than 6900hs including 35w.,the 5800h is not on the same efficiency league where amdâ€™s best ryzen 9 6900 is beaten.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
more to battery life than the cpu but its likely because the oem is letting the 12700h use all its performance rather than tweaking it down to 6900hs levels.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

but amd isnâ€™t more power efficient in low wattage either.,the ryzen 9 here is barrly matching the power efficiency of an i7 at 35w meaning it will lose to i9 at 35w.,below 35w the intel i7 1280p is more efficient.,"https://twitter.com/oneraichu/status/1496520184190091265?s=21

this will be hard to match by amd u series since those are just underclocked h series.",seems like with 12th gen intel will have the efficiency lead vs 6000 series is both lower and higher power limits.,so intel should have better battery life if everything else (other than cpu) is equal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not alone but it's a major contributing factor given power management settings out of the box for windows 10 and 11 are pretty aggressive straight from the oem's compared to previous versions of windows.,over 90% of users on both os's have it enabled (includes cpu frequency scaling and c-states among other things).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah that's not what it is showing.,draw a vertical line from 60w for instance.,it's showing the performance vs a power limit setting.,by this graph if you set your intel 12700h to 75w it'll outperform the 6700hs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

>the curve is a characteristic of the physical process node.,no.,different kinds of sillicon on the same node can have massively different voltage-frequency curves.,there are defects when you actually manufacture chips.,some of these defects make different chips have different voltage-frequency curves even though all pf those chips are of the the same die.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"""how many fps""  depends on the game you run.","wont matter since nobody will have better hardware

""work well"", uhh sure you didn't specify what ram and what motherboard.","your guess is as good as mine

""bottlenecks""  you make your own bottlenecks with that setup.","run 1080p you'll have cpu and monitor refresh rate bottleneck

run 4k you'll have gpu bottleneck.",you don't seem to know where bottlenecks originate from.,imo a 3080 and a 12600k and 32gb ram will last you for the next 5-8 years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the best current processor and the best current gpu... are you serious?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ok bc idk what i should get for specs as my first gaming pc, i want something that can run graphically demanding games in 4k at 60 fps.",any suggestions?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can use the 12600k and a 6800xt as your core parts if you want a pc that'll perform really well for years without spending 5 grands or more on a gaming pc.,"you can get a 3080 if you want to but they're almost always way more expensive than a 6800xt for about the same performance, if not a bit worse.","if the price is about the same for either, you can get the 3080.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the way i see the 12100f is that it's good enough *for now*.,if you are super tight on budget then i think it's a good option.,but if you like to keep your cpu around for a while and can spend a bit more than the 12400f is a much better option.,you can easily get a couple of extra years of performance out of that in games and it will be significantly better in productivity apps too.,even if you upgrade your gpu down the line the 12400f may still be usable while the 12100f likely won't.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"should be more than enough for a 6600 xt, you're likely going to be gpu bottlenecked rather than cpu bottlenecked, unless you plan on doing stuff in the background that can use a decent amount of the cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"based on what i saw in a yt videos, the 12100 was bottlenecked by the 3060(or 3060 ti) the gpu was reaching 100% but the cpu wasn't, so yes, i'd assume it's enough even for the 6700 xt/3070 ti, it also handled a last gen flagship gpu like the 2080(or ti, not sure which one it was) with ease.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 4 cores is going to bottleneck in demanding titles like rdr2 and hzd.,"iâ€™m assuming that you want to stay in budget, but i highly recommend buying a 12400f instead.",6 cores will keep you good for at least the next 3 years.,4 cores is too little for new triple aaa titles if you want consistent 1% lows.,youâ€™re going to notice that your cpu usage is constantly at 70-100% which is going to cause throttling and fps drops.,"if you live near a microcenter buy it there for the cheapest price, otherwise check newegg, bestbuy, or amazon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sure itâ€™s enough, as long as you keep your expectations in check.","itâ€™s not going to be max fps with max settings, but itâ€™ll be able to maintain a decent frame rate with reasonable settings in new games, and higher settings with better frame rates in games that are more than a few years old.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"dunno if it helps: 

i've compared the old 4770k (4 cores 8 threads) with rtx2080 i had before upgrade versus 12700k with the same card.",the difference in rdr2 was 17 fps 0.1% low (36 vs 53).,maximum fps obviously did not improve since the card was the same.,maximum settings at 1440p.,so if you're sensitive to fps drops - you might want to invest more in cpu.,"though this comparison is not all that correct (much older architecture, ddr3 ram) - still something to consider.","especially since 1080p will bottleneck your gpu less, and burden your cpu more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is this a trick question?,":)

i reckon the 12100f will be plenty for today's gaming, but if you have the budget to fit an rx 6600 xt, you might want to consider the 12400f.",the price difference is rather small.,"if the budget is tight though, focus on the gpu - it's the right way of thinking.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
easily.,i plan to keep identical build 2-4 years.,"i'm sure the ""muh coarez"" crew will try and shit on the i3 but in reality the i3 gets the same 144fps on the latest titles, that the 7700k got on the titles of 2017.",4c/8t is plenty if you aren't streaming.,even a 3070 is fine at 1080p ultra with i3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,i plan to put a 6700xt with mine and keep it for 4-5 years.,i game at 100hz and 12100f can do 144hz on aaa titles.,"directstorage is coming to pc and could lower cpu loads massively, like up to 40%.",though i believe 12100f will be fine for 5 years anyways.,"i'm not a wierdo that plays unoptimized aaa open world games on low settings with a powerful gpu, and i doubt you are either.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"how long is ""a while""?",3 years?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wish there is microcenter in our country.,i thought about getting 12400f +h610m +6600.,but then i found a deal where 6600xt for the price of 6600. and now i have to stretch my budget on cpu too.,"anyways, how about i5 11400f?",is it good enough?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 4 cores shouldn't be a bottleneck here since the 12100f is as powerful as a last gen 6 core,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no it isn't look at the benchmarks.,people are so misinformed.,"games are still single thread bound, it's just that 5 years of no ipc gains meant intel needed the same crutch amd was using.","between ipc gains and directstorage, both companies will soon  have to beg any level headed gamer who doesn't stream to buy more than an i3/r3",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so it'll bottleneck a bit?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'd say 4-5. i've been using a ryzen 5 2600 for four years now even though it kinda sucks.,i'm sure the 12400f can last longer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 12100f is enough,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"bottlenecking isnâ€™t really the issue, because the parts are roughly in the same performance category.","the parts just arenâ€™t â€œtop of the lineâ€, and new games definitely are pushing the envelope.","which isnâ€™t to say theyâ€™re bad components, because theyâ€™re are not.","the important part, however, is that theyâ€™re definitely capable of playing whatever you want, at medium to high settings, with 60fps or better, depending on the game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
higher settings means less cpu and more gpu load.... you seem to be insinuating that cpu load also increases with settings.,maybe if the game has a crowd density setting but otherwise it's the opposite.,as the gpu loads the framerate lowers and cpu load lowers.,the cpu has no idea or cares about how detailed the textures the gpu is painting onto the brushes.,the cpu only sees the wireframe so to speak.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"typically, the voltage stays around 0.975-0.995v or so with temps mentioned above.","under load (30-40% in my case), the voltage hardly seems to rise, staying around 1v or so.",what's funny is i've fixed the voltage at 1.2v and left other settings the same and the temps were hardly any different than what they were when left at auto.,"i ordered this aio today: [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b08wrj5mqw/ref=ppx\_yo\_dt\_b\_asin\_title\_o00\_s00?ie=utf8&psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b08wrj5mqw/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=utf8&psc=1)

"a couple things:

first, laptops are actually relatively unaffected by the chip shortage.",it's totally possible to get a laptop for close to what a similar laptop used to cost.,"second:  cpu clock speeds are often reported as either the ""base clock"", which is a fairly meaningless metric, or as the ""boost clock"", which is how fast one individual core can actually go.",i'd use the boost clock as the real metric on how to judge a cpu for your use cases.,"that said, clock speed isn't everything - different cpus can do a different amount of average instructions per cycle (ipc), with newer cpus generally being better at the same clock speed.",anything amd before ryzen (e.g.,what you have) has particularly low ipc.,"third, for gaming, the gpu is more important than the cpu, although both are important.","someone else linked a laptop with a gtx 1650 and i5 10500h - this is probably about the best you can get for gaming for around that price, but if gaming isn't your biggest priority and you want to also use your laptop on battery, it's probably best to avoid intel 10th generation or older.","intel and amd's integrated graphics are significantly worse than what the 1650 will get you, but should still be plenty for light gaming.","going for intel 11th gen or amd 4000/5000 series will get you much better battery life if that matters to you, and you should be able to find those for under $600.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"some main points of the leak:

arrow lake-p codenamed â€œhaloâ€ is targeting apple 14â€³ premium designs

arrow lake-p has a priority over arrow lake s (desktop) series",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
meat of the leak is [here](https://twitter.com/adoredtv/status/1496217229922291715/photo/1).,"some interesting tidbits:

gt3 tape in should be happening right about now (week 8 2022).","""growing die size beyond ~80mm^2 (320 eu) would drive reassessment of tsmc wafer request to meet linearity"" - no idea what this means tbh - what does linearity mean in this context?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
48 threads.,hmmmmm isn't amd supposed to hit that with 8000 series?,"with 24 normal cores on 2023.

no-one really needs that many processes.",but it's still kind of a letdown to not have more pcores.,12+24 should be better in my opinion.,though it could be that those are the numbers for the mobile skus.,and maybe desktop does hit the 12+24 or better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol isnt arrowlake already a codename?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i too wonder what linearity could mean here.,"my guess is that they'd run out of booked tsmc capacity if they exceed 80mm^(2), compared to their target volume of chips, so they'd have to order more?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the rumor here is that mobile will still be 6+8.,i don't know of a halfway reputable source claiming to know core counts for arrow lake-s (desktop).,i think that number came from a throwaway reddit account that videocardz is continuing to trust.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"current rumors are suggesting at least one of the zen 5 based socs will be 8 zen 5 cores, and 16 zen 4c(?)",cores.,"we don't know if that will be a mobile or desktop based soc, but i don't think a full 24 core zen 5 consumer soc is guaranteed.",and that's before we consider what kind of igpu and other specialized accelerators it may have.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no way zen5 will be 16 core only.,it will be a mistake even for zen4 to top out at 16 vs a 24 core raptor lake.,just for the halo mt.,i expect zen4 to beat it down the stack and meteor to take back the lead until zen5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"eh, i don't think we'll see that either.","now this is just a total guess, but i think we'll see 12 core ccds with zen 5 over that.",increasing the core count per ccd isn't difficult now that they've essentially moved to a ring in each one.,"it's pretty much the only way i can reconcile the idea that turin uses the same socket as genoa whilst doubling core count at least - add one ccd to each corner and increase cores per ccd to 12, and that gets you 192 cores total (16x12).","igpu, accelerators and all that'll stick on the i/o die anyway.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if needed they may also use threadripper skus with more features likely to be needed by 16+ core systems.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
serious question: currently who need more than 16 cores in a manstraim desktop computer?,"i guess that if you need more cores, then you also need more memory channel, thus hedt or workstation platform.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't think raphael really has that problem since it will still match in thread count.,we still don't have a very good idea of what any of zen 5 socs will look like so we'll just have to wait and see.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"poor ring scaling is what crippled many-core intel designs, though.",led to amd trying to distance themselves from the term.,took em a year to admit 3d cache is on a ring bus when normally they'd show it off at something like hotchips.,at a certain point the routing becomes a mess.,"either you've got a million per chip connections to keep hops down as cores scale up, or you've got an intel ring that tries to route through other cores and stalls operations but doesn't use up so much power.","amd somewhat ""solves"" the problem by keeping as much data as they can in each ccd and staying at the magic 8 number that intel also seems to like for its p cores.",they may need to dig into experimental or 3d layouts if they want 12+ ccds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that only really works 192 core turin, but not for 256 core turin(?).","either the number of chiplets are going up a lot, the chiplets are actually going to 16 cores, or these are not using the same chiplets.",we probably won't know for sometime,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">amd somewhat ""solves"" the problem by keeping as much data as they can in each ccd and staying at the magic 8 number that intel also seems to like for its p cores.","hold up a second, that's wrong.","firstly, you've forgotten that on intel chips the imc and igpu also sit on the ring.","in other words, they've had 10 stop rings since coffee lake.","secondly, the gracemont clusters on alder lake are each another ring stop.","so right now, as of today, we already have examples of 12 stop ring buses with the adl-s 8+8 die.",next gen with raptor lake intel will be pushing to 14 stops.,by the time we hit arrow lake an 8+32 design means we'll have 18 stops.,"if we want to get into kinda cursed territory then there's a broadwell chip i could bring up, but for the sake of sanity i won't.","it absolutely is a mess scaling past 12 stops, but it's not infeasible.","and amd ""only"" need 13 per ccd.",12 cores and 1 for the ifop bridge back to the iod.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is very little reason to have a lot of cores and 2 memory channels + few pcie lines.,either consumer platform will change to semi-hedt or there will be some sort of bigger threadripper platform above consumer platform.,amd said they did tested bigger core count configuration of ryzen so they also have options.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"right, but there's loss on the e cores.","each core alone is about as effective as a full skylake core, but route work through them and they significantly lose efficiency.",they don't scale like the p cores and the ring is also frequency limited by them.,it only scales by modern performance standards to its 8 p cores.,their coffeelake design also had to make regressions for the 10 stops.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
will have to see if raptor lake has any problems with dual channel ddr5.,intel can move the i9 to quad channel and still claim it as desktop halo ( or 3 channels again ) with the i7 remaining as 8 + 16 ( like raptor lake ).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
coffee and comet lake made regressions?,that's new to me.,"core to core latency increased slightly, but it wasn't anywhere near enough to put a dampener on performance in almost every scenario.",>they don't scale like the p cores and the ring is also frequency limited by them.,"that's not a result of having to scale to 12 stops though, else comet lake would have done the same thing.",that's something to do with adding the gracemont's.,that much is obvious because the ring drops to the same clocks as the gracemonts themselves - how much of a drop depends on the clocks of the gracemonts per product.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there's some variable core to core latency penalties across comet lake depending on which cores are disabled, and the efficiency for work completed is a little worse than coffee lake even though throughput is higher.",can't really say its guaranteed to have cost some ipc but the results look like a compromise.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this is what it should be, trading the crown back and forth every 6 months to a year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

how about you run some tests with the new ryzen 6k processor's.,your comparing intel's 12th gen to amd's last gen's.,everybody here is proud intel took a whole year or 2 longer to produce a new cpu that could finally beat ryzen's last gen's cpu????,if these 12th gen intel chips are so good...then why didn't you post the results against amd's new 6k processor's???,that would be an actual test.,not testing new cpu's to older cpu's.,"this benchmark intel posted is honestly pathetic
just saying don't be a sore looser.... do better",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well.... i mean the comparison is the newest gen intel vs the 1.5 year old amd.,surprisingly intel is not that much better which begs the question: how will ryzen 6000 series perform?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ah yes, the threaded benchmark where the ryzen chip with the most threads.... is not present.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that cost $200 more which donâ€™t fit in this chart.,this chart here is for the same price range.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is desktop vs desktop.,"ryzen 6000 is mobile only, and still performs worse than 12th gen mobile.","ryzen 7000, aka zen 4, launches late this year and is expected *after* 13th gen aka raptor lake.",so this comparison is right.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they did compare it against the 5950x.,"the review is from launch, back when the 5900x and 12900k only had about a $50 difference:

https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/articles/davinci-resolve-studio-12th-gen-intel-core-vs-amd-ryzen-5000-series-2247/#benchmarkresults

they also did a general comparison across alderlake and zen 3:
https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/articles/12th-gen-intel-core-cpu-review-roundup-2248/

alderlake is generally faster than zen 3 at production.","the only places where it's slower is in some types of encoding vs higher core count zen 3 chips, and for some reason unreal code compilation where its significantly slower.","overall the only thing zen 3 chips are consistently faster in is compression and decompression, possibly because their branch predictor is a solid percent more accurate for compression, which is huge given they're both in the 90%+ range so every percent lead is very difficult to obtain.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think that's another issue with comparing intel and amd cpus.,they don't exactly have direct competitors.,price wise most of the cpus are staggered.,like the 5900x being about $100 less than the 12900k while the 5950x is about $80 more.,"in this comparison all the intel cpus are more than the amd cpus, even if it is only a measly $20 by the time you get to the i5.",if amd made a cpu that was the same price as the 12900k it would definitely beat the i9 without a doubt.,however i feel the i5 would still hold its ground since amd has never really been that great at the low end.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fyi.,"they intentionally didn't include the 5950x because it makes no sense to consider it for a 5950x which is slower and more expensive than the 12900k

has a consistent comparison developed in the value of an intel p core vs an e core?,like 2 e cores = 1 p core?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that video is largely useless to prove they aren't power hogs.,multiple benchmarks that show usage over time on graphs you really can't read that peak significantly all over the place and no one can remotely read average or total power used during them making them near worthless.,then using gaming where the same gpu is taking up most of hte power and the cpus aren't heavily loaded also telling us nothing.,the one cpu benchmark that showed consistent power usage is at the end and while they call it a power hog it also shows that the 12th gen intel used dramatically more power throughout.,"https://youtu.be/jeuonkqkars?t=1070

it also seems to show the system itself is less efficient (probably ddr5 combined with much more efficient chipset due to the issues with pci-e 4 chipset falling through and using an i/o die instead) which actually makes the true cpu draw higher as it's using some 30-35w higher idle.",to say it isn't a power hog is pretty ridiculous because fully loaded up it absolutely is.,"that doesn't mean it will use that much power in everything all the time at all, but to claim it can't or doesn't is completely wrong.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ah, i see.","i hadn't seen these numbers before, thanks for sharing.",i suppose there are several different workloads to consider and it's only natural that the 5950x having 16 homogeneous cores against 8p+8e cores will win in some multi-threaded workloads.,"11.5% is a considerable lead, but from what i recall in reviews which took a lot of different workloads into account, the two cpus we're performing real close.","either way, i think it's exciting to have intel performing this well against amd for the first time in 3-5 years and i'm hoping it will continue because it only works to benefit consumers and push the industry forward as a whole.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yea ur response doesnt make sense tho.,the 12900k beats the 5950x with ddr4 and 5 in the benchmark in question so... yeh its not displayed but doesnt really matter.,maybe to keep the priceclasses similar the 5950x could be compared to a 12900ks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"from what i understand most of south america and south east asia have the same problem, honestly people don't really think a out what its like building a pc outside of their own country, just because something is $x in your country does not mean its not almost twice as much in another, also sometimes certain components are inflated when others aren't so in some countries you get situations where cpu's are 2x or 3x the equivalent price in the usa or europe but motherboards and ram are cheaper.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
like almost everything in japan you need to use a third party agent to do anything.,in this case the wholesaler (third party agent ) buys large amounts of products to sell to a store (like amazon) then the store sells to us.,(usa amazon buys the product they sell directly from the manufactures and doesn't need to use a middleman wholesaler).,"the biggest ""third party agent"" in the pc components market is called ask and it's known for stupidly high margins (people call that ""ask tax""), this combined with the lack of msrp, makes pc components extremely expensive.","also all the warranties are done by ask, so your gpu that should have a 3 year warranty by the manufacturer suddenly have 1 year warranty if you bought in japan.","unlike nvidia, amd and many others brands, only intel sells their products without using the ask company, making their products waaaaay more cheaper than their rivals.",with intel's global warranties.,"tldr: intel always cheaper, amd always expensive and never had a chance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
amd isn't even trying in the desktop market with zen3 against alder lake or even rocket lake.,the server market is more profitable per unit moved so they've all but ceded desktop to intel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is why i canâ€™t stand the glorification of mindfactory in r/amd and r/amd_stock.,mindfactory is extremely biased towards selling amd products (just check their website and youâ€™ll be greeted by a barrage of â€œamd promotions & ads).,whatâ€™s worse is that r/amd then claims that mindfactory (a single retailer in a single country) data is an excellent representation of the rest of the worldâ€¦??,74% intel cpu shipments in japan isnâ€™t even close to the germany shipment data.,good job intel.,i knew that adl was killing sales despite the narrative r/amd_stock tries to bluster from the mindfactory â€œdataâ€ in an attempt to boost their market price.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"interesting, amd really needs to step up the supply game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

can't you buy in other countries and use a shipping forwarder?,"i usually buy in the us and forward to my location, usually with very cheap shipping vs the retailer shipping.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
youâ€™re really exaggerating.,"pc components are not extremely expensive, the 5600x is $283 ($260 in us), 12600k is $292 ($280 in us), and amd was killing it before they decided to drop their value products:

amd guided 31% increase in revenue for 2022 with gm of 52% while intel on the other hand intel guided roughly 2% decrease in revenue for 2022 with gm of 52%.,remember intel gm was in mid 60s few years ago.,amd is selling whatever they are manufacturing and are prioritizing epyc over ryzen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not just supply but price to performance too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you don't really need a shipping forwarder but shipping costs and lack of warranty (ask obviously won't honor a warranty from something not bought from them) make buying internationally almost not worth.,but for expensive items such as super high end cpu and gpus are worth doing that.,a lot of self claimed experts like me would exclusively buy evga cards since it's the only brand that do global warranty with a beef 3 years period.,"funny thing is that with all this crypto shit thing, scalped gpus in japan are/were way more cheaper than usa prices.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

can you specify what models you have in mind?,the 12900k is definitely better value than the 5950x.,do you perhaps mean threadrippers?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thank you for sharing your experience!,"i'm building it for work, specifically gamedev in unity engine but i don't expect sustained multithreaded workloads longer than \~20min, maybe 30 minutes tops for unity builds which is when the cpu will reach peak temps.","code compilation takes a few seconds at a time, and platform switching a few minutes perhaps.","so as long as i can keep it reasonably cool roughly for 20-30 minutes of multithreaded workloads (that still likely won't tax all the cores to the max like synthetic benchmarks), i'm good.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what are your temps when running a synthetic benchmark (e.g.,"cinebench, aida64 fpu, etc.)",for 20 min?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

iâ€™ve never seen a failure mode like that.,"stupid question, but did someone have physical access to the machine?",was the cpu purchased on ebay?,the fact that two cores are missing is super strange.,edit: iâ€™m assuming this isnâ€™t running in a virtual machine.,"if so, check the hypervisor config.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that's the gpu frequency.,"and yes, the gpu will boost to 1.1 ghz in normal use.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the fast answer man i appretiate it!,side question tho why do they put it that way?,is it like an energy saving feature or something?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, the frequency is dynamic because you don't need it to run at full speed all the time.",the same applies for the cpu frequency.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the cpu uses the motherboard base clock which is normally 100mz.,then it multiplies that with a controllable multiplier.,so when the cpu is advertised with max freq of 2ghz it actually has max multiplier of 20. cpus tend to run very low clocks when they are not working and eventually shutting the clock off entirely to save power.,"cpu has some maximum multiplier which can depend on the number of active cores, maximum power, temperature etc.","i3-10105 should have maximum single core multiplier of 44 which corresponds to 4.4ghz, so iâ€™m not entirely sure what the maximum dynamic frequency you gave is.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the integrated gpu's,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ah, sorry i missed the gpu.",anyways the same things apply to that too.,"it uses the same clock source with multiplier, downclocks when possible and boosts to some max value when needed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that is a lot of paste, but the real problem is that you have 50c coolant temp, which means your radiator is grossly underpowered.",since you have a small radiator it will need a lot of fan speed to compensate for the lack of area.,what fans are you using?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mine is around 85-95c full load @5ghz.,using the ekwb elite 360 aio.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
h80i-v2 is definitely on the smaller side for the 12700k but you can probably get it under control.,they just get pumped with way to much voltage at stock settings.,my 12700k was hitting about 93c with a noctua u12a while drawing something like 1.3v.,try manually setting your voltage.,i was able to use 1.23v and run at 5ghz while lowering my temps to a peak of 85 in r23.,"also, that looks like a little too much paste but it shouldn't hurt anything.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you can limit the max power draw in bios to lower temps, but at the expense of performance",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mine was throttling in r23 too.,though i'm using an air cooler (cooler master ma612).,undervolting it helped a lot.,and without a noticeable performance loss.,just something to consider.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i also noticed that the coolant temperature takes very long to cool down, which has big impact on idle temperatures as well.",this also suggests why it goes that high in the first place.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

can you share exact settings of your undervolt?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have cleaned the dust already with an air blower.,"there is still slight dust stuck in there it seems which won't go away with the blower, any other recommendations to clean it with?",i noticed that the coolant just stays around 40â°c after the stress test and it won't just come down at all even after an hour or so.,over the night when i shutdown the pc and turn it back on in morning coolant starts from about 23â°c and gets stable at 31â°c on idle.,but if i run a stress test it goes high and then doesn't get below 40â°c resulting in my idle cpu temps to be around that mark as well.,"i will check if i can tighten the screws more by applying more pressure, but i think there is no room for it.","are you determining that from the thermal paste imprint, if so, any examples of a good imprint/how it will look that shows the correct/tight enough mounting pressure?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

dust inside the radiator is really only cleanable with air.,"the fact that idle water temp climbs by almost 10c, and coolant temperature takes a long time to lower is troubling.","could either be a lack of airflow due to dust and poor fans, or a clogged pump or block.",all aios will eventually clog up unfortunately.,which means the must be replaced.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

a 12900k does somewhere along the lines of 27200 in cb23.,"from that, about 4400 a 5000 is from the 4 efficiency cores ( depends on the processor model but for the 12900k, its around that).",with about 21500 coming from the performance cores.,"so a 40% uplift ( 37.800 ) means:

a) about 4 more efficiency cores.",that is 5000 already accounted for.,b) that just leaves bumping up the ipc / frequency by 15% across all cores.,let say increase power cores by 10% but do another 20% on the efficiency cores ( 6000 per 4 ).,so the 8 efficiency cores do +- 12.000 now.,and the performance cores go from 21.500 to 23.650 with a 10% uplift.,combine both numbers and you get ... 35.650. not that far from the 40% theoretical number.,"the extra 4 efficiency cores already account for 16% performance gain, without even touching anything else on the cpu.",now power usage?,hahahaa .... lets just say i estimate this thing to be as hot as the sun on the same 10nm/7n process.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there is some opportunity there for that.,the 3090 was built on a relatively weak samsung 8nm (not super dense and low perf/watt) process relative to tsmc 7nm.,"add in further advancements from tsmc 5nm (density, perf/watt, and performance or higher clocks), and sprinkle on a new architecture on top and thereâ€™s a good chance of 2x+ gains over 3090.

"which makes sense, as most programs that do need fast cores don't scale beyond 8 cores.",and it would be better to juice those 8 cores with more performance/power than it would be to add additional p-cores.,and the e-cores are there to scale highly threaded tasks and be a bit more efficient.,"until developers actually start using more than 8 cores for gaming, there is very little reason to add more, instead of just making faster ones or adding more cache and adding more e-cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

they don't make motherboards.,they make the chipset and sell it to motherboard manufacturers.,intel is notorious for changing the chipset/socket almost every cpu generation to sell more motherboards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not necessarily.,if you reduce clocks (and voltage) but make the new gpu a lot wider you'll keep power in check while getting a lot more performance.,current gpus are pushed pretty far up the voltage curve (look at how adding 100w and oc to 3080 does almost nothing).,though rumors are next gen could see 450w-500w anyway.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how are you measuring the performance difference with/without the 150w powerlimit?,"i'd expect you'd see lower scores in some benchmarks, but not necessarily much difference in normal day to day use (depending on what you use it for).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"power limits work by lowering the cpu clock, which makes it slower.",possibly the limits were high enough that you were still below the limits and so did nothing.,alternatively it may have gotten slower and you didn't notice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the power draw for 11th gen is huge after something like 4.0ghz.,"lowering the power limit to 150w should keep it somewhere around 4.2-4.4ghz, while default 4.6ghz all core is something like 180-190 watts.",it is likely slower but not to the point of being significantly slower than before.,"not entirely sure about the 170w part, probably it's voltage/frequency spike as it goes over the limit, then it starts restricting power.",i get this when limiting max frequency without directly limiting the turbo clock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, to be honest i havenâ€™t done benchmarks as the only thing i really use the pc for is browsing and gaming.",iâ€™m sure the difference would be noticeable in benchmarks but my question is rather why the cpu would draw 12% more power in an application (game for instance) where it can perform the same with lower powerdraw.,"i seems to me like a waste, so iâ€™m hoping to learn why this would be.",thanks you your comment!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that makes sense, as mentioned in another comment i think performance may have dropped ever so slightly like you suggest, and i just cant tell the difference.",to add to your first point maybe the monitered 170w i've seen has only been a power surge?,this could also explain the highest temps i have seen compared to what i see after the 150w limit.,thanks for your comment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"lowering your powerlimit (within reason) won't stop your pc from performing any tasks, it'll just won't be quite as fast at those tasks.",in many cases (such as yours) the difference in speed may be not be noticeable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there is zero reason to obsess over how much your cpu is being used.,it's not important at all.,"if you are playing a game and the gpu utilization is over 95%, you're good.",even if that's not the case but you're getting sufficiently high frame rate then you're good.,just enjoy the game.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

in simple terms the cpu is feeding frames to the gpu to render.,"gpu bound (your situation) is where your cpu is feeding more frames to the gpu than it can render, so the cpu can sit back and relax.",this is the norm.,"cpu bound is where your cpu can't keep up with the gpu's appetite for frames, so the gpu gets to lounge about while the cpu works its ass off.",this isn't common unless you're running low resolution with no framerate cap.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

cpu isnâ€™t like gpu because for a game to run good we need gpu to work as hard as it can to give us the best fps so gpu will always be around 90% and higher in games but cpu just have to process the frames that gpu is giving + any other physical related things and background stuff so when itâ€™s at 10% it means you have a lot of head room because if it really needed it would use more of the cpu but itâ€™s not so it doesnâ€™t need it ( so itâ€™s good and everything seems normal so donâ€™t worry),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

is your only exhaust the gpu aio?,i would definitely put one beefy exhaust fan on the back to take more heat out of your case.,especially since the intake from the cpu aio will end up being warmer air.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great build!,i would get a gpu support bracket if i were you since the gpu isn't that small and the weight of psu cables and the aio tubes can cause it to sag over time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your bottom fans are exhaust; those really should be intake and positioned at the very bottom not an inch up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you could turn the 360 aio fans around to push the air through and out the back.,"then turn the bottom fans around to intake air- <hot air rises> <sucks in cold air from the bottom over the gpu as well which could benefit from cool airflow even though its on its own aio>

now you have a negative pressure because you have 5 exhaust fans, and 3 intake fans.",i suggest you utilize that back exhaust area and put another intake fan there.,also get a cheap magnetic screen to cover the intake areas to prevent dust from getting in - expecially if its on ground level.,"also noticed that your 360 aio tubes are hitting your ram sticks, id make sure theres not alot of pressure on them, may be a downside to that case.","the way it is now, its sucking in hot radiator air, then heat wants to rise so its gonna go through your gpu radiator and your bottom fans arent gonna push out much heat.",your essentially heating up the air as it comes in.,so do these things to fix it.,otherwise awesome build man.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

nothing personal but i see so many builds where fans are being used not so much for cooling but for aesthetics.,if you are worried about airflow there are far better cases that could achieve better airflow with less fans.,"again, not a criticism just an observation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why would you buy a 12900 if power draw was a critical metric.,just say itâ€™s cheaper.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah the issue is that buying a k-sku should mean you plan to actually use the overclocking feature.,stock voltages are high (for stability on random psus and mobos) and they can easily be adjusted to destroy any non k sku in performance/watt.,"k-skus have better binned silicon regardless if you want to actually ""overclock"" with higher voltage or not.",edit: btw gaming isn't a good benchmark for real perf.,"of modern cpus above mid-level because even an i5-12600 would be ""within 5%"" even at 1080p",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is a recording of buildzoid's low-mid range alderlake chipsets.,"a few notes:

- don't bother with ddr5 b660 boards, most of them are on a six layer pcb, meaning you won't be able to hit the voltages needed for ddr5 oc.",- gigglebyte tend to give you more usb ports per dollar than other manufacturers at the cost of half your audio ports (buildzoid's fault apparently).,"- rog b660 boards are overpriced, as usual, but they can do non k oc.",- msi b660 tomahawk wifi ddr4 is probably the best overall board for an i7 12700 or i9 12900 in terms of feature set (especially audio being better than entry level z690).,vrm is overkill for running any non oc cpu.,"- h670 doesn't make sense, basically the same cost as z690 in a lot of cases but can't oc.",some h670 boards have worse rear io and audio than their b660 counterparts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
auto should be stock multipliers for x core workloads on p cores.,sync all cores will run the 1 core freuency spec on all p cores.,at least thatâ€™s what it should mean.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

unfortunately it just made every core run at 4.0 ghz :/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sync all cores makes it run at the highest core ratio setting of the last core across all the cores.,"better off leaving it on auto imo,

you are probably getting 4.4ghz on single core speed and lower ratios as you work down the amount of cores you have.",that is ussually how stock is from intel as far as i know for 12th gen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

oh wow that is not alot of information.,it is basically limited by how much you can cool.,"if you have a really good 360mm radiator shoot for a 4+ turbo ratio offset on the p-cores, set ring to 4.4 and e-cores to 4.2 all.",set cpu switching frequency to 677khz voltage to 1.42 adaptive with an llc4.,update your bios prior to this btw.,core voltage should be 1.35v during load with 250w cinebench and 280w prime95.,12700k are binned worse than 12900k so the chances of you getting an outlier that can do 5.3 on the p-cores at any reasonable voltage are slim to none.,if you are solely gaming: disable e-cores.,p-cores can be at ~5.2 with ring at 4.9-5.0. voltage will be insane lol but powerdraw will be similar.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is almost certainly an issue with your cooling setup and not the cpu itself.,"also when i worked at microcenter there was never diagnostics done on a lone cpu itself, first because they are the most reliable part of the pc, and second because technicians dont just have a test bench for every platform just sitting around to slap a cpu or ram or whatever into.","the microcenter service center is designed with diagnosing and fixing entire pc's with issues, not testing an individual component.","and yes, if you want to file a warranty claim you have to take the pictures of the identification codes on the cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"audio stopped working, black screen, constant screen freezing, crashes.","finally heard back from intel 

they agreed it was the cpu, getting a refund as they are currently out of stock of 12900k",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thatâ€™s your problem, not the cpu.",itâ€™s either broken or not broken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
?,???,if it was actually working then it is you that is defective.,considering you used it for a month the cpu is fine.,apply thermal paste maybe?,attach a cooler?,you most certainly aren't gonna get a return lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"running at 100c does not mean the cpu is defective, and telling you to ask someone else is how stores get rid of customers they don't want to deal with.",is there any other reason you think it is broken?,what is the problem you're trying to solve?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ahh that's different then.,usually when it just runs hot it's a cooling issue but it should never be blackscreening etc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"dont turn it off just yet, you will find out that once you disabled intel premium rst in bios you wont be able to boot into your windows anymore even though you didnt use optane in the first place.",you need to manually change the storage driver from intel optane rst to ahci in windows.,"once done, you can turn rst off in bios and try to boot into windows again.","if done right, your windows should now no longer uses rst premium driver.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"turning rst off won't do any harm to your data, be it on your windows drive or optane cache if you have any.",so it's just a matter of accessing your bios settings and turning it off.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i thought so too since they were talking a big game recently.,"for example:

> intel executive raja m. koduri explained that the company expects its circuit innovations will deliver â€œ1000x better performance per wattâ€ than todayâ€™s gpu or sha256-based mining equipment.",however it would appear the contracts intel has with a couple of mining companies are not for this miner but for a second generation miner which they have not yet revealed anything about to the public beyond the quote i just gave.,"so perhaps this was a 1st generation try and the second iteration is as they claim though i have my doubts it's 1,000x better as raja *""lets release a t-shirt instead of a gpu""* koduri is claiming.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i wish they made something that could compete with bitmain in power usage, otherwise i don't get the point.","maybe this is their first working device and it will get better over time, but until then it's a huge waste of the worlds resources.",and i'm not talking about electricity (mining is not a waste of electricity either) but a less efficient device is useless to miners and the world.,hopefully they don't sell any units until they are comparable or better in power consumption.,jack from twitter stepped down and started a similar venture.,if intel can't do it my hopes are low.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

halo products really help to sell the entire product line.",businesses know this.,business schools teach this.,and it works.,i know tons of guys who bought the 5950x just because it was the best product at the time.,but they can never fully keep those cores utilized.,maybe if they were used it to help rip dvds on the side.,i think the 16e cores may also help bring down the power consumption that 12900k sees in those same cb r23 tests.,12900k with 24t can already smoke a 16c/32t 5950x.,so the next logical step for intel is to bring down the power consumption and maybe raptorlake can solve this problem with 8p/16e 32t.,again halo products are very niche products but they help to sell the vast majority of the product stack below.,"i'd be totally fine with an i5 13600k and it could potentially feature 6p/8e for 20t which is would be insane for an i5.... 

i figure if i9 gets 32t, then i7 may feature 24t so i5 could be 20t or 16t.",depending on how they play with the e cores.,e cores seem to be the key.,very dense and take up little die space.,amazing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
more e cores is huge for laptops.,especially considering how insane the power consumption is of these modern cpus.,"if i could have the performance cores turned off all day for my normal work, but still have them there for the time it's needed then maybe my i9 laptop could get more than 2 hours of battery life.","but for now i'm a poor 11th gen user so i get only ""performance"" cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i get that a lot of people won't need more than 6p+4e like the 12600k, or maybe 8p+4e like the 12700

but more e-cores could be huge for the lower end cpus, even for gamers.","like if the i3 13100f has 4p+4e, that could be a serious budget gaming cpu for under $100 (according to current gen pricing)

or if the i5 13400f is 6p+4e then that's a really great gaming cpu for under $200 (according to current gen pricing)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah i'm still on ddr4 as well with a ddr4 z690 board.,might upgrade to 13700k from 12600k later this year if it offers a decent performance leap and ride out the ddr4 platform for 4-5 more years before building a new system.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the whole industry does this not just intel.,tsmc and samsung had naming conventions that did not match intel in node densities in the past.,but tsmc and samsung had mobile phone sales to bolster their portfolios.,one could argue that mobile phones have much greater volume and yearly life cycles than pcs.,but not everyone is upgrading every year.,people upgrade in 3 to 6 year cycles.,"intel has always been working on the good stuff for desktop, laptop, and server customers.",they were working on entering the dgpu markets.,yes they were delayed with 10nm as they had issue with volume production and maybe were too ambitious with the node density.,those products are here today and as promised it is the good stuff.,and things keep getting better with time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
where did you get this information?,the leaks were telling that raptor lake == alder lake but double e-cores,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,raptoreum and monero are two projects that come to mind.,raptoreum favors the large cache on ryzen cpu's though.,intel cpu's don't perform as well.,"currently the miner does allow you to use the cpu while mining and i haven't run into any limitations here, even gaming.",corporations should stay out of mining imo.,the norton av mining is one example of folks opting in to mine and receive a portion of the actual cost.,"in practice it has hidden costs the average person doesn't consider, like power consumption and cooling.",so it really ends up being a cash/coin grab for norton.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no one is forcing you to upgrade each generation.,how will the 12900k be 'worthless'?,unless you are obsessed with having the best of the best at all times.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
e-cores only matter for productivity and the very high end.,gaming only cares about p-cores so 6-8 of those will do fine.,adl will age fine for a few years yet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i canâ€™t wait to see you bragging about your 13900k come september, then complaining about how your 24 core processor is suddenly â€œoutdatedâ€ come spring 2023. you could always just enjoy your i9 and upgrade in a few years, but youâ€™re a tool that feels the need to spend hundreds of dollars for an additional ~10% every couple of months.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what holds you back from selling the 12900k for a good price and getting 13900k instead?,whole investment probably 150$ and you get 8cores more and higher single core performance too.,remember the time when we were paying over 500$ for just 8 cores?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think the really interesting competition will be zen 5 vs meteor lake.,"both will use chiplets, heterogeneous cores and they will hopefully be released once hardware prices got back to normal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"at the heyday of intel, we have seen demos of products launching year or 2 later.",just to show what is possible.,i rarely see that having a major impact.,intel 4 is uber critical as its 1st euv process from them and 1st major change since they went finfet route.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

arrow lake is rumoured to have 8c+32c.,so i expect meteor is going to get 8+24c.,i think intel do not have tdp room for more performance cores.,app that need to use more than 8 cores is usually scale pretty well on more cores.,"i actually surprise intel start with 8 performance cores, considering intel have stuck us with quad core long enough.there are far more apps only use quad cores.",starting with 6+16 would have given alderlake a clear win over 5950x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

but then again, intel low wattage alder lake only have two p-cores and a lot of e-cores, we'll probably see how they make use of those then.",my guess is that they will just tune p-cores for lower power and use it for everything anyway and only use e-cores when you do heavy cores workload.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

well i just went with 10% as it was what the commenter above said.,the only credible source so far has said 7%-15% depending on workload.,this likely means 7% where the increased cache doesn't matter that much and 15% for cache-intensive workloads and includes the improved cores.,"as usual there will be some outliers where it'll be less or more, but this is what we have so far.",remember that this range is still based upon early silicon samples and not even intel knows the final clock speeds/binning at this point.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you are making a mess of the whole thing.,"that ipc increase could be theoretically achieved without a significant increase in cache, there are other things that can be changed besides cache(decoders, how the instruction queue works, improving the branch predictor, reducing the overhead from a wrong prediction, faster clocks and any number of things).",my comment specifically mentioned that a big cache increase is part of the changes that contributed to the mentioned ipc increase.,again: you can have ipc increase without cache increase or you can have a very small increase in cache.,it does not immediately follow that bigger ipc = hugely more cache.,"it is akin to saying the following:

not a single review has actually tested thread director because the reviewers don't understand what it does and are just regurgitating intel's marketing.,even anandtech has sadly done a poor job.,testing thread director requires the usage of multiple concurrent workloads/use cases of different instruction mixes.,"for example, one with heavy avx instructions and the other simple integer calculations.",you also need to have enough work concurrently running such that there aren't enough p-cores.,thread director is supposed to identify the different threads to prioritize to p-cores (i.e.,avx) so that the highest throughput is achieved.,but avx isn't common for consumer use cases and is definitely not heavily used enough to matter.,"and 8 p-cores is more than enough for so many workloads, there is little to no spill over to e-cores.","intel's own marketing calls them 'mainstream applications' and shows them as the most common, vs 'emerging applications'.",and only a sliver of the 'emerging applications' are drastically impacted.,([source](https://images.anandtech.com/doci/16959/td%20classes.jpg)),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1) remove your cpu cooler

2) wipe off residual thermal paste with your preferred method (i use a paper towel and any high proof alcohol like 70%)

3) carefully un-latch the cpu socket retention arm (the ilm arm) while holding the cpu in place so it doesn't fall out 

4) carefully remove cpu and set aside in a safe spot

5) using a torx screwdriver, carefully and slowly remove the bottom 2 ilm bolts while holding the ilm bracket in place.","carefully remove it from the motherboard making sure not to lose the bolts

6) same as 5) but this time for the top 2 bolts.","take care not to lose the bolts, and hold the bracket on with your finger until both bolts are free

7) install 1mm thick m4 nylon washer on each bolt.",re-install starting with the bottom bracket.,re-install the top bracket.,"screw on to hand-right (don't over tighten - there's literally no point and you could damage the mobo if you really go at it

8) re-install your cpu, holding it in place while you bring the ilm tensioning arm back down on top of it.","re-paste and re-install your cpu cooler

voila!",cooler temps for $0.10 worth of plastic.,"you've successfully fixed intel's bad design, un-bent your ihs enough that your cooler is making better contact, and dropped your temps 5-15c (depending on load - better gains from higher temps/oc's)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the problem that the washermod fixes isn't merely distance from ihs to cooler - it's the bend that the ilm makes in the ihs!",less tension on ilm to ihs = less concave = better contact between cooler and ihs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"as the other redditor has already said, lapping is a much more extreme alternative and in this case would be a bad idea

assuming (correctly) that you're not lapping the ihs while the cpu is mounted in the ilm (because that would be dumb) then you're not going to get the ihs flat.",the ilm is bending the ihs because of a poor design where the ilm bracket puts too much pressure on the middle of the ihs.,"the washer mod just relieves some of that pressure, reducing the bend / concavity and thus allowing a better/flatter contact with the cooler

">considering the size difference

it does seem impressive, but even without jumping into comparing manufacturing nodes, just simply look at the transistor count.",m1 max is an absolute chonker because of the push for efficiency - they can pack many more transistors if they don't have to worry about pushing the silicon to its limits.,this isn't really a valid strategy for intel/nvidia/amd consumer segment because of their limited margins.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no benefit to intel to put risc cores on desktop, but meteor lake should finally bring sizable igpu to the field.",apples using of risc isn't their main advantage it's their 5nm silicon and there fact they can hyper optimize their walled garden.,risc is slightly more efficient than x86 but in modern cpus the decoder is tiny so the difference is nil in most scenarios.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i was replying to someone how said that the chip is competitive in terms of size.,so yeah itâ€™s competitive but only because apple brute forced by spending money on a huge chip.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on how many layers your pcb is.,"most of the h670 and b660 boards are six layers, so ddr4 is going to struggle past 4k mt/s, especially if you have all 4 dimm slots populated.","don't even bother with ddr5 on a six layer pcb, you'll struggle to reach 6k mt/s, even limiting yourself to two dimm slots.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"non-k cpus can't adjust vccsa, which in turn limits the memory frequency you can achieve in gear 1. some chips do 3466, most do 3600, and some lucky ones do 3800.

"if you meant system agent voltage, then we can manually change it on non k cpu alder lake with h670 mobos.","but h670, especially asus still have big problems with ram overclocking and even boot with xmp profiles like 4133 cl19",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3600 is easy you could do it with all four slots populated.,i assume that's 32 gb of dual rank?,"dual rank will give best performance, it can be achieved by either using two dual rank sticks or four single rank sticks.","there's not really much difference between the two from what i've heard, even on a six layer pcb.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you can set a different voltage, but it won't apply.",it's an unfortunate limitation of the fivr and intel microcode.,don't believe me?,"force gear 1, and see how high you can boot with vccsa at 1.45v and vccsa at 1.00v",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thank you very much, yes that would be the intention.",slightly off topic but if i might ask.,"if you were to buy a ddr5 mobo with the intention of slotting in faster sticks down the road than what is currently available, which one would you get?",or is trying to provision that way a fools errand?,"my particular use case benefits heavily from ddr5, i have reason to want to get it, but i prefer to have 64gb now and paying $600+ to get 2 x 32gb of 5200mhz c40 ddr5 is a tough pill to swallow considering that speed will likely be antiquated in the near future.","that is the main reason i started looking at ddr4, and the concern that any ddr5 mobo i get likely will not handle the faster speeds as they come a year or two from now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

anything with four dimm slots is bad for ddr5.,"none of them have a single qvl past jedec speeds, so your only options are the super expensive oc boards like the msi unify x or the evga dark if you care about speed.","edit: i should have been more clear that the qvl is for all slots populated, you can definitely get two dimms on a four slot board to 6k mt/s, but the two slot boards are better past these speeds because you start to get interference from the unpopulated slots.",[source](https://youtu.be/q8xlvztqyx8),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"""extra 8 e-cores are a decent boost""

you understimated effect e-cores have on multi threading.",those extra 8 e-cores are literally going to put raptor lake i9 right between threadripper 3960x and 3970x.,difference between those and 5950x is massive.,basically zen 4 doesn't have any chance if they don't increase core count which is unlikely not only because rumors are suggesting it but because upcoming 5000 series threadrippers are confirmed to stay at same core count which means ryzens stay the same until zen 5 and hybrid architecture.,"&#x200b;

moving onto single thread and gaming, you re looking at 5.5 ghz boost for raptor lake and 8-15% ipc icrease from alder lake which means zen 4 should deliver 30%+ ipc increase over zen 3 which again is very hard task amd.","as for cache improvements, intel has upper hand in l2 while amd obviously in l3 size.",which one is more important for gaming we shall see.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"at least some of the zen 4 variants are going to have 3d vcache and i wouldn't be surprised if this was used for product segmentation, and perhaps even to increase core counts across the product stack (maybe a bit to optimistic on my part).","i would only expect a zen 4+ if there are delays with zen 5.

i would not be too surprised if only the 3d vacahe variants were able to beat raptorlake by 10+%, while the non-vcache variants are either at parity or maybe even slightly weaker, particularly in mt.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

a flipping 10600k is getting much better frametimes then a 9900k.",also i'v spoken to ppl who made the jump from 9900k>12900k and they both had 4k monitors and they noticed less stutters/smoother gameplay on 4k.apparently it was something to do with how many npc there was at one point that was causing it on a 9900k and the 12900k didnt suffer from the issue so even at 4k there's still scenarios where you can get cpu bound in certain games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes it can hit 5ghz on all cores but not specifiedhow long.,"for heavy multi threaded workloads, hitting 5ghz once is not sufficient.",it has to remain at 5ghz for long durations.,which usually doesn't happen.,for 12900k it can hit 5ghz on 2 cores.,but when there is sustained workload it drops to around 3.7 to 4ghz on all cores.,it's all about thermal headroom and process node advantage.,tsmc 5nm is a much better node than intel 7. so it should be able to sustain 4.5ghz all core not beyond that.,so if amd achieves linear scaling in performance then they should get around 10 to 12 % improvement just from the process compared to zen3.,zen3 on tsmc 7nm used to hit the same clocks as intel 7 which is roughly 3.7 to 4ghz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, but if we already know threadrippers should launch very soon with the same core counts as previous generation, and zen 4 should also arrive sooner than expected there is little point in releasing 1500+ $ threadrippers that would get beaten by zen 4 ryzen 9 in multi threading.",it will for sure get badly beaten in single thread since it is using zen 3 cores.,amd is in tricky spot right now.,"i think their original plan was to introduce next core count increase with zen 5 and since zen 4 is all big cores with focus on 3d cache, adding more cores then what they have know will be very expensive for them",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i don't see much value in comparing price vs price unless you go all in with full system cost.,that includes mobo/ram etc.,especially when the amd chips aren't being sold at msrp anymore.,you should go off actual price.,yes intel chips seem to out perform amd's but the way you structured your comparison feels like a gross misrepresentation of reality.,just compare each chip in order.,"intel wins on price and performance i believe, no reason to muddy the waters with ""well if you compare this higher tier chip to this lower tier chip we get massive performance differences""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

intel is doubling e cores next gen though.,wonder what that means for the ryzen 5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
except they are.,"the 5600x and 12600k are the same price in my local market, and while intel motherboards are still considerably more expensive (which is one reason zen 3 is still sort of holding up so far), the performance difference between the two chips is still massive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel are being cheap bastards by not jacking core counts on the i3â€™s, donâ€™t get me wrong, but the i5-13400 will be a mind-meltingly fast budget chip.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"
i am going to buy a cpu later this year, so it will boil down to a choice between raptor v zen 4, will have to see which pulls ahead (gaming for me is the priority)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which is why you should compare it to the 12400 instead.,if the motherboard/ram costs more on the intel then the amd then its not really a actual price comparison cause no one can actually make a functional computer without those new boards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah i get that, but is the ryzen 5 going to get that 3d stacked cache?",it kind of feels like amd is reserving that for the higher core count parts.,they also haven't responded to the i5 11400 yet or the i5 12400.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it all depends on system cost, yesâ€¦ but the 5600x is $100+ cad more expensive than the 12400 here, making it hard to recommend in any case.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that gets reduced in difference when considering mobo and ram costs especially if you go ddr5.,hence why reviewers consistently bring this up in their reviews that it has to be a consideration when evaluating your next purchase.,as far as i'm concerned intel wins on performance and price per performance on every tier at the moment when comparing the same tier vs same tier and including the costs of mobo and ram especially if you stick with ddr4 with the 12000 gen intel.,i don't understand the need to try and weight the numbers so far in intels favor when its already in their favor that their chip is the better purchase unless you have a case where you simply upgrade your existing amd system with a new chip and leave the rest the same.,it is really tunnel vision to look only at the chip msrp and ignoring the rest of what it takes to make a system.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was always under the impression that meteor lake would have the higher ipc gains over raptor lake.,i guess with it being the first multi-chip design (broadwell aside) and if the focus on mobile support is to be believed i guess it makes sense that it wouldn't necessarily have the big ipc jumps over raptor lake.,"i think given all of this i think it's safe to say that amd and intel will be trading the performance crowns with each release, but amd will likely keep the efficiency advantage until lunar lake barring some big screw up on amd's part.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

meteor lake is ""another impressive upgrade, but not as big a deal as raptor lake (+8-15% st, +30-40% mt)"".","if meteor lake has a smaller or even similar st uplift compared to raptor lake, that's pretty disappointing imo.",i was expecting more given the new architecture and new node.,"that said, this is extrapolating a relatively vague statement from a leaker at least a year out from when the product is supposed to launch, so don't put much faith in it.","second takeaway:  sierra forest will have ""more cores than you expect"" (via mlid).","to that, all i can say is it better.","previous rumors claimed it has 128 cores and will launch late 2023. meanwhile, intel confirmed sierra forest for 2024, so instead of a late bergamo competitor it's probably going to compete with bergamo's successor.","greymon has claimed zen 5 will have 192c/384t and 256c/512t options, so unless sierra forest can match that it'll likely fall behind.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think where meteor lake will have it's most impressive upgrade is on integrated graphics.,"battlemage will be out around meteor lake, and it will be mcm.",it would not surprise me if a battlemage chiplet ended up as part of meteor lake with huge increases to performance.,"there is also the possibility of specialized ml hardware to accelerate certain tasks, and you can't forget that meteor lake is going to be on a new node so perhaps there are some big efficiency gains from that and from design changes from redwood cove and crestmont.",even if the ipc gains are not great there is still plenty of room for meteor lake to still be an impressive soc upgrade over raptor lake.,not to mention it's important for intel since it's their first mcm design of this level of complexity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"as others have said, sapphrie rapids already has golden cove in it, and up to a four tile design, but those tiles are a completely different in terms of design then alder lake (the most obvious being they don't contain gracemont).","if your asking if intel might one day, for example, take a bunch of redwood cove tiles that they use for meteor lake and aggregate them to make a xeon soc they way amd does with epyc and ryzen, i would not expect something like that until granite rapids at the earliest, and intel may decide they don't need to and keep creating different tiles for consumer and enterprise socs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
amd's design strategy fits their r&d budget of 4-5 years ago *really* well: with zen 2 they only needed 4 different dies to provide their entire product stack *plus* chipsets.,4!,"(the ccd chiplet, the epyc i/o die which doubles as the tr i/o die, the ryzen i/o die that doubles as the x370 chipset and the trx40 chipset, and the apu).","and only two of those were on the more-expensive-to-design-for n7 process; and the other two were reused for zen 3 (ok, the ryzen i/o die technically went from using glofo 14nm to using glofo 12nm, but the design rules are nigh-identical between the processes).",the chiplets being a mere 77mm^2 (with zen 2 anyway) was a great hedge since it meant that n7 would have to turn out absolutely abysmally to have a defect density high enough to seriously impact yields.,it also gave glofo something to do and saved amd from having to compensate them for not using their 14nm process under their long-running wafer agreement.,"amd were hardly new to mcm packaging, so all told it was a very economical, risk-minimizing approach.","whether that remains the economically superior case at greater market share is a more open question: with more unit sales to amortize design expenses over, it becomes economically easier to tweak the design to optimize for particular markets or optimize the die designs so you can spend more on design and validation teams but in return you get to churn out more cores per wafer since you don't have to laser off as many to create the skus that you want.","there's got to be a point where the economics flip towards more customization, although where exactly that might be i could not say.",> does anyone know if intel has taken alder lake to the server market yet?,"sapphire rapids uses the same golden cove cores as alder lake, rumours suggesting it'll be 56 cores in the top sku.","was supposed to be out in 2022q2, but [the latest roadmap](https://www.anandtech.com/show/17259/intel-discloses-multigeneration-xeon-scalable-roadmap-new-ecore-only-xeons-in-2024) just says ""2022"" so perhaps that's slipping into h2.","gracemont e-cores won't be coming to the server market, although it looks like a successor will form the basis of sierra forest in 2024.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

nh-15 d is the only option here if you consider only air cooling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
never gonna give you up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the best cooler would be the free one since you won't be overclocking.,the most important thing is case air flow.,i have an i5 11400f with stock cooler.,it never goes above 60c when gaming because my case has 4 fans.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have the nh-u12a and it is completely fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't know where this myth comes from for 12th gen. other air coolers will be fine too.,"the u12a is a good balance, for example.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no cinebench r23 throttling?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably from dozens of daily similar threads asking how to cool down 12 gen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you have a 275 dollar budget for a cpu in 2022 youâ€™d be doing yourself a massive disservice by not saving up another 150 and getting a 12th gen and a h670/610 board for not much moreâ€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're burning money for very little performance by trying to upgrade a cpu on such an old socket.,get a 12400f for $180 and an 80-100 h610 or b660 or stretch it to $130 for a good board for $310 total.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ebay my friend.,they are around $160 us right now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i actually have a 6700k that i can sell you!,it was kept under a 140mm water cooler for it's entire life and never saw temps over 50c.,dm me!,it is perfectly fine for gaming now-a-days,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"4.5ghz is the maximum stock all ""p"" core boost speed for the 12600k, so if you're not throttling there is nothing to worry about.",just because your cpu is allowed to draw up to 150w doesn't mean that it will need to draw that much.,fire up occt if you want to see it use 150w haha,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"look in bios for the power settings, maybe your board has set 100w as maximum limit for some reason",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you running a budget b660 motherboard?,check your bios to see if you're running at a limited power spec.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you have a z690 motherboard?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh ok thanks.,i saw that it had a max boost of 4.9ghz on the slide when it was revealed?,"iâ€™m not throttling, i max out at like 60c",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
msi z690 tomahawk wifi ddr4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
doesnt matter here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"4.9ghz is the fastest it will run, if only one core is being used",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it definitely matters because certain b560 motherboards we're incapable of running cpus at intel spec.,i imagine a budget b660 is potentially the cause.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
possibly yeah.,but locked power limits would be the reason here maybe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would look at the 12th gen i7 12800h.,it's much more powerful than previous generation chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you care about ecc?,"one is a low power mobile processor, the other a higher power desktop class part.",with enough cooling the high power part will easily win.,question is a bit strange though.,"the point of the xeon is to get ecc, so if you don't need ecc no reason to consider the xeon over something cheaper.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the xeon w all the way.,"double the cores and threads as the i7, and the higher boost clock (5.3 ghz vs 4.8 ghz) plus the higher tdp (45w vs 35w) means that the xeon should be able to provide similar single core performance, while far surpassing the i7 in rendering and other multi-core intensive workloads.","likewise, the xeon supports error correcting (ecc) memory, which could be helpful to minimize possible errors or crashes during your work.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whats ecc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
something you probably don't need.,why did you pick that xeon?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was looking at laptops and i found an acer conceptd ezel 7 pro and it had xeon w cpu and i was comparing it to the surface studio laptop which had an i7 11 gen. there similar except for a few features.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i see.,in that case i would look for reviews of the two products.,the xeon is much faster but will require much more cooling to sustain that level of performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
okay thank you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
anything other than gigabyte in my opinion.,msi seems to do better than asus with ddr5 however.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which asus maximus?,"the master is, according to reviews, a very good board for overclocking.","if you don't oc, maybe look for cheaper versions which fits your needs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
always asus.,too many doa gigabytes boards and issues lately.,"asus has superior audio quality as well which helps for music, movies and gaming immersion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have a aorus maater z690- not what i wanted, but zero complaints.","($200 off retail)

did a bios update of a bare board and works fine with my g.skill 5600 36 ram at xmp.",oc stability seems good so far and the vrm's stay chilly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i also try the asus maximus formula and i was so depressed cause it was the exact same gigabyte master board but almost 400 dollar more return it for the maximus even more disappointing was worse then the gigabyte for 220 more how its this possible and the gigabyte had better temps but im staying with ryzen just so perfect for another 2 yars,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maximus hero z690,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> the master is, according to reviews, a very good board for overclocking.",any 4 dimm z690 ddr5 board is going to struggle with overclocking.,this isn't a particularly good result: https://www.techpowerup.com/review/gigabyte-z690-aorus-master/14.html - the rtls in particular are complete garbage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
talking about audio quality of an onboard chip.,good joke.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i hadthe master also zero problems ram was xmp6000 the board profile was able to go 6400 suoer smooth boot really fast but i return it got me 5950x for warzone caldera i get smoother frames and higher thats all i play so its a win win 4 me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how did you return 3 expensive motherboards?,you said asus z690 were worse than auros master in what?,my shop asking me which one should i get asus z690 hero or auros master?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"both are great boards, however die master is significantly cheaper and therefore probably the better choice for most people.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i know that.,stuff is still new.,overclocking is never guaranteed.,"even on an older ddr4 board, the oc mileage may vary.",we just have more information for older configuration on what works and what not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its probably just not very popular.,"theres zero benefit of the 12300 over the 12100 or 12400, so those cpus move a ton more volume while the 12300 is deprioritized to devote more silicon to the cpus people should probably be buying.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
try micro center they would know,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"depends on what you use the computer for, if youre doing mad video editing or cpu heavy programs then its probably worth it, if your just playing games you prolly wont even notice the difference.","12th gen is great , i have the 12700kf.",i dont really see myself upgrading for a long time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"an upgrade from one generation to the next is rarely meaningful, but it's also hard/impossible to predict the future.",i'm not sure what kind of answer you expect.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"
for gaming, going to new chip from 12600k won't really make a difference unless you really need 500fps instead of 400fps in esport titles.",12600k will be more than enough for upcoming 4 years.,"consoles hold the cpu intensity of games back, current console are using zen2 cpu at 3.5ghz, that is miles behind a 4.5ghz 12600k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
really doubt it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"from what i understand, the ""double digit performance increases"" for raptor lake is mostly from cramming more of the low power cores in, and a little from higher clocks.","it'll be the same ipc, manufacturing node, etc.",it won't make any difference for gaming that you couldn't achieve now with a better overclock.,meteor lake in 2023 will be the interesting one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i doubt tbh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i experimented with the 11600k and 10900k previously, the 12th gen is way better than those its an actual tangible difference.",the smaller nanometer size chip leads me to believe there will be much better performance down the line though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm in the same boat with a ddr4 12600k system.,i'll only consider a 13700k once it's been out for a while and prices start to drop.,if i can get one at a decent discount i might upgrade to stretch out my z690 system another year or two.,depends on the exact performance gains.,all crystal ball gazing at the moment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how about 8th gen to 13th gen?,i'm hoping it smooths out my vr frames.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably it won't be a huge performance difference but i might still upgrade from i7-12700kf to 13700kf if the price is right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wish i had gone for a 12700k but they were sold out when i was looking to finish my system and get a cpu so settled on 12600k instead.,might make the upgrade to 13700k depending on what the final specs and performance benchmarks are like.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for instance i was getting close to 80 % utilization on 11600k for battlefield 2042, on my overclocked 12700k im down to 25% utilization.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my i know why you're more inclined towards the 12700k?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you should return it because it's such a minor upgrade it's not worth any price.,"it should be ever so slightly better more often than not though unless perhaps it differs in some other way, perhaps one kit has single rank modules and the other dual rank modules?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"return

look up speed to cl charts and don't chase minor upgrades that won't give you any tangible performance uplift

"i googled a bit for washer modding as i didn't really know what that was, and people say to not do that, results are inconsistent and it's dangerous to do",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's 3600 cl 18 and i already returned it, waste of money on almost no performance boost",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your choice but a) it's not dangerous (just be careful not to bend pins) and b) results are great for almost every report,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"please give me some link on how to do that, can't find any appropriate anywhere",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

90â° after ten minutes of r23 isn't unreasonable.,keep in mind i9s are very power hungry and will run warm on pretty much anything short of a massive custom loop.,is it holding boost at these temps?,have you overclocked or are you running multicore enhancement?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do the washer mod it will really drop your temps,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the temp is fine for a stock i9, the score is a bit low though.",around 27k is normal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hey, thanks for replying.",i have done no oc.,no idea whether it is holding boost but i'll check.,seems like the worst-case scenario is poor mounting pressure as the others have commented.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what?,"95â°c with open case, 18â°c ambient and a 360mm aio while running cinebench?","that's not normal or fine at all, with 360mm you should be staying under 90â° even in a closed case with ambient around 25â°c.",so probably bad mounting pressure or bad thermal paste.,(it's pretty usual that companies use some dirt cheap thermal paste for prebuilts),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not true for the 12900k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"360mm aio can cool even 300w cpus and not go over 100â°c, 12900k takes 250w in maximum load so under 90â°c shouldn't be a problem.",also ppl who use 360mm aio on 12900k have temperatures under 90â°c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't think i have to elaborate if you look at the flood related posts since launch of the new gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hi!,thanks to both for your replies.,seems like i'll at least need to verify the thermal paste or the mounting pressure but knowing the aio is at least on is a relief.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you tried returning it back to stock and putting the original drive back in?,"because there is clearly a hardware issue now since you installed the new drive, either damage (even esd) or compatibility issues with the new drive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the higher the resolution the less stress on cpu and more on gpu so if it's great for 1080p then it's greater for 4k.,"the main drawback is high refresh rate gaming, i.e.",above 60fps,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4790k is getting old.,it can't offer 60 fps on ultra quality on top titles.,think red dead redemption 2 or nfs heat.,it was holding back my gpu (radeon 7).,a switch to 10900k got me a big boost - some games even +100% fps (which matters to me as i have a 240 fps monitor).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"8-pin eps connectors are good for 150w, so the 4-pin is really only useful under extreme conditions like ln2 overlooking.",it only contributes another 75w.,"plugging it in won't do anything bad, it's just redundant for regular use.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
agreed.,i had a 4790k for 6 years and sold it last year to recoup the costs of upgrading to ryzen (r7 3700x).,i even got a boost on fps on my 1660ti.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm almost certain i was getting 60+ fps on ultra/high with my overclocked 4790k and 1080ti.,there was no change in frames when i switched to 10700k till i got a 3080.,1080ti and medium overclocked 4790k are a perfect match if not a 2070ti,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am not sure i agree with the last part.,"if that were the case, why put it there at all?","&#x200b;

even on the manual, it says to plug in all connectors to ensure stability

[https://us.msi.com/motherboard/z97-mpower-max-ac/support#down-manual](https://us.msi.com/motherboard/z97-mpower-max-ac/support#down-manual)

&#x200b;

while i know it's not needed to have a ""functional"" computer, having a stable computer might be different.","4790k, i would plug it in regardless.","anything less like an i5 or i3, then yeah you can leave it out i suppose.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
really depends on the setup.,had a 4790k running at 5.1 ghz with cache at 4.7ghz and 2600mhz ram.,i didn't really see any performance gains when upgrading to zen 2.,(gpu was a rtx 2070),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the ultra setting usually will put more strain on the gpu but not much more on the cpu.,where you suffer the most is on the lowest settings/ resolutions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
jesus u are just downvote central,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm sure you were able to get 60fps at ultra on some games, with a powerful enough graphics card you can brute force your way past cpu bottlenecks to an extent.",but with a better cpu you would see a big performance increase on newer games even with a 1080ti.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we do indeed.... i have made many over the years!,"in my younger years i was very much a ""i can save a whole 5 minutes of instruction reading and following by diving in and spending 5 hours trying to figure out why it's not fucking working"" mentality..... many, many instructional minutes saved !",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in the manual on page 31 it says:

> make sure that all the power cables are securely connected to a proper atx power supply to ensure stable operation of the motherboard.",not that you have to plug the extra connector in.,most power supplies won't even have an extra eps connector.,"and as i said before, it's only useful for overclocking, and usually with ln2.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mine was with 2133mhz ram and 4.6ghz (4.5 uncore) on air mind you.,"while in some games the difference was around the single digits, on more modern games (cyberpunk 2077 being the most notorous)i have seen between 15-20% increase.","also, how you managed to find 2600mhz ram on ddr3??",most kits topped out at 2400mhz back then.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it was one rdr2 and odyssey.,i was getting 70 average.,don't know why the down votes for facts but ok lol i was almost upset i upgraded till i got the new gpu.,anyways i fkin love the 4790k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you cannot overclock on b660.,"the 12400f is a ""locked"" processor, you cannot overclock it (unless you go for an expensive b660 board with external clock and stuff).","normally, for overclocking you need a k processor (e.g.",12600k) in a z690 board (e.g.,msi pro z690-a).,"if by ""overclocking"" you mean decent vrm's, the 12400 is a cool chip, pretty much any b660 is good enough for it.","so you'd better focus on the features you want such as ddr4 or ddr5, usb ports, m.2/sata slots, wireless connectivity, etc., in this case.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think the best value b660 motherboard is the cheapest b660 motherboard, but that's probably not what you had in mind, but as i-also-reddit pointed out, none of these parts are ""overclockable"", so you should probably reconsider your needs.","i'd like to add though, that many of the cheaper b660 motherboards doesn't come with a pcie 5.0 slot it would seem.","if that's important or not, depends, but i went for one with 5.0 myself.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"depending on the pricing in your region, i would say asus prime b660 plus would be the best bang for buck motherboard and that's the one i paired my i5 12400 with.","but if you don't care about the feature set, then you should go for the cheapest b660 you can find.","there won't be any difference in performance and should be able to take your ram to at least 3500 mhz on gear 1, 3600 mhz if you get lucky.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it depends on what you want.,for example i believe the cheapest entry to pcie 5.0 is the asrock h670 riptide at around $150.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cheap b660 boards lack pcie5.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
anything from asrock.,bought an asus b660m-a ddr4 that had glitchy fuzzy graphics on boot and returned it.bought an asrock b660 rs pro.,"the asrock was alot cheaper and had better build quality, the asus mobo flexed alot, the asrock feels sturdier and it was even cheaper at sgd182 vs sgd 290.",(i got it on amazon for sgd 195 without warranty).,the only downside i can see with the asrock is that it did not have a usb c port.,"only a usb c header, other than that it works perfectly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
alright that helps a lot.,thanks man,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
alright thanks a lot man,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's a lot cheaper because it has terrible power limits.,never ever buy asrock mbs in the cheaper section.,they bungled the last time and have terrible power limits this time as well.,even manually changing them from bios doesn't help at all.,it's cheaper because of these reasons lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well to be fair i own 3x asrock intel mobos .sandy bridge,ivy bridge and alder lake i run all my components on stock (never updated bios before) and never had any problems.",all of them have never broken down.,the cheapo h61 mobo i bought back in 2013 still works beautifully,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm sure they work beautifully and have not broken down.,that's not my point.,"my point is in the current lineup, as was the case in previous generation as well for asrock massively handicaps its product because of these power limits in terms of performance.",a little bit more money and msi actually have really good offering or two with b660m-a version alongside the slightly more expensive bazooka or mortar.,gigabyte aorus has decent option too.,i'll even recommend the cheap asus ones before cheaper asrock ones and that's despite asus really getting a solid mb done after a certain price point.,the vrm on asrock is kinda iffy too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

first world problems!,iâ€™d stay off the junk for at least 3 months.,usually when you get hired they will tell you about drug testing policy.,"would think if they going to do it, they would have done it before they gave you a position.",some jobs may have random test done or at certain intervals.,did you google about drug trust at intel?,most companies will post about their testing requirements,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if i'm not mistaken ""undervolting"" falls under the general category of ""overclocking"" (according to intel).","so for undervolting you'd need a z690 board and an unlocked k processor, i think.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just don't see the point in undervoling a 12th gen makes no sense at all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have core voltage in bios on b660m-plus d4, and i've adjusted the number (offset) and haven't gotten any message or warning.","i'm a bit unsure about how to verify the change though, since the values fluctuates with load.",running windows 10. don't know this xtu tool.,"anyway, i assume that if i have the option in bios, it works?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
buy z690.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most b660 can undervolt any cpu.,just run some benchmark with hwinfo on background and check cpu package power max.,apply undervolt on bios and run the test again.,"if package power is lower, it's working.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i can modify voltage on asus b660i with a 12700k (went with k cause 12700 was the same price).,if that option is available for non-k i donâ€™t know.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it makes sense for something like a 12900k to reduce heat and power consumption without any noticeable drop in performance.,"it doesnâ€™t make much sense at all with a 12400, because i doubt itâ€™s consuming much power or getting hot enough to be concerned.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
try an sff case with a quiet cooler.,"also, full load above body temperature is too hot.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i mean, you could in theory verify by cranking the undervolt to the point of certain instability and see if it crashes...

pretty unorthodox though",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good to know.,i thought undervolting was locked under overclocking settings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have the same board and cpu.,how did you manage to do it in yours?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i myself have a 12900k and have no issues with heat at all using a nzxt 240mm cooler i just don't see the point in undervoling if you can afford the chip you should be able to afford the  cooler the 240mm is the the cheapest cooler and it does the job pretty well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
who knows how it differs between mobo makers though?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it sounds like undervolting *is* locked.,it's unlocked for /u/infinite_beta because he has a k cpu and it's locked for op because he does not.,"so it's tied to the cpu, not the chipset.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ai tweaker->cpu core/cache voltage in bios,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it isn't always a question of affording the cooler.,it could be an effort to cram it into an itx case that won't accept a dual 120mm rad.,"if op is trying to run an air cooler in a case with limited space, reducing the waste power from the 12400 by 20 w could be the difference between the build being viable or not.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
though the performance difference is significant between 11th and 12th gen but for light office use and web browsing you won't see any difference at all.,unless you're doing something which requires very high multi threaded workload you're good.,then again it also depends which processor you have currently.,an i3?,if yes then which one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
soooo...... for light usage is not really worth to upgrade from 1 gen to another.,mayb if it's more than 2 or more gens apart u can consider it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you should see a better battery life due to the e cores present in 12th gen. outside of that not so much of a difference in office workloads.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

12th gen is newer and will be much better once options start rolling in.,currently we only know about flagship 12900hk numbers.,they are good (as it should be.,newer products) but not everyone needs desktop performance in a laptop.,now the fun stuff.,12th gen units roll in mean 11th gen units will see a discount.,and honestly a laptop is always a compromise.,so pick the one that fits you the best.,"chrome book to netbook* to game machine, apple, amd, or intel can all do office tasks.",but they are all priced and built different.,so my recommendation is compare and buy the one with the best build and the features you need (plugs/adapters).,i personally like dell despite the hate they receive.,they provide good support and parts for repair are easy to come by.,good units for business and easy to manage.,"https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-budget-laptops

id go 12400 as you still have a viable upgrade either up to the top of the 12th gen or to the 13th gen where the 10700k to a 10900k/11900k isn't worth it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if you can get 10700k 20% cheaper than 12400 then only buy it.","else 12400. 

both cpus are good.",you won't notice difference.,try for non f. igpu is good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes i'll go for ddr4 b660m mobo if i were to pick 12400.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i know a lot of people mention ""future proof"".","but,  in reality when pcie 5 or ddr 5 starts to get fully utilized, well by then i would start to upgrade vs now.","if you're going for 12400, well, if you want to get the best use outta this setup, what do you think buyers will do?","buy ddr 5, which isn't that important right now for gaming.","anyways, i have 10700k, and my friend has 12400, and my system which ended up being about $150buks cheaper was outperforming his 12400 by at least 18% for gaming like cyberpunk.","i say go for 10700k, save that money, once ddr 5 and pcie 5 start to get fully utilized by then 14th gen will come out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol pci-e 3.0 is fine.,2.0 held up for years.,youâ€™d still need a rtx 3060ti or better to bottleneck 2.0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
he said 10700k... did you mean 10th gen?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"don't think so ...

12400 all core 4 ghz, ipc advantage in games close to nothing 10400vs 11400 < 5 fps, 10400 vs 12400 5<>10 fps 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0_ifevgu7q

but the 10700k can boost to 4,9 ghz all core.",but as i found on another post the gigabyte aorus pro b560m has one m2 slot not usable with a 10gen cpu so that would fail it for me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, i forgot to mention i'll be using pcie 3 together with ddr4 in my post..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then you might as well just go for 10700k.,i got mine during its original release date.,"i am able to go 5.2ghz on all cores, and usually hover around 1.32v for gaming.",https://imgbb.com/jx7fgf3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"mine works just great (3080 not ti)
corsair rm750",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have 650-g seasonic psu and 9900k 5ghz and 200w power draw on full load 3080ti is msi suprim x with 400w default bios anf 450 max i belive.,form wall i draw about 550w average when cpu and gpu get heavy load like 3dmark when prime95 and furmark running then i probably coud max out psu but so far its great.,psu fan is a bit loud since i have custom loop with mora 420 radiator.,also 3080ti u can undevolt and oc thats what i did its cooler and more peformance.,1000w psu on that cpu yours will be sufficent and with headroom for oc so u dont worry about psu and it will also be silent.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
undervolt both components and you're golden.,you shouldn't run into issues unless a big spike when oc or your psu degrades over time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've got a 12700k and 3070 ti on a seasonic core gm-650.,"i know that's much less power, but i overclocked both of them as well as my ram to get a ""legendary"" score in 3d mark time spy.",nvidia is recommending beefier power supplies for ampere than they ever have with previous generations given the listed tdp.,you have nvidia's recommended wattage.,you don't have anything to worry about.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12900k + 3080 ?,"in this case,its great thanks.i dont mind going with a 3080 instead of ti,i think i will really come down to whats the cheaper card i can buy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i know nvidia sugested a min 750w but i was affraid that the 12900k was gonna eat to much power,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i know,sadly i already ordered the 750w variant",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes 3080 and 12900k.,everything works fine i undervolted them after several months of use to reduce temperature.,but psu was always enough,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they both consume about 580w without mods under load (340w gpu and 240w cpu),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you are only gaming, the 12900k is actually the most efficient cpu on the market.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
750w will not be problem it does not mean maximum power.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

do you have any idea how much it consumes while gaming ?,"pc part picker says that it can consume 735 w ,thats why i\`m a litlle bit scared",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"great,thanks for the help",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"one last question,do you keep multi core enhancement on ?",and do you think the uhd 770 are worth overcloking untill i can get a dgpu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"same, nh-15d i had about 75 c battlefield 2042 and several cores 100 c in cinebench.",after undervolting it never goes beyond 89 c in cinebench,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i keep it at default

i just checked, with undervolt while playing cpu eats 229 watts and gpu 224 watts so its ~455 watts total.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i had the same problem, it's a bug in the recent intel gpu drivers which were totally nonfunctional for me.",see if there's an update available or revert to an older version.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol they have such issues with their drivers and still they think it'll be fine to release actual graphics cards.,"so please no one preorder an intel gpu, wait for reviewers to test if the drivers are without major problems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i had 64gb of ram, but some applications were leaking several gb/s so i could still only run windows barely long enough to uninstall the driver before windows would become unresponsive.",it's a pretty insane bug to ship in a real production driver.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's not even related to windows integrity.,intel gpu have had issues with memory leaking for a long time and they claimed that they fixed them with a driver update last month.,but it looks like they didn't actually fix it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
download windows 11 installer.,"run it while running windows to install on top of your os, it will keep your files and apps in place but reinstalls windows 11. it has resolved a lot of my customers issues especially ones that upgraded from 10 to 11.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
true and i thought that they were saying windows 10 was going to be the last version of windows.,why couldn't they just add the windows 11 theme on windows 10 and let people choose what theme they want giving people more choices?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i have pentium e2200 from 2007, using it since 2009, and believe or not it still do well for web browsing and consuming media, it struggles sometimes for sure but that's mostly due to the lack of ram as i only have 2gb and unable to add more thanks to the limitation of my board, swapping it out right now with another one to add more ram is extremely pointless especially with how ridiculously expensive lga 775 boards are this days, still, despite that i can still open 30+ tabs using chrome with little to no lagging most of the time, there's only one local online store i frequent to check the prices of pc parts that lags a lot, hardly any other site does except for those gaming sites, probably, but for sure when gaming, and the only things i'm sure it'll still struggle with even with more ram is playing 720/1080p 60fps and higher than 1080p resolution videos on yt or even offline for the latter one, and x265 + av1 at 1080p, i have not tried the last one but i can assume it would, i do think i had some short videos but i'm not sure about that, however, 480p plays perfectly fine using mpc-be, but with x265 i can still play 480/720p videos with 0 stuttering as long as the bitrate is low, i have not tried videos with high bitrate to be sure, but even at 1080p, using mpc-be with filters it can play videos with not too high bitrate with just a bit of lagging but with audio stuttering, at extremely low bitrate of 1mbps or less there is 0 issues whatsoever, i can even video edit or encode anything as long as i'm willing to withstand the stuttering while editing and the painstakingly rendering and encoding times which i'm obviously not willing to although i did at times because i had not choice but to do.",bottom of the line is that if my ancient cpu is holding pretty well with basics even after all this time then i'm willing to bet that yours will still be doing great well into the 2030s.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have an i5-4690k and it works fine.,i can't upgrade to windows 11 cleanly but i don't see any need to.,windows 10 will be supported for some time to come because of all the machines running it.,i know intel is counting on people upgrading but it will be slow.,if intel gives me more features to upgrade to maybe i would consider it however just adding cpus is boring.,i want them to do more audio processing and interface with iot devices.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
id say its still good for 3-4 years,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

so long you'll be able to get something much faster almost for free by the time it's no longer sufficient.,make an experiment and post the results later,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"another 10 years for basic stuff, it should be able to handle gaming at 1080p very well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tbh you only know that something is slow if you've used something faster,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you're using linux and have an ssd you can make swap memory so that when you run out of ram it automatically uses swap instead so your pc doesn't crash and continues to handle tasks such as media playback.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what do you mean an experiment?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have had a 9900k desktop in the past and i have an i7 10870h laptopâ€¦

keep using it until it runs out of juice and report back when that happens?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh.,my experience has been a bit different but then that could just be me.,i have a desktop with a 7700k (@ 4.9ghz) and a 1050ti.,i used to use it for everything.,and still use it a lot.,i also have a laptop with a 8550u .,both have ssds.,i dont game on my laptop.,"in web browsing and stuff, i feel the laptop is much more sluggish.",idk why,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i7 12700. more cores and cache mean better frame stability ( 1% and 0.1%) in games and better results in multithreaded tasks.,"oc demand strong cooling solution even on i5, and at least some knowledge, and if you had it you would know that there is way to overclock non-k cpus with some motherboards.","so, clearly, i7 12700 is best choice in this situation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"12600k if you want to overclock, 12700 if you want the extra cores, threads and cashe and don't give a damn about overclocking, it also consumes less power if i'm not wrong so overall it got it all over the 12600k except for overclocking but even that is possible with some boards.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oc?,"if you are inclined, may i suggest undervolting as the new way forward.","get the 12700k, undervolt it and get cooler temps, higher clocks and better all round performance than a 12700.

but if you are concerned about budget, then get the 12700 and a budget 660 board with ddr4.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"12700 for sure, not even a question, because:

1. can save money on the motherboard.",price of a b660 motherboard is much lower than z690's.,"2. come on... i7 is called i7 for a reason... even you overclock your i5, an overclocked i5 won't beat a normal, non-overclock i7.","(unless you real very great at that, or you're lucky and get a very nice i5 cpu for your extreme overclocking)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fries or burgers?,(also no context),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on what you want to do with it.,for gaming maybe 12600k and for tasks which need more cores 12700. there is no easy answer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"12700 all day unless youâ€™re someone who like tinkering, undervolting/oc.",go for 12600k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i got the i5 12600k as it has the highest oc potential, around 10-12% among k series 12gen and was also cheaper in my case.",also the games that don't leverage more than 6 cores can get more performance out of an oc-d i5 12600k however in the future more games will probably leverage more cores so the 12700 might gain a slight advantage.,"overcloaking the 12700 would probably yield the best performance but it is mainly supported on ddr5 platforms so it will be overall more expensive and hacky, not to mention intel might patch it at some point.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"undervolting is the new overclocking, so 12600k if you want to tinker, 12700 if you want a b660 mobo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that 12600 is an amazing chip!,they are fast out of the box and even faster with a little bump!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

12600 is essentially throwing money imo.,a 12400 is the same cpu with lower clocks tho they have a worse igpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea iâ€™m at my 5 year upgrade cycle so i always go big so iâ€™m good for a while!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

wtf.,you didn't put your thermal paste on properly.,there's no cooling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is too high bro.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah you're thermal throttling.,hwmonitor should list that as a perfcap reason.,i would recommend a new cooler.,even something cheap like an arctic freezer 34 should be way better than stock.,"and for the record, better thermal paste isn't going to make the stock cooler better.",it simply doesn't have enough surface area to properly cool a power hungry chip like the 10700.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i used the dot method and used enough to ensure even coverage... used corsair tm30 performance thermal paste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
any idea why it would be idling high?,"house is actively cold, sub 70 right now.",thermal paste is evenly spread.,using just the stock cpu cooler but it shouldn't be that bad right?,used corsair tm30 performance thermal paste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"it can stream games easily, the i5 and 3060 has the functionality to do that",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks.,because i was torn between buying a tuf dash 15 with an i511300h + 3060 or an rog g14 with a ryzen 7 5800x + 3060. some people tell me i canâ€™t stream with 4 cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you shouldnâ€™t.,donâ€™t buy an 11300h laptop if you wanna stream high end games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
go with the g14,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you could stream with 4 cores but it's not ensuring it'll be good

if it's the basic discord streaming to a server yadda yadda whatever i wouldn't say it'd be too bad but anything more intensive, i'd just recommend more processing power like a 6 core or 8 core",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
shouldnâ€™t what?,sorry.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh.,iâ€™ll just stream it on discord and nowhere else.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in fact mostly iâ€™ll do it on facebook.,itâ€™s just for me and my friends.,i am not even good at gaming hahaha.,just wanna try new stuff out that is why i wonâ€™t spend too much money.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
shouldnâ€™t use a quad core to stream.,modern games use a four core eight thread cpu up pretty well so adding the extra load of streaming will tank your performance.,for streaming you shouldnâ€™t be getting less than 6 cores bare minimum.,8 is recommended,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh then well you're alright

when i still had my i3 10100 + rx 570 pc i managed to stream gta 5, metro exodus and bo4 pretty easily with little to no issues to discord (mostly down to the fact my 570 was just handling stream encoding along with rendering and my i3 was pretty much holding discord open along with the game) so in your case i'd say you'd be pretty alright",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then it doesn't really matter much.,you can offload the streaming to the 3060 with nvenc anyways.,so the laptop is fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh so i canâ€™t use it even if i set the graphics to medium?,yeah i was planning on playing cyberpunk and assassinâ€™s creed valhalla other than rdr2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

well i donâ€™t know what that is but iâ€™ll google it.,ðÿ˜ thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it'll run fine.,but streaming uses cores or nvenc if ur gpu supports it.,the 5800 is a better option overall,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wouldnâ€™t try.,i mean yes if you turn down the settings enough itâ€™s possible but youâ€™d have to really turn the settings down.,"if itâ€™s like $100-200 more to get a 8 core, get it well worth the money.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thank you.,i am actually googling about nvenc as i was given the same advice here.,i find it really helpful.,also out of context rtx has this feature (although not available in all games) called dlss that also seems to make fps better.so i think iâ€™ll be fine with the tuf dash.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

how much is vcore and frequency when high temp happens in prime?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the  spikes are likely from the small fft portions of the test which tend to create a lot of heat.,"this is rarely seen in most usage scenarios, however, so your current setup should be fine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"frequencies are maxed (4.7 and 3.6 for p and e cores, which should be from avx offset iirc), vcore is at 1.27\~ by coretemp.","i changed out some of my case fans and the core temps were down 4-5 degrees across the board, i ran some of the other tests and it is the small fft portion that gets rough, but it handled a test with just that fine",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just tested it, you're exactly right, i changed out half my case fans (computer store didn't have another set) for higher rpm higher pressure and i can feel the air moving and the temps dropped about 5 degrees, thank you for your comment",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,i can do small fft's maximum about 1.24v without temperature throttle triggering.,i have 2x240 and 3x360 fattish rads only for cpu.,"my 12700k requires 1.232v for 4800mhz, so that's what i'm using for prime small.",only using that for loadline level and ac\_ll adjustments stability testing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"90c and below, haswell is a very hot architecture if i recall correctly.",obviously cooler is better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
^(mine idles mid to high 30s depending on the room.,with a light overclock it hits high 90s in cinebench.,have a noctua u14s on it.),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you use it for work, jumping to a new 12th gen platform would probably be a worthwhile investment.",12th gen 12700k or 12900k with a ddr4 z690 motherboard would be a good jump in performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was going to do the exact same thing.,x99 with 5930k.,"was going to pop in a nvme ssd, new gpu, and a 6950x from china.",i actually got all those parts last summer.,but then i broke my ankle before doing the upgrade and wasnâ€™t able to even physically access the system.,"and then while using rdp it stopped working suddenly in the fall, and without being able to get to it to troubleshoot (my guess was power supply or motherboard), i decided to just cut my losses and get a new 12th gen system.",turns out the gpu failed.,but i kept going with the 12th gen build.,"now that i know whatâ€™s wrong with it i do plan on finishing the upgrade, but i kinda need to find a new gpu for it, since i used the 6700 xt iâ€™d acquired for it in the 12th gen, and the only other video card i have laying around is a x1950 with a failing fan.",edit: didnâ€™t answer your question.,"if itâ€™s cheap enough and your current system is doing okay, but youâ€™d like a little more speed, sure, go ahead if you get a good deal on the cpu.","but donâ€™t expect miracles, because itâ€™s still an old system.",i moved up to a 12900k with ddr5 andâ€¦.,itâ€™s a joy to use compared to the old system.,"and iâ€™m doing 4k animation on it, so my demand are pretty high.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not worth keeping.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you could try to get a xeon too.,x99 is the last consumer platform to support xeon cpus as well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was thinking along the same lines as you.,"grab a 6950x, increase the memory, add another ssd, you, know the basics.","but, ......and its a big ""butt""...the graphics card.","if you play games ( or plan to ) on a current gen gpu, unfortunately our x99 systems are just to weak.","there would be a massive cpu bottleneck, (gpu will be waiting on the cpu) and we would not be getting the most out of our graphics cards.",today's graphic cards are so much faster than just a few years back.,"if overclocking the cpu to 4ghz is an option, i'd love to hear if this will remove most of the bottleneck.","i'm going by stock speeds for the 5960x/6950x, so i can not answer or give a solid yes/no if you overclock an x99 system, and the bottleneck remains.","i'd love to upgrade to the 6950x, overclock it to 4.3ghz, and put in a rtx 3080 / 3090, but i'm not sure that's feasible for use x99 users.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"prices are not as bad as i'd thought for a 12900k & a decent mobo either, maybe time to move on as you say!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>those 1660v3's are pretty inexpensive at 80 something dollars and overclock as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a non-k chip on a z series board is essentially a waste.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the z series board would allow you to adjust vccsa voltage on a non k sku.,so if you really want to push your memory overclock that may appeal.,otherwise z series isn't buying you anything in your case.,the z690-a would get you an extra type a port on the rear panel and two more sata ports over the tuf h670.,if that doesn't matter to you then by all means grab the tuf h670 of you want the better wifi.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
msi z690-a is probably the best of that.,"thing is, itâ€™s kind of a stripped z690 compared to what it could be, while the others are kind of loaded up to the max which gives a similar feature level.","the asus h670 is a very similar feature set to the z690-a, but 7 rear usb ports is the suck.",i certainly donâ€™t see any benefits to it over the z690-a which already has a strong good reputation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if 690 is same price, grab that, as one day in the near future.. these 12genn will be a thing of the past and u can buy a k chip for next to nothing..

&#x200b;

non k chips seem to sell well due to the thought they cannot overclock.. hense the idea they are still quality bits.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea as i thought.,"thing is, several z690 are the same price as the b660/h670 boards im interested in.",that would make the z690 the better choice in this case i guess?,since it does get abit increased connectivity and pci4 lanes compared to h670.,"msi z690-a - 200

gigabyte z690 gaming x - 200

h670 tuf - 200

b660 tuf - 200



in this case the z690 makes most sense i suppose?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
didn't they say that the vccsa/vccio are locked in the processor this time?,for all the non-k skus.,you do get the option for vccsa in b660 and h670 but they don't work because of the lock.,https://www.reddit.com/r/intel/comments/sluk4z/psa_12th_gen_non_k_skus_have_locked_vccsa_voltages/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks, i didnt know that.",sadly i have this kit for a time.,"it shows as samsung b die in cpu-z so i was happy at first when i saw that, 
but its a lower bin kit and doesnt oc for shit on my previous tries with a ryzen 3600 (ripjaws 3200 cl16 2x16gb)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if it really can adjust the vccsa then it is going to benefit, especially when non-k alder lake seems to be set at some 0.95v?",and 3600 ram often won't run,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if the z690 board has the connectivity you want, then go for it.","when you aren't overclocking but are spending $200 on a board, for a locked cpu, the performance will be there regardless of what you board you buy, it all comes down to i/o, lanes, rbg, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it won't matter.,"vccsa/vccio are locked into the processor, not the lower series motherboards.",just go with the board that suits your needs and costs less.,be it b660 or h670 or z690.,https://www.reddit.com/r/intel/comments/sluk4z/psa_12th_gen_non_k_skus_have_locked_vccsa_voltages/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea i will choose between the gigabyte and the asus then.,connectivity is more then i need on both tbh.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"looking at the specs, b660 tuf is definitely a no go.",h670 tuf has the most m.2 pcie 4.0 x4 and looks pleasing as well.,rest all specs were almost the same.,"if you are gonna keep it for a couple of years, i would definitely suggest you to go with the h670 tuf.",you can never have enough m.2 slots lol.,"to be honest, there won't be any performance difference between a b660 and a z690.",i have 12400 running on a b660.,"in the starting, there was difference of 1-2% vs the online reviews.","but once i installed some samsung b-die with tighter timings, the difference disappeared, and i realized that kits these reviewers use are top notch to get the best scores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the one thing im worried with with the asus is lack of temp sensors (from previous experience)

(i like to set my case fans to the pci-ex16 sensor so they ramp up with gpu abit)

the product page does however show some sensor being there it looks like (hard to judge from marketing pictures lol).",but now im doubting wether it was just locked out in bios to run fans from it.,"iirc my previous asus board only allowed to run fans from cpu or chipset/mb sensor (b450-f)



basically im still between the z690 gaming x or the h670 tuf (same pricing).","the z690 does have a proper black pcb from gb as opposed to my b660 gaming x.

then some marginal things, asus brings wifi, nicer rgb control.",the gb has more luxurious audio and much nicer bios fan control (its moot with my external dac and wireless stuff),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
short answer: yes.,the 12400f will run laps around the 3770k.,i just upgraded from a 4770k to a 12600k and the difference in gaming and multitasking is huge.,my 1070ti now stays at 99% utilization while my cpu chills at around 20-30%.,also my 1% lows have improved significantly.,"go for it, specially for open world multiplayer shooters such as battlefield, battlefront, etcâ€¦",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ran a 1070 with 3770k and going to a 3700x was a huge difference, you'll notice a difference just in normal windows usage with boot times everything just feels more ""snappy"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just check your gpu utilisation in games... i suppose that at 1440p you're probably gpu bottlenecked more often than not,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks.,why did you go with 12600k?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you play in 1080p or 1440p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i built the pc just when the first 12th gen cpus came out and had been following this one in particular for months.,just reading the specs i knew right away it was going to be the cpu for me in the lineup.,"still today with these slightly newer 12400, 12500 and 12600 out on the market, i wouldâ€™ve gone with the 12600k because of the:

- higher stock base / oc frequency
- higher igp
- e-cores
- oc capabilities in case it is needed in the future.","they can hit +5ghz across all p-cores easily and 4ghz across all e-cores
- integraded graphics on this cpu are crazy good.",and it is very good to have it in case i want to sell my gpus and wait a few days for a good deal on a new one.,"also if i want to completely remove the gpu when the pc gets older, never hurts.","also they are designed in a way that they can help your dedicated gpu in some tasks such as adobe premiere, which i use a lot for work.","in general, i think the 12600k is the best cpu within the 12th gen lineup.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as far as i see it's not far from 12400f in terms of performance in games, correct me if i'm wrong :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1440p ultrawide.,3440x1440p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the elaborate answer!,"good reasoning indeed, though i am still not convinced about paying $110 more for 12600k... especially given the gaming benchmarks which show almost identical fps results.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
agreed on 12600k.,"made the jump from a 2500k, 1070 super, and 16gb ram last week.","i was content, but motherboard failed and forced my hand.",i got a good 10 years out of it.,"ended up with 12600k ($240), msi pro z690 ddr4 ($220), and 32gb of cl18 rip ripjaw.",best buy price matched micro center and had the mobo in stock as well.,ram was about $120 or so.,opted for noctua redux  and temps are 40 at idle.,"load is around 75.

all other parts i transferred over.",its pretty impressive how much quicker and responsive the computer is.,my biggest headache has been windows11.,"between open shell and some other modifications, its fairly close to the windows 7 experience...

upgrade your mother boards bios as soon as you can.",fixed a lot of bugs for me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for pure gaming the 12400f represents the sweet spot probably.,"i donâ€™t like renouncing to integrated graphics though so iâ€™d still recommend the 12400.

still a very solid choice man.",hope i managed to help you in the decision process.,enjoy your pc!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 12700k... it's cheaper and has an igp.,"the 12700kf is the same cpu just with no igp, you'd be foolish to spend more for less.","also buying an 'f' sku because no igp=better oc is an old wives tale, it isn't true",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
picked one up yesterday,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the difference is $13 and you made a post over this?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
literally just buy whichever is cheaper.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

try this last suggestion:

\- go to start and type device manager

\- select network adapters

\- uninstall it

\- follow the instructions above  --> clicking autorun.exe --> if the option to remove the driver is displayed select it, else just continue with the installation.","\-once installed go back to device manager

after a minute or so the connection should return, else try restarting your pc.",hopefully this does the trick,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i honestly couldn't tell you, i've been desperately trying to figure it out i can't find anywhere that gives me any indication other then the device manager telling me it only has 200 series drivers installed, it's an alienware aurora r8 and i know they use custom mass produced boards as it's a prebuilt.",but now where can i find any information beyond that?,"hence all my confusion, the idea was buy a low end and just fiddle with it to learn but i just can't figure this part out?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you have a more powerful gpu, the 8th gen can kind of hold you back in terms of minimum fps.",if you are still using a 60hz monitor then it should be fine.,it really depends on what you need if for though.,"&#x200b;

i plan on upgrading when the next amd platform comes out.",since i play a lot of vr the minimum fps is a big deal for me and is holding me back in a lot of newer titles.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in that case it has a z370 chipset.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

awesome so if i wanted the put in i7 8700 it will be ok?,do you know why it's not showing up as the 300 series in device manger?,is there something i'm overlooking?,appreciate it by the way bud,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"dude that's a handy little program, nice one thanks",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"12700 will be faster at multithreaded workloads, even if the 12600k is overclocked to hell and back.",gaming might be a tie.,"some titles might like an overclocked i5 better, some might like the extra cores better, some others, the extra cache of the i7, and so on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"locked 12c/20t vs unlocked 10c/16t, take the former if you don't want to overclock and if you need the extra cores and threads.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12700 is the better chip.,"more cache, more cores, higher frequency, better binning.",obviously you can overclock the 12600k but without extreme overclocking youre not really going to pass the 12700 except in st but not by a meaningful amount.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it'll be huge.,even an i3 12th gen would be an upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 12900k imo is really overkill.,the 12700kf should be more than enough.,"also, do you plan on overclocking?","if not, look at the 12700f.","if yes, you may need a better cooler to push it farther",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you will need the lga 1700 bracket for your noctua.,amazon has them for $10.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the performance boost is going to be absolutely nutty.,whatever rough cinebench r20 numbers i could find indicate that the 12700k is about 4.41x as fast as the stock 4790k (which is similar to your chip) in multicore.,"since yours is clocked 10-20% higher than a stock 4790k, iâ€™d expect the 12700k to be about 3.75-4x as fast.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
awesome :d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am actually planning on overclocking but will try and see if my good ol' noctua can keep up to start with.,"if not, i'll go for water-cooling :)

i'm thinking the same thing when comparing the 12700 and the 12900.","&#x200b;

"i don't think anyone (even gelsinger) believes the plan is going to go the way it's laid out, or that the projected numbers are real.",that said it has to be done.,it absolutely sucks that intel let things get this far out of hand before turning things round.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel has a world class design and product team.,the recent 10nm products show that they are still formidable there.,think a bit how late 10nm process was and how it trapped all the products and how delayed they are and yet still how competitive they are to apple on tsmc 5nm and amd on  7nm shows you how terrible the silicon technology and manufacturing side has held the company back.,imagine the product team unleashed to us tsmc 3nm instead of being handcuffed by idm think and stuck on a intel process!,"what is pat doing, he is plowing huge sums of money into the weakest thing at intel, the same division that has dragged intel down, does that sound sane or logical ?","the leading edge semiconductor business went from dozens of players to just two, samsung and tsmc.","i donâ€™t consider intel in the same camp anymore after the 10nm debacle and slips on 7 and the rebranding, all signs of total disarray that hasnâ€™t yet recovered.","they chances of coming back are slim even considering  the  the hope by plowing tens of billions in rd and twenty billion plus in capex, but really they canâ€™t ever get back to relevance.","they are trying compete  on a base of three hundred million x86, against competitors that have double the capex and customers like apple, mediatek, amd, nvidia and a huge established ecosystem that allows the competitor a scale of a billion chip base  or more than 3x volume.",that scale and volume means faster yield learning and larger economies of scale for lower cost.,these are simple facts that no amount of spin can change.,these are the economics of leading edge semiconductors manufacturing and there is no shortcut even with government subsidies.,"intel trying to do leading edge is a flashback to gf trying to do catch up to leading edge with only amd as customer, economics simply canâ€™t justify it.",intel missed the opportunity about 10 years ago at 22nm to do this pivot of foundry and scale from a position of leadership.,simply put tsmc with their 30 year+ developed ecosystem and trillion dollar valuation companies supporting them with huge volumes blew by them.,intel was so inward arrogant looking they missed the pivot and canâ€™t recover without total failure from their competitors.,sure they may catch on technology but the five year gap and lack of scale and ecosystem will drag them down.,"they are doing a hail mary, likely hood of business success is low like a hail mary, far more prudent to pursue a high probability strategy which they seem to proud to consider.",pat was the one that could have pivoted with credibility but strangely decided to try and have intel fight on three fronts of which two he is certain to lose on and think he can come out on top?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
actually two companies at the leading edge and one hoping to make a comeback by 2025c letâ€™s see.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
product plans are shackled by having to wait for process to catch up.,but process teams need the guaranteed volume from product team to justify investment and get process learning.,"a virtuous cycle hampering product while amd, nvidia, apple, mediatek donâ€™t have this issue they go to the best manufacture for ppac and ttm.",intel has a fundamental strategy problem that no one really address because we all hope they can come back.,"the odds off them getting to process parity and cost parity are slim and requires stumbles by the competitors, and why the stock is dead money till you see the competitors fail",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the product plan isn't that unrealistic.,the revenue numbers are if they don't hurry up and get production going.,even if they get product out they still need to convince people to buy it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>intel missed the opportunity about 10 years ago at 22nm to do this pivot of foundry and scale from a position of leadership.,[intel tried exactly this 8 years ago](https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/pdf/foundry/sunit-rikhi-2014-idf-presentation.pdf).,unfortunately this failed so dismally very few people remember it was a thing.,"the most notable outcome was acquiring the showpiece customer, altera.",that slide deck has more than passing similarity to the current foundry pitch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes agreed.,the likelihood that the competition will falter early in the battle seems low given the stakes and the fact that they're all coming off wins.,that doesn't bode well for intel and i think it's going to come down to how much pain the board and investors are willing to suffer in the climb back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
granite rapids is delayed.,gpus are delayed.,"intel is projecting client side growth that no one else, analysts or corporations are projecting.","meanwhile theyâ€™re fighting to upgrade while competition is at the top of their game, intel admits itâ€™s going to take a very long time to pay off the investments they are making now.",the vast majority of market analysts have downgraded intel stock.,all that needs to happen is the competition decides to unroll the cache of tech theyre holding back now to put the intel plan into a tailspin.,"if intel was over the hump of process modernization and culture renewal, plus they had reached parity with the competition theyâ€™d be ready for the fight.",itâ€™s going to take them 3-5 years to be bringing something concrete and believable to the table.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes they failed miserably at foundry when they actually had something of value to sell.,they successfully fooled a bunch of companies to take the bait only to ruin them all.,the dna for foundry is really different and intel core people simply donâ€™t have it.,i am skeptical pat with his top down religious arrogance and few new hires will make foundry even come close to work.,"it will end similar to the last time, maybe even worse given all the promises.","even with tower they simply have an uncompelling  offering and their leadership nodes are years out and will most certainly be high cost with significant pdk gaps to what the other foundries offer, the idm baggage is going to drag the foundry side and the foundry will drag down the idm, the two arenâ€™t complimentary but distractions where they donâ€™t have the resources to do one, let alone both",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
right now the only reason there isnâ€™t a stock holder revolt and bod house cleaning given this strategy and poor chance of success  is the covid driven shortage and nationalistic favorable politics of onshore of semiconductors and supply chain even though they donâ€™t make any longterm economic nor business sense.,the fact ohio was selected was insane and is all politics as you can hear with â€œheartlandâ€ and it being a swing state.,"pat is a preacher and knows how to milk it for money,  give him credit as well as his desire to see intel back to its legacy but simply 1 in 50 odds if even that good chance.",trust me the semiconductors has for itâ€™s whole life been a boom and bust and this boom will let certainly end with excessive capacity soon with all the capacity coming in two years.,"remember intel likely still going to be on the outside as they are building shells and need intel4 and 3 as well as 20a and 18a to come not only on schedule but be cost effective against samsung and tsmc gigafabs, which are low probability.","they wonâ€™t have scale as apple, mediatek, amd, nvidia wonâ€™t go to ifs.","i doubt they can convince amazon, facebooks, google either as those are competing somewhat directly.",buy from intel or do for cheaper and faster and more custom by yourself thru the foundry ecosystem.,"everyone has seen what apple has done with m1 and customized stack, why outsource?","so who is left to use leading edge foundry, not many and also willing to accept schedule / execution risk, no track record with pdks.","lastly everyone is interested for reason of price and competitive capacity, there is really only one game in town and everyone needs negotiation against the big foundry.",but when you need capacity on schedule you go with who will deliver.,"test chips arenâ€™t real, they keep others honest, in the end foundry is about trust and i would say only one company has delivered trust, and they donâ€™t take much, they are trusted and do t need to!",also lastly remember  this is intels third go around on foundry and last two times they had leadership and now really nothing at all but promises.,"so even if perfect execution when intel comes back in 2025 best case, the world will be swimming in capacity and they are without scale to compete against scale an trillion dollar companies.",really ugly situation is 50:1 odd to good?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"exactly, one of intel's great strengths has been the tight integration between product design and process development.",processors for processes and vice versa.,"> the idm baggage is going to drag the foundry side and the foundry will drag down the idm, the two arenâ€™t complimentary but distractions where they donâ€™t have the resources to do one, let alone both

agree entirely, and for similar reasons the idea that they can seamlessly move production to external fabs as needed doesn't pass the sniff test.",this has all the hallmarks of a powerpoint strategy.,"technical and economic details are for subordinates, and any objections are evidence of not getting the vision.",certainly conceivable that they pull a rabbit out the hat on the process front.,but even if they do this the success of the foundry business requires significant technical compromise from the core business.,the only alternative is an unrealistic amount of capital to develop tailored processes and libraries at each node.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'm not sure if i like the idea that minimized tasks go to e-cores.,i might want the render to happen as fast as possible even if i'm not looking at it.,i think they should make it smarter so that it will only reduce the priority of the task on the p-cores but still run it there if the cores are idle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why intel add a lot of e core ?,???,for power minimize?,?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not sure who's getting excited for an extra 8 e-cores.,i'll be waiting for meteor lake and hoping it works on lga1700.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so... if you minimize more tasks would it just divide the cores between them?,and when completed does it release those cores?,how would this translate to a linux environment?,that could be useful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

intel woke up one day and realized they could add some of their other technology to their desktop cpus.,a problem of large companies is that the left and right hands don't know what they are doing.,i think this problem may only get worse with intel as they buy more companies however we can hope the new ceo will work to fix this.,the chiplet design for cpu's should help however there are lots of managers protecting their turf at intel so sharing technology information at intel may be tough.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's just a tuning parameter in windows that's been around for years and years.,"(phone had arm and big.little long ago) background apps already run at lower priority, it is really just about the scheduling policy if the background app is allowed on performance cores.","you can change this yourself with the following:

    powercfg /setacprofileindex scheme_current profile_background schedpolicy 2
    powercfg /setacprofileindex scheme_current profile_background shortschedpolicy 2
    powercfg /setactive scheme_current    

value | schedulingpolicy
---|---
1 | performant processors
2 | prefer performant processors
3 | efficient processors
4 | prefer efficient processors",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's what i was thinking.,this doesn't sound very smart.,it shouldn't start ramping down those p-cores until something else start demanding cpu cycles (like pressing the render button in after effects),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"should really be 100% utilized, and then rescheduling as needed if your active software starts demanding threads.",i think this is a bandaid fix to avoid scheduling lag.,should not be shipping this feature until the scheduler is fast enough to do it in a cycle or two.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can still force the p-cores onto minimized processes.,or simply move the window aside instead of minimizing.,i get your point but there has to be compromise somewhere.,and for 99% of users this makes the most sense.,most people who are doing renders or compiles or whatever either want the fastest time and thus don't use their pc while they wait or want to use it and don't mind slower times.,"i don't think it really needs all 8 p-cores freed up when minimized though, i think giving 2-4 back would make more sense.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, and there is zero issue using the system scheduler for that, i am not sure why intel thinks that software fix would be a feature, having work and cpus idle sucks...  
lower the thread/task priority and let the oses handle the scheduling, this has worked since forever...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm guessing this behavior is for power efficiency.,i wonder if higher windows power modes would allow using p-cores for background tasks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

how dare you call me out like that good sir?,/s,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm not that excited for it.,most people don't need the extra multithreaded performance anyway.,for e.g.,"gaming, moving from 4 cores to 6 is helpful, 6 to 8 questionable, anything past 8 is useless.",and there's another difference between alder lake -> raptor lake and the uplifts we've seen in the past.,"i3s were stuck at a paltry 2c/4t, and moved up to a respectable 4c/8t by tenth gen. alder lake did not come with a core count increase for i3s, and leaks suggest the same is true for raptor lake.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it'a going to be better across the board so it should hold up for the next 5-6 years.,"especially comparing 12600k the 13700k should have significantly more cores, higher clocks, and better ipc.",kind of settled on a 12600k in november since i needed a new cpu so i'm still looking to upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

caches are external to the cpu pipeline and thus not associated with any specific pipeline stage.,"although you said loaded into if you actually meant ""loaded from cache"", then that happens during the memory cycle, at least in the classic 5 stage pipeline.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for the explanation!,iâ€™m trying to figure out when the data would be reloaded into the data cache in case there is a cache miss.,"given the cache missing is detected during the memory access stage, does the reloading happen during the execution stage, e.g., the detection causes the instruction to be re-executed such that the missing data is reloaded to the data cache?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
data is loaded into the cache when it is returned by the memory controller or flushed from another cache level.,things like the memory controller might be pipelined too but they're not cpus and so don't have cpu pipeline stages.,asking which stage they return data on doesn't make any sense.,they're not cpus.,in a modern cpu detecting a cache miss takes several to dozens of cpu cycles.,during that time the instruction is paused while the cpu determines where the data is located.,"the instruction doesn't get executed a second time (which would be wasteful since it's already been decoded), it pauses until data is available.",meanwhile other nondependant instructions keep executing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"another of intel's slides mentions lunar lake as 2024+ and ""ultra low power performance"".","it might suggest that lunar lake is mobile only architecture, or that they are expecting it to follow on quickly from arrow lake.",i'm generally pretty surprised that intel is teasing so much so early when amd seems to have preferred to play close to the chest (for now at least).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"nah,itâ€™s coming to pc,maybe laptop first tho",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s possible itâ€™s only going to be mobile only as they are more concerned about the massively bigger mobile market.,the big selling point of meteor lake is the 192eu gpu and they want to fend off apple.,i would assume if they have capacity they would do desktop but it sounds like the mobile market is the market intel is looking at most.,they also want to keep nvidia out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that rumor stemmed from the information pointing to arrow lake coming so soon after mtl suggesting that arrow lake will be the desktop counter-part to mtl.,"however, that might not be the case given intel has confirmed arrow lake for 2024.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i doubt it.,"first greymon isnt that reliable, he has walked back a lot of stuff in the past like most recently the rdna3 release date, tweeting he no longer has any idea, and been flat out wrong about stuff like expecting a zen3d release by 2022 christmas.",other leakers/rumors have been claiming desktop and laptop for mtl.,"second, roadmap.","if meteor lake was mobile only, that means intel would be launching zero desktop parts in 2023, thats not how intel runs their business.","they would rather put out a poor chip than no chip, see rkl.","also look at their arc roadmap, one launch every year.","intel isnt going to pull an amd and sit on their ass and not launch a desktop chip in 2023.

"of cource, it was a joke.",we know little to nothing for the specs and the performance.,we do know some things about the 13th gen but that's it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel can prepay and buy leading edge fab like they are doing for tsmc 3nm.,they are getting it next year and will get it in 2024/25 timeframe as well.,otherwise it makes no sense for intel to use tsmc.,i think this is part of risk mitigation to buy external node capacity as well.,pat did mention it as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if they won't use external foundries any slip in process roadmap will be a complete disaster.,10nm/7nm like 2-3 year delay for 20a and 18a is still a real possibility.,even 4 could get delayed again,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if i had to guess they may not be ready to start manufacturing gpu parts on their nodes just yet, or their current gpu architectures are already optimized for tsmc.",may have to wait until druid or later before intel decides to try to bring that back to their own foundries.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel bought the majority supply of tsmc 3nm.,https://www.techspot.com/news/90780-intel-has-reportedly-secured-majority-tsmc-3nm-production.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel 4 might be manufacturing ready by the end of this year, but also might have meteor lake launch later in 2023 because of ramp up and to build a bit of stock before launch.","similarly, on intel's roadmap, intel 7 was ready q2 2021, but alder lake did not actually launch until\* q4 2021. i think you are right.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you can never say for sure until 2024, mtl is supposed to launch h1 2023 after being ""manufacture ready"" in h2 this year.",20a is supposed to be manufacture ready in h1 2024 based on slides today and arrow lake could technically release on it in h2 2024. otherwise it will be on intel 3nm or tsmc 3nm(as rumored).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">based on what i read earlier, intel 4 will be â€œmanufacturing readyâ€ by the end of this year, but itâ€™s for a 2023 product.","depending on the node it takes 3-6 months for the part to come back from the fab, so if something goes into manufacturing in late 2022 the boxed parts don't arrive at retail until well into 2023.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"should not have said ""exactly"" accurate, i apologize, but both arrow and lunar lake probably only got shifted by 1-2 quarters, since they did say q4 23 and q4 24",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just seems right and it is a significant upgrade in ipc and i believe the first 7nm.,even if it is still 10nm why not it's time at that point.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">alder lake seems to scale better with power

yeah, intel still has their last advantage which is clockspeed, but guess what amd fixed with zen4?","all core 5ghz, seems like zen4 will finally allow users to scale with power, there goes intels last advantage.","well it makes sense why amd is able to pull off zen 4 early samples all core 5ghz, since according to tsmc, their 5nm node will have a 15% speed improvement at the same power so if we take the 5800x all core frequency of 4.5ghz and add 15%, you get 5.1ghz......

so if amd directly ports zen 3 to 5nm all of their cpu will be able to hit 5ghz......now that is impressive, but of course zen 4 will have increased transistor count so the rumor of 120watt tdp seems correct.","man this will make raptor lake looks silly, if 6950x follows zen3 with the 5950x having the same tdp as the 8 core 5800x due to binning, the 6950x will have 16p cores that could potentially do 5ghz all core at 120watt tdp.................brutal.............makes intel ""e-cores save power"" argument looks underwhelming and frankly disappointing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i do agree on the zen4 thing, it's timing is just absurd and raptor lake is actually looking good from the ""leaks"".","but, by 2025, just like intel will come out with a radical lunar (or nova?)","lake, amd may also be planning for its next zen, which could very well be a new champion.","but until then, all we can do is wait.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

a gtx 1080 is still a pretty good card imo.,"i think upgrading the ram to 16gb and then buying a new gpu when stock and prices (hopefully) settles or until rdna 3 and lovelace (supposed to be end of this year) would be a better plan, but hey that's just my 2 cents.",either way good luck upgrading your rig!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

do not forget that amd entirely relies on tsmc's progress as far as process node is concerned.,if tsmc doesn't manage to also get access to asml's 2nd gen euv machines (which i believe they won't for at least the next 5 years as intel has the priority and won't have its units until around 2024) every fabless companies that rely on them will be left behind intel.,if alder lake is already competitive performance wise with the likes of m1 max and rembrandt without the help of euv i'll let you guess what will happen once they transition to the much higher standard asml high na devices.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i don't expect past leadership mistakes to happen again.,intel is the one who invested the most into asml euv r&d but due to past leadership negligence they let tsmc and samsung get the bulk of first gen euv equipment.,without euv it obviously took years for intel to fix their 10nm node.,intel has now again the ambition to restore its process node leadership and is showing to investors how they will actually achieve it which includes getting those asml high na euv equipment ahead of other foundries.,another reason why i don't expect past mistakes to happen is the fact that under pat gelsinger intel has now multiple teams working on multiple nodes at the same time.,we saw loihi 2 the neuromorphic chip on intel 4 node.,"meteor lake (also on intel 4) has been taped in, taped out and powered up last year.",intel 3 node has also been announced to be ahead of schedule.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ultimately the gnr delay is hurting intel.,"though they have moved it to a stronger node, its going to be painful 2 years while amd releases zen 4 and zen 5 server chips.",ultimately it affects data center revenue which is the most important for its gross margins.,this is pretty much the last stand from intel.,cannot afford any more delays.,this also means the intel euv node is still going through a churn.,mtl was supposed to release h1 2013. its probably a h2 2023 product.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel is getting the xeons back it seems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why not an add in card?,its useful but it's niche.,with current pcie bandwidth it shouldn't be an issue to give it direct access to memory.,"it probably means it'll never get mass market adoption, but but given the current issues intel seems to be having with putting it in cpu cores i'm not sure that was ever happening anyway.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
making avx-512 smaller is basically impossible without hurting it's performance.,there is no reason to suggest they made small avx-512 simply because it will be a xeon.,just a reminder: they alrady had xeon phi which had basically an array of atoms and amd is already developing small core epyc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes they do!,power consumption and cooling requirement is as big a factor as the relative performance when it comes to selecting cpus for large server deployments.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
absolutely.,power usage directly correlates to cooling requirements which can be huge when you look at things at a rack level not to mention a full data center.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"generally servers will care much more about performance per watt than a desktop would since power becomes a limiting factor not only in how densely you can pack performance into a cabinet but also in how much electrical power you need to accomplish a given level of performance, both of which are major factors.",not so much about peak performance on one thread among hundreds or thousands since the cores generally run similar things whether they're a part of a supercomputer or a hypervisor cluster.,you'll generally see pretty modest base clocks in servers in order to keep them in performance per watt sweet spots.,"sure, there'll always be some skus that have a handful of very boostable cores (and aside from the very limited cases of individual thread speed mattering, there's call for them due to extravagant per-core licensing of enterprise software).","and yes, the electricity bill is a very significant part of server ownership: to get the most out of them they're generally running 24/7, require electricity to be spent on air conditioning (as a ballpark, 1-2x as much as energy is spent on actually running them) and since they need to be accessible 24/7 you need redundant power supplies with hordes of upses and backup generators and multiply-redundant diesel fuel providers in case the regular power supply goes down for days on end in case of natural disaster is **expensive** electricity - can easily be 3x the rate that you pay domestically after all is said and done.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"considering that ecore performance is around skylake, it's not like they provide shitty performance and they take up a lot less die space.",by having an all ecore sku they can probably load up on a ton of them to provide cloud providers an option to amd's epyc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think audio processing is a good application that most people will use.,also as time goes on ai and smart interactive applications will become more common.,it may be that avx-512 will be replaced with newer more powerful dedicated processors similar to gpus but it will be around in some form.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

either a bad chip, or more likely a combo of bad cooler/pressure, poor airflow/poor case

try un-mounting and re-mounting your cooler (use the 'line' method right down the center of the cooler for the tim) and make sure it's torqued down well.",if temps improve it's likely your cooler was poorly mounted.,"also can be a bad cooler/bad heatpipe (if air) or failed aio (if closed loop liquid)

aio 360mm won't remove the heat if vcore is  > 1.30-1.32v (tested on my aio).,live with that.,it's a difference between radiator fans running 100% and ability to obtain heat from the processor.,these are 2 different things.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

update: i did the washer mod and got a 15c drop in temps!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks for your reply

i'm using the lga1700 backplate from ek water blocks, and the usual/original lga115x screws with springs that came with the water block.","when i remove the cpu block i see good, consistent contact across the ihs with no patches or pools

do you still think that the mounting mechanism is to blame?",what would you suggest instead?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're probably lacking mounting pressure on the hot side.,the problem with the old ek supremacy/velocity mounting is the lack of tooling support meaning the amount of torque on each thumbscrew is highly dependent on finger size and motherboard layout.,the bottom right is likely to be tighter than the other three since it's the only thumbscrew not obstructed by the vrm heatsink.,"since lga1700 moves the mounting holes even closer to the vrm heatsink, the problem is even worse on the upper left since it's surrounded by vrm heatsinks with 5mm of room.",what i did was finger tight all 4 thumbscrews to the same amount and then use a plier to turn them another 2 turns.,this dropped temperatures on my 12900k by 5c across the board and evened out core temperatures to within ~5c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wow!,2 more turns with pliers sounds a bit dangerous.,could you damage your cpu?,have you also done the 1mm washer mod on the z690 ilm?,and if so did that help temps?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i tried really torquing down the finger screws on the ek water blocks supremacy evo cpu block buy it didn't make a lick of difference in my temperatures... going to try the washer mod tomorrow, and if i still can't get decent temps i'll bite the bullet and buy an lga1700 specific cpu block",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you have your mobo out of the case?,you should be able to verify the backplate and block are mounted completely solid and tight.,how tight are you screwing?,you should tighten to where you canâ€™t reasonably tighten any of the heads without effort (using a philips).,my 12900k barely breaches 70c.,i had to use a washer above and below the mobo for each of the four holes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just did the washer mod too - damn what a difference!,15c drop!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the ek supremacy water block screws are tighten by hand only (no screwdriver heads).,i'm tightening as much as possible - it feels like too tight!,"where i can barely move the head

what cooler are you using for your 12900k?","and what temp does it get to in cinebench r23 (with power limits off, thermal limits off)?",if i left intel's thermal limits (70c) on then the chip doesn't go above 70c either but i get thermal throttling because of the lower set thermal limit.,i'm overclocking the i7-12700kf here to 240w (same tdp as the i9-12900k) so my temps make perfect sense.,"in non overclocked ""to the limit"" usage my i7-12700kf doesn't get hot under the water block.","i just want to squeeze every bit of performance i can out of it (5.2ghz single, 5.1ghz all core turbo) hence higher power draw at load",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

adding more cores for raptor lake could potentially mean that the chips will be clocked slower.,"this may shake things up between the three product lines i9, i7, and i5.",maybe.,we can speculate on this just by looking up past intel and amd chips.,and we can see that usually adding more cores mean that we should expect slower base operating frequencies.,because more cores operating at higher speeds will mean a hotter cpu.,just filter by base operating frequency.,ignore max turbo boost frequency as that is usually opportunistic and will take advantage of temperature lulls and past wattage use history and stuff in order to boost.,"intel

you need to scroll down to the bottom for the amd line of chips.",but the trend mostly remains true.,more cores will mean lower base operating frequency as you have to keep heat in check and keep the processor cool.,so there are tradeoffs for more cores.,all that being said =p i think the new 12900ks main advantage over raptorlake or existing alderlake chips is that it will be better binned!,unless intel will be pulling more surprises and hitting us with a 5.6 ghz or maybe even a 6.0 ghz and beyond... for raptorlake and meteorlake stuff.,then 12900ks will be pretty sweet for a long time coming.,crazy times... 16 core/24 thread 5.5 ghz st turbo boosting chip from intel.,and you know guys will try to run that thing at 5.5 ghz all core boost for prime 95 stability.... that is insane.,who knows what the future may bring.,maybe intel 4 tech will bring us even more insane speeds....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"honestly don't put your money on 12900ks, unless you are a real overclocking enthusiast.",overpriced and not worth it.,theres plenty of better options like the 12700k or your mentioned (assuming) 5800x3d when it comes out.,you could also buy the basic 12700f if you want to save even more money and spend it on some other parts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i got a 5600x at launch, 85% of the gaming performance of a 5900x for under 40% of the power draw at max load.",you should get a 12600k if you want to undervolt it for higher performance at stock wattage while getting 85%-90% of the gaming performance of the 12900k.,efficiency is sweet with the current gen cpus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

\*cries in locked multiplier on a laptop\*

my cpu goes from 60c to 100c in 1/10th the blink of an eye because max turbo boost is 5ghz in a laptop.",and even if turbo boost is off you can't get the cpu to not try to run as fast as it can with the built in windows performance settings.,"i had to enable some hidden option in the registry to limit the maximum clock speed to 4ghz and then use throttlestop to set the ""speedshift - epp"" to something less aggressive in order to get a usable laptop.",meanwhile amd is much more focused on efficiency so my friends laptop with a comparable cpu gets significantly better battery life and performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">my 4690k lasted like five or six years before it was meaningfully outclassed,

that's because intel essentially released the same cpu for 5-6 years...

you've got a point i'd much rather them keep on with the march of technology and r&d.,limiting that in any way is literally going in the wrong direction.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

true but those 8 e cores will still add to power requirements and add to additional heat.,overall package footprint will remain the same so i still suspect clocks to remain the same.,but i'm just guessing of course!,i have no idea how they improve on the 10nm esf or make improvements in other ways.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it will come out approx.,"in april, zen 4 is coming 2h like amd has stated and i doubt they have somehow magically made their process quicker and launched it way earlier.",you can wish but its unlikely.,the 5800x3d was planned as a limited edition anyways so be prepared with your 1ms bots to order it rofl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

intel's boost time is commonly named tau.,[check more here.,"](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/intel-core-i5-11400-review/2)

> intel has recommended power level 1 (pl1 â€” boost power), power level 2 (pl2 â€” sustained power), and tau (boost duration) variables for all of its chips, but motherboard vendors are free to exceed those recommendations, even at stock settings, to differentiate their motherboards.","as such, performance has long varied by motherboard based on the respective power settings.",boost clock is limited by time (tau) and other factors.,"there are some good graphs out there that can show this well, but i can't seem to find them tho.",i think hardware unboxed had a video on different motherboards which had different performance because they didn't all set tau to the very max.,i'm assuming that's what the other guy meant when he said you can adjust this on h510.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

do it.,itâ€™s a good price (maybe talking him down a bit).,people mentioned cpu throttling being a concern but your vrm will be the issue and could cause a bsod.,"if so, under-clock the cpu a bit and it will still be much faster than your i3, especially in multi-core applications.",then maybe upgrade your mb to a good used option that can handle that cpu with some overclocking.,a while back i purchased an i9-9900k for a steal and put it in an msi z370 gaming plus board (totally entry level mb) and had the above issues and solution.,i was very happy with the combo even though i had to keep the cpu at stock speeds.,i eventually found an msi meg z390 ace board for cheap and was able to run the cpu full steam with decent overclocking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"even if it did, it'll still be way faster than the i3

i feel like people see the word throttle and think it's ruined but really it's maybe like a couple percent slower lol, you could say the same thing about ram or cooling, if you aren't running the fastest ram in the world and using sub-ambient cooling then you're leaving performance on the table!",really you just need to think if those extra $100+ mobo/ram/cooling are worth the couple extra % of performance for you...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
could be.,but i don't think that there have been any formal testing on this.,but what i do know is that all intel lga socket 1200 chips will work with all b or h or z motherboards.,the only things that don't work is overclocking or memory overclocking on those systems.,"so the customer can safely assume that  if intel specifies that the chip can boost to 5.3ghz or 5.1ghz in op's case, then i think all mobos must meet this power delivery requirement with their vrm design.",for whatever minimum tau = 56 sec and pl1 or pl2 power limit.,at least that is my understanding.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i only briefly watched this video.,"https://youtu.be/hkita0xvxum

it looks as if they test for a 1 hour blender render.",that's an all core load and is more of a stress test than real world use.,i was never suggesting that the motherboard that op currently has is an overclocking or endurance motherboard.,but it is good for a typical consumer.,which should not vrm throttle or thermal throttle as the workload will burst for 56 seconds and then settle into a pl1 of 125 watts.,for single threaded gaming loads it is more than enough and is an excellent upgrade from an i3.,there is no point forcing op to upgrade if his motherboard is perfectly capable of using the i7 10700k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my concern is that the vrms will pop under pressure at some point and maybe take parts with it.,i could definitely be wrong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
op later mentioned they have the strix model which is supposed to handle boosting up to 210w so it should definitely manage a 10700k just fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the 12500 is about 220â‚¬ while the 12600kf is about 300â‚¬.,the 12700f on the other hand is about 370â‚¬.,i know that's it's a very weird configuration but the price difference between this board and the much lower end ones isn't huge.,going with ddr4 and a similar board would cost the same.,my part choices are really weird to understand but it's just a weird motherboard pricing situation.,i could maybe even squeeze the 12600kf in there but it's tight since it's enough expensive already.,i'm open to suggestions but it's hard for people to help me because they don't know the availability and prices here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 12600kf would be worth it since you get the 8 p-cores.,i would get an entry z690 board.,the top-end b660 boards are scams.,for example the board you listed has 16 phases (unneeded.,14 phases is more than enough for a 12900k.,let alone a 12600kf..).,with identical features to an msi pro-z690-a.,i'm not sure about specifically your countries pricing but i would be shocked if an asus z690-p or a msi pro-z690-a would be more expensive.,btw: if it is not that much more i would get a 5600 kit since it can actually overclock to 6000 relatively easily on a msi-pro-z690-a.,"a 5200 kit is micron memory chips that suck, and you would be limited to like 5500.",- i specifically recommend these ([https://www.corsair.com/us/en/categories/products/memory/vengeance-ddr5-memory---black/p/cmk32gx5m2b5600c36](https://www.corsair.com/us/en/categories/products/memory/vengeance-ddr5-memory---black/p/cmk32gx5m2b5600c36)),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

drivers are pieces of software that connect standard operating system functions (e.g.,writing a file to storage) to the hardware that implements that function (e.g.,taking ones and zeros and sending them over a sata bus).,the driver is the program that (running on the cpu) knows how to turn a command to write a file into the data on the sata bus that will cause that data to be written.,"drivers always run on the main cpu, but could also include additional software that runs on a hardware device if it includes its own internal cpu or microcontroller.","when you change hardware, typically the operating system will look for a compatible driver, and if it can't find one it will request that you provide it.","when you update a driver the existing code is removed and new code is added, which is why you may be required to reboot.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the 1st, 3rd and 4th cpus are very low tdp/wattage, so they'll provide decent short term performance when opening up new tabs etc, but will slow down in longer tasks (gaming / video encoding etc).","the 5th option is the best, it's slightly faster than its predecessor (2nd).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i7 is the best one.,i have a 6th gen(2016) i7 and it can run cyberpunk 2077 and doom eternals!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
none.,you can buy a ryzen 5500u laptop for peanuts and that is several times faster than any of these.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would go 7200u.,"if its for a tablet, the chances that you would actually hit 3.6ghz at 4.5w and stay at 3.6ghz are probably slim to none on the 7y75.",you would probably throttle due to heat before you hit 3.6ghz.,the 7200u with its 15w of power will help get you to the 3.1ghz and stay there without exceeding power draw or thermal throttling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the 7200u probably is better.,"7y57 has a maximum sustained wattage of 7 watts, half of what the 7200u, which means naturally, its sustained multi core score will be lower.","unless the manufacturer is throttling the 7200u, which rarely happens, it will perform better than the 7y57.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7200u would be the best-performing part in the list.,but are you able to consider anything more recent?,even 8th-gen i3 would be about the same or potentially better than these options.,that could be cheaper since it's an i3 model.,"edit: also, see if you can get an ssd for your laptop.",it will be and feel a lot faster.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

int his case i would vote for the #1 - 7y57.,high single thread benchmark while beeing the most energy efficient one of them all.,its also the most recent one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the vrm should suffice for a 12700. not sure regarding the power limits though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most b560 boards had an unlocked powerlimit.,so i would assume b660 would continue the trend.,the questions that should be asked is 1. do you need more cores?,2. do you plan on overclocking?,the gaming x board seems like a solid b660 imo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oc is not worth the power cost on these new k's imo.,i'd rather put the money toward a 12700 instead of a z board with 12600k.,however if the ~150euro boards don't suffice with power limits etc then is pretty moot at that point,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">oc is not worth the power cost

i'm oc'd to 5.2ghz on preferred cores, 5.0ghz on rest of p-cores, 4.0ghz on e-cores and ring clock at 4.6ghz all constant (no frequency scaling) and my cpu package idles around 4-8w and games under 100w a majority of the time on my 12700k...

sure it'll draw 220w if i run multi-core cinebench, but honestly are you sitting around running benchmarks all day every day?","if you enable c-states up to c8 and turn on rush to halt, it really is fairly efficient.","can i make the cpu package pull over 300w if, i really go crazy?","yes i've gotten it to 307w stable, but it's not relevant for normal operation at all.","my 3080 is the piece of hardware that is pretty inefficient, idling around 30w with two 1440p/165hz monitors on and drawing 370w under full load.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was more talking about having the possibility of ocing then it actually being worth it.,i would reccomend the 12700 combo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"220 is not much more then the 180 from 12700 haha

but for the same money spend i'd still rather get the 12700

"i used to care about it, back in 2500k and 6600k days but not so much now anymore with the much smaller gains.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

8 core server cpus probably sell more than 30+ core ones.,not everybody runs â€œserver farmsâ€.,letâ€™s take a simple use case: storage servers.,"you need pcie, in some cases lots of ram, but probably not more than a few cpu cores.",or if your small business runs their own office server for internal services.,do they need 24 cores?,why?,edit: also xeon bronze are not entry level cpus with expensive motherboards.,the cheapest 6 core xeon bronze supports 48 pcie lanes and 1tb of ecc memory and dual socket systems.,there are no xeon bronze on the latest generation but the cheapest 8 core xeon silver supports 6tb of memory and 64 pcie lanes.,intel works tightly with their customers to produce exactly what they want to have.,some xeon workstation models are literally consumer cpus with added ecc support but they are not expensive and not server cpus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>can we talk about the fact that the whole intel xeon bronze lineup is literally just entry level cpuâ€™s with over expansive motherboards?,they're not actually entry level cpus since you get the hex channel memory and massively increased io of the sp cores on most (all?),of the bronze series.,"if you want to build a system with 512 gb of ram or a server with an array of x16 pcie coprocessors, you'd use look at one of these processors since you can't do that with with the consumer gear.",">letâ€™s even not start to talk about the price of motherboards that support the lga 2011

do any of the xeon bronze processors even run on lga 2011?",i think that is mostly older haswell-era stuff.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thx for explaining to me, but still in my opinion the minimum core count should have been 10",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s due to power requirements (big deal in data centers) and memory throughput/amounts.,also most boards have dual sockets so a cpu can fail.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"mine are all built out of parts i save from going to a recycling centre, minus my 1070",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm about the same.,i upgrade when necessary as i like squeezing out my money's worth.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i upgrade my cpu and gpu every generation.,i can usually sell the old components for 60-75% of their original value.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this dude has done 3 different ryzens, i still have the same amd a10 i've had for 7 years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
every 3-4 years for me.,"got a rtx 2060 and ryzen 5 1600 few years ago, now i am looking for an upgrade on both.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
every ten to twelve years,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i build a new desktop every 4-5 years.,just upgraded from my i7-7700k to a 5800x.,nice jump in performance.,my i7 rig is now my media/plex server so itâ€™s still working.,iâ€™ll probably keep that until win10 is no longer supported.,a nice toasty 8 year lifecycle.,ðÿ˜‰,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mainly kept the same desktop but just a cpu upgrade because i had originally had a ryzen 3 1200 which bottlenecked my 1070 at the time.,"then i upgraded to a 2600, which was nice but then i made a stupid decision and upgraded to a 3600 which really didnâ€™t make much of a difference.",so i wanted to upgrade for higher fps in esports titles,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
upgrade every ddr generation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"same, i would go intel.","better value, i'm stuck with my b350 mobo.",and no beta bios for ryzen 5000 series.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is it really?,you have to factor in the cost of a new mobo as well don't you?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ur mobo doesnt support 5000 series?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this!,"they gonna have air bubble sounds and reduce performance with the tubing like that :(   

it might not be too noticeable right away but itll get worse over time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i fixed the tubing.,i was just super excited that i took the pic before doing any cable management either,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they nearly confirmed it will be a multiyear socket.,they also did confirm that am4 coolers will work on the am5 socket.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why not?,"assuming he's been buying things that cost around what an i5 does and a reasonably priced motherboard, it's really not that expensive to just upgrade those two components.",maybe $40-45 / month if you are saving throughout the year and not reselling your old stuff?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's quite easy to do on ryzens.,you can go from a 1600 - 2600 - 3600 on the same b350 board.,although the jump from 1600 to 2600 is minor it still wouldn't cost much to sell the old cpu and buy a new one.,$50-100 at most would be my guess.,now assuming he's on a 3600 or 5600 i wouldnt buy a whole new board just to get a 12600k unless there's some other reason.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because intel is better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was having problems with tpm 2.0 and windows 11 so i decided iâ€™d switch to intel to see if it fixes my problems which it did.,my b550 board crapped itself when i enabled ftpm so i thought iâ€™d give intel another shot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"had a 1200, then upgraded to a 2600, and then a 3700x.",and i wanted something that would achieve the most fps in esports games.,so instead of going ryzen 5000 i went with intel because i was having ftpm problems on my ryzen system and couldnâ€™t play valorant.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i tend to change cpu ever 2-3 years, and go for the 70 series class card from nvidia/amd, this time i went with a 5700xt, the first time i went for a all amd build",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that is placebo.,"general latency on desktop is up to storage and display, not cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s actually quite good.,i havenâ€™t seen over 70c yet.,i think my highest temp is 64c and i have a 240mm aio,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my last computer was still running the e5 1231v3 (the i7 4770 but $100 cheaper) until i upgraded to 5900x this summer.,most work i do utilizes 50% of the cpu at best.,i won't be upgrading until ddr6 at this rate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i like to upgrade every generation.,"the performance difference is sometimes negligible, but the one generation old components usually sell for more than you might think.",i sold my 3900x last year for just over $400.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i also had an opteron desktop, but has a dual cpu dual core.",sucked at gaming though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most likely it depends on how much people are prone to marketing.,the gains from upgrading every year just are not big enough unless  one constantly messes up their builds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

or type of gaming you do.,"if you stick to 1080p@60, you can easily handle that on a few years old pc.","if you play something like 1440p@144, you need to upgrade regularly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"eh, also on your hobbies and interests and overall spendings.","i've swapped my stuff quite a bit, but i've also bought them during deals so i've sometimes made money when selling them back.","example i got some fans for a good deal, used for some year and sold for like double price.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i would say it definitely depends on the region as well, amd prices have stayed quite high in some regions where even with an amd mobo it doesn't make sense to buy their processors.","in my case it's actually cheaper for me to sell my amd mobo + cpu and buy intel b660 + 12400 rather than buying a 5600x

in my region a 5800x costs more than a 12700 , 5600x costs more than a 12600k

i am sure there are more regions where this is also the case, in the us at least it seems like there have been some retail price drops on amd cpu's but that definitely isn't the case everywhere.","i mean gg to intel , i went with amd because i thought it would be cheaper down the line to just upgrade my cpu and then intel came along and brought some serious value on the lower end, happy that intel came out guns blazing on the value side, i have been recommending alder lake to pretty much everyone lately.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"that doesn't seem like a smart use of money, and at the same time op is using a ""puny"" i5 so it's not like he has that much money to throw around or he's a creator who needs an i9 and the highest possible performance every year to render super fast.",are you also going to tell me that he buys new thermal paste every year for this one yearly cpu change?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh that makes more sense but how much difference have you seen between 2600 and 3700x.,"i, myself would have skipped the 3700x upgrade step.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not for the programs i'm using,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"better off upgrading roughly every 2 generations at the moment, then you're pretty much guaranteed a nice 30/40% jump.","but yea it depends on the person, personally 6-7 years would be way too long with current advancements.","the thing with amd and ryzen is that the early chips didn't have great single core performance or latency, so it took literal years to catch even the 8700k in games.","gpu ideally would be every generation, but it depends on the performance leap.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the single cpu opteron models (100 series) were stupidly cheap and outrageously overclockable (+150%), to the point they performed better than the much more expensive consumer line althlon64 cpus.",that was the golden age of overclocking.,"now you pay extra for the ""privilege"" to oc and only get mild gains.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"performance gains year on year aren't great but efficiency gains have been pretty good, especially if you are willing to undervolt.",definitely not every year upgrade good though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

for me it's the resale value that makes it an easy choice to upgrade.,"i bought a 3900x for $550 in 2019 and sold it for $400 in 2021. i could've stuck with my 2700x that whole time, but four more faster cores for nearly two years only cost me $150.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"oh yeah, definitely been recommending alder lake myself.","even got one for myself, but with local prices (really just microcenter) coming down i've been of the mind that it's best to just upgrade cpu if you're in that situation, i.e.",near a microcenter.,"but other than that, alder lake all the way",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
here in new zealand a 5600x costs $440 and a 12400f is only $305 so i'd almost be better off getting an a b660 motherboard which is $240,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

â€œsmart use of moneyâ€ what an idiotic statement.,i could argue the food your parents bought keeping you alive was a waste of money to produce such a dumb meat sack.,guess we are both right in our assumptions!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean itâ€™s perfectly feasible to go a decade between cpu upgrades.,if you had a 3930k youâ€™d be missing absolutely nothing major.,"itâ€™s msrp at launch was $594, which was crazy back then but today wouldnâ€™t be so bad.","youâ€™d be getting a 6 core 12 thread processor with quad channel ddr3 support, presumably ddr3 1866 mhz considering itâ€™s a fairly high end platform.","in 2012 youâ€™d probably pair a radeon 7970 with 3930k, as youâ€™d wait until january of 2012 to build a pc since the radeon 7970 was a massive leap in performance over the previous generation graphics cards.","technically, that decade old build could still be holding you over today.","thatâ€™ll run pretty much any game on the market, at around 1080p ultra low settings.",even cyberpunk 2077 will be almost playable at around 25-30 fps.,"not great, but thatâ€™s a literal zero upgrade pc from a decade ago.","the logical route wouldâ€™ve been to probably upgrade with the gtx 10 series to a gtx 1080 or 1080ti, which youâ€™d still be on today and doing just fine for 1-2 more years at least.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when i got a 1700x i was coming off a six core intel without pretty similar single core performance.,so it was basically an upgrade all around.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that's what i thought just wanted to make sure thank you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's questionable if it's better atm with ddr5 costing more then a kit of fast ddr4 like 4600 or even 5000 mhz ddr4 you would probably take a negative performance for a kit of ddr5 5000mhz cl32.,ddr5 will eventually get there but it's similar to where ddr4 was at launch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ddr5 is much more expensive and has a higher latency.,you can find fast enough ddr4 ram (3600 mhz cl 18) for cheap.,"if you are sure that memory speed is a huge bottleneck, you can wait for ddr5 to improve or you can buy right now, with caveats.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
disabling c-states is safe but would likely hurt battery life.,i also donâ€™t see why cpu power saving should affect coil whine.,unless maybe there is a very specific low voltage level that causes the whine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes it is, although i donâ€™t see why you would",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your battery life may decrease by up to 70% less,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my battery life hasn't change that much.,and also i don't know why but when i turn it on it cause coil whine(in this mode that sound get higher when i touch the touchpad).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
coilwhine in my experiance is due to the voltage or current being pushed through the device cpu/gpu creates a resonance that propogates through the air.,depending on your altitude *i.e.,"how thick or thin the air is,* as well as how well your hearing frequency range is.","some people will have the same device and not hear it at all while you can, ussually the older you get the more this sound frequency you can hear drops off.",while a younger person with good hearing can hear it very clearly and distinct.,"you could try re-enabling c states and lowering or raising your altitude by 1000 feet or so but i think disableing c-states is a better option for the time being lmao...

also this is all just speculation as ive delt with coil whine before",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
disabling c-states should absolutely tank your battery life.,the chip will likely be burning watts of power when otherwise idle.,"if you didnâ€™t notice, that likely means your device was already terrible on battery.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"also c-states will make your core clock speed fluctuate to as low as it can go when its not utilized, so i think its the lower end of the frequency spectrum that you are hearing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're doing it wrong.,"you're supposed to set svid behavior in bios to trained, and call it a day.",for a more comprehensive guide written mostly for asus boards: https://www.overclock.net/threads/asus-maximus-z690-extreme-i9-12900k-guide-load-lines-vf-curves-adaptive-voltage-by-core-octvb.1794957/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"put llc to #2 and adaptive voltage to -0.036v, this helped me to reduce temps by 12 degrees c while loosing about 4% performance",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the link.,i will read more into it.,i am just trying to get tune so i am not thermal throttling without losing over 10% performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i also tried using the asus ai oc with no settings change as well and itâ€™s unstable as well.,not sure if you had any experience with this issue?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it seems like every time i restart my computer the xtu setting disappears.,and i have to rerun my saved profile for it to apply.,not sure whatâ€™s going on there.,does xtu need to be running at all time?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i will give this a shot when i get home from work.,i did -.050 offset before with no other setting modified before that dropped the temp like 14c but i was losing a lot of performance around 10%.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
could you explain how the change in voltage will affect performance in this case?,does it have to do with turbo boost or other similar features?,"coming from much older cpu generations, i was under the impression that adjusting the voltage only affected stability, while performance was tied to clock frequency, so all in all a sort of triangle.",most of what i've read here suggest it's much more entangled with the newer cpus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i haven't really used ai oc much, but as far as i know, you're supposed to run a stress test on stock for a while to calibrate your cooling performance, then activate ai oc.",ai oc will then automatically adjust clock frequency depending on what's stable or not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh thatâ€˜s funny because i read that xtu will apply the settings to the mobo.,"but you need to apply it, not just save your profile settings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes i also tried -.050 and felt like its too much performance loss for me.,but this also depends on specific unit parameters,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gotcha.,so reset to default and stress test it on cinebench r23 for the 30min stability run or something similar to update the cpu score.,my current cpu cooler score is 163 for a noctua d15s which i am not fully confident about.,i will give it a shot and see what comes out of it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s what i read as well.,i also read that undevolting in xtu doesnâ€™t get saved or something.,thatâ€™s why i am trying to transfer the settings from xtu to the bios directly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i did my offset undervolt in the bios after just fooling around with oc in xtu, really donâ€˜t know if my clocks are now stock or the ones i set in xtu lolâ€¦ but iâ€˜m very happy with temps and performance now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the way i know it wasnâ€™t applying was when i go to the xtu speed up my processor auto pc option.,it shows the default 4.9ghz and not the applied oc.,maybe i am wrong about it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have one core on 5 two on 4.9, 4 on 4.8 and 8 on 4.7 is that stock or oc?",if itâ€˜s oc than xtu saved it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that sounds like the default setting i believe.,like i said i am pretty new to this as well.,trying to make sense of it from all the various resources.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"6th-10th gen all have the same ipc, so at the same clock speeds they're more or less identical, the only difference is core/thread-count and cache.","11th gen has higher ipc, however it also has higher latency, so some things end up being worse, but more or less 11th gen is generally a bit better than 10th gen and earlier, although the 11900(k)(f) was completely pointless as it was just a *slightly* higher clocked 11700(k)(f).","personally i'd consider the biggest difference between 11th gen and 6th-10th gen is 11th gen introduced a non-z series chipset (b560) that allowed memory overclocking, although one thing there is to note is that 10th gen could also be used on that chipset.",also 11th gen could use pcie 4.0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

10 gen had improved ipc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not true for intel.,if oc even binning mattered ( 4 core cpus had higher frequencies gen over gen and a better bin older gen could beat a newer gen ).,after that the terrible no ht cpu came along.,and then 10gen fixed everything only for 11gen to have less cores.,"but moving on, sure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ehhh no.,too many examples of that not being true.,"in this case yes 11th gen i7 is better than 8th, but not always the case.",the 8700k is better than the 9700k in most games for example which benchmarks and the naming scheme would tell you is wrong.,games donâ€™t like non-hyper threaded cpus and it introduced a lot of bugs and extra heat to have two more cores without hyperthreading.,intelâ€™s naming scheme didnâ€™t get i9 until 9th gen so before that thereâ€™s a lot of discrepancies and niche cases.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, let's just pretend the 11900k doesn't exist.",your own link replying to the other guy shows it's performing worse in games and multi-threaded applications than the 10900k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i5 12400 beat them both.,no point getting 11th gen now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'd assume a 12600k is better than my 2600k but not sure by how much...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
true but that's one outlier because rocket lake was such a fuckup and somehow it ended up with fewer cores than the previous gen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was looking at a microsoft surface studio laptop which is 11th gen i7 tiger lake 11370h and the other is wacom mobile studio pro 8th gen i7 8559u,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ahh see youâ€™re just looking at average fps.,a lot of games had huge issues with the 8 core/8 thread and 6 core/6 thread cpus just causing crazy stutters and .1% lows that made games unplayable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
roughly 350% faster.,not including more specific tasks which the 12600k can accelerate far further.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> somehow it ended up with fewer cores than the previous gen

that's because the cores were larger, if they made a 10 core it would've been **very** expensive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ah, so laptops, that's a completely different story then.",more or less what dashata said.,"11th gen laptop cpus are on a smaller node, not only that but h skus also have a higher tdp than u skus, the 11th gen cpu will not only perform better at the same clocks but will also stay clocked higher, it's an all around much better cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the 11370h and 11375h only had 4 cores compared to 11800h and 11850h so depending on what you do you might have a performance loss,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that much ?,"i believe you speak with frequency boost and all but if the two of them run at, let say, 4.5ghz is the difference x3.5 ?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

how so?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes but stock the difference in frequency is huge.,those old cpus were able to run way faster even on air cooling.,mine ran at 4.5ghz for ages with a corsair h60 so i'd be curious is you put a 12600k at 4.5ghz how much of a difference it make in single thread performances,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not an expert in architecture but multicycle instructions were extremely common on cpus of the 70s and 80s.,the instructions just took the time they needed to execute before the next instruction could run.,are you asking what happens if the cpu receives an interrupt in the middle of a multi cycle instruction?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm trying to fully understand the multi-cycle process.,though i'm wondering how logically and electronically this is going.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
does multi-cycle instruction in this context mean something else than just dividing the instruction to smaller steps?,this is very common as implementing e.g.,slower floating point instructions in single cycle would require very long cycles.,"also multi-cycle design enables multi purpose hardware, such as using a single alu to do all the arithmetic operations, counter increments, address generation etc.","i don't know about 4004 structure specifically but in general the data path would be divided to functional steps and there are simple register between each step to store the intermediate result, bunch of multiplexers to allow multiple different inputs to each step and some controller to control them.",apparently the 4004 used a single internal 4 bit bus so there would have been a controller and multiplexers there to control what goes where.,edit: [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fixr39x8s4) is a full diagram and simulation.,slow that down and start deciphering.,edit: also someone has written a visualized [emulator](https://github.com/asicerik/j4004).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not really.,feels overused and kinda lame tbh but maybe because i prefer clean boxes.,early ryzen box is clean as well and i'm not a fan of amd a series box art,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

assuming that's stock settings yes that's good actually.,mine at stock hit 100c on my 280mm aio.,i'm sure this is partly due to the motherboard using too much voltage.,i undervolted to 1.17v and the temps remains in the low 80s,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seems a tad high to be honest.,"i have a 12700k so it's not apples to apples here, but on my 360 aio at stock i rarely ever reach 70/75c in cinebench.",only an allcore oc at 5.0 or 5.1ghz will generate heat over 90c.,"maybe your mobo is overvolting a bit too much at ""stock""?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mine gets 76c on a u12a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cinebitch should not stress a cpu so hard it gets that hot.,at least i don't think,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's bad.,i wouldn't run my computer over 90. if it was over 80 i would make adjustments,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for stock itâ€™s ok, if you undervolt you can save up to 15-20*c so even 74*c. i managed to undervolt by -100mv and reduce temp by -20*c in cb23",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how do i do that in bios?,i am not tech savvy im scared i might do something wrong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how is that bad if its in cinebench?,in realistic usage i would never reach that tho,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
on a 12900k it's pretty okay temps under stress tests,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
exactly where in the bios will depend on your manufacturer but it should be in the overclock setting somewhere and it would be called vcore voltage .,this is typically set to auto by default.,find this setting and change it to something like 1.20 and configure the mode to override mode.,the mode setting should be right above the vcore setting.,save settings and then reboot.,try and run cinebench and monitor your temperatures.,if cinebench freezes or crashes your system go back into the bios and slightly increase the vcore say to 1.21 for example and repeat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
even if you happen to misconfigure something you computer would just go back to default settings.,modern bioses have very good fail-safes built in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you undervolt, at worst your bios will give you a pop up saying the system failed to boot and ask if you want to restore default settings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yaa probably not as big of a deal as i am making it out to be.,like you said it's most likely not gonna do that during gaming.,if all your doing is gaming your probably fine.,you could see what temps are during gaming.,i still wouldn't want my cpu reaching 94 during a benchmark.,a 240 may be a little small for the 12900k but what do i know i bought a 360 for my 12600k.,temps don't even reach mid 70s during cinebench,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i dont think there is whole lot of other things that could really push my cpu to 100% unless its a benchmark...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's not.,"and if 90c was an issue intel and amd wouldn't set the thermal throttle to 100c+ and further for shutdown, all while warrantying these cpus for years under those conditions.","and as you point out, cinebench really isn't a realistic use case for 99% of people.","if you plan to render out content all day everyday, you might want to consider a better cooler, but if you plan to play video games, general use, photo editing, etc it's perfectly fine.","you can drop temps down a bit more with undervolting, but it doesn't really matter if you're never hitting these temps/usage in your normal daily workloads.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hardware unboxed has a video that literally says 240 aio are not enough for this cpu.,it's not just for gaming so imo these temps arent good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
undervolt is safe.,the worst can happen is it crash.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i couldnt do it in bios, so i had to do it in xtu, i didnt find the setting, i have a -.100 offset now, temps lowered to 70s to low 80s, xtu told me that for some reason i dont have the watchdog thing or whatever that restores settings, i dont know why its telling me that if fail-safes are normal and good now",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my case cant fit a 360mm unless its front mounted, pcspecialist made this pc, i just got it today so i can return it, but it seems fine right now, ofc temps could be lower but i do gaming and sometimes video editing or other recreational stuff like photoshop",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"12600k 280aio sff build here, is in low 60c on 120w 10min and my fan curve is made for silent work so it's not spinning quickly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 12900k by default is overvolted by most mobos.,the temps should not go above 70s in gaming,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oooh i c.

one more thing to try is find out what your pump speed is and what the fan speed is on the pumps.",pump speed during cinebench should be 70% or higher i think.,if your still getting those hot temps check your gpu temp .,if the gpu temp is really good then a front mounted aio won't be any issue.,"you won't get as much cool air in the case but it will help with cpu cooling

front mount aio helps cpu 
top mount aio helps gpu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think op said they use it for other things then just gaming.,hey i'm just repeating information i've heard.,"don't shoot the messager

watch hardware unboxed video on the 12900k",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is incorrect.,pump speed should be at 100% at all times.,the only variable introduced is fan speed which is dependant on cpu temp,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in average use (meaning no benchmarks all the time), i doubt cpu will go above 80s then",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why 100%,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this cpu only went to like 60c when i was testing deep rock galactic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ya that's probably right.,dunno.,i wouldn't risk it with that expensive of a cpu especially if i was using it for other things then gaming,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"- constant speed can reduce the amount of wear verses fluctuations in speed 

- at full speed again, the only variable for cooling is fan speed, thus, you can better control temps

unless you do some testing and find out that lower pump speed is equal to higher pump speed (that is, same temps at 70% verses 100% under the exact same conditions) thereâ€™s no need for variable.","it doesnâ€™t sound like op is too confident using bios either, so itâ€™s probably best if itâ€™s left at full speed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah that's what i meant.,won't go above 80c unless u encoding videos 24/7 lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is no risk.,if the temps go too high the cpu will throttle.,many cpus are built these days in such a way that they boost as high as the temp and power envelope allows them (my 5950x is such with pbo enabled).,if the temp envelope comes first then they will throttle.,if the op is not throttling when running cinebench (and even if he was) he is fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
constant speed is constant at 70% or 100%.,i think running pump speed at 100 would reduce the life span of the pump .,also some pumps are loud at 100%.,since his cpu is in the 90s i would run pump speed at 100% but normally i don't think i would.,you also should be able to change the pump speed without using the bios.,at least with nzxt aios you can,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there's probably an optimum in terms of thermodynamics to be found here, not sure 100% is the absolute best in a void since water will circulate faster, thereby spending less time in areas where the actual heat exchange happens.",too slow however and the system will create heat faster than the loop can dump it.,"as you say, something around 70/80 could be a good idea, but of course that mostly depends on the pump rpm not on a percentage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i sometimes do video editing, i thought my 94c wasnt bad cause its a benchmark, i am not too pc tech savvy but i am pretty sure benchmarks dont really show realistic stuff, but it does show what to expect.","my cpu temps have been fine so far apart from the benchmark, which i dont know is good or not, i was expecting worse tbh",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nah the cpu with begin to lose time on the lifespan even before thermal throttling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its fine.,your cpu will self regulate to not go above safe levels unless you force it to do that through bios.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it should be fine in video editing.,"if you're afraid that it may be getting too hot, then monitor your temps using hwinfo64 while working.","if it goes above 80c, it'll be a good idea to get a better cooler.","and maybe update your bios, the newer bios versions disable avx512( i think.",you can also disable that in bios manually i think but not sure).,avx512 is essentially useless because only rare scientific apps use it.,avx 512 causes a lot of heat tho.,so that could be the reason of the cpu reaching 94c in cinebench even though it isn't the heaviest stress test.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hardly.,how many cpus have you had break on you without serious overclocking where voltages (not temp) damages them?,have you heard of that happening to anyone else so that it could be atrributed to temps below thermal throttling level?,i have not and i have had various computers for decades and have worked in the industry.,when moderate voltage related degradation would be even measurable the cpu is already well above 5+ generations old.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 12400-12600 will perform similarly besides igp performance.,"but the 12600k is a big step up with e-cores, extra cache, higher frequncies and power limit.","if your on a tight budget get the 12400(f), if you can afford the 12600k then get that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 3600 shouldnt be having stutters in every game.,it's a decent cpu.,i think it might be your gpu or just a corrupt os install,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you're playing cpu demanding games at lower resolutions (1080p) then you're probably maxing out your cpu.,but the best upgrade for you may be to get a higher resolution+frequency monitor.,"if you upgrade to 1440p@144fps or even 4k@60fps, you'll get a major upgrade in graphics without changing the cpu or gpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't think your 3600 is the cause of stuttering.,modern ryzen cpus are really good and the 3600 shouldn't be bottlenecking your rtx 3070 that much.,"have you been monitoring cpu, gpu, memory usage and temperatures during gameplay?",is the cpu at 100% usage or thermal throttling?,do some more research before you commit to change your whole platform.,"and if you conclude that the cpu is the problem, why don't you get a 5600x instead and keep your mobo (if it supports it).",use hwinfo64 for monitoring.,best of luck!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> i have a ryzen 5 3600 but i have stutters in game which i imagine is a experience most gamers have.,not at all.,i have the exact same cpu and it never ever stutters.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what games are you playing and at what resolution and frame rates?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there are plenty of reviews and discussions on the matter.,"in short, it depends on your budget and your needs.",either one is likely more than enough.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"useless post since it doesn't  specify any games or the rest of the rig, not sure why it has so many comments if op fails to provide the most elementary information required to give an advice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i came from a 3800x to a 12700k and the 1% lows are significantly better.,i was surprised how much smoother the difference was.,the 3000 series were great value but still quite a bit behind the equivalent intel at the time.,there were a number of games that were cpu bottlenecking on a 3070 at 1440p that no longer do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"don't think it's my gpu considering it's a rtx 3070. i have reinstalled my os many times in different ways (keeping programs and files, or only keeping files).","so i either think it is my cpu, ram or maybe my psu?",but honestly i have no actual clue,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i agree.,i have one and it's just great.,but maybe the op is playing cpu intensive games at 1080p@144fps+ without much ram?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my 3600 is definitely bottlenecking me in recent games (with a 3060ti)

dying light 2 sees gpu useage drop into the 70 percent range in the busier areas in the inner loop (and even lower in some very demanding spots).","far cry 6 was also a struggle at times, with framerates getting uncomfortably close to 60 fps and some noticable micro stutters even with gsync on

i remember cyperbunk running poorly (heavy cpu bottleneck) with rtx on

metro exodus was significantly cpu bottlenecked in the tundra map and certain areas of the first big map (forgot the name)

bf 2042 was a completely miserable experience too, but i'm not going to really count that game as it's a technical disaster

&#x200b;

the cpu also can't run any gamebryo games like fallout 4 at acceptable performance

&#x200b;

overall average fps is still good, but framepacing isn't up to snuff so a game getting 100 fps in less demanding areas means little when it's stuttering in other areas.",it's starting to feel about as bad as my 4690k did back in 2015 (with games like the division really starting to struggle),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

possibly.,could be using single channel.,he did state he has 16gb in later comments,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yep bf2042, same experience.",so i'm not that crazy to assume it just the cpu itself not really holding up with the frametime and framepacing eventhough it gets high fps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it probably is bottlenecking lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the part that's maxing out is the one holding your system back, or as we say, it's the system's bottleneck.","you usually want to max out the gpu, so that you have the best graphics you can while playing.","when you upgrade your gpu, you also step up the graphics (from medium to high or ultra) or step up the resolution (1080p to 1440p or 4k) or the monitor frequency (60 to 120/144/160hz+) and get the best graphics you can with that gpu.","if any other component is bottlenecking your gpu, then you're not getting the most out of gpu, and thus are getting lower graphics than you could if you were not bottlenecking it.",does that make sense?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

?,this whole post is about the cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes but u never mentioned the games,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you have this completely backwards.,"in a gaming rig you want the gpu to be the bottleneck and it provides absolutely no benefit to handicap your cpu to ""match"" your gpu .",leave the cpu stock and be happy.,you just need to upgrade the gpu whenever you can.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
first thing: you want a gpu bottleneck like u/sli_guy said.,if the cpu is used only 20% it's totally fine.,leave your cpu alone.,"there is no such thing as ""too fast of a cpu""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2 options here.,1 - gameplay is smooth.,"everything is fine, leave it as is, get a better gpu in 60 years when they're available.",2 - gameplay is stuttering with unstable fps.,get rtss or use game/driver settings to limit framerate to something reasonable.,"crippling your cpu is pointless, you can accomplish the same thing by just limiting fps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
please be a troll postâ€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why?,why would you deliberately limit the performance of your components?,thats never a good idea unless power consumption is an issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and even if it's to lower consumption, the gpu should be limited first anyway... (and then maybe underclock the cpu to where it won't max out any thread for that lowered voltage)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a few suggestions even tho i'm not pro.,reinstall the os.,sometimes conflicting drivers cause performance loss.,"also, if you're using windows 10, disable the e cores because win10's scheduler isnt designed for hybrid architecture and thus while gaming, it assigns the work to the e cores instead of the p cores.","if u use win11, u will not have this problem.",also 20k cinebench scores seems about 8k lower than usual.,it might be conflicting drivers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not sure if it wouldâ€™ve helped, but i wouldâ€™ve personally reinstall windows from a usb and wiped the existing partitions when changing platforms",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you don't need to reinstall windows.,uninstall any of the previously installed motherboard driver packages from your old machine.,delete their install folders and any leftover files.,"install the new drivers from your new motherboard manufacturer (and any bios updates)..

clear out (delete) any 'greyed out' devices in device manager (these correspond to your old chip and motherboard and they're greyed out because they aren't there anymore).",you'll need to enable 'show hidden devices' to see them.,this step is usually missed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"""detailed temps"" image isn't working.",there isn't much difference in benchmarks between windows 10 and windows 11. disabling e-cores just increases the ring bus frequency for the p cores giving them a bit more performance and power headroom.,go into control panel and uninstall all the amd programs.,"how many processes are running in task manager, less than 100 i hope?",try a malware scan.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'm open to trying it.,windows update just says my computer is eligible but i don't see an upgrade button,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and probably using windows 10 with alderlake.,he should disable e cores if he wants to keep using windows 10. i got to say i jumped from x79 to amd and then to intel with the same nvme windows installation xd.,i was suppose to do a clean install the first time i see an issue and so far nothing xd.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its recommended to do that every time you switch motherboards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"dont undersand too, cause he thinks probably newer is better lol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

can you point me to documentation that says disabling e-cores on win 10 has better performance?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is windows 11 a must for the 12900?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, it was actually a wash in terms of price and i was not expecting a generational leap, here is my rationale, i posted on another sub:

should i upgrade my 5900x to a 12900k?_x000d_  
_x000d_  
hear me out, i really like this chip (5900x), but i am having a few issues which haven not been resolved by bios, windows updates: stuttering in windows, while gaming, audio pop-ins, usb random disconnects etc._x000d_  
_x000d_  
i managed to get a 12900k for $450, and microcenter will swap out my dark hero motherboard (warranty), i plan on picking up with msi edge ddr4 motherboard, this way i can keep my ram kit.",i would have to re-sell my 5900x on ebay but i think i can cover my cost.,"going from the dark hero to the msi edge would be a $180 savings, and i think i can get at least $450 on ebay to cover my 5900x used, **so the cpu swap would be a wash.**_x000d_  
_x000d_  
i am getting a new mounting bracket for the intel 1700 from arctic for **free** since i only purchased my aio last year._x000d_  
_x000d_  
the cons would be swapping out the old board, higher power draw while gaming?","(idle seems lower than ryzen), zero upgradeability (was thinking of trying out the ryzen 3d v-cache new cpus in 2h 2022, heard they will use the am4 socket._x000d_

the pros would be smoother gaming, lower frametimes, no usb, audio issues, future proofing, at least until ddr5 is in end-life and prices come down, i usually only adopt a new ddr platform at the end of it's lifecycle.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not for gaming.,every major review outlet shows avg fps goes up with e-cores off and 1% lows skyrocket.,frametimes and stutter get way *way* flatter.,"the e-cores, when game thread randomly hops to them, are too slow and inhibit fps.","games don't need more than 6 p-cores anyway, so having the e-cores on is just waste, nevermind the slowness of them when game main thread tries to run on them.",you get around this by disabling e-cores.,you could also do it with process lasso.,"but out of the box the w10 scheduler is dumb, and if w11, op is running the scheduler profile the ryzen driver installs, so it'll stay dumb.","clean windows 11 should be ""ok"" with e-cores on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ah well.,"that fix seems to work fine on most z690 boards, but i see youâ€™ve got a b550.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have the 11400 and did plenty of research before buying.,i can recommend the asus tuf b560 or b560m gaming plus wifi (or without wifi).,have been using it for almost a year and have had no problems.,"well-priced too in my region, hopefully it is also in yours.",vrms are good.,heatsinks are good.,i/o is adequate.,bios easy to use.,black and slight yellow accents on the aesthetic look good.,pushes the i5-11400 to its max power limits and performance by default out of the box.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
u can get a 12400f with a b660.,much better performance.,tho mobo can be slightly more pricy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i5-11400 + rx 6800. meant for 1440p aaa gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bro thatâ€™s what iâ€™m trying to get (as in 1440p gaming) but iâ€™m broke.,do u have any recommendations for like a 1000-1500usd build?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my thinking was just put everything on the graphics card and upgrade the rest later on.,i think the news was saying though that amd expects the chip shortage to alleviate by late 2022. plus crypto is still crashing.,maybe you just gotta wait a little bit more for some good deals.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what do u think of 11400f paired with a 3050 build overall should cost around 1k usd.,the 3050 is around 450 usd which ik is overpriced but the best deal overall,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
get a 3070 if you can afford it.,itâ€™s the best budget to performance at msrp if you can get it like that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not any more than you can put an 1200 chip in an 1151 socket.,you should be able to keep your 1700 cooler with 1800 tho.,"it's just like how 1150, 1155, 1156 and 1200 are all the same size and use the same coolers.","once the number changes, the pinout changes and it's no longer compatible.","i'm not saying it wouldn't be possible to add pins and still keep it compatible with the same socket, it's just something intel has never done before.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1151 sockets weren't labeled 1200 though.,same for the rest.,but 1700/1800 labeled sockets.,since it carries the label it must support any chip branded 1800 eventually.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"intel is moving into the sensor business with mobileye among other things  - they have a need for analog manufacturing for things like silicon photonics and lidar - this gives them better control of supply chain for some of these non compute semi products that donâ€™t fit the newer fabs, good buy i think.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is intel gaining here?,"is there some specific technology they want easy access to, maybe even to transfer to 300mm, or is it mostly buying a customer base?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pretty strange acquisition.,"mostly obsolete fabs (19% on 300mm), 40% revenue from rf, mainly analog stuff.","i guess it is a decent back door into the foundry business, all of the nodes are badly affected by the shortages so nobody can try to run away.",couple interesting bits are the silicon photonics pdk and a foothold in defense/aero.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if this is part of intels' foundry plans, why didn't intel buy an american analog semiconductor company?",like on semiconductor.,all i can think of is that this is for mobileye.,yes i know on would cost more.,but is intel serious?,i doubt this helps intel's bottom line any time soon and it seems 5.4b could be part of a better investment.,"update: see [semianalysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbkfao1ouu8)

a little bit before the end of this video, dylan states that intel will stop buying back shares and dividend increases are likely to stop.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"experience foundry company that specializes in power ic, which intel hasnâ€™t produced probably in decades and also a customer base.",probably most of the old fabs wonâ€™t make it as most of the designs would be forward ported to current nodes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they are getting the ip and the people.,intel seems to want to expand their foundry business line so this makes a lot of sense.,"as tower has experience in rf, mems, and other specialized stuff.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not everything needs 7/5/3 nm nodes.,automotive/industrial chips can be made using larger nodes and do their function pretty well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
question from the clueless: can those dabs be converted towards addressing the chip shortage in the near terms?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
exactly.,most analog and rf chips can only be made at larger geometries.,these technologies are being actively developed by tower and similar foundries.,"it's lower stakes than the digital world given the volumes, but the same type of performance roadmaps and competitive dynamics apply.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no they canâ€™t be converted, but the 150mm fabs are probably making gallium nitride parts for the power ics.",150mm is the max size for gallium nitride wafers due to the brittleness.,anything in silicon could be moved to the new idm 2.0 300mm fabs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nah, they are frin 45nm upwards to more than 100 nm technologies.",they need would pretty complete reworks to address the market segments you are probably referring to.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"people seem clueless about analog, power, rf, and high voltage process techs.",towerâ€™s website says they have 65nm bcd (bipolar cmos dmos) which is very leading edge.,"200v soi is fancy, along with .13um analog friendly cmos.",they have very high speed sige and so on.,intel has experience in almost nothing that tower does.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and largely 200mm and below.,very old technology.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s informative and a little unfortunate.,appreciate the explanation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""old"" technology doesn't quite capture it.",the rf and analog market requires very different performance than digital.,fine geometries don't buy you much when you're dealing with high rf frequencies and high voltages.,cost is also critical.,"if you have to design many variations of products customized for different uses, like lnas for various handset makers and frequency bands, are you really going to spend millions for each product maskset?","these ""old"" fabs can be leading edge in their own way by offering better performance than anything else for their targeted application (say low noise amplifiers and rf switches for mobile devices).",advanced cmos from intel or tsmc can't touch the performance of these technologies for the application and are leagues more expensive.,my take on the acquisition of that intel can leverage its resources to maximize the value of tower's technologies while extracting a lot of value for their own nascent foundry business.,"the foundry mindset is very different than intel's, but time will tell how well these two companies can benefit each other.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

wouldn't i3 10100 or 12100f still make more sense even for office pcs?,celeron is likely to cause slow downs even when opening or switching between windows.,the loss of comfort isn't worth it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are overestimating how much work most office pcs have to do.,"many are used for email, simple web browsing and editing simple word/excel documents.",in addition in corporations it's not uncommon for employees to use thin clients which means that the pc they are using is only used to display a remote desktop and send inputs to it.,this cpu will be more than capable for that use case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah, but i'm getting the feeling people on budget should prioritize value over anything else.",if you can save up for a celeron you can probably save up for an i3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>have you actually used a duel core lately?,"no, but i'm using ryzen 5 1600 and i sometimes check how very basic tasks affect cpu utilization and the numbers lead me to believe a dual core would be suboptimal for virtually everything.",another reason why i don't think it's such a great offer is that given the performance difference (in my country i3 12100f is around 100% more expensive than this celeron) the value isn't really there either.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a bit of a poor comparison as the 1600 is 6 years old now so per core itâ€™s going to be quite a lot slower and even with that being said, if your 1600 is struggling with spreadsheets/browser tabs & an email client open then i think you have some issues there.",my 35w 200ge manages just fine (o_o).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah, the scheduler on w10 ""isn't aware"" that there's p & e cores available, but cpu parking p cores and always using e cores while idle or on low load makes me think there's more than that.",wouldn't think win10 is left without any support.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://youtu.be/xbftsej-yis and after this communication these tests come and show windows 10 performs about the same.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
process lasso is nice for this.,i tried it for a while on my 12900k before i just disabled the e-cores altogether.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's windows with processes that have low cpu usage.,the e cores aren't parked so processes go there first.,"once the load increases, it unparks core 0 and puts some load there.","if that's not enough, it unparks another.","i'd say i don't have issues, but those less cpu intensive games are causing some problems running on e cores.",will report back if i get any decent info.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"rename, edit a bat file, all annoying af",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why would microsoft put this much/any effort into an old product if they want everyone to use w11?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, too much hassle.",trying to fix it once and for all for all apps.,"will think about disabling e-cores again, though it's nice when you're just using the browser.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i also play some indie games, but never encountered a problem.",all of them are smooth as silk.,"well ... there is a bug in rdr2, i have to start prime95 before the game or it says my account is not active.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes but you can do a quick registry at it to bring back the classic right click menu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
since w10 is like 90%+ of the current desktop pc userbase.,intel launching a cpu that wouldn't work properly with a current os that can't be fixed with patches/hotfixes would be plain dumb.,it'd scream bad reviews everywhere.,"even before this, win10 could intentionally detect ""worse"" and ""better"" cores and use them in cpu intensive scenarios accordingly.",one thing i can do to check how it actually acts is downclocking all my e cores to 1ghz and see what it does also.,but wanted to see what others are doing since i know at least 10% didn't switch to w11.,"if it's a must, okay, will do, but till then i'd rather try and find a solution to go around it.",even most yt channels doing benchmarks show no actual difference of using either.,and w10 is supported till 2025 too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, i can't play rdr2 also, tried to play it the first day i assembled the pc.",denuvo drm issues... does disabling e cores help?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no 12th gens are shipping with w10, so i dunno about your theory... microsoft keeping os support to 2025 isn't to backport anything but to keep enterprise customers happy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i didn't had to, so no idea.","i load prime95, start the game, shut down prime95 and continue playing.","it is not a 100% solution, but it does help.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i get what you're saying, but every single board out there supports w10 along with w11.","most of them have a sticker being ""windows 11 ready"".",i just really don't think it's a must to go w11 route since my w10 scheduler has proven to be aware of e cores.,but to support that theory and see how it compares to w11 i actually do have to try it :) i was in the same boat owning an 8-core cpu years ago with windows 8.1. had to go windows 10 route to actually get the most out of it because... scheduler.,forcing me to switch os's every time instead of patching things is something i try to avoid at all costs since new os can sometimes even break more things than fix them.,i've got a software stack of around 25-30 programs (i'm a fullstack dev  + devops) and if i were to use this on software that's been created for w10 it could cause loads of problems.,while fixing only the cpu scheduler.,i hope you understand what i'm saying - i know you're right and those cpu's are to be used with the new intel thread director or whatever that thing is called - but why on earth limit it to windows 11?,"it's not something that's to be exclusive, it's a necessity for mainstream cpus from this generation forward to be used correctly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've confirmed rdr2 works if you disable e cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what's being a software developer matter?,i know plenty of web app devs who don't understand resource scheduling at the os layer.,"the os is designed to do plenty of functionality, interfacing with your hardware for you.","sometimes there's compatibility issues, sometimes there isn't.","seems you don't want to accept the resource scheduler premise, so you can continue tweaking the w10 scheduler with random troubleshooting for fun.","w10 and awareness of its hardware has nothing to do with knowing when to send specific workloads to which cores, which seems to be the case here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hopefully the kinks will get worked out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

glad you allotted some time for this build.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looks good - especially for a first build!,strong specs as well.,"if your aio tubes have enough length to flip the aio and have the tubes on the bottom that would be ""optimal"".",it won't necessarily hurt anything running it as it sits but over time you may notice some air bubble noises in the pump from having the tubes at the top where the air rises to.,"personally, i'd probably run 3x120mm fans in the front as intake and place the rad at the top as exhaust - takes advantage of natural convection and puts the pump below the entire radiator.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i know, me too.","my brain hurts when i see my ""cable management""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no problems mounting it that way aslong as the pump is lower then the radiator.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yepp, its the first pc i have built ðÿ˜š",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes fans blowing in any direction overpower natural convection but i don't think it hurts to orient things in a way to assist what happens naturally.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wasn't necessarily suggesting that orientation for temps but rather for pump noise and longevity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have the same case and you should be able to easily orient the tubes so they just bend up and towards the front of the case when the radiator is mounted up top.,i wouldnâ€™t think that it would bump into the gpu at all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i just honestly don't know how they do it, like i feel like i'm just using entirely different equipment.",my old rig was a nzxt h500 and my new one is in a fractal design meshify c and i feel both these cases have good cable management options but when i get the psu in it's just fucking chaos back there and i can't get them looking nice and i have to literally stuff them in like an overpacked suitcase,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

as long as the pump is lower than the highest point of the rad everything is fine..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"this will start with fees to unlock features,  and end in subscriptions to use your processor.","this should be rejected,  and loudly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is for server cpus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

because..?,"i see this as instead of features being fused off, they just get locked off with the ability to upgrade later.",you literally are not losing anything from that.,why would you care.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"you clearly don't understand, you're paying for that silicon anyway.",that's the situation *right now*.,"whether the feature is locked in software, or physically fused off the chip as it currently is, it doesn't change *anything*.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">i'm not with that okay either, i've personally been very frustrated bynvidia and amd preventing users from using advanced features like sr-iovand vgrid on consumer gpus that are very much capable of them

consumer gpus would never get the same feature set as enterprise, it's unavoidable segmentation.","the question is, why do you care how it is achieved?","we can achieve that with software, with hardware, or by going out and creating multiple different dies for consumer / enterprise.",these all have the *exact same effect*.,"the only difference is that software is the cheapest, while creating multiple dies is atrociously expensive, and as a consumer you'd just end up having to pay more for the exact same thing.","so why not let companies achieve it in the cheapest possible way, which also ultimately makes things cheaper for you?",">it makes it far easier for intel to paywall things, incentivizing them to do so.",what do you think they're going to paywall now?,"this move isn't really about creating new walls, it's about efficiency.","even if the walls don't change, intel can save money while potentially offering better products for some clients (who, say, don't need avx-512 right now, so they can avoid paying for those).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i will always recommend this.,the model number should be the cinebench score.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i plan to upgrade my rig from a 8086k to a 13900k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's possible they'll skip 14 which has major negative meaning in chinese language markets.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
microsoft did that though with office.,straight from version 12 (office 2007) to version 14 (office 2010).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's a good point.,i forgot about apple iphones.,although it's apple - customers buy it if they sold a brick.,theh literally sell a stand for 1000$.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i don't think it's a good idea to put so much importance on cinebench.,it's an important benchmark but not one that you'd tie your business to.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"because office is a product for the general public, that includes many retarded usa people.","that same public does not even know what a cpu is, so i would not be concerned about the naming.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that stand is targeted at a professional audience.,not at a â€œproâ€ audience like they do with all their products as a marketing term.,itâ€™s genuinely there for people who have large production companies that want to buy into the ecosystem.,is it too much?,yes.,is it justified by the fact that people have bought it?,i suppose so.,itâ€™s kind of like buying a lamborghini when you have an average income.,"itâ€™s ridiculous and not feasible, but somebody with money wants something extra because they can.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's because gay people are usually high income and take in great consideration design and fashion.,apple suits their needs very well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they actually started toying around with changing the naming scheme.,[take a look at this page](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/processors/processor-numbers.html).,this is how low power laptop cpus are named... i find it much more confusing than the regular high end naming.,they basically dropped a digit from the end.,confuses you whether it's 10th gen or 1st gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you know, there are multiple skus with the same amount of cores?",i swear this is a troll bot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what?,everything you dont like isn't a troll.,you do know that model numbers exist right?,i12 900k or i12 850k - will have same cores but different skus.,this isnt hard to understand.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
might not be a good idea imo consodering how variable humans on the road drive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there are multiple revisions of ax200 made by intel to fix hardware bugs.,"check the labels on the card, find the line starting with ""ta: k34403-"", and the following 001/002/003 is the hardware revision.",003 is the most stable version and 001 is absolute disastrous trash.,"if you got 001/002 you'd better replace that with a new one, or even better, an ax210 that is likely to be much more stable than any ax200.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good competition means we all win.,it just took intel a little bit to hit their stride but i think we're going to see some awesome competition ahead of us.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they sure are.,what's interesting is that on the client portfolio they are opting for big little but in server they are continuing all big cores.,i guess money and die space are no object in server space.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

vast majority of people don't need processors this powerful though.,we're talking *maybe* single digit percentile of people who need anything beyond 4-8 cores.,"anyway, i'm more concerned about software than hardware.",core count is becoming the new arms race but the rate at which applications are being developed to utilize them all is astoundingly behind.,many of the most popular applications the world uses daily (office/gsuite/zoom/slack) are still only single/dual core bound.,microsoft is doing better though and are designing their software to use 4+ cores lately.,video game elements like physics and npc's have to largely be single threaded tasks too.,"with all these cores, i just hope the software mostly catches up to make use of them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is good progress.,"intel have been pretty much mia in the high multithreaded market for a while, and amd have been totally dominant in this respect.","i personally am all about mt performance as well, and the 3960x has served me well for 2.5 years.","i do think by raptor lake it will be knocking on 3960x territory, that's great.","amd won't be standing still however, and the idea that ryzen desktop not zen 4, tops out at 16 cores is a rumour.","amd are going to 5nm, they have a higher 170w tdp and a smaller io die, that means more power for higher clocks and cores.","amd will want to compete with intel and whilst intel use performance and efficiency cores, amd scale with chiplets.",i reckon amd will have an extra chiplet on a high end cpu to go beyond 16 cores.,"with zen 4 will come the high single core speed, how high remains to be seen.",it remains to be seen whether intel will restart hedt or whether they believe standard desktop will cover most needs for mt and io demands.,but things are looking tasty.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"> 280w vs 105w

yeah.. erm no.",if you ever used any of these cpus you'd know those numbers are pointless.,a 5950x with all cores loaded during a render will eat a lot more than 105w.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
threadrippers are hedt (high end desktop) and have unreal performance in multi threading.,"to beat such a processor with ""normal"" i9 will be quite an achievement by intel.","top of the line threadripper from the same gen, 3990x, won't be beat until 2024 or so by i9 (in multi threading)

reason why this is significant is because of intel push of hyrbid architecture which allows for massive core count increases we have consumer level cpus already beating hedts and we are not limiting single thread and frequency either.","if it was amd way, we would be ""stuck"" at 16 medium sized cores for who knows how long.",and biggest multi threading improvements always come from increasing core count.,"if zen 4 tops out at 16 cores, i m almost 100% sure it won't beat 3960x and their normal ryzen 9 with 12 cores doesn t stand a chance",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>many of the most popular applications the world uses daily (office/gsuite/zoom/slack) are still only single/dual core bound.,microsoft is doing better though and are designing their software to use 4+ cores lately.,video game elements like physics and npc's have to largely be single threaded tasks too.,"beyond 8+8, most desktop users would be better off with more cache instead of 8 more e-cores for raptor lake.",+36mb of additional l3 instead of +6mb and +8 e-cores would be a bigger improvement overall in a weighted application benchmark for a similar area.,the problem is reviewers focus on cinebench and blender.,every generation needs more cores to keep climbing that dumb ladder.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>many of the most popular applications the world uses daily (office/gsuite/zoom/slack) are still only single/dual core bound.,that's because they're glorified web apps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i agree most people have no use for this much cores but still to have (3rd gen) threadripper performance while maintaining high single thread perf at reasonable prices is simply amazing work done by intel and proves that hyrbid architecture was right choice because since ps5 has 8c/16t and future games will be made after that there is no reason to go above 8 perf cores.,"meanwhile, many e-cores provide massive performance if you do something like rendering or simulations.",and arrow lake is supposed to up the number all the way to 40c/48t.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are completely wrong.,12600k a 10 core processor alone will make up more than that 1% and it's only a mid range.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

13th gen yes: ddr4 and ddr5 as well.,"14th gen is....tbd

rumor puts 14th on lga1700, but it may be ddr5 only, so only current ddr5 boards will support it while ddr4 only gets the 2 generations.",intel could also give 14th a new socket entirely.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on what kind of servers.,"i'd *love* a server chip that was just like, 128 atom cores.","i'd also love one that was just 2+16, or 8+0.",we have uses for all sorts of balances between them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a 5950x *stock* will use 105w +-10 package power + 15w io die power.,the ppt is 144w so it won't exceed that number for total socket draw.,"like, yeah your cpu cooler is going to be cooling more than 120/130 watts or so, but the cpu itself isn't blowing out its own power consumption numbers.","certainly nowhere near 200 or 280.

turn pbo etc on and that changes the ppt higher so it *can* blow out power.",just not stock vs stock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i mean the largest reason it's not ""necessary"" is because it hasn't been available.","look at things people are able to produce at home with modern cpus and especially gpus, it's crazy.",people making commercial quality work in their basements.,these things have to exist before they can be adopted.,also a bigger reason for cpus going higher core instead of wider is the difficulty in keeping defects down and power contained on modern nodes.,if they could make a fat 2 core cpu with 6x the ipc at 6x the cache per core they would absolutely do it and software engineers around the world would cheer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, if only the power budget can go to a much bigger cache...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

>around 175w.,142w is the default setting for ppt.,"but at stock settings the ppt isn't the limit for the 5950x, it's actually the default tdc settings that limit performance.","so what actually ends up happening is that in fully multi-threaded workloads like cinebench the 5950x pulls about 120-125w, and that's about it.",it gets stuck at 3.7-3.8ghz all core at the same time.,"source: have 5950x and have tested this, but you can also refer to [anandtech's results here.","](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16214/amd-zen-3-ryzen-deep-dive-review-5950x-5900x-5800x-and-5700x-tested/8) they ran into the same issue, although they don't seem to have explained why.","241w vs 142w isn't double the power consumption, i give you that, but your comment just seems dishonest on purpose.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5950x and 12900k both trade blows in different multi threading benchmarks but 5900x?,it is not in the same league as these two.,12700k and 5900x are better matched,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
awesome!,"i got shafted on skylake, so that is good to know about the upgrade path.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you'll love amd's upcoming big.little then - dumbed down super fast 128 cores for your server.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's misleading at least.,that 105w is the cpu power consumption without taking into account parts of the actual cpu.,and if you want all multithreading performance that from that cpu you'll have to turn on pbo.,it's not like the 3960x doesn't go well over the 280w mark depending on settings and cooling capacities.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8 core zen 2+â€¦ not even comparable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i covered that caveat of the stock ppt including the io die.,and most people wonâ€™t need to unlock ppt higher than that.,the zen efficiency curve means they perform about as well at 105w/144w as they do unlocked.,and games wonâ€™t consume much more than 60 watts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"performance wise, no.","but a lot of games are being designed for xbox/ps, then ported to pc.",but this still hasnâ€™t happened.,so i donâ€™t see why the ps5 would accelerate this process of software using more cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most people don't buy a 5950x.,and it's primary usecase is not gaming.,i'm just saying.. advertising the 5950x as a 105w cpu is not really honest.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"jaguar consoles were 8 core, yes, but iirc exposed 6 or 7 total threads to games.","ps5/xbs expose 14 threads on 7 cores to games, and some titles are already maxing that out.","but until games move past being bound by a single main thread, the only thing that matters *really* is single core ipc/clock, which is why we can see 12100f gaming just about as well as a 12900k or 5950x",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a 5950x.,it uses less power than a 5800x or practically any similarly rated intel cpu.,"delta over idle at stock is about 148w, when factoring in psu efficiency and vrm efficiency that's only about 125w to the cpu.","the motherboard will wick away about 20w of heat, leaving 105w of heat for the heatsink.. and that's how thermal design power is calculated.","max power delivery of am4 is 142w, iirc, but that's not sustained in practice without pbo tweaking.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah.. let's exclude components of the cpu so that it looks more effcient on paper.,">delta over idle at stock is about 148w, when factoring in psu efficiency and vrm efficiency that's only about 125w to the cpu.",soc on ryzens is always on so that 125w is not the whole cpu power consumption.,it's just the difference between baseline and load with your settings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i am not excluding anything on the cpu, i have detailed logging and external power monitoring through my ups.","psu and vrm are not part of the cpu, total 5950x power draw, mine anyway, which is an early sample, is roughly 125w sustained max.","tdp isn't a specification for power draw, it's the amount of heat the heatsink needs to dissipate.",am4 105w tdp cpus draw up to 140w.,intel 95w cpus can easily draw more than 160w.,12900k can pull 240w...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that powerdraw seems to depend on a lot of things.,my 5900x draws 144w on stock settings with an arctic freezer 360 aio.,with a dark rock pro4 it went lower than that.,turning on pbo makes it draw 180-200w as it hits cooling limits but performance goes up 20%(multi-core).,tdp is anything the manufacturer wants it to be.,it's not an exact unit like watts or horspower are.,intel is just as guilty i agree.,they labeled the unlocked 9900k as a 95w part...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"on the 12700, threads 17-20 are e-cores which run cooler since they're clocked at a paltry 3.5ish ghz.","as for the difference in cores temps for p-cores (threads 1-16), it is typical to see a difference of 8-13c between the coolest and hottest p-cores under a 100% load.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i believe its cinebench load distribution among cores.,"i noticed pretty same situation with 12900k, believe its not a big deal, software needs some years to adopt to new architecture (i hope so).",your temps are fine for me as cinebench usually heats up to 100 deg on air cooler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thread 20 is an e-cores thread so it's runs much cooler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is super impressive!,"the only thing you need (though this started a little later than the pentium ii era..  but you have the modern case..) is a window mod for the old spinning harddrive..

fantastic rebuild showing off some cool hardware and kudos for the time and effort put into even doing folds for the ide cables.,i would love to feature this build in our asus pcdiy #builderspotlight live stream so please consider submitting it.,"i am torn in the approach to use a vertical mount for the gpu while it shows off an awesome card the horizontal mount shows of the board more and is more in ""theme"" but overall this is a stunning retro build.",thumbs up all around!,looking forward to your submission.,#teamasus pcdiy #builderspotlight,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

amazing!,"i had a voodoo 3 3000 pci and i still remember the first time i ran nfs high stakes using glide, the change from using software rendering was astonishing!",i wanna build a pc for all the games i have for win98,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> i've always adored the pentium ii, for what a leap forward it was at the time, the fact that you could run dual processors

don't forget [the original pentium did smp too!",](https://www.vogons.org/viewtopic.php?t=62732),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would have dropped a 10k scsi or found a way to do ssd caching or something.,would be awesome to run redhat 5 on this lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you!,i really was eager to get them mounted vertically - i really like the look of the voodoo2 being completely covered in chips.,"those and the pentium ii cartridges were such a chonky, pretty look for hardware at the time and nobody got to look at them because we were all just using the bog-standard beige cases of the era.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
easily my go-to retro game.,"this machine is pretty overpowered for descent, but it runs it (and descent 2, 3, and freespace 1 and 2) beautifully.","i adore those games, and they actually hold up pretty well today.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it wasn't - this machine (and the machine i had at the time) is dual-booted with windows 98 (where you'd only use one cpu), and nt 4 (later windows 2000).","i tended to stick to windows 98se for games, and go to windows 2000 for heavier-weight stuff like desktop publishing and photo editing.","later on windows 2000 got better at gaming, and i spent most of my time there.","this was particularly good for doing things like playing mp3s in the background while gaming, or running icq, etc.",without it impacting game performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you so much!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i've definitely been on the train of upgrading and reselling my old parts for like 30 years, so nothing in this machine is from any of my daily driver builds.","that said, i have been building up a collection of parts for the last few years, so some of it i already had, notably the pentium iis, optical drive, and the sound card.",anyway _most_ of the parts were really cheap.,"i think the processors were $5 for the pair when i got them, and most of the drives and cards were no more than $50 each including shipping.","the really expensive parts were the case, since it's new, and the voodoo2s - i specifically wanted a matched pair of those stb cards with the dark pcb, since the plan was always to vertically mount them.","those cost like $300usd for the pair, which was a bit painful.","then again, i lusted after them as a teenager like you wouldn't believe, and i could never have afforded them.",so getting to play with them now feels pretty amazing.,they're awesome.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so before i built this machine, i picked up [one of these](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/b004hax7ou/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=utf8&psc=1) and was able to get the sidewinder working really well, for both windows games, and dos games under dos box, if you felt like playing with the sidewinder again.","you do need to do a little messing around with the switches on the unit (note: switches are _only_ read when it powers up, so if you change something, unplug it and replug it - lost a _lot_ of time before i figured that out).","once it's done though, works great.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thanks so much!,"those ide cables ended up being really fun to do, though i broke an awful lot of plugs before i figured out how to do it gently.","i initially tried to do the build with rounded cables, but the case is _so huge_ it just ended up looking like there was a lot of empty space.","this ide cable origami ended up filling the space, and i think it looks pretty cool.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i do have a youtube channel, though it's mostly just a dumping ground so i can send links to people or post them on reddit.",unfortunately this build predates me actually filming work i do on these machines.,"that said, maybe i could put together a smaller tour video of the thing - i've gotten a number of questions about the vertically mounted pci cards, as well as the front-panel audio stuff, so there's some material there.",i actually have a pair of pentium iii 850s for it!,"they're not slotket, but full slot 1 packages.","i'm fairly limited in my options for p3 upgrades on this rig because the fsb on the board maxes out at 112mhz (and really you should run it at 100 for proper bus timing), and p3s are multiplier locked.",the 850s are 8.5x100 chips and work really nicely.,"i wanted a pair of the 10x100 1ghz chips but collectors know how rare they are, and they were beyond my reach.","anyway, i occasionally swap the p2 400s for p3 850s, and the matrox millenium for a radeon ddr vivo to get that '2001' feel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it didn't, but i was actually a little surprised about that.","the sound card is isa, so i wasn't sure what to expect.",i have a 300w supply from an inwin a500 that i was going to fall back to if the corsair didn't work.,i haven't found any issues at all though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

like... are you asking why?,"i mean there is something resembling utility here - i had a retro gaming space pre-pandemic that i've given up to use as an office while i'm wfh, so i wanted to build a machine i could play retro games on while sitting at the same desk as my modern gaming rig, but without having a bunch of extra peripherals around, or an old-style case.",this was my solution.,"that said, what i just wrote is the *excuse,* not the actual reason.",i just wanted to.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">window mod for the old spinning harddrive..

i'm not sure if i love you or hate you for suggesting that.","it really is an incredible idea, and would really add to the build.","hmm.. i need to be careful though - that disk was new in box, so i'd probably need to find something more easily sacrificed.",too bad i don't have access to the clean room i used in grad school.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dear god no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and it was actually more stable too...if an app locked the only thread and would not relinquish it...the os would freeze.,having a second thread for the os allowed the killing of the bad thread on the other processor...recovering from what would be an almost certain hard reboot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i agree, thereâ€™s something about being able to see both the p2 cartridges and  the underside of the voodoo2 all together, and itâ€™s a different chonky to the modern 3 slot coolers (ridiculous imo but thatâ€™s because iâ€™m a sff guy)

enjoy the build!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don't get lost on the way out!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

cool build, sir.",respect.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is good to know.,i have been a bit reluctant to attempt a retro build from this era because of potential -5v issues and not really wanting to trust old power supplies.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no you wonâ€™t have to change anything for the max boost clock.,only thing that you would want to change on non-k cpus is the max boost duration.,this is easily changed in the bios or the intel extreme tuning utility.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you should check if you can find reviews for prebuilt machines from that manufacturer.,what the other user said is theoretically true but some manufacturers use absolutely stupid settings for the cpu in their prebuilt systems.,it might be locked to 2.5ghz when all cores are active which would seriously hurt gaming performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the last part isn't necessarily true.,"some brands are limited because there aren't aftermarket options for some psus or mobos, or some have proprietary parts that only work with other proprietary parts, but you can replace both, or use an upgrade by the company in some cases.",some are very limited by space and might need modifications or a new case to accommodate.,"it's possible to upgrade prebuilds, especially nowadays, ometimes they're just a pain in the ass to upgrade because they don't have individual future intentions in mind.","i would agree though, it's always better to build yourself.",unless the world runs out of semiconductors and you are in dire need of  a rtx-30 series gpu lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
people seem to have a huge misunderstanding of air coolers so i would like to clarify.,if you are running the processor at stock (intel default power settings) ect your cooler is rated at fully supporting the cooling needs for maximum stock turbo boost operation ect [https://ncc.noctua.at/coolers/nh-u12s-chromax.black-11/cpu/intel/lga%201700](https://ncc.noctua.at/coolers/nh-u12s-chromax.black-11/cpu/intel/lga%201700) .,it also notes that unless you bought it after 11/21 you need to order the bracket for lga 1700 found here for proper mounting on the new boards.,[https://noctua.at/en/webforms/form/preview/id/44](https://noctua.at/en/webforms/form/preview/id/44) also you may need to look into a new case but if not a priority then do the leg work and remove your board to install the proper bracket.,also verify are your fans oriented on the cooler and the case to push air through and out the back?,you might have one on wrong trying to blow air off the cooler into your front fan which is likely blowing the air right back allowing no heat to really leave (simple mistake just doublecheck all your fans for proper mountain orientation.,please do not buy an aio as that is not needed and a waste of money for a product that would be noisier and provide no real benefit for someone not actively trying to overlclock the proccessor.,finnaly update your bios if not current bios and again or even 2x use the reset settings in it to clear anything that might just be stuck (i have seen some things fail to revert on the 1x try.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is abnormally hot for gaming and idle.,are you using the lga1700 bracket or the legacy mounting holes on the asus board?,what case do you have and fans?,what voltage are you running at?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nh-u12s is pretty small for the i7 12700k imo.,"had one for my new i9 10850k and it was not enough for the chip, it was hard crashing my pc because of 100-celsius temps.",i went to a liquid cooler and now only reaches 65 to 70 degrees celsius under high load now.,so i recommend at least a 2 fan liquid coolers or a really big air cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"itâ€™s the cooler, but even with the nh-d15 in a huge case with good airflow like mine, itâ€˜s gonna get hot.","my advise and many others do it, set a undervolt offset, you will probably not feel a difference in performance, but a huge drop in temperature.",i have an offset of -0.025v and it brought me down about 10c.,"so try maybe -0.025 or -0.05v and you will be ok, even with this cooler.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1/ air-cooler is too small

2/ cpu by default is heavily overvolted.","needs undervolting

3/ aio min 280mm better 360-420mm needed - especially if you want to ""overclock"" a bit.",4/ you got b660 so you won't make an undervolting.,z690 needed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
take off your cooler look at the thermal paste and determine if it the cpu and the cooler have good contact.,"u12s is probably not sufficient to cool your cpu under benchmarking but it shouldnâ€™t be that hot during gaming, unless you are playing cpu intensive strategy games that use avx.","if you see a pile of thermal paste at the center of the cpu that means your cpu is bent by the retaining bracket, try the 1mm washer method.",another way to determine if your cpu is bent is using something with a straight edge like a metal ruler and align it on top of the cpu with a flashlight in the back.,if you see any light between the center of the cpu and the ruler you know your cpu is bent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what are the temperatures of your gpu ?,if theyre high as well it means the airflow in your case is low/bad.,"if gpu temps are low but cpu high, then change cooler, no other solutions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
u should check a few things.,1st bios fan curves the default ones probably do not utilize your fans to its full potential.,2nd make sure u did not use the low noise adapter of the cpu cooler.,3rd litterly every new motherboard raises the power limit the cpu can draw and possibly several other things you actualy can adjust to get the temp down.,litterly nearly every board these days oc the cpu in some way in default settings.,pretty sure the asus board somewhere has a setting where you can limit the cpu power draw to 190watt wich would be stock intel spec if iam not mistaken.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i bought the cooler about 2 weeks ago, and have the properly marked and labeled bracket installed.",i verified this when i received the cooler.,"as for fan directions, those are correct as well.",my case may be constricting some airflow but the fans are working correctly.,i also verified the bios is up to date.,"i do think the cooler is probably undersized for the processor, and my case is probably adding to the affects of that.","all the fans spin as directed by the bios, and behave as expected so it isn't something wrong with the fan curves either.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
an aio is not only better at heat-dissipation it is also quieter under load than any equivalent air cooler.,"comparing a noctua-nhd15 (100$) vs an arctic liquid freezer ii 360 ($110) the arctic liquid freezer ii is way quieter, dissipates way more heat, and takes up less room near your ram modules.",aios are way better in most situations than air-coolers at this point.,the only reason to use an nhd15 is if you have a super small case or you're using a super bad motherboard that needs vrm cooling.,i would suggest at least googling information before you mislead others.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i am running at stock voltage, have a ""deepcool tesseract sw mid tower case"", with 4 chassis fans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"also, i am using the lga1700 bracket that was supplied with the cooler",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i do wonder about your case but it shouldnâ€™t be that stark a difference and no way is noctuas compatibility guide saying fully supported for people to get your tempsâ€¦.if you can try and remove the hdd trays in the case to allow less inhibited airflow in the front?,"also just something to test, is this the same behavior if your xmp is off entirely and itâ€™s running its bare compatible stock memory baseline settings.","i know asus cucks up its settings so thereâ€™s a xmp to run your memory at the rated speed but then thereâ€™s another xmp setting that also applies some form of overclock to the cpu along with the memory, again just stupid behavior on the motherboards part.",maybe you did just get unlucky with your bracket and or motherboard itself?,"that said even in worst case try the d15 cooler, i have it and it keeps my 11700k cool as a cucumber (running it stock) has no issues though when gaming and even when i stressed it with a few laps of cinebench i donâ€™t believe a core got over 72c.",your cpu i know does draw a little more power but even under load iâ€™d expect a top end temp of maybe 76-78c (which is perfectly good temps to get under a stress testing workload) i donâ€™t think under gaming my cores even surpass 68c (as the overall cpu usage is usually only 20-40% in any given title.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

clearly the smart money is that veteran gpu manufacturers are going to maintain their position as the leaders in gpu technology for the first few years.,intel could pull a rabbit out of a hat; but its probably not wise to assume that intel will have competitive top-tier performance to match x900 an x090 from amd and nvidia respectively.,if they can match x800 and x080 performance that would be a serious accomplishment.,we can be reasonably hopeful that they will have very good mid and low range products at highly competitive prices though.,"that's what most people buy anyway 

but hey, it'll be pretty cool if intel can compete with flagship products",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think it's too early, but even a x70/x700 competitor at a good price is good enough for a lot of people.","don't forget, most customers are interested in x50/x50ti/x60/x60ti/x70 variants and amd equivalents.",the people running rtx 3090/3080 and rx 6900/6800xt aren't as much as the average redditor thinks.,there is a reason the gtx 1060 is still the most popular card and the rtx 2060 has its own fair share as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ddr5 is not worth unless you want to spend the extra money.,beside that maybe wait a bit and get a 12700k if possible as the 11gen was a bit on the weaker side but they are still great cpus.,so if you have to choose get a 11700k then as more cores are better even if the i5 is faster in clockspeed but as soon you multitask you will have more cpu utilization and things might become laggy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">also, tdp on cpus isn't literally how much power they are going to/supposed to use.",that's a measurement of how hot they get.,*thermal* design power.,umm... no.,power use and heat generation are literally the same thing.,all the power the cpu eats turns to heat.,tdp is an arbitrarily decided number.,in intel's definition it is the maximum amount of power the cpu can use when running at its defined base power.,so basically if you run prime95 at base clock then you will be at tdp.,conversely at tdp power level the cpu should never run a workload under the base clock speed.,when power limits are enabled (typically in non-k and laptop cpus) tdp (or pl1) is also the maximum average power the cpu is allowed to use.,average is defined by a exponentially weighted moving average filter with time constant tau.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i explained exactly what tdp is.,directly from intelâ€™s documentation.,cooler has to be able to dissipate at minimum tdp amount of heat because tdp is the maximum average heat output.,with smaller heat dissipation the cpu always overheats under load.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
compute is what makes the heat.,only energy that doesn't convert to heat inside a cpu is whatever little comes out as signal to other devices.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and i'm saying that their listed tdp values are not constant or sustained in normal use.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm not sure what you mean with constant or sustained.,tdp doesn't change during runtime so it certainly is constant.,sustained doesn't seem to apply to the concept at all.,the advertised tdp is equal to standard pl1 setting.,with k-series chips it's only meaningful as an indicator of power level at base clock.,"edit: 

intel cpu measures the package power it consumes.",this is the instant heat output at any given time.,this is limited by some power limit.,the cpu also computes an average power estimate over a period of time.,this is done with an ewma filter i mentioned earlier.,"time constant ""tau"", which is the third relevant boost parameter besides pl1 and pl2, relates to how the filter weights previous state over the latest measurement.",intel standard (turbo boost 2) boost system allows the cpu to consume up to pl2 amount of instant power (and thus instant heat output) as long as the average power (and thus average heat output) is still under pl1.,when the average power reaches pl1 the instant power limit drops to pl1 so the average can never go over it.,with longer tau the average follows the instant measurement slower and thus boost can be longer.,tdp is an advertisement value that tells how big this maximum average heat output is at standard settings.,"given standard tau value it is technically also the minimum required cooling capacity to not overheat under load, although cooling is really a lot more complicated problem which can't be reduced to a single number like this.",as i said it's not really relevant with k-series since they don't have standard power limit settings but are expected to run with however much the motherboard can supply.,there have been some new additions to the turbo system for laptop cpus which enable the manufacturer with some extra boost options and dynamic power limit values.,but the basic system is still the same.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>the only reason power usage scales up with load is because it powers those circuits on to process the commands.,no.,"cpu power consumption is sum of leakage power, which you would reduce by gating input power of entire regions in the circuit as your link presents, and dynamic power consumption which happens due to transistors operating, which you would reduce at idle by ""clock gating"" which means stopping the transistors from switching when there is no reason for them to do so.",leakage is the current that goes through the transistor even if it should be closed.,dynamic power is the current that goes through the transistors when they open to charge the capacitance in the circuit (+some short circuit power).,dynamic power is directly proportional to the cpu frequency and to the square of the input voltage (and also directly proportional to capacitance receiving the current).,"leakage depends on the operating voltage, transistor dimensions and the threshold voltage of the transistors.",in very small high frequency transistors leakage current is a problem because smaller leaks more and faster requires lower threshold voltages.,leakage used to be very small in older cpus but with smaller planar transistors it got very high.,the major reason transistors went from planar to finfet was to make smaller transistors that leak less.,with finfets the leakage became much smaller and dynamic power was again the main issue.,apparently with 5nm finfets leakage starts to be a problem again (according to random interview of some industry people).,regardless of all that i wouldn't say that leakage power is not used for computation.,it is an integral part of what is consumed when doing computations.,ultimately it doesn't matter if the current goes through dripping little by little or when they open the tap.,"afaik cpus only actually power gate the cores when they enter c6 state (""deep power down""), because it's relatively slow to power them on again.",between c1-c5 there is only different levels of clock gating and some voltage reduction.,so disable c states to see how much the cpus consume at idle when they are fully powered on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">regardless of how it works, cpu's still generate 100% heat for 100% of the watts put into them.",even the wattage used for compute gets put out as heat as it can't thermodynamically do anything else.,we're not operating with zero-point energy here.,that is exactly what i said and you objected to it.,the problem in your original comment was the idea that the efficiency for compute is bad.,that's like saying that the efficiency of a wood cutter is bad because that all goes to heat too.,there is no special energy stored to two pieces of wood that is not in one piece.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

its worth upgrading if games you play does not show desired amount of fps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
worthy can only you tell.,"considering you are playing at 1440p the 12700k should be enough, you are limited by your gpu  most of the time.",the 12600k with some fast ram should also be a noticeable upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, which resolution will you be playing on?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
upgraded from 7820x to a 5950x.,definitely helped bring up minimums and make frame times feel much better.,12900 should have a very similar feel maybe slightly more so even.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if your system is not delivering smooth gameplay an upgrade to something like a 12600k would be good.,or 12700k if you want it for 5+ years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it will always depend on the types of games you play.,"some games are 99% of the time gpu limited, and others, even at 4k, can be cpu limited.",while you are playing games you should take a look at task manager or a performance overlay like rtt and see if your cpu is holding you back.,(remember to look at per-core usage and not overall usage as that can not tell the whole story),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">1 x 16gb 2400mhz

well there's your problem.",you need two sticks to use full bandwidth.,"if you have a z-series board you can buy a 3200cl16 xmp kit and use it, otherwise you're stuck at 2666 max xmp.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm using a i5 9600kf and in most games these days it runs at 70-100% usage 50 - 60c range.,those cpus are just not enough in 2022 unfortunately there's nothing wrong with your cpu imo 6 cores / 6 threads are just not a lot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i would wait for as long as you can for maybe 14th gen. if you cant, maybe 12400f or 12700f would be ideal with some faster ram and a b660 motherboard.",all up it would probably cost you $400-$500,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it might be because your cpu is failing,  your cpu is bottlnecking your gpu.","so in theory, if you had a weaker gpu, your cpu would have a much better utilization.","practically, you'll need to either downgrade your gpu or upgrade your cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the problem is my motherboard is a asus h310 plus so i only have 2 slots and i think the ram is capped at 2400 mhz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9600k can run any modern game at a very good framerate and barely any game scales any good past 6 threads but ok.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also i donâ€™t think it is malware as the game itself is using 90+% of my cpu and the other 10% is chrome/discord etc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i normally play games like escape from tarkov and battlefield 5 and i have tried wiping my pc but the problem was not resolved,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"wow okay, what ram speed?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tbh dunno nothing crazy average speed i guess 2400mhz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
okay good to know.,i think i may just be in need of an upgrade,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"h610 for gaming, if you're going to buy max 3200 ddr4 ram then there is no benefit from the b660.",also i don't recommend you get the celeron g6900 or the pentium g7400.,they might be better value right now but if you take into account that the pc will have to be upgraded much sooner then anything under an i3 is very bad value.,it costs more per year of use if you take into account the shorter time until obsolescence and replacement.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"its fine , locked 3200mhz ram ,but you dont need anthing higher .older nvme and pci slot but you probally dont really care .",most ppl build pc with the mindset better be safe than sorry but the h board totally fine if you plan to use it and throw it away(not upgrade) .,just dont stick a 12th gen i5-k or higher into it  .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on the manufacturer but usually h610 is barebones for light office load.,"though 5600g with older motherboard should not have the high price-up of mobos and it will guarantee 60 fps on games (such as minecraft, i can see intel igpus dropping below 50 frames often with fast graphics) and it will support minecraft mods that make game heavier.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"memory overclocking is probably the biggest difference plus 2 more dimm slots and other features, on the long run they may come in handy so if you can get him b660 board then do so.","also get him an i3, the 4c/8t will come in handy on the long run too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you considered amd?,if going integrated gpu i believe their 5600g/5700g is notably more capable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the board model determines the vrms, not the chipset.",but generally the more expensive the board the better the vrms.,"h610 only has pcie 3.0, 2 memory slots.","but when you're asking to do such basic tasks, that really isn't a deal breaker unless you plan to upgrade this pc into a much more expensive one, which probably won't happen.","i don't know what cpu you are planning to use but if it's an i3-12100 or worse it really doesn't matter, you should be fine using the cheapest crustiest board you can find.",if it's a 12400-12600 maybe consider getting a nicer b660 board ($140).,but if it's out of your price range h610 is still perfectly fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks everyone for your input - i ended up going with a b660 motherboard and the i3-12100 in the end.,"probably didn't need the b660 but it was only â£14 more expensive so meh, why not.","stuck with i3 as wanted the quad core and by the looks of it, this smokes the low-end ryzens.",unfortunately couldn't find a reasonably priced 5600g otherwise i would have seriously considered that.,going with 16gb ram which should be enough for now for most appliactions and a cheap m.2 (pcie 3.0) drive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah that's the other route - i was going to go i3-12100 just to cover off some games not working due to the dual-core thing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i was thinking of getting the i3-12100.,i know it's overkill for what he uses it for but i figure when he's a teen it may still be ok to throw in a gpu for some heavier 1080p gaming.,it'll never overclock (just not interested in that side of things).,just wanted to make sure i'm not missing something really obvious.,so b660 would be ready for pcie 4.0 (i.e.,next-gen rtx cards etc)?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"h610 boards usually have pci-e 4.0 for the gpu, just not for ssd but pci-e 3.0 is enough for ssd haha.",only the most expensive ones need pci-e 4.0. pci-e 3.0 can handle up to 4000mb/s ssd speed which is very high.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i regret to inform you we have known what raptor lake will be bringing and its late 22 release timeframe since before alderlake even released this past fall.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just do what i do and put your old chip in an little itx for plex and storage duties.,then you can slim down your main system and just install the minimum for performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
glad i got a z690 with option to upgrade to 13th gen. might go for a 13700k if it really impresses in benchmarks and sell my 12600k for a decent return.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

imo rocket lake's release in march of 2021 was a placeholder to keep intel's desktop line fresh since everyone knew alder lake would be released toward the end of last year.,"intel will probably launch the k-series 13th gen chips late this summer or in the fall with non-k sometime thereafter at the very end of the year or early next year, which would be like 10-12 months between 12 and 13 gen releases.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'm upgrading at lakey lake ( core gen 69 ),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
naw.,it will be a revision of current architecture.,"not an overhaul like we saw between 11th and 12th gen. minor revision, like 8th to 9th.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they confirmed it lga1700.,"looks.... i know u hate intel, but spreading fake new doesn't make other people follow you....",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hedt could still serve a purpose as it is the pcie lanes that matter in that chip now rather than the core count.,although the rumors for the intel hedt that is allegedly launching in q3 are pretty spicy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"amd's threadrippers offer a lot more cores and quad channel, though.",intel's also used to be higher than their desktop parts until they got stuck on 14nm forever.,zen 2-3 only goes up to 16 while tr went as high as 64.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think the maximum price for mainstream platform cpu need to go back to below $500 like it used to be.,otherwise there isnt any market left for hedt.,it is just too small to be worth the trouble.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't really agree with hedt being questionable unless you only used it to game.,intel abandoned it due to being unable to compete with 3rd gen threadripper.,there is only one name in the game for hedt - amd.,"and they decided considering they are capacity constrained, hedt is the lowest of priorities to update to zen 3, and if you want hedt features tr 3000 is the only option.",for hedt users they need more io than mainstream platforms offer on alderlake and zen 3.,"16 cores isn't enough for many hedt users, who have workloads that go beyond gaming and with more threads the more work that can be done.","i'm willing to bet when intel gets back into hedt, and let's face they'll love to be able to claim to have the most powerful desktop platform outright, hedt will become sexy again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as you can see [here](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/codename/97787/products-formerly-coffee-lake.html) 8th gen and 9th were both on the same coffee lake micro architecture.,12th gen and 13th gen are on separate architectures.,hope this helps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"threadripper is cool, yeahâ€¦ but remember the core-x series?",it was so stupid.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
using more enhanced cores and increased ecores doesnâ€™t scream new architecture.,"it is just an enhanced version of alder lakeâ€¦ same socket, same design.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

honestly the majority of how a laptop performs largely depends on the manufacturer and the specs in the laptop.,then it depends on how they program the performance profiles of the machine.,some machines perform great with a 120hz panel.,while another machine can perform horrible with the same panel.,"battery life is honestly so varied, that you have to do independent comparisons.",i prefer this review site just because they make it easy to compare different models.,jury is still out on 12th gen laptops as all reviews aren't in yet.,i don't think we will know the full picture until mid summer.,by then most reviews should be out and full comparisons will be known before the next holiday rush/sales.,"https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-business-laptops

set on xmp i. this profile may contain some auto optimized parameters from asus for more stability.,"also, if you only have one kit, get on slot 2&4.",if you have 2 kit (for example you want 64gb)  don't even try to enable xmp with full 4 slots.,"if you want 64gb ram, there is a 2x32gb 5200c38 from corsair.","experienced it myself (maximus hero bios 1003, corsair dominator 5600c36 2x16 kit, have to sell it as i've already passed the return windows).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because the issue isn't the ram.,the issue is on the bios side of things.,also the ram you have is in the qvl for both the board and g.skill's site.,chances are there is a bios setting you need to change that isn't part of the xmp.,"additional in red text on the product's page it says

enable the xmp profile in the bios to reach the rated overclock speed of this memory kit.",maximum memory speed and system stability depends on the capability of the motherboard & cpu.,so at the end of the day it isn't false advertising as they are placing a disclaimer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"g.skill has already removed the product line of sticks with 36-36-36-76 timings, and replaced them with 36-36-36-96, as well as raised the vdd/vddq to 1.25 for the 5600 bin and 1.35 for the 6000 bin.","at any rate, 5600 should be pretty attainable on a z690-e",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i need to pickup a lotes lga1700 mount though as the one that comes with the elite mounts the cpu nowhere near as level as the lotes one that came with the master so it hits tjmax at just over 300w of synthetic load
where are as with the lotes one it could do the full 340w and stay under tjmax just

i just dont think that 12th gen's imc is anywhere near good enough for ddr5 yet
maybe when we get to 14th gen it will be good

my son still has a z690 aorus master + 64gb of crucial 4800 and i have had to run it at 3600 with 80ns latency to fully stabalise it

yeah ddr5 is annoying.,i have g.skill z5 6000 40 i can only get to run at 4000. just got 6400 36 i can only get to run at 4400. this is on an asus z690 hero latest 1003 bios.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my dominator 5200c38 kit in xmp2 can be unstable when the memory chips are cold so i bumped the mem voltage from the xmp profile 1.25 to 1.3 and it fixed the stability issues.,memtest will run the ram at it's default jedec speed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

really ?,that has created for me some confusions.,"last time i visited gskill site they still listed them, 2 differents sku.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
interesting.,might explain why xmp 2 is so wonky in terms of stability i guess?,but maybe not.,"either way, going to update bios and switch to xmp 1.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fwiw for anyone who happens to get the 6000 / 36-36-36-76 / 1.3v kit: it worked out of the box on my z690-i with xmp i w/ an i7-12700k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
interesting.,seems like a common problem with ddr5.,i have my memory set on xmp 2 right now so when i get home iâ€™m going to check on a bios update and just run xmp 1 and see if that improves things.,iâ€™ve also got memtest running right now to check and make sure the modules themselves arenâ€™t bad.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you can if you set 1:2 and boards don't by default.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i should have mentioned that iâ€™m on an asus strix z690 gaming-e. also on latest bios.,this seems like itâ€™s a common problem.,is this an rma worthy problem?,i donâ€™t understand how they can sell these modules with these speeds that clearly wonâ€™t run to advertised spec.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

because boards try to do gear 1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sounds like a bad module maybe.,my kit passed a memtest thankfully.,i believe my issues are/were related to an unstable xmp 2 profile.,i updated bios to latest version and changed to xmp 1 and things seem promising so far.,i had one game that was crashing like crazy but it checked out after i tried it again earlier.,i didnâ€™t really grasp the difference between xmp 1 and 2 so it didnâ€™t really register it could be the cause of instability.,i was also having overlap with video driver related issues so it was a bit challenging to isolate the problem at first.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

don't bother with the rma imo unless you want to sell your kit as new.,i went through this song & dance over a month ago and simply sold the g.skill kits the moment i got it back from rma.,there are 2 problems that caused this afaik.,g.skill being too optimistic in binning these kits and asus messing up their ddr5 boards.,"the first problem you can fix by loosening the timings and overvolting vdd/vddq,.",the second problem you can't really do anything about as asus boards simply need more vdd/vddq to run the same speeds/timings as msi and gigabyte ddr5 boards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you're not making sense.,you have a graph representing a stress test showing 125w total load.,you are also presenting temperature data of the cpu under load.,are we to assume it's that same load?,you then also say the cpu draws 190w under an all core load - cine bench.,"so, what is the actual power draw of the cpu, in the stress test you're using to generate these graphs of temperature?","when you put numbers out into the world, don't be shocked when people question them.",it's part of the process.,"if you've sat and plotted a graph of an i7-12700k pulling 120w under a 'stress test', [when intel's own specs show it pulling 190w](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/134594/intel-core-i712700k-processor-25m-cache-up-to-5-00-ghz.html) then *you* need to understand why your numbers don't adhere to that.",you haven't answered my quite reasonable questions about your graphs.,you've just insulted me.,i'm seeking to understand why you show a i7-12700k pulling only 120w under a 'stress test'.,"it doesn't sound very stressy to me....

yes and i still don't understand them.,"your stress test is clearly not 'stressing' the cpu, since under full load it will draw 190w, but you show it drawing 125w.",this is not normal behavior for a i7-12700k.,so what is limiting it?,the motherboard?,the test not actually being an all core stress test?,is you graph a true representation of actual power draw?,what?,"if you're not subjecting the cpu to a full load, then i find your temperature numbers suspect also.","there is not enough context to draw any useful information form these grapsh as presented: clock speeds are irrelevant between different cpus, so is voltage draw.",temperatures are essentially arbitrary unless we know much more about the fan profile applied.,since you present a power throttled i7-12700k as 'stressed' i can't really deduce anything useful from any of your tests.,i don't trust them.,"keep downvoting me for questioning you though, that's the scientific method through and through ;)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

to answer you second question.,the 13900k will have 8 p-cores and 16 e-cores.,i'd expect significantly improved multi-core performace but very only a minor improvement in single core performance compared to the 12900k.,we haven't seen picures of the 13700k die but can be pretty certain it will have 8 p-cores.,it can't have less p-cores than the 12700k or more p-cores than the 13900k.,i expect it will have 8 e-cores but these will be the new smaller more efficient e-cores so i don't think it will quite match the 12900k in multi-core performance.,but it might match or exceed the 12900k in single-core performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

10900k loses to 11900k in applications,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"raptor lake is going to double the e cores, provide a 10-15%  improvement in st performance, reduce power consumption by 25%(if i recall correctly) and feature a massive increase in cache size.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel is rushing to squash amd's advance that is eating their market share.,"pretty much the same trick they did back in core 2 duo, then quad, nehelem,sandy bridge era.",that also means amd have to move as fast & cannot afford to have 1 mistake.,i think amd are most vulnerable in mobile segment.,their 8 core ryzen just isnt good enough.,they need to do something getting the core count up in mobile market.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my guess is late q2.,sometime not later than june this year.,so it will be something like a new generation every 8 months.,performance will be much better than alder lake both single and multi threaded.,it will also have better efficiency at the same performance level compared to alder lake.,i think it's going to be quite a tough fight for 16core zen 4 unless amd takes a 24 core threadripper and brands it as ryzen 9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"with that in mind:  
for those who were initially supposed to buy alder lake:  
did you decide to hold off?",(and just wait a few more months for raptor lake to arrive this year?),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it will run cooler and less power hungry at 10% higher clocks probably same chips lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

multiple leaks suggest that raptor lake will release around late q3 or early q4.,so i donâ€™t expect anything before september.,from what iâ€™ve heard single threaded performance gains are only at about 8-10%.,but theyâ€™ll double the e-cores which will definitely help in multithreaded tasks.,"i also heard that amd are testing 24 core models internally, but havenâ€™t decided whether they will release a 24 core model or not.",i guess it depends on how intelâ€™s new chips perform.,"itâ€™ll be an interesting year for cpu releases, im excited.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

people make different claims on raptor lake release date.,"i'm not sure about the exact launch date, but i know that the product is really healthy and running quite ahead of schedule.",looking at the progress i don't see it getting later than june or july.,amd testing not decided on 24 core ryzen but testing internally is totally unbelievable.,soc design doesn't work that way.,companies cannot test random configurations like that.,if amd designed zen 4 ryzen as a 24 core chip then they will test and launch a 24 core one.,lowering the core count is possible without much of a problem but going to higher core count requires at least 18months of effort.,usually it takes 3 years from soc definition to launch.,"if amd zen 4 ryzen was a 24 core chip at definition, then they can launch it.",just because intel raptor lake is 24 core amd cannot just add one more chiplet and make it 24 core.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

new cpu every 6 months is difficult.,it has to be at least 8 months.,it's more than 5 cpus in 4 years.,"if you take 2021 to 2025, we have rocket lake, alder lake, raptor lake, meteor lake, arrow lake, lunar lake, and so on.",so for me it looks like 6 cpus in 4 years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™ve heard raptor lake isnâ€™t a massive jump in performance.,leaks suggest an increase of about 8-10% on average.,so it might not be worth it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"that's better, but it's more than that.",applications which scale well with cores will generally perform better on the 10900k.,"compression is ~15% faster on a 10900k, for example - while rocketlake is almost twice as fast in encryption",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel is going really really fast.,i doubt amd can do anything at the moment but to make money until really beats them in every aspect.,you will see that with raptor lake.,in my perspective raptor lake is almost ready and should launch in less than a quarter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i would wager though that most applications don't scale to use more than 8 cores (@ 100% load each).,hence why i think it's faster overall on applications.,"otoh the 10900k does have more cache (+25% l3) though which is probably what's carrying it in some of these situations..

and on the third hand.. 11900k should age a little better as it has even more vulnerability mitigations in hardware than 10th gen.  (similar to how 10700k consistently outperforms 9900k even at the same clock).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
makes more sense.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

> what happened?,memory express says it isn't an aio failure and had it tested twice by two technicians.,they probably don't know how to test coolers properly.,the pump in your aio has probably failed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you run your aio at the front with the tubes at the top, you run the risk of sucking in an air bubble and having that go through the system.",the air bubble can possibly get stuck in the aio cold plate and that can have the effect of suddenly spiking your temps.,"once the air gap clears, you suddenly get decent performance and wonder what went wrong.",despite all fans spinning and the pump seemingly working.,there will **always** be air in the system.,"this is why in an automotive cooling system, they have procedures to heat up the coolant slowly in order to clear any air bubbles.",similarly a vehicle's braking system will also be bleed of air.,this ensures adequate performance.,"but sadly, consumer pc aio cooling does not have the same standard of care and the possibility of air entering the system is very likely.",unless you go custom liquid cooling setup.,people will bleed the air out of those systems.,and you can visibly see tons of air bubbles in the system.,so the solution is always if possible keep the tubes down if the radiator is placed at the front.,"if the radiator is placed above, then any air should be trapped in the radiator above.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have an i7 11700k and hit those same temps on a msi 2 fan aio during stress tests and benchmarking... ultimatly deemed my aio to be faulty after many tests and new paste.,i bought a noctua nh-d15 chromax and installed and now i mine all dayat 4.8ghz in and 80f house in florida between mid 60c up to 72c max.,"it's normally at 65c when i get home 

edit: only time i seen 80c on the noctua was when i ran blender benchmarks with my house at 82f to simulate summer conditions when i'm out working.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my guess is that your aio failed.,theyre perishable products and fail after only a few years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

so my motherboard's bios everything was set to auto.","the computer auto overlocked trying to push 5.4 ghz @ 1.6v, according to my friend could have killed it.",he tweaked some things in the bios and now it runs like a charm.,we aren't sure why it auto overlocked in the first place but glad it's fixed now!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah it was running great for the time i had it and suddenly it does this..... the picture was when new thermal paste was applied,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
check your motherboard bios and make sure nothing's funky going on with your processor clocks.,if you have xmp ram then make sure xmp is enabled that's your factory o.c.,"voltages changes cause high temps, psu could be a culprit possibly if your proc is running normal settings.",your best case scenario is to maybe pick up a cheap air cooler and see if it runs at normal temps or bite the bullet and buy a nice aio or air cooler.,it would be nice if you knew someone that might have a cooler that you could try without having to pay but the only thing i can think of is getting a hold of a second cpu cooler and testing further to confirm whether or not that aio is functioning right.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"does your bios have temp monitoring, does the computer idle hot in there?",could be windows being stupid somehow..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i lean toward the aio because it's got so many working parts, pump, fan, radiator, tubes  that can get clogged, etc.. all kinds of stuff can go wrong",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i set everything back to default in bios, it idles around 35c but it jumps to 45 at times... yeah i wish i have a second aio to test!",you think reinstalling windows would help?,"i don't have much on the pc, just games!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"mine idles there too but doesn't spike...

before reinstalling windows maybe try booting into safe mode with network you can do windows key ""r"" and type msconfig.","click boot tab check safe boot then hit network and restart

if you can monitor your temps in safe mode and they're lower than it could indicate it's a windows issue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i forgot to ask too did resetting your bios change temps at idle in windows now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm wondering if you got some type of malware on your computer that could be forcing your processor to run pegged i feel like there's a low chance of that .....but your cooler should still be able to compensate for a cpu running at 100% either way 100c is thermal throttle and not what you wanna ever see

the ultimate worst case scenario would be you proc took damage during the first time it overheated and its internal heat sink might be damaged.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no it did not change, idle still roughly 35c.","after reapplying the paste, i was able to boot up successfully to my desktop.",my cooler's been working wonders for me.,"able to run forza horizan on max settings fine, not sure why it's messing up now.","i do agree with you that it is a aio failure, but the technicians says otherwise :(",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

still a great combo.,imo i wanted to get the 12600k but i would rather wait till dd5 is a normal price.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is straight out of the box with a stock cooler.,b660 asus tuf board.,microcenter had no cooler for the 1700 so i had to order one off amazon.,coming from a r5 3600 this was a very nice improvement.,definitely glad the money that i picked it up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for the comment.,i actually checked  and it was balanced so i will change that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"right,  since i beat the #1 score with this combo thatâ€™s how.",i would assume the combo isnâ€™t something a lot of people use.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very nice!,just wasnâ€™t expecting it to be this big of an upgrade.,and for the money you canâ€™t beat it.,i sold my 3600 and cooler for $30 less than i paid for this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
b660m asus tuf and stock cooler that came with it.,iâ€™m trying to find one i want with works with the 1700.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea i play at 1440p and people like to argue it doesnâ€™t make a difference.,i mostly play mmos.,but like ffxiv benchmark.,was 24 fps on the high end and 30 fps on the low end.,thatâ€™s a good jump.,i mind the 1% lows more so than the top end since most what i play is already over 100fps.,not to mention the difference i spent on the 12400 to what i sold my 3600 for was $26.,i think over all i spent a little over $100 to get a new mobo/cpu and memory from what i was using.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

nice definitely a cool upgrade.,"just might be helpful to know if you encounter any harsh stuttering, slowness, or crashes while loading something up that the cpu is likely the culprit.",could just be you need to adjust some settings in the bios.,or maybe a new cpu cooler that you said youâ€™re getting?,might not be temp related though.,overall nice build!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no worries, run the timespy again to see if u gain few points xd",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is honestly one of my favorite hobbies.,just finding those esoteric combos and grabbing top spots!,"the i5-11500 was a champ at it, i think they sold like... 10. that with pretty much any gpu was a winning combo, with minimal tuning.","the i5-12600 is neat too, grabbed a few 2nd places but there's some guy witha bclk overclocked one who's got the first place spot.","also, i3-10105 with tuned b-die and any gpu it 'shouldn't' be paired with (mid tier and up).",clearly no-one else bothered with doing that!,!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so stock cooler?,impressive then.,did you go b660 based on availability of the boards?,"i'm still on the fence if i want to pair the 12400 with a b660 or @/a better specced h670 board, but the h670 ones available here for reasonable prices are all asrock.",weird thing is that better b660 boards are still prices same as budget z690 boards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

drivers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
doubling of the cache is definitely going to be a big difference and is the main reason i'm thinking of holding out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
temps seems to be fine did some gaming for a few hours and was running great.,i game at 1440p so not as harsh on the cpu.,but pretty noticeable difference,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
price and availability.,cheapest z690 they had for ddr4 for matx at microcenter was $100 more before taxes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm not sure what you mean?,"my point was that

 - the 12400 performs similarly to the 5600x
 - the 5600x should be cheaper due to not having to get a new motherboard
 - op mentioned that they needed to get a new lga1700 cooler, leading me to assume they already had an incompatible one for their 3600 (hence, wasting money)
 - the 12400 can't be oc'd, the 5600x can - the oc in the title is referring to the 3070, unless they decided to use bclk ocing with a really expensive motherboard (as cheaper ones don't support it).","- 3600 -> 5600x/12400 doesn't really make much sense to me, but jumping up a tier and a generation does (hence 5800x recommendation - would still be cheaper than the 12400+mobo, as it's just the cpu (a 12600k would make sense too))

i just find going from the 3600 -> 12400 to be a really strange upgrade, when you can get a 5600x for cheaper that'll perform similarly, or a 5800x that'll perform better but should still be cheaper (cpu vs cpu+mobo), or a 12600k that performs better than the 5800x & justifies the platform change.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yup, my advice is hold on for a bit on to your 3900x for now.",since raptor lake also offers double the e cores and 10~(maybe15%) improvement on single core ipc (cmiiw).,amd by then (hopefully*****) ddr5 prices also already in the more reasonable range since am5 will also support it too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah if you can hold it then just wait for it, both cpus will be great anyway, probably a bit cheaper at the end of the year",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"definitely should be a noticeable upgrade in performance from the r5 3700. 

you could be all good and have no issues just trying to provide a little more info on the score you provided.",most likely intel speed step or shift is on and down clocking the cpu when it either gets too hot or overloaded.,"itâ€™s a totally normal built in behavior but there is some tinkering, if you want, to be done for optimal performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ah then it's a no brainer.,over here in europe it all seems so overpriced that there's little difference in mid end b660 vs budget z690.,"wish we had those price differences, would make choosing a chipset easier at least, lol.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you also donâ€™t know why they upgraded.,contrary to reddits opinion there are a lot of motherboards that could support the 3600 that donâ€™t or wonâ€™t support a 5600x.,"maybe op was tired of dealing with amd, again, contrary to reddits opinion amd tends to do some pretty weird stuff when it comes to clocks and they arenâ€™t the most stable especially if op had an older board.",also saying the 5600x can be overclocked is a stretch.,"the 5600x can be tuned, no zen3 cpu should be overclocked at this stage but should instead have extensive tuning done with pbo which doesnâ€™t constitute an oc.",you are right that a move from a 3600 to the 12400/5600x is a weird jump but op could have been having issues leading to the change.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm probably gonna keep my existing ddr4 (since i already got a ddr4 board and have 64gb 3200 cl14 b-die from my original ryzen system) but all the rumors for raptor lake are making me rather excited.,"am5 is out of the question since i already got z690 and i'm still pretty salty over x370 support on the amd side, no zen3 support until adl was starting to eat into their profits.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh agree 100% once new cooler is on iâ€™ll be able to make sure temps are good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well i also have a matx case so they had as rock z690 but on the low end for $10 less than my tuf.,i donâ€™t like as rock so went this way,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"contrary to redditâ€™s opinionâ€¦ you do realize most of the tech world (anandtech, ltt, tech jesus) do not support the narrative that amd is less stable, right?",zen had a couple growing pains but itâ€™s all been sorted out.,"intel also has issues with brand new platforms, they get sorted out and people move on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> you also donâ€™t know why they upgraded.,"> [...] op could have been having issues leading to the change

fair point - i just assumed they wanted a bit more performance.",> also saying the 5600x can be overclocked is a stretch.,"the 5600x can be tuned, no zen3 cpu should be overclocked at this stage but should instead have extensive tuning done with pbo which doesnâ€™t constitute an oc.","i guess, but my point with that was that it's a benefit it has over the 12400 - i didn't intend to imply it'd be more than a few percent, moreso that it *would* be a few percent & op appears to have expressed an interest in doing it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a rebuttal to that is two of those three (that i know of, not sure if the anandtech reviewer) donâ€™t daily drive a zen3 machine.",there is a *very* big difference between reviewing something and putting it through its paces and having to live with it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"linus daily drives zen 2, and lots of their staff are pc nerds and daily all sorts of setups.","these people are tech experts and have been able to speak at length when there were issues, they get a lot of hours on these machines that you donâ€™t see.",buy whatever you want but stanning for a company like intel is just pathetic.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"linus runs threadripper, their hedt offerings havenâ€™t dealt with a lot of the issues their primary offerings have.","iâ€™m not stanning for anything, in fact iâ€™ve not even said intel yet but you have.","again, testing and benchmarking is not daily driving.","but again, feel free to have your own opinion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's likely the all-core turbo, 4.4ghz is the single core turbo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's incredibly annoying that they don't list all core max turbo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes that's the page i found but after looking in the bios there didn't really seem to be any obvious option about it so obviously didn't touch anything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
amd does the same.,"but honestly, most users *won't* see this limit unless they are benchmarking (which is not a useful thing to do) or do some cpu-heavy stuff.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why would it not be useful?,you should want to know if your hardware is thermal throttling and how to fix it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most users are in this all-core limit because that's the most common frequency that is used in gaming.,otherwise all the gaming benchmarks wouldn't be showing the cpu at its all-core frequency and the performance gap between a celeron and an i9 wouldn't be as big.,> amd does the same.,"that is true, but at least with amd you can increase the all-core frequency to the single core frequency, at least if amd creates a cpu with a all-core frequency of 4 ghz and single of 4.4 you can easily overclock to 4.4 to fulfill the cpus potential.",with intel's locked cpus you're stuck with the all-core frequency they don't advertise.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, but i was talking about all core turbo clock that isn't listed neither in intel specs nor in amd specs.",you don't have to know it to figure out whether you're thermal throttling or not.,"you can easily figure it out by checking your temps or even just by running hwinfo, as it explicitly tells you whether the cpu is throttling or not.",what clock frequency it's running at is largely irrelevant.,"if you're concerned about performance, you would simply check your benchmark scores, not clock speeds.",and when i said that benchmarking is not a useful thing i meant to say that it's not something that a regular user would do very often.,"so even if your clock stays below the advertised turbo maximum, it's not something you should care about.",these clock speeds (base and turbo) are in the specs simply to give you some metrics to compare different cpu models within a generation.,"and even that is not *that* useful because there are other things that affect performance, cache size, for example.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i thought that games don't use that many threads to hit that limit.,perhaps i was wrong.,but does it really matter what frequency you're stuck at?,"the 5600x has approximately the same performance as the 12400, with the latter being 1.5 times cheaper, and that what matters.","if someone were to buy a 5600x for its overclocking capabilities, then the price difference is sort of justified, and that's about it.","or get a 12600k for about $30 more, which isn't locked so it becomes a non-issue.","what matters in the end is how much performance you can squeeze out of a cpu, whether you overclock or not, and looking up benchmarks and reviews is the only reliable way to figure it out.","if someone buys a cpu thinking â€œoh, it has 200 mhz higher turbo clock, must be a better cpu!â€, they're already doing it wrong...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvuqxagrgfu&t=271s

a game doesn't need to use every core for it to hit the all-core frequency limit, if a game uses 4 cores it's limited by the the all-core frequency, if a game uses 3 cores it's limited by the all-core frequency, maybe 2 cores also.","all-core turbo doesn't just mean the frequency limit for when every thread of the cpu is being, it's the frequency when more than 1 core is being used.","for example genshin impact uses 3 cores, 6 threads, it's less than the full 6 cores, 12 threads the i5s have but it's more than 1 core so it's limited by the all-core frequency in genshin impact.","(as well as the 60 fps limit)

> but does it really matter what frequency you're stuck at?","yes, it's also the reason why intel locks cpus.","if a game doesn't utilise all the cores of a more expensive cpu, then limiting the frequency of cheaper cpus makes sure that the cheaper cpus don't outperform the more expensive cpus.","https://tpucdn.com/review/intel-core-i3-12300/images/relative-performance-games-1280-720.png

how do you mean?,what should i do?,just set up a local account and create another one with the windows login afterwards?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no worries~ if you happen to reposition your aio again, just let me know if it fits at ram side :) 

i have seen many complained about ek aio tubes are pushing the ram in gigabyte z690i.","looking at the photos from their product website, z690i looks pretty similar to b660i in term of the clearance between the cpu socket and ram slots.",that kinda hold me back from getting b660i since i can only route the tubing from ram side in my current pc case :(,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you have any images to show this?,"though you might be accurate in your answer, i'd still be more reassured if there were images from your rig showing the tubes clearing the ram and not pushing on it.",i would presume by that logic that smaller pump blocks would absolutely clear the ram?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"awesome, thanks for the quick response!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"update: perhaps from a clearance perspective the l12 ghost will fit, but the mounting equipment is blocked by the io shield.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yes i do have the same board with the noctua u12a in a nr200, 12600k.",it's compatible and runs super cool.,what do you want to know?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm getting a new setup myself and my doubt is between the 12700(f) and the 12700k while leaning towards the non k version.,"but the whole pl1 and pl2 'issue' is holding me back, from what i read is that most mobo's don't work great with non k versions (so far).","also from a mobo perspective, their isn't much choice in mitx yet, i'm doubting between this aorus board and the asrock z690 version.",it's a pitty this one only has 1 m2 slot.,otherwise i would pick this one immediately.,such a shame the strix one is only ddr5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not sure how much that is in usd but b550i pro ax here in the states has been $220 and $180 when on sale.,i would grab this one but itâ€™s got one m.2 slot and well not available.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"none, but i will be using ek 240 basic when bracket arrives.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
some heatpipes make slight contact with gpu but can be elevated by bending the c14s upwards a little.,the c14 fits as normal in its default position.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 12700k and down don't run that hot.,so not if you want most performance for everything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no issue, stock bios is fine",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you can live with single m.2 slot this board is great as alder lake has excellent stock performance.,i'm currently running 12700k in mine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm using crucial ballistix 16gb kit.,think it's around 40mm but wouldn't go any taller than that imo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i will be, as i'm rebuilding my geeek m5 build soon after an issue with internal power cable killed my psu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't as you just don't use the ram side in any cases i've built in.,"unfortunately, its the case of believe me or don't.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
note: the l12 ghost does not provide near the level of cooling of the l12s.,its still the best under 70mm cooler option for this motherboard.,see cooling comparison here: https://reviewer.co/coolers/noctua-nh-l12g,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the l12 ghost fits as i've tested this cpu cooler, so can confirm ðÿ‘edit: noctua states it not compatible.",guess i was wrong.,was pretty confident i tested the l12 ghost and had no issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
try with heat pipes ends facing the pcie slot.,the mounting equipment fits in either orientation without issues,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they a bit shady on that.,on product page they don't mentioned exactly what audio codec are used.,this is why i'm asking.,anyway thanks for your replies.,i think i'll gonna go with this board since better vrm and sexy look more important for me than two m2 slots,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's perfect, thanks so much.",i've ordered both now for my build.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i was considering the asrock h670 too, which would work nicely with the non-k 12700 and has two m.2 slots.",i read somewhere that the h670 is similar to the z690 board and has the same 150w limit.,"i don't need 2 m.2 slots and i can still use the sata ports if i need more storage, so i decided to go with the aorus b660 instead, for the higher power limit (and better vrm cooling).","in hindsight, i think the h670 would probably be a good choice too, as i never reach 150w with my regular work.",the difference in performance would be minimal and only visible in benchmarks.,"if you get a non-k cpu, there's no point in getting the asrock z690 instead of the h670 one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh, i believe its something like $150.",but maybe prices went up in the meantime.,it got two m.2 slot.,one gen 4 on the front and one gen 3 on the back,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gotcha well thatâ€™s great to hear.,iâ€™m looking for fitment confirmation with that aio.,hopefully with tubes coming out the top of the board.,keep us posted.,thanks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you have pics of how the c14s fits in the mobo?,planning to upgrade to alderlake and i have one c14s around that i'm planning to use,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but has a higher energy consumption.,i don't see an advantage of running constantly on max.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i dont mind just having a single m2 slot.,could you tell me how your experience is so far with the bios?,i have the gigabyte b550i and my bios is so laggy/stuttering when i use my mouse.,"i dont know wether thats a gigabyte thing or just another ryzen thing, it is really annoying doing some setting in the bios while it is so laggy.",(i had rmad my first one thought it was buggy but my second one hast he same issue),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ok, thanks",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"after looking at your vid involving the 10l case, i can now see that the ek's tubing does appear to still push on the ram but with the test bench video the tubing seems to just clear the io shroud.",how much of a pinch is it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™m getting a ssupd meshilicious, so unfortunately the fan-on-top configuration is not an option.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

same: were still few months away from msi b660i gaming edge wifi.,"no official announcement, but it always come few months after the rest hit the market, although not sure why.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hi, sorry too for necroposting.",though i might be going for this exact configuration as well.,"the gigabyte b660i aorus pro ddr4, the nh-u12a, and the 12700f (it's cheaper and has less power draw, plus lots of other differences)

were you able to fit two regular 120mm fans on top of the case, or does the motherboard place the cpu socket too high so the nh-u12a blocks it?","if so, could it work with slim fans?",thanks in advance!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what are you using as cooler?,i ordered the aorus today :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had the b550i and i loved it.,wanted to switch to 12th gen and kind of miss it ngl.,hopefully this b660i and other ddr4 mobos become available soon enough.,thanks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no fitment issies with ek aio (tubes of the rear io side),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
here you go: https://www.instagram.com/p/cdg_9ajnzsm/?igshid=mdjmnzvkmjy= sorry it also fits the other way which is the default ðÿ¤”,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've has no issues with bios or board as whole.,"the laggy bios on b550 could be wireless interference, if not using wireless then not sure, maybe if you've changed hardware multiple times since installing windows.",i did also have issue receiving with very laggy bios then my installation corrupted on msi b550i.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm assuming it works, if so, which orientation did you use?",thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was able to fit the two fans that come with the nr200p at the top of the case.,"it's tight, but it fits",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a noctua nh-u12s.,here's the full build: https://nl.pcpartpicker.com/b/rc3tt6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was thinking of switch to 12th too but that would be a shitload of monney for not enough % of moar perf.,i'll wait until the 13th before going blue again,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
appreciate it.,that works out great.,i wish this had a second m.2 slot and was available.,if you do any testing.,iâ€™m wondering if the 12700k loses much performance with a 150w power limit.,i was looking at the asrock h670m itx/ax for my build.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just making sure this is on the gigabyte b660i aorus pro ddr4?,i was going to go with arctic liquid freezer ii but i hear thatâ€™s not going to fit so iâ€™m wondering if the ek basic 240 will fit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you dude for your time i would have instantly pull the trigger if isnâ€™t so hard to get a decent compatible cpu cooler nowadays for those mitx boards of the 12th gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh one last question, iirc i saw some people complaining about long boot times (20 seconds etc.)",do you think your board boot slower compared to your msi?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"needed to exchange the cooler, so donâ€™t know yet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks a lot for responding!,it eases my mind.,hoping both my nh-a12x25 will be able to fit up there.,"will otherwise just have to use them as a bottom intake, with the default configured as top fans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no doubt.,not worth it to switch from am4.,i got these parts for xmas so i decided to return the mobo and cpu.,now iâ€™m on the hunt for a decent mobo.,i can wait a bit longer before i piece everything back together.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it does, only in heavily multithreaded applications, benchmarks etc.",i'd be more concerned with vrms,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have bought se 226 xt for purpose of having lga 170 out of the box.,mine b660i is currently shipping internationally so i need to be patient.,then i will give my feedback on cooler compatibility.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what happened may i ask ðÿ˜•,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good to know.,so probably editing video or photoshop is where youâ€™ll notice a decline in performance.,hopefully not by much.,thanks for your work so far.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
previously i had just set up the mounting bars (forgot to put in the spacers) and roughly set the cooler down.,"when i actually went to install the cooler, i realized that the box was missing the thermal paste and the cooler baseplate was scratched.",donâ€™t know if someone actually tried to install it or just stole the paste.,either way itâ€™s going to be a couple more days before i can finish the build.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ok, i got it installed, and i can see why noctua objects to it.","i am able to tighten the screws all the way down; however, the heat pipes are in firm contact with another bit of shielding.",i suspect that if i were to remove the cooler some scratches would be visible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"funny to flair this post as ""news"" lol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the news,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[i made a few changes](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/prrq78) to your list which brought the price down a bit.,"swapped out the cooler for a slightly smaller and cheaper one, although still very high quality from noctua.",replaced the mainboard with the tuf b660 from asus.,swapped out the 970 evo ssd with a wd sn750 which will have nearly identical performance but $20 cheaper.,"and i swapped the ram out for a 3600 kit, up from the 3200 you had listed.",these would be my recommendations.,also don't take just my word alone and check out some reviews for these parts online.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the fact that op finished his build is news to me!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well then what are you waiting for

tell the townspeople and kingdoms of the extravagant news",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
practically nothin if you're playing at 1440p+,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you want to upgrade just for gaming, don't.","12900k destroys the 11900k in mt, but if all you do is game then the upgrade cost is not justified.",same for a 10900k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it'll depend on resolution and the game itself, some games may show next to no improvement while other games may show quite a bit of an improvement, especially if on 1080p, not so much if on 1440p/4k.","[hardware unboxed](https://youtu.be/wwsmyhhc6j4?t=1026) had it at 8.4% / 16 fps (although the there was a larger impact on 1% low minimum fps, 21 fps / 15.1% higher minimum fps) higher average @ 1080p than the 11900k.","if you're playing @ 1440p or 4k, likely not going to be much of an improvement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you have 11900k don't switch to 12900k.,it won't improve that much.but if you wanna do some professional work go with 12900k.,you are already owing a 11900k you don't need to upgrade any further wait for 2-3 generation then upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"itâ€™s a much better cpu, doesnâ€™t mean the 11900k is bad though.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so i had i5 2500k with 3080 for a few months and i switched to 12700k.,my experience is that difference in 1080p is very small.,"rdr2 and metro exodus i had the same fps, cyberpunk and some other games the difference was up to 30%.",if you play above 1080p the difference would be even smaller.,so 11900k vs 12900k you should see absolutely no difference in games,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[removed],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
about 1-5 percent more fps at 1080p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what about ryzen 9 3900xt?,is it worth upgrade for raptor lake or zen 4?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[removed],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what?,"the difference is huge, you probably locked your fps or something.",2500k to 12700k is a huge jump.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12900k has double the cache.if anything you will get better frametimes regardless of resolution.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's about 20 fps in total war: warhammer 2 skaven benchmark at 1920x1080,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no 3900xt is a very good chip, you need you wait about 5-6 generation then upgrade.",11900k has 8 cores that is why the op needs to upgrade it sooner but you are having 3900xt 12-24 thread beast of a cpu you won't need a upgrade any sooner.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"itâ€™s a lot like the 11. but newer features and more advanced, more future proof.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is in cpu bound tasks but not in games.,fps wasn't locked.,"everything worked well on max settings even with 2500k

thing is reviewers feed you with crap just to buy new hardware but in reality you can stick with high end cpu for 10 years if gaming is your priority

oh and its worth to mention 2500k was oced to 4.5ghz",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
exactly - could be 350  up to 370 in csgo which is pointless.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but much worse memory latency and cache latency also they are equal in gaming i would say not a big difference,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah, this cpu serves me still good.",also what are best cpu for a nas server?,"or plex server, do i need high end or low end for 60tb of nas storage?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"tbh, rocket lake does have 1 advantage of avx512, which i'm not sure if it improves performance?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're telling me cyberpunk worked well at max settings on a 2500k?,"what, you got thing at 5.1 with tuned ram or something?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i know ppl who play on 4k and noticed less stutter overall(cyberpunk is the example they gave me) they went from 9900k>12900k.,spoke to these ppl because i wanted to do the jump so i was looking for ppl who made the jump with similar rigs and they all pretty much told me games became smoother.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
more like 95 vs 115 fps iirc.,the difference is smaller at 2560x1440 because the 3090 is bottlenecking.,"and really, it's the outlier.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so nas stands for network attached storage you do not need an high end cpu for that you can make your work with a 12100f which should be perfect for this job.,"""do i need high end or low end for 60tb of nas storage?""",depends on what type of work you are doing personally i would go for high to middle end storage devices.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"itâ€™s available if you use an earlier bios, it improves rps3 emulator performance, but not much else in native games.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i had it at 4.5, 16 gigs ram 1600mhz",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that has been my impression coming from a 10900k as well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, as someone who recently took the plunge from an 9900k to a 12900kf, i can confirm this observation.","modern warfare improved the most, but in general gaming in general was smoother.","but, let's be clear, it is not ""wow"", more like ""that's nice"".",doing .net dev and other mt stuff is rockin'.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks a lot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pretty good.,"i just looked up 2500k oc'd in cyberpunk, and it struggled to stay above 30 in the city, with heavy frame drops and hitting 100%.",12700k easily triples / quadruples performance in that game.,"it's not a ""30%"" gain.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12900k is a walking trash what draws 300+ watts and couldnt cool it down properly even with an 360 aio cause 100 degreees easily.,5950x>trash 12900k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
im telling you what i saw mate and it's not a huge difference.,i was actually surprised how small of an improvement 12700 was,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's funny.,i tried a 5950x before the 12900kf.,"notice i said, ""tried"".",still running the 12900kf...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's really odd.,i don't know what to tell you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
really unsurprising considering how fast this sort of stuff gets developed in the linux world.,when alder lake motherboards drop a little in price might build a system for something like pop os.,as for games other comments have mentioned unless it's a multiplayer game we are already in a world where stuff works great.,just need the anti cheat crap to start working,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the day a headline says â€œlinux now supports all anti cheat, games and is now faster than windows for gamingâ€ i will be interested.","doubt that will happen, but the glass is half full.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think the conclusion in this article is pretty poor...to say that windows only wins 13% of the time is disingenuous.,the comparisons should be against 1 linux distro...heck we could just add a few hundred more permutations of the linux and really crush windows 11 down to only winning 0.5% of the time.,averaging all of these together is really bad data analytics.,"also, quite a number of these benchmarks are virtually the same when linux wins, like png encoding...not just one png encoding and move onto the next benchmark, lets benchmark the png encoding with different encoding levels!!",same with svt-av1 which is benchmarked 4 times.,they are all practically the same but linux wins 4 times instead of once!,great stuff!,yet x264 which windows wins is only benchmarked once!,boo windows!,"for me, this article reeks of fudging the numbers.","all in all, there are some instances where clear linux does well over windows, but in so many of the runs, the difference is negligible, likely in run to run variance but linux always barely takes the lead...how convenient.","great to see linux doing well, but the article is doing a good job of making it look like linux is winning and windows is in last or near to last.","after clear linux, windows was the second highest number of winning results.","in reality, i don't think we are to the point where windows is being pounded....yet at least.",certainly nothing that will move me across to linux.,"that said, i am doubtful that the numbers where windows was winning were enough to get linux users over to windows...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that is good to hear and what i had expected from a productivity perspective.,"i have my new alder lake workstation build almost ready (...ddr5 shortage), so it will be interesting to do some tests.",i don't expect any problems with productivity tasks as that has been well tested already.,what i'm specifically curious about is how well the alder lake works right now on linux.,"and specifically if the drm/denuvo drm issues that plagued the launch of these cpu's on windows, have been solved also on linux.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the anti cheat crap is snake oil... with security and privacy issues,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i feel like you're being incredibly unrealistic and unfair.,"linux is in a fantastic spot right now for gaming as is, a ton of work has been poured into it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's a game dev issue.,if linus bribed game devs to support linux like ms does for windows then they would.,unfortunately linus doesn't play games and the linux foundation doesn't have the money to spare.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what are you talking about?,they compare clearlinux which is intel's own distribution and ubuntu 22.04 which isn't even out yet properly.,all the different versions of ubuntu are just kernel versions that they are comparing which you can install on ubuntu.,i could understand your argument if it was like clear linux + ubuntu + fedora + arch linux + slackware + gentoo.,but it's just clear linux because intel and ubuntu because most popular.,as for windows users swapping to linux most don't even know it's an option for them because all they know is windows or mac.,with the way windows as a service is going though and the efforts of companies like valve that might change hopefully,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you are missing my point.","the number of linux environments tested matters...when you count the number of 'wins', it is misleading to to lump everything together.",we are comparing linux to windows...so: lets say hypothetically that it is windows vs 99 different linux build variations.,"when results are calculated, there are 100 benchmarks, and lets pretend each benchmark is won by a different linux build, besting windows by merely 0.25% each time (insignificant), but windows always comes second together the top 2 beats out every other linux build by 33%...a significant margin.",let us let windows win a single benchmark in this instance.,"it would be true to say ""windows only one a single benchmark out of 100, or 1%"".",but the more accurate picture would be formed when we look at each linux environment vs windows in a vacuum.,"it would actually win all benchmarks by a wide margin except one against each differing distro...a 99% win rate 1 on 1.

it is severely exaggerated, but none the less it demonstrates the skewing we are seeing in the results.",and i want to be clear that i don't think windows won at all with the current builds.,"for example, for windows against ubuntu 5.16:  
ubuntu wins 33, of which about 5 were basically a draw  
windows wins about 19, of which about 2 were basically a draw (\~40%, much better than ""13%"")  


for clear linux against windows:  
clear wins 41 of which about 2 were a draw  
windows wins 9, of which about 2 were a draw (\~20%, a bit better than ""13%"")

none of this includes repeated tests for things like png encoding, for some reason done at different levels and windows always loses.","why not just say, windows loses png encoding tests, and be done with it.",one test.,this further skews results.,"other interesting tidbits when compared to the previous article where windows is ahead that may indicate further bias:

\- why is the only paraview 5.9 benchmark that is used in the both articles the one benchmark windows lost even back then?",why not the same benchmarks?,\- renaissance: windows won nearly every benchmark in this suite.,"completely removed in new article

\- libjpeg turbo: windows won previously, benchmark gone in new article

\- selenium  
\--ares-6 x2 (chrome and firefox) windows won previously, now gone  
\--octane x2 (chrome and firefox) ditto  
buuuuuuuuuuuuut...every single selenium benchmark windows didn't win in the previous article miraculously made it over to the new article.",huh.,why not the same benchmarks.,"i could construct an article that makes linux look like a complete loser vs windows as well if i wanted to...  


>you really need to understand it's not 4 linux distros, it's 2 distros with different kernels which is more like different drivers coming from a  windows perspective as all the kernels are easily installed on a linux distro.","you are 100% correct, distros is the wrong term for me to use here.","earlier i said linux environments, which is more accurate.",i shouldn't have changed terminology.,"however, this is the thread scheduling in the kernel, for this purpose, i wouldn't consider it like drivers in windows.","however i do fully expect you know a lot more about linux than i...

i dont see the workload being forced onto just a few cores.,"in the top graph with e cores enabled i see 10 threads doing work and with e cores disabled it looked like only 6.  


i don't know why it was using hyper threading before all the cores were occupied when you had the e cores disabled, but when they are enabled it looks to be doing the proper behaviour; not occupying the second thread of p cores until all cores are exhausted.",probably whatever tasks were occupying the second threads of the p cores in the bottom graph are now on the e cores in the top graph freeing up the hyper threads so the p cores give 100% performance to whatever they are working on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what im trying to get clear is hyper threads = less performance unless all your cores are exhausted because the number of processing threads your program has exceeds or equals your cpu thread count.,neither the cpu nor windows can decide how many threads are to be used.,that's up to the program and its programmers.,for example the game devs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thanks for the reply.,"yours looks exactly how i expected mine to, and yes, i followed all the preparation and install steps.","on my board, the cpu socket back bracket sits significantly higher off the back of the mobo and it caused a gap between the o-rings and the mobo itself when i mounted it.","in hindsight, i couldâ€™ve still just mounted the stand-offs and got everything on there, but i ended up having a bigger issue.","that weirdly huge lga1700 backplate is taller than the mobo stand-offs, and the o11-d mini isnâ€™t wide open in the back like it is in your case.",thereâ€™s steel behind about a third of the backplate.,"turns out, itâ€™s just not compatible with that case, or any other case that isnâ€™t wide open behind the backplate.","luckily, i found someone on pcpartpicker who had the same issue and figured out a solution.",my asus z690 board has lga1200 and lga1700 mounting holes.,i ended up using the (much slimmer) lga 1200 backplate along with the lga1700 mounting clips and stand-offs.,it worked like a charm.,everything mounted up nice and temps are great.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ah ok, good to hear you got it all sorted!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the i7 has 8 cores and the i5 has only 6. the base clock speeds are a â€œguaranteedâ€ speed if you use all the cores.,the i5 has a higher base clock speed as a result of having fewer cores.,this has no bearing on single core performance or any indication on what single core frequency will be sustained.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the biggest problem it has is that its an 11700k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 11900k was a horrible chip the day it launched, and itâ€™s worse now.","literally every other cpu surrounding it was a massively better buy, from the 10900k to the 5800x and 5900x to the 3900x, and now that the 12600k curbstomps this disgraceful â€œflagshipâ€, thereâ€™s really no reason to revisit rocket lake ever again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rocket lake is actually not that bad.,"it had awful bios(es) at launch, performed worse than it should but after around 2-3 months it actually got a lot better.",11th gen is closer to alder lake than skylake.,but since alder lake exists.,the 11900k should only be bought if it is (including a motherboard) cheaper than a 12600k with a msi pro a (which costs combined around  500 bucks),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in applications - yes.,"[https://www.techpowerup.com/review/intel-core-i9-11900k/24.html](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/intel-core-i9-11900k/24.html)  (overall summary of apps)

if an application uses all 10 cores of 10900k, the 10900k can occasionally be faster.","but if it uses anything less than 9 cores, the 11900k is faster since the cores are stronger in applications (10-12%).",in games - the answer is it's about equal or slightly slower because of higher latency in the cpus cache structure.,"that said, there are a few exceptions and some games where 11900k is faster than 10900k.",p.s.,example where 11900k can be noticeably faster in an application (adobe after effects cc):  [https://tpucdn.com/review/intel-core-i9-11900k/images/after-effects.png](https://tpucdn.com/review/intel-core-i9-11900k/images/after-effects.png),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yah as other person said use case, imo, no because the 8 strong cores can still manage excellently with the 16 threads and you have an overall better platform with faster baseline supported 3200 memory, improved wifi and pcie 4.0 support both for graphics and nvme.",that being said buy a 12th gen i7 with ddr5 and be really further proofed as that platform with a proper motherboard has pcie 5 support on the gpu now and ddr5.,11th gen was def a filler sorta product lineup.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"not accommodating 12th gen, then yes it will be all down to your use case as others said.",i9-11900k is generally faster per core but having 80% cores of i9-10900k kinda cancel out its speed bonuses if application can use all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i like my 11900k got it new in box for 250 canadian with warranty from someone off facebook marketplaceâ€¦.,so win for me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for most things, yes, because most things use less than 8 cores, like the massive majority of things.","kicker is, a 12th gen i5 beats both in most things too even with ""only"" 6 cores.",it all depends what you do.,"heavy content creation can use the cores, most everything else scales to single threaded performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for me 11900k is much better than 10900k.,i mostly use my pc for msfs and sim-racing in vr.,20% higher single core performance helps a lot in sims.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i have mine clocked at 5.3 all core and it destroys my old 10900k at 5.3 in gaming benchmarks, obviously cinebench isnâ€™t as good but gaming only needs 8 cores 16 threads so 11900k is a monster.",iâ€™m not concerned about upgrading until at least 13th gen itâ€™s that good!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"11900k > 10900k, only if it were 10nm like tiger lake",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think if someone were to upgrade from an older i7-930 or i7-2600k era cpu both 11900k and 10900k would be a very acceptable upgrade path.,they will likely see a huge leap in performance.,and i would be perfectly happy recommending an 11900k if it so happen to be priced below the 10900k or vice versa.,"but if someone was to be upgrading from an i9 9900k or i7 8700k where the performance gain is already minimal, then yes they need the 12900k.",because why upgrade at all when the leap is minimal?,i guess my point is that 11900k is a very good upgrade if someone is coming from i7 2600k or the older 22nm intel chips.,the leap is so substantial for the user that i seriously have no problem with 11900k or 10900k both are excellent chips.,and extremely powerful.,i am speaking strictly for gaming/everyday using the cpu though.,and not for rendering video/3d model tasks.,unless they do that occasionally then by all means go for more cores.,but users who pick 11900k or 12900k or k series in general want the performance and they want the ability to tweak these chips.,which is why 10th/11th and 12th gen chips have some really optimized packaging for the enthusiasts.,"[thin die, thin stim, thick ihs](https://hothardware.com/image/resize/?width=1170&height=1170&imagefile=/contentimages/article/3155/content/big_alder-lake-die-width.jpg)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tech jesus called it a waste of sand.,i have to agree.,not sure what intel was smoking on 11th gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 11900k is still a very capable cpu, and only lost 2c/4t over the previous gen because rocket lake was *supposed* to be 10nm but intel had to stick with 14nm one last time.",so they could only scale up to 8c/16t (despite 10th gen having 10c/20t also on 14nm...) because they didn't have enough time to backtrack and properly port over a design that was meant for a different manufacturing process.,"but like others have said, the cpus from rocket lake still have higher ipc, frequency, and better per-core performance over 10th gen. thus the 11900k has 8 slightly faster cores than the 10900k's 10 cores, which yields better fps in some games & can do somewhat better in a few other areas as well.","however, in stuff like blender or heavily thread-bound applications, the 10900k will do slightly better since the use cases i'm referring to always prefer more cores/threads.","all of that being said, the biggest problem is that...the 11700k exists, which can more or less match the i9 if oc'ed and cooled properly and costs less.","alder lake also exists, and intel finally got to 10nm, and we see why now that the 11900k was 8c/16t (that was meant to be 10nm at first) the 12700k and 12900k are inherently 8c/16t designs as well, with the added e-cores being the only major change.",their 10nm approach for the higher end of the skus was to use 8 hyper-threaded cores and compensate them with lower performance non-ht cores.,"the impressive part is that the p-cores, while following the same trend across the lineup as 11th and 10th gen more or less, got a really great ipc bump over rocket lake too.",so cpus like an *i3-12100* and *i5-12400* are both under $200 and yield previous gen flagship performance.,while the 12600k curb stomps any i7/i9 before 12th gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so itâ€™s just the same die but with higher clocks?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
overpriced 11700k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™d argue the biggest problem it has is that itâ€™s a 5800x priced on par with the 5900x, but yes, thatâ€™s a problem too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

none of these other chips have avx512.,"if that's what you need, it's a much better (and faster) chip.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"11900k is an oc enthousiast chip, capable of high clock if kept cool.",saying its an horrible chip is just plain ignorance.,the only downside to the 11th gen is the slower cache and a wierd imc to work with.,takes time to figure out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"11th gen also fixed nasty silicon bugs from skylake though, and the igpu has av1 decode, pcie4.",itâ€™s not always just about raw performance.,"even if the 10900k is slightly faster in your use case, iâ€™d still go rkl if only for the bug fix.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 11900k is still on the same production node, its a weird backported frankenstein chip.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
better binned yes.,when oc you could get 100-200mhz more.,it might even match a stock 12600k that costs half the price.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all k chip are same die anyway.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my 12700k does avx512 with the e-cored disabled.,still much better than 11900k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
â€¦ and the terrible price/performance?,thereâ€™s no excuse for selling an eight-core chip for $550 in 2021.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's horrible compare to what you can get for the same price(or even cheaper), why would you get a 11900k when you can get a 5900x for cheaper, 5900x was $450-$500 while 11900k was $550, it's not a bad cpu on it own, it's a bad cpu when compare to other option you can get for around the same price",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
