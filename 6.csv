"yeah my cpu useage is typcally in the single digits, up to 15% occasionally

but in fact it's more about 20-45% useage on 2-4 cores

it never maxes my cpu cores out but as i said, it doesn't use them all.",which is a bit weird since i remember having a nearly perfect parallelisation on my old phenom x6.,like all six cores had the same useage of about 80% when i did basically nothing than just drive around a bit.,"(the x6 was cool, lovee that cpu
easily outperformed the fx six cores that replaced it haha.",like the fx needed approximately 800-1000mhz more to outperform the phenom.,"i overclocked my phenom from 2,8 stock, 3,2 boost on three cores to 4,0ghz on all six cores haha.","still have the board and a case in my basement)


my gpu is mostly around 85% usrage on maps with high res textures because vram is full, but will be at 99% on other maps etc when i'd unlock the framerate.",cyberpunk somehow manages to have the gpu at 100% matter how full the vram is outdoors/when driving.,"in missions, indoors or on foot it rund better and maxes out the fps limit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the highest performing chip on a socket will always hold their value.,"many users that are on i5's for an older socket type motherboard like lga-1151, see it as cheaper option to go with an i9 rather than upgrading the entire system motherboard and memory.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah dude you'll be fine with the 9900k for a bit.,at least to see what the next gen x3d series can do and compare from there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>ke all six cores had the same useage of about 80% when i did basically nothing than just drive around a bit.,yeah cyberpunk is crazy demanding.,i learned the hard way that amd fx series wasn't good.,i was younger and not really on top of pc's and had my dad get us an fx-4130.,it was quickly obvious i should've went with intel at the time even an i3 would've been faster.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it isnâ€™t â€œcheaperâ€ though.,"on amazon, the 9900kf costs $428.",the 12600kf costs $278.,you can throw in a motherboard with the 12600kf and it would still be cheaper.,both can use ddr4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>yeah cyberpunk is crazy demanding.,"that comment was about beamng.drive

sadly, the phenom iis lack certain instruction sets and features to run cyberpunk etc.",cpu useage on my ryzen is about 5-20% in cyberpunk,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
right i agree with you but that's the way it has always been.,it was the same with the 3770k 4790k etc.. it could also be that it's more simple upgrade for people.,i personally only buy the highest tier chip when i upgrade every 4 or 5 years so i'm never tempted to upgrade just the cpu later on.,"i think you could definitely find one cheaper used one than $428 but since they aren't produced anymore, brand new chips are more rare and go up in value sometimes (especially from amazon sellers)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i'd personally change the case, there's tons of airflow restricting material, even if the case looks good.","don't overpay for asus boards and simply grab z690-a pro ddr5 or z790-p board and a pcie wifi board, there's also no reason at all for 64 gb of ram with your use case, grab 2x16 gb 6000 mhz ddr5 memory, preferably on hynix dies (they have unequal primary timings).","also, consider grabbing 6700 xt as it's pretty much the same price as 3060 ti and faster, plus gigabyte's 3xxx series are above average unreliable and break down significantly more often than counterparts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you only game take that 100$ of the ram and drop it to 32 and get a decent case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

is there particular reason you need 64gb ram and z790 board?,raptor can run on 600 b h and z series too.,do not go with the super expensive motherboards because you will have no use of it.,as far as games you play go you only need 16gb ram to play it very very comfortably.,"ddr5 sure is alright, but if you want budget you should go with ddr4.","there is performance difference between the two, but you will hardly notice it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hmm.,pretty much agreed with all of this.,op: i have a cheap gigabyte 6700xt and it would be more than overkill for 1080p gaming.,"i use mine at 5760x1200 in many games, and it even does that just fine.",donâ€™t skimp on cooling.,"youâ€™re looking at a pretty nice system there, so get a good modern case with good wire routing and airflow, and then load it up with quality fans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

z790 why, just get asus z690-p or msi z690-a and save towards a better gpu

ddr5 why, 4%difference for double the price?",i'm going to go and say he should get a 32 inch 165hz monitor.,they are less expensive than he thinks and it's what you are constantly looking at.,there is a lot more enjoyment to be had in a better monitor.,i'd probably have more fun with a 10 year old pc on a good monitor than a brand new pc on a 1080p monitor.,he isn't going to regret it and it will outlast your pc by a long stretch.,get a used 3060ti.,"mod the case to be able to fit the 3 fan version, even if it means destroying it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or like run it on the motherboard box for a month until you can afford a new case.,check second hand market in your area for a deal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i personally would go with 32 gb,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
am i tripping or is this basicass cooler is almost same price as deepcool ak620?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a case is an enclosure.,front ports are creature comforts at best.,don't you see bigger problems coming like the wattage and condition of the psu he will be running these brand new components in?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"good ddr5 are currently cheaper than b-die and are much faster, plus sticking to 16 gigs is already stupid, adhering to get trash hynix based ddr4 that are overtaken by literally cheapest ddr5 is even more stupid.",the total price difference is both minuscule atm and there's nothing you could redirect the saved cash towards to.,why z790?,for much better ddr5 clock capabilities.,"&#x200b;

"you said double the price and that's clear indicator you meant for the op to grab 16 gb ddr4 or you're still living in 2021. trash tier ram is always a no-no unless you literally cannot spend more dime on a pc, it's easily cpu family difference in games (i5 >i7) and more, given oem 4800 mhz already produces significantly more fps than a pair of shit 3600 hynixes while costing same as 32 gb kit of said memory, this is simply a no brainer.","so far the only exception of this rule is zen4 with ram bandwidth being heavily restricted, resulting in very little performance uplift by going from 5200 to 6000 mhz.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"tl;dr (per techpowerup):

  
""in our highest resolution 4k ultra hd, the core i9-12900k is 6.5% faster than the ryzen 7 5800x when averaged across all games, but you have to pay close attention to individual tests.","in highly cpu-bound games such as anno 1800, the framerate jumps up by a whopping 28%, and with far cry 5, by 26%.","there are several other games posting 15-20% performance gains, which are hard to ignoreâ€”hitman 3, halo infinite, death standing, dota 2, aoe iv, you name it.","but then there are several other games, including recent ones, and ones that use the latest game engines and apis, where the performance difference is under 5%, or in quite a few cases, even under 3%.","control, for example, posts a meager 0.2% performance gain.",these bulk of games drag down the average to 6.5% overall.,the reason behind the games with minimal improvements has to do with the games being gpu-limited at 4k.,"this should be the ""normal"" situation, you want your games to be gpu-limited, because the gpu is much more expensive than the cpu.","so if you run cpu limited, you'll have wasted money on the graphics card, because the gpu is sitting idle, waiting for the cpu to push out more frames.",there are no situations where the 5800x ends up faster than the 12900k by a whole-number percent at 4k.,things get interesting with 1440p.,"first off, the rtx 4090 really isn't designed for 1440p.","you can max out 1440p with even older generation cards such as the rtx 3070 ti, but perhaps those with high-refresh rate monitors would want to pay attention.","averaged across all game tests, the 12900k ends up a significant 13.8% faster than the 5800x.",all those titles that posted a 20-25% performance gains at 4k are now seen with 30-45% gains!,the 5800x really is posing a severe cpu bottleneck.,"all the games that were gpu-bottlenecked at 4k are now clocking at least a 3-10 percent performance gain, which goes a long way in uplifting the overall average.","there are a couple of cases where the 5800x ends up faster than the 12900kâ€”tests such as devil may cry 5, ac: valhalla, gta v, and prey.","dmc-5 could be a case of the game not being fully optimized for the intel hybrid architecture, with thread director misplacing the game's worker threads onto the slower e-cores.","1080p gains purely academic significance with a graphics card of the performance level of rtx 4090. even the high refresh-rate crowd would do well to save a ton of money by opting for a cheaper graphics card around the $700-mark, such as the rx 6900 xt or rtx 3080 10 gb.","with the games being thoroughly cpu-bottlenecked, the high frequency and ipc of the 12900k lends it a large 15.7% performance lead over the 5800x when averaged across all games, at 1080p.","we see several titles such as the guardians of the galaxy, halo infinite, warhammer iii, and watch\_dogs legion gain performance in the 35-50% range.","several other titles clock 15-30% gains, but the bulk still push 0-10% gains, which drags down the average.",dmc-5 loses as much as 59% frame-rates for the same reason it does with 1440p.,"intel's massive frame-rate gains aren't just a function of the 15-20% higher ipc of the ""golden cove"" p-cores of the 12900k versus the ""zen 3"" cores of the 5800x; but several other factors that lubricate the graphics rendering pipeline, such as the larger caches available to the p-cores (1.25 mb per core, 30 mb l3); the faster main-memory running at ddr5-6000 compared to ddr4-4000 for the amd machine; which have a cumulative impact on the cpu-level bottleneck.","comparing the 3d graphics apis at 4k uhd, we can't really see a pattern where intel's architecture favors one api over the other.",directx 12 and vulkan are supposed to have better parallelization for the cpu-side of things; while nvidia has optimized its directx 11 code-path to be parallelized over the years.,"therefore, all three apis show 6.4-6.6% performance games, which make up the 6.5% average.","older games are expected to be slightly less parallelized, particularly those released in 2018 or before; which were most likely developed on quad-core machines.","here, the 12900k is showing a 6.4% higher framerate than amd on average, likely due to its sheer ipc and clock-frequency uplift.",the memory-level bottleneck is less pronounced.,"surprisingly, games released between 2019 and 2020 are only 5.5% faster on the intel machine, this is probably around the time game developers were discovering higher cpu core-counts, and building for 6-core and 8-core machines.","the latest games (released between 2021 and 2022), favor intel in a bigger wayâ€”averaging 7.9%â€”the games are clearly getting more parallelized, taking advantage of newer instruction-sets, and perhaps intel's thread director is able to harness the power of the e-cores with some of these games.","intel's performance leads over amd are in the 30-50% in some cases, despite its ipc only being \~20% higher than ""zen 3,"" proves that the amd platform is being held back by slower memory as well.","intel's 12th gen, amd's ryzen 7000 ""zen 4,"" and intel's upcoming 13th gen, paired with ddr5 memory, would be the ideal platforms for the rtx 4090, and someone still on a ryzen 5000-series (or older) platform should brace for performance losses arising from the cpu bottleneck, but it's very game-dependent.","all said, the geforce rtx 4090 is a next-generation graphics card that demands a next-generation platform.","our 13th gen core ""raptor lake"" reviews will go live in the coming days, and so you'll be able to make an informed choice on one.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

is anyone surprised by this ?,we already knew 12900k is faster than vanilla 5800x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tpu tested the 4090 with the 5800x and recieved some criticism from the community saying he probably cpu bottlenecked the 4090 with this cpu.,he basically wanted to test how true these claims were.,"regardless, he said he'll do this again with the 13900k and 7950x in the upcoming weeks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i believe it's to show how the 4090 is cpu bottlenecked with older (not even that old) processors even at 4k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the author stated elsewhere they were testing the 5800x3d next.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
agreed!,the 5800x was already released in 2020 and the 12900k was launched in 2022.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yup.,i feel like itâ€™s finally time.,the 9900k held up so well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

but nobody knew there would be a cpu bottleneck at 1440p with the 5800x using a 4090,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its to see how much a relatively recent mid range cpu bottlenecks a 4090 compared to a newer high end cpu.,"the 4090 breaks the conventional idea that you only need to upgrade your cpu at 1080p or with cpu bound games, it's being partially bottlenecked by almost every cpu out now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"hm, alright.",though i'd personally put 5800x against 12600k to make it more reasonable.,the average score is completely pointless and misleading due to numbers deviation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah it depends on the games you play.,i mostly play cpu intensive sims.,"only reason i snagged the 4090 on launch day is cause i wanted it to be here by the time the i9-13900k arrives in the mail cause i knew it was gonna be tough to find one after the initial rush

one of the reasons i want an arc a770 is also for linux support.,"and spec/price wise it's almost unbeatable, it might be possible in the future that especially on linux for it to reach rtx 3070 levels as the hardware should be capable",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they are very good value cards but some of us are willing to trade off some experience for supporting a third vendor in the market.,"(plus av1 encoding, and usable raytracing performance are added benefits).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
clearly you are in the wrong sub!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you have to be on kernel 6.0 for arc to work correctly.,but assuming you are using kernel 6.0 or higher you should be good to go.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, as much as i think arc is just nowhere near ready for prime time, itâ€™s competitive enough that iâ€™m glad people are buying it to support intel, because we need some honest-to-goodness competition in this broken market.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so i have read, but i am planning this pc long term, my current one lasted almost 10 years, only upgraded the ram and ssd.","i will research a bit more, but i think i'm gonna try to get an arc a770 :d",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"depends on the audience, most people don't care about older games, or stuff like that (and even in older games in terms of benchmarks sure it sucks, but it's still playable)

the fact that intel is competitive on popular games, already responds to the use-case of most gamers",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to see intel gpus making use of lots of pcie specs, i guess this stems from its root aka the igp.",this seems to causes reverse situation compared to amd ulps registry bit.,"afaik ulps was crucial for mobile dgpus a decade ago though these days all power management stuff are handled by smu for both amd gpus and igps

now i've never came across aspm settings on any intel nor amd mobos (most likely due to shoddy bios on cheap boards) but i don't seem to never came across it on business/server grade boards that i managed to get my hands on either.",intel can force their partners to expose this bit on their chipset but i'm not sure if amd would want to considering they and nvidia have no need for this pcie bit and arc isn't in hot demand either for amd to bother their mobo partners,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
anyone remember the radeon 4870?,90w idle consumption.,surely it can't be worse than that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what kind of idle power consumption is considered normal for the arc a770?,i'm curious if some reviewers got it wrong.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm surprised they didn't target refresh rates over 60hz, considering the entire market is moving in that direction.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would this on media playback and multi monitor reduce the consumption?,"it tops the charts on anything, not just idle",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i couldnâ€™t find the bios settings they mention, but setting pcie power control had no apparent difference.",my a750 is reporting 33-37w idle before and after.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's not, like 40w before fix",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>also note that if you attach a display to arc graphics with a refresh rate over 60hz requires the gpu to run at slightly higher clocks to drive the pixel throughput.,this isn't anything new.,"in the past, using high refresh rates [significantly increased power consumption](https://www.pcgamer.com/144hz-monitors-and-nvidia-gpus-draw-surprising-amounts-of-power/) - even while ""idle"".","it's improved a lot since, but using a higher refresh rate will require more resources than 60hz even for basic tasks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that depends pretty heavily on your gpu and the rest of the system as well as the games you play.,needs a lot more info,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"worthiness will depend on your budget, setup and the difference from current performance to target performance.","for the main games you play, what is your desired fps?","do you hit your monitor's refresh rate, or no?",do you need to?,do you play max settings and care more about graphics than performance?,"are you on 1080p, 2k, 4k?",do you play older games or new titles?,are you cpu bound for the games you play?,so many variables,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

nope.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you would see a better improvement from upgrading your gpu imo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you would need a new motherboard for any significant gains.,"with 13th gen coming out soon, i would consider the 13600k as its the latest gen and will last you a very long time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i guess like for the price of a new cpu, would it change performance a marginal amount for newer games.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

intel really needs to improve their driver version numbers.,they're such a pain to decipher.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i really like intel's release notes on their drivers.,seems like they're actually putting forth a ton of effort.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
curious how a770 does in plague,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, i'm trying to understand why there's so many decimals.","all of their drivers have been in this format xx.0.101.xxxx, where x is the only numbers that have changed between versions.","i know the first two numbers are the major release version, but what's the 0 and the 101 that's in every driver release?","if they'd drop those it'd at least be 31.3491 which isn't exactly great, but it's at least a lot more human readable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
first 2 numbers are newest supported wddm version i think.,"101 is there after the last number crossed over 10,000 and looped back around to 1069, changing the 100 to 101. i'm guessing it can go up to 999 theoretically.",also i think this is the microsoft mandated driver versioning system.,they could use their own versioning system when announcing new drivers like nvidia.,i think nvidia's newest driver is 522.25 even though the driver version listed in device manager is 31.0.15.2225,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

only 10th gen and above is officially supported to have rebar.,"however, some motherboard manufacturer actually updates to bring such support so you have to check that.",there is another thread like this here: https://www.reddit.com/r/intel/comments/mgxoiy/resizable_bar_support_for_9700k/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no; 9th gen doesnâ€™t have rebar so it will perform really bad.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

but does nvidia let you enable it?,afaik they block it under 10th gen. but that might be wrong or out of date.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably because it never was limited by hardware.,"i mean, if it works now on zen 2, it obviously wasn't the issue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

>if the t&cs say that, weâ€™ll fix them.",buying either the intel a770 or a750 limited edition qualifies for the bundle.,"&#x200b;

naturally, *that* specific wording seems to suggest that non-intel arc gpus (asrock, gigabyte, etc) may not be eligible.",so it'd be great to have clarification on the prior clarification.,"some intel folks are going to be resident on the 21st for an ama about the raptor lake launch, i expect it to be brought up there to get a final, unambiguous answer (which is tough to do, these days).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"after you go through the redemption and sign up, unfortunately cod canâ€™t be downloaded until 10/28.",i have yet to receive anything else from the intel insider gaming access thing yet.,there was a promotion for 3 games when you bought a cpu but that ended in july.,are the 3 games offered with the intel account sign up different from those or the same?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"also i think i found some more info from pcgamesn.com that seems to make things a bit clearer

[pcgamesn.com article on arc bundle](https://postimg.cc/yvp6ykr3)

it seems that while you only get cod with the bundle itself if you register for some program called the intel gaming access program you'll get the other 3 games they've been advertising.",maybe you can look into this further on your end and see if you can actually register for it.... would be really helpful if you can let me know what you find!,thanks again!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea just find it kinda crazy that these cards are in the hands of actual customers yet can't find any feedback on the promo beyond the t&c and other marketing / editorial coverage... like has no one with this card tried to use this promo?,just find it very strange.... and the whole wording and implementation very poorly handled.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i tweeted ryan for clarification and also reached out to another user who has his card in hand and was redeeming as we spoke we worked through it together as when he redeemed he did only get cod but i found an article that pointed to the end user needing to register for intel gaming access program to get the other 3 games i shared this info with him he went to the site signed in and got the email for the other 3 games... so you will technically only get cod + pick 3 with the card but if you then sign up or go access the intel gaming access program you'll get the other 3 games in an email.,"ryan also responded to my tweet and laid out these details just a few moments ago confirming what me and the other reddit user had already gotten to the bottom of.... lol

but atleast now we know for sure how it works and even have word directly from the source as to how it's supposed to work.",ryan says they are relaying better updated info to partners so hopefully soon it won't be nearly as confusing for those who aren't actively searching for this info like i was.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't know about the previous offer you're speaking to but it looks like you get gotham knights ghostbusters and something else i can't rememeber off hand now if you do in fact go sign up for that program i spoke of... had multiple people including ryan shrout himself confirm this for me.,only with the intel arc limited edition a750/70 not any other 3rd party cards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i come bearing updates!,"i was previously signed up with intel gaming access, but i went back to the page and signed in again, and now i got an email with the code to the other three games!","i'm not sure if there was a delay, or whether me going back and signing in again triggered it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah.,"from what themalcore added, it sounds like it should go through no problem.","i had passed on ordering an a770 when they first went live on newegg, but then did decide to give one a whirl when preorders went up.",i'll try to follow up if it successfully ships and if it includes the same promo (as well as whether or not it redeems on my main ryzen rig).,update for posterity: newegg left out the promotion when they got around to shipping out my backorder; i had to contact their customer service by phone and have them look into it.,the code was sent via newegg message (account center) later that evening.,"the gpu itself arrived a few days later and i was able to redeem both cod mw2 as well as three of the productivity applications, though their servers collapsed when mw2 went live.","during the redemption of the arc promo, enrolling in their gaming access program also granted keys to ghostbusters: afterlife, gotham knights and settlers (not yet released).","i waited until the gpu was on hand to start the redemption process, but it ended up not being required.","no platform checks were performed, and the only thing needed was the master key for the web portal.","got there in the end, it was just a bit of a pain in the ass.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

excellent sir.... i think we've cracked this one... thanks again oh and one more time just to confirm what cpu did you have installed?,want to make sure that does or doesn't seem to matter as again the intel t&c makes it quite confusing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thanks man i have a feeling it will be fine on your ryzen rig but getting some hard evidence as to such would likley ease plenty of future buyers minds when making the decision on whether its worth it to give the gpu a try.,please keep me updated and thanks again for working with me to get to the bottom of this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can confirm works fine on any system gpu not even required to be installed (did whole process from my phone) master key from retailer gets you cod bundle + 3 software if you choose to sign up for intel gaming access during registration you'll eventually get an email (landed in promos for me in gmail) that includes another master key this time for the other 3 games.,hope this helps!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

my store didnâ€™t even know they were getting them.,there were only 5 total â€œlaunchâ€ stores and mine wasnâ€™t one of them so honestly i wouldnâ€™t be surprised if they didnâ€™t know about the promotion-there is a way to submit a receipt on intelâ€™s site but it seemed broken.,this current promotion thing is running through february which is good.,hopefully if i can drive there today iâ€™ll what they say,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
got the email from intel.,they give you a â€œmaster keyâ€ (their term for redemption code) and that adds the promotion to your intel account and that shows on the â€œdashboardâ€ there.,iâ€™m going to go to micro center today to figure out what they need to do to give me the promo for my 770. iâ€™ll make a new post with screenshots and clear info on how it works.,"the 3 additional games are gb: spirits unleashed, gotham knights, and the settlers pc standard edition.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok man well still a small bit of cloudiness is still possible til we for sure see someone with a non new intel cpu and an arc gpu get the same but i have a feeling you're probably right and either way (for me atleast) it won't matter as i too have a 12700k.,i hope this info helps others who have questions finally kinda understand how it all works and what qualifies thanks again for helping me get to the bottom of it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
interesting.,i have the intel gaming windows app and i don't see the new games mentioned anywhere.,just the cod bundle.,i registered with the gaming thing after redeeming my cod bundle and reading you could get the other three.,the whole thing confuses me honestly.,"outside the app, i don't see where to even sign in on the web.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if they can't help you there's an option on the site to submit a purchase verification thing and likley that will get you a key if you can't get mc to figure out out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
any word back from mc?,i'm in the same boat with a a750 and did not receive a master key for my purchase.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i got my master code from newegg and used it of the intel software offer page and it mentioned signing up to get the 3 other games i clicked yes / continue on that page and finished the survey saw the cod + pick 3 bundle in the dashboard but i can't find anywhere or anything else about the other 3 games not on this site nor the intel gaming access site....

not sure what i'm supposed to do or what i'm looking for.",am i supposed to to go someplace else to get them should i be looking for an email is there more steps i didn't mention i need to do?,any help would be appreciated if you have in fact gotten access to the other 3 games please share any details and anything i missed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got both sets with a amd 5950x and a 3090 in my system.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so here's what i've just found out after going through the process.,"get master key from retailer

enter key and begin sign up process

when asked to join intel gaming access program for 3 more games say yes and continue through the page to confirm that you want to join and finish survey.","you'll eventually finish and land on the dashboard with the cod bundle listed and not much else to do for now as cod can't be activated til 28th but you can pick your 3 software (i only picked one so far)

after some time you'll eventually get an email from intel (landed in my promo section in gmail) that says ""welcome to arc insiders"")

open this email to find another master key this one for the remaining 3 games

hopefully this finally spells things out as clearly as possible for everyone.","no you don't need a intel cpu installed you don't even need your arc gpu (heck i did all of it from my phone)

no need to download any app app or sign in on anything else.",let me know if anyone has any questions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

drove back to mc tonight.,they are clueless.,someone in the general product area basically said if itâ€™s not on their website somewhere then itâ€™s something thatâ€™s not currently active.,"i ended up having to buy something anyway so then i talked to somebody up at the customer service desk when i checked out, and they said typically when things include codes for promotions, that it filters through all of their systems and the code and instructions print out on the receipt or you get an email, because the purchase triggers them needing your email thatâ€™s how things in the past have worked.",there was a previous intel gamer days promo this summer and the codes for qualifying cpu purchases were on the receipt.,i think we need to reach out to intel or maybe mc over their support email links and see what they say.,the intel dashboard and account set-up for the promo has a way to submit proof of purchase but the buttons to upload seemed non-functional.,"the promo period seems like itâ€™s going to last for three months, so what i worry about is that micro center wonâ€™t be involved with the promotion until way past a possible return date and the employees basically just said that because of their price protection thing that a manager may be able to basically return and resell the product, which would then trigger any possible code on the receipt once it was active in their system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thereâ€™s no number to call them over the phone so if i canâ€™t make it there tonight i wonâ€™t be able to go until thursday unfortunately.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the article made a mistake in their comparison to the 7950x, amd's ""65w"" mode refers to the cores only, the full package power of that mode, the one comparable with the value controlled by intel's pl1/pl2 settings, is ~90w.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"question is, how much will it cost?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
honestly this amount of power in the hands of the consumer is amazing and overkill all at the same exact time.,most users are completely fine with i5 or heck even an i3.,i think both amd and intel have winners on their hands this generation.,and the real winner is the consumer.,can't wait for comparisons on the e cores and amd full cores.,that is the only thing that i am looking forward to.,mobile laptops that can take advantage of p & e cores for exactly what we want.,all day battery life laptop machines that can double down as desktop replacement devices.,i think we've already hit peak smartphones when samsung and qualcomm featured the very first 7nm chips in their smartphones.,i am still rocking a samsung s10+ and that guy can get pretty much all day battery usage even 3 years in.,everything still feels snappy and quick.,apps load fast.,only thing that would tempt me to upgrade is a headphone usb-c dongle and better optical zoom over my current device.,i don't even care about 5nm or 7nm chips in my phone or whether the qualcomm snapdragon can beat the apple silicon.,(i know apple is better - but android has more freedoms).,anywho rant over.,i am excited for the ama this friday.,these guys make some exciting stuff.... can't wait for mobile to launch...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that's true because the only real difference you get with a i9 or r9 is the multi thread performance boost.,the single thread and gaming performance is pretty much the exact same all the way down the stack on the same generation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you are allowed to upgrade.,8th gen intel to 13th gen is roughly 5 years.,which is why i like intel's naming scheme versus amd's as it is much easier to track the passage of time/improvements.,i recall 8th gen i5 is on 14nm and features just 6 cores and 6 threads with no hyperthreading.,"so the bandwidth for memory, pcie, and io will likely be much slower.",definitely you must upgrade.,just depends on you.,going from 14nm to raptor lake intel 7 (internally was 10nm esf) is a huge leap.,"if you can soldier on and wait a bit, you can jump to meteor lake which will be on intel 4 (internally was intel 7nm) so double the process node improvements and likely 5x the thread count.....

going from 6threads to 32threads.",and from 4.3ghz upwards towards 6ghz ?,??,haha it will be like night and day.,"ddr4 to ddr5..... pcie 3.0 to pcie 5.0

for sure the i/o has improved, since i5 8600k only required i/o for 6 threads.",wait 1 year or go for raptor lake.,you can't go wrong!!,!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well do you see 100% cpu usage?,"depending on the tier of performance you're after, i would either wait 1 more year for 14th gen, or i would just get a 12400.

with msi mag b660m you can even overclock non-k skus and you will be able to upgrade to 13900k one day if you want too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's really not.,"oh no, in maybe one game at 4k that gets 200fps in an engine that has engine limitations and doesn't utilise a cpu well you can't get more fps...

while in other games you get 400fps at 1080p, 300fps at 1440p, 200fps at 4k... and all with relatively low settings usually.","https://www.techpowerup.com/review/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-founders-edition/11.html

cpu limited, technically sure, in reality, the engine is trash, if another game uses that engine in 5 years, that engine will still be trash and a faster cpu will still be a problem because the engine is trash.","calling a gpu cpu limited because in one or two bad engines that limit everything is frankly absurd, that's not how it works.",the best games graphically in 5 years will not be cpu limited by a 12core 5900x or intel equivalent unless you buy the most expensive gpu and play at the lowest settings or play a broken game.,"i mean, the 7950x, the 5800x3d and the 13900k will all be massively cpu limited if you play a game at 720p, but is that relevant to anyone for any reason, nope.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i remember people said the same about ddr3, so i bought into ddr4.",now that i'm upgrading they are saying the same about ddr4 to ddr5.,"even when i'm staying on ddr4, there are now faster memory that it just makes more sense to just buy new ram altogether.","point is, there is no future proofing really anymore unless you are a mid/low range buyer.","you have to replace the entire thing, which exacerbate the whole keeping my pc longer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"it's actually a joke tho, sorry for the inconveniences, really.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so you really just need a cpu with about 20% higher clock on the main thread.,the 12400 can be overclocked to 5ghz+ on all 6 cores and can be found for less than $200.,and the same is true for the mag b660m mortar max wifi ddr4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm assuming you will see up to 100/80 = 25% better performance.,at least in theory and assuming you don't encounter any other kind of bottleneck.,"the biggest improvement will be the frametimes though, all these pre 10th gen intel cpu's lack hyperthreading which makes some demanding games stuttery, especially at higher framerates.",the jump to 13th gen will be huge.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ue5 isn't particularly cpu heavy at all from everything i've read.,you're talking about unreleased unoptimised games and consoles going for 30fps targets.,"those same consoles have limited gpus and limited cpu performance and power to go with it, limited clock speeds.",them looking like going for 30fps targets on consoles isn't remotely indicative that ue5 is cpu heavy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but will it delivery as good cpu frame times in vr as 13th gen i7?,thats literally all i care about.,vr performance.,"and my cpu frame times at the moment are way to high, i want to be 100% gpu limited and low consistent cpu times",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"some people are telling me that â€œall you need is an i5 for gamingâ€

what i want is the best minimum fps because the most demanding i do is vr.","i can dial in my graphics settings to suit my 3080 (i aim for 6-7ms gpu frame times) but my cpu frame times on my 8600k move around alot

this is why i want to get as much cpu performance as possible.",surly the i7 would delivery better lows right?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"of course i don't know for sure, but 12th gen and 13th gen are the same thing.",its just a slight difference in design.,they even share mobos.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, an i5 is indeed good enough for most people, it is a very capable cpu for its price.",if you absolutely need frametime stability for vr though you need to get a cpu with as many p cores as possible.,"the e cores aren't extremely useful for gaming yet, but they still contribute to better frametimes.",in your case the 13700k would be very solid.,overclock it and you should have a good experience.,"of course the cpu is only one of the things, you also need to have a decent ddr5 kit and ideally tune it (either with xmp, or preferably, manually if you know how to).",a good ssd is also very helpful in minimizing stutter and sudden hiccups.,"also if you don't mind going amd the 5800x3d is a very good chip with impressive 0.1 and 1% lows, but you run into the risk of encountering some usb issues and i'm assuming this is the last thing you wanna hear when you are specifically interested in vr.",but the option is there.,"either way all 12th gen i5 or better, the upcoming 13th gen lineup, 5800x3d and zen 4 are very solid for gaming.",even if you decide to cheap out and just get a 12600k you won't miss much.,"surely a 13700k will deliver more consistent frames, but it's not like cheaper alternatives are garbage.",any of these chips is a huge jump from a 8600k.,also here's a good advice that many people ignore but helps a lot.,"if you don't need the maximum amount of fps the gpu can push, you can always cap the framerate to something your system can *consistently* deliver.","this helps tremendously with frametime consistency, since the framerate won't fluctuate much, if any.","it's better to have for example a steady 60 fps, rather than hover anywhere between 50 and 100 with sudden spikes.",a fluid consistent image helps a lot to avoid motion sickness in vr.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks for the detailed response

i play 90hz vr mainly so thats the frame cap.",i plan to get ddr5 6000 cl36 as that looks affordable now.,"the 13700k has 8 p cores vs 6 p cores on the 13600k

my 8600k has 6 cores and it makes sense to me that i should go higher than a 6 core cpu.",i only upgrade cpu every 4-5 years.,playing wireless pcvr requires extra background tasks to run further strengthening my reasoning behind stretching the cpu spec as high as i fan afford this time around.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

also, i think a lot of people are underestimating the performance of e cores.",they aren't that far behind full blown skylake cores.,in many tests they actually outperform skylake.,"&#x200b;

my workloads require synchronization between threads.,individually threads cannot run on different types of cores because then some will complete before others and waste available processing time.,"some of the jobs i have can run on eight threads and be confined to only p or e cores with taskset, but if all of the jobs require more l3 than the chip has available, it doesnâ€™t make sense to run multiple because the penalty of memory access is so high, so you reduce the number of jobs and increase the parallelism to usually just a single job across all of the cores.","so on hybrid chips it is a damned if i do, damned if i donâ€™t situation with the current amount of cache intel has confined themselves to.","ryzen requires limiting one self in the same way by binding jobs within a ccd, but they have enough cache that has never been a problem, and 3d cache on a 7950x would make it not be a problem for many years in the future with the rate at which my workloads usage of l3 increases as i work through more work.","hopefully intel solves these problems in coming generations, otherwise large parts of the scientific computing community are just going to keep ignoring them as long as amd has cheap consumer chips that far outperform xeon chips on a performance per up front cost basis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

>it doesn't mean you can plug a display port 1.4 card today (rtx 4090) into a display port 1.2 and get full support on that monitor.,that's exactly what nvidia did with 4090 card.,"the point is you can plug a 1.4 into a 2.0, but not a 2.0 into a 1.4. having a more updated port gives you more options.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is correct.,"nvidias new 4090 has dp 1.4, which allows for 120hz @4k max unless you use compression.",or 8k60.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's always on.,your refresh rate and your fps are only linked via g-sync/freesync.,you still have to change between them either in windows or in game.,"same as if you picked a 60hz refresh rate, it doesn't just 'unlock' 120hz when you exceed 60fps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

can confirm your \* point.,my 5900hx is rated by amd to be 45w but it happily gobbles up 80w under full load.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for amd it's tdp and ppt.,"amd tdp == intel pl1/'tdp'

amd ppt == intel pl2

most amd fanboys won't differentiate though.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ask gamers nexus",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> intelâ€™a tdp number is based on base clock

i've never found that to be 1-to-1

for instance, my 10850k at it's tdp (125w for both pl1 and pl2 so it was locked) was way above base clocks under prime95 load.","turning turbo off and running base clocks, it was running only 55w.","and if you were running, say, a 10900 non-k at 65w pl1/pl2, you'd get above base clocks in all-core, and full boost turbo in gaming.","load varies, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
amd 7950x 65w tdp = 88w ppt for example.,"don't know the math, but anandtech has these things.",https://www.anandtech.com/show/17585/amd-zen-4-ryzen-9-7950x-and-ryzen-5-7600x-review-retaking-the-high-end/20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it must reach 100c at 44w i am guessing.,bc mine throttles thermally at anything more then 40w with turbo time of 10secs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel lists ""maximum turbo power"" on more recent chips now.",eg.,"https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/230500/intel-core-i713700k-processor-30m-cache-up-to-5-40-ghz.html

as a side note, *maximum turbo* ***power****!!!!!","*

amd's tdp doesn't include something so you have to multiply by 1.35 to get ppt.",if you know ark has maximum turbo power then you probably know tdp vs ppt.,they should both just suck it up and stick the number people care about on the box.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
of course they are.,all cpu properties are made up by their designers.,intelâ€™s listed tdp is the pl1 value in default configuration.,laptop manufacturers can set different tdp according to the cooler design.,"pl1 corresponds to the maximum average heat output of the chip, hence thermal design power.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

correct.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i've found that if long term performance is important to you, say 2-3 hrs of continuous heavy loads then the best thing is to turn off turbo boost",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i donâ€™t think gamersnexusâ€™ explanation of amd tdp is really good.,the tdp doesnâ€™t come from the formula he presents.,tdp is an arbitrary value amd decides based on other values they want to have for the cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the technical definition of base clock is the minimum clockspeed the chip should run while staying under the defined tdp.,so if you put the heaviest possible load at tdp power limit it should run around base clock speed.,conversely if you disable boost forcing to chip locked to base clock it should never exceed tdp.,i have found prime95 with avx hitting fairly close to that level.,"but they are not really 1-to-1 in practice and individual chip variation affects things, temperature affects things etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh, unquestionably.",it was getting there even with lenovoâ€™s stock settings.,"i had undervolted back when i got the laptop, but iâ€™m pretty sure it had stopped working right after numerous bios / windows upgrades and still an ancient version of throttlestop.","so just a few days ago i updated everything, did an even more significant undervolt, and itâ€™s running a whole lot cooler at the stock tdps, such that iâ€™m thinking of boosting them a bit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'll fiddle around using ts and see what's the max performance i can get while keeping reasonable temps.,"imo, i7 1165g7 is a joke.","my friend has i5 1135g7, which turbos to max available speed and still doesn't go over 85c in temps.",which results in roughly same performance and more affordable price.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

too bad for me 11th gen mobile chips can't be undervolted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, i've read about that issue with those two chips in particular, the 4.7ghz turbo of the i7 1165g7 is just too much for its own good.","you could start with 35w, reading intel documentation it turns out that's the real default for the pl2 value (pl1\*1.25).","a lot of websites list much higher values because that's what oems used (with a nudge from intel maybe), probably to claw back some performance in benchmarks against their amd counterparts with up to twice as many cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with turbo boost on it draws loads of power to hit the turbo clock speeds but then laptop thermals are not the greatest so temps shoot up and it throttles back to really low values till it cools down and then the cycle kinda repeats.,it's why u get spikes sometimes.,if u turn it off then it doesn't hit crazy clock speeds but the max non turbo clocks can be maintained for much longer at more manageable temps.,"i have an i5-8300h laptop and i've managed to go from temps ur seeing to 80-85 max on heavy loads for 2 hours or so which is typically how long i play, by turning of turbo.",you can also undervolt it if u want to make it a bit more stable for longer loads.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, yes in general amd cpus use more power than tdp.",but tdp has never meant power consumption.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel's non technical definition of tdp is, and i quote: ""thermal design power (tdp) represents the average power, in watts, the processor dissipates when operating at base frequency with all cores active under an intel-defined, high-complexity workload.""",in practice they make up a tdp number and set base clock to whatever is the speed they can guarantee the chip can do if limited to tdp.,this is why bigger cpus usually have lower base clock.,"for example 12600k has higher base clock values than 12900k, it has less cores so they can run faster while remaining under tdp.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
okay i did some tinkering and now i can set short term temp (via setting pl1) and long term temps (via setting pl2 limit).,if i set power limit to 30w the laptop maxes at 90c.,which is good i guess but not good for sustained use maybe.,"what max temp would you recommend for a laptop, for short duration and long duration usage?",edit: got pl1 and pl2 mixed up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
temperatures do not hurt the chip.,you can happily drive it 100c 24/7 around the clock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"while performing common tasks like browsing the web, watching videos, writing documents and such it wouldn't reach 30w for very long anyway, so i think that's ok, 90c is also as hot as i let my previous laptop get, it really only reached those values while playing games.",it lasted me 6 years and it didn't fail because of the cpu.,"&#x200b;

btw, perhaps it's a typo but pl1 is long term and pl2 is short term.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">yes, but at the end of the day, i can take my 12700k and run it at 65w pl1 and pl2, and it'll run max boost clocks for almost anything except blender and prime95 loads.",that has nothing to do with what the question was.,single core workload would obviously never hit any power limit.,> my experience is that tdp and base clock is untethered.,doesn't follow from above.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i read somewhere that higher temps reduce life of processor and surrounding components.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes it's a typo.,so it is okay if i let short term power bring cpu to 95c and long term to 85c?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i havenâ€™t really heard about cpus dying pretty much ever in normal use conditions.,in some situations if a laptop cooling is really bad some components on the motherboard might die but that isnâ€™t really dependent on the cpu chip temperature.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it can yes, but generally things are far enough away that that isn't a problem.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you are unlikely to get 64gb ddr5-6400 to work.,ddr5 doesn't like to run at high speed in quad rank form.,"even with the best memory you're likely to wind up at 5600.

depends entirely on what you use the pc for.,"for gaming ram only sees significant gains up to 1080p, but this might change on a 13900k & 4090 setup because less bottlenecks elsewhere.","i would say 2x32 ddr5 is just too crazy expensive to be worth it at least up to 12th gen - on 12900k at 1440p, 3600cl16 gear 1 gives 1% less performance in gaming than ddr5 6000cl36.","just make sure your ram is running in gear 1, and its not going to be any more than 1-2% worse than ddr5.",but 13900k and 4090 means less cpu and gpu bottleneck so the difference could increase.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
commenters here saying thereâ€™s only a â€œ1%â€ difference between ddr4 and ddr5 have no idea what they are talking about.,"ddr5 is much faster than ddr4 - going with ddr4 on a high end cpu would actually be a waste of money, as you are not unlocking the full potential of your system.",refer to this: https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/y5u283/is_ddr5_worth_it/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

>or do you think 13900k is much better paired with 64gb ddr5-6000-6400 than with ddr4-4000c16?,functional difference between the 12th gen and 13th gen is essentially more e cores and more/faster cache.,"making the cache more effective will probably decrease the importance of ram, at least to the p cores, so you should be able to get a good idea from the 12th gen benchmarks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it always has been shown that some games have huge improvements with ddr 5 like spider-man with ray tracing.,"if you go with an expensive cpu like a 13900k, you just go for ddr 5. the difference in price of the whole upgrade will be very high anyway since the cpu and the board will cost a pretty penny.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that thread you are referencing is using a video from hw unboxed with ddr4-3200 c14.,the op is using ddr4-4000 c16.,"because actual latency is based on clock speed, he will have 15% better latency + 25% higher bandwidth with his ddr4-4000 vs what hw unboxed used.",hw unboxed is full of newbs by comparison.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's a big yes yes from me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is the correct statement if you go for an expensive cpu.,it is starting to show that ddr5 is faster and it will only continue to get better.,the extra cost of memory will be small when you buy a 13900k with that expensive motherboard that people always seems to get.,"but if you play it smart and buy a 13600k plus an msi pro-a board, ddr4 is a very good choice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's not alot but its something considering its 0.1% lows,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yes, gaming ipc.","rocket lake had l3 cache regressions, but could match/beat zen 3 with high enough clocks and low enough ram latency.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is not correct.,do you own an alderlake?,"with only running with p-cores u can run on the windows energy power saving plan and still hit 5.2ghz, with e cores on the p-cores will only run at 3.8ghz max with the same windows power saving powerplan.","without the e cores the latency goes down, and cpu load goes down as the gaming threads will not be sent to the slower e-cores(which they do) and the perf goes up because the threads will not run on the e cores and ""stall"" the system.",e coes for gaming are worse than running with just the p-cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, that exactly why i did it.",with raptor lake cores off iâ€™ll get that cache up to 5.1 ghz lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 1% and 0.1% are what i care about the most... so if i turn off the garbage cores i get a free +10fps.,ok let's do it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thats what i did want but damn, there was no display port on the 1030.

differences are slim but in the favour of e cores being left on.",why on earth would you want to use windows energy saving plan?,"i have a 12600k, it sits at 5.1 all core with or without e cores.","also energy saving plans should not be reducing a manual overclock, why get a k series and leave it on auto?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

anyway, not at all the same results that i experienced, but i do only test multiplayer games like fps, race sims at fps way over 240.

the first game, horizon dawn prefers the sys without e cores, and the tomb rider game at the first segment of the test likes the config without the e cores as well, before it gets very close.",heck i would call that gpu bound.,"in my tests there are gaps in like 30fps at least here in avg joe games we see pretty much no difference, so yeah if you play single player games like that then i guess u can have it how you please.","heck, 12900k and my 12700k lost to 5800x3d in many games, but with tuning and naurally e-cores off the alderlakes would outperform the 5800x3d, something that his(bangforbackpcgamer) would not see.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i play a lot of ddo though and would love to dual box with a bard, but you have to pay for all the expansions on a second account so meh.","guild wars is iffy getting the second char to follow, its only needed for uw hm solo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"might as well go and buy myself a brand new rtx 4090 and use it with a 14"" 640x480 crt monitor.","if nothing in the system is being stressed, then its likely p cores alone are going to be better.","now bump everything up to 4k max settings, have chrome, afterburner and whatever else open in the background and try again.",these are called variables and you can change the variables to suit whatever your position is on what is better.,the only way that you get those huge gains on p cores only is when nothing else at all in your system is under stress.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"also i just realized those results can't be true, otherwise 12600 non k would be outperforming the 12600k in all those games as well, which clearly isn't the case in any review of the chips.","clearly something else has been done to hamper the e cores on performance, maybe stuff like cache or ringbus clocks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"everyone already knows how power efficient alderlakes are, e.g:

https://www.reddit.com/r/intel/comments/vbnij1/10900k_vs_12600_vs_12600k/

"you don't need a power supply over 100 dollars, just don't get a super cheap / unknown one",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
where are you from?,"it's hard to recommend a psu, especially budget ones, since the best deals can be different from country to country.",similar thing happens to the gpu.,"for that price i'd try to find a used geforce 1650 super, or if the budget allows, a 1660 series.",amd's rx 570/580 should be cheaper but you can assume used ones have been mined on for years.,also they use more power.,"i'd avoid current amd low-midrange cards as they have cut down pcie lanes, which is bad news for older motherboards like yours.","as for the power supply, if you're from europe and aquatuning ships to your country, you can grab a be quiet pure power 11 500w for about 55 euros for example.","even that seems like overkill for an ultra budget optiplex build, but at least you'll be getting good efficiency.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had one of these and put a gtx 1050ti in it for my gf.,it runs off pcie power so doesn't need a new psu.,the 1650 (non super) is the best card you can get that will run off the pcie slot and is decent for 1080p gaming at medium settings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
brand name pcs can be picky with gpus.,the gpu can be perfectly fine but not run in the dell.,the pc have a proprietary power supply?,might need an adapter.,the current power supply might not have a power cable plug for a gpu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you are looking at tray pricing.,"while i agree it shouldn't be 659 either, 599 isn't the ""individual cpu"" price necessarily.","price will come down after initial weeks of course and any sales or offers, you might get it even for less - this is different though.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

can anyone recommend which smaller storefront would be more reliable as for the pre-order stock.,"only reason i haven't purchased anything from b&h, central or ant is fear that they are just accepting as many pre-orders as possible without keeping track of stock.",from what i've seen b&h is notorious for this.,iv considered central computers above ant only because the internet seems split down the middle with their reliability.,"i just want to make sure that i get one on release day, could care less about shipping or a slight upcharge at this point.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is a bit misleading.,"the price for 1000 boxes is the guidance price for the base unit intel sells directly, which in the cpu case is a box of thousand cpus.",itâ€™s not the wholesale price.,big customers get the stuff at individual pricing depending on what they order.,someone like newegg would order hundreds of thousands of cpus and certainly isnâ€™t paying the full amount per cpu.,typically after the initial launch demand intel retail price gets very close to the listed price.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"actually, the op is providing an intel page i havenâ€™t seen before, which specifically says tray pricing is $589 and boxed pricing is $599.",so arguments that boxed pricing is *supposed* to be $659 are false.,and before anyone says thatâ€™s wholesale pricing and markup comes after: itâ€™s not.,manufacturers do not publish wholesale pricing openly on the internet.,"i was in the computer retail biz for a decade, and itâ€™s just not done.","itâ€™s â€œsecretâ€, and dependant on the customerâ€™s business relationship with the wholesaler/distributor.","itâ€™s not like everyone with an ingram micro account pays the exact same, even for the identical quantity of something.","this is obviously intelâ€™s recommended sale pricing, and i kind of wish they would make that more clear.","also, that means that when intel provides a range of pricing on a product - for example the normal 13900k ark page says $589-$599 - they are clearly providing the tray/boxed msrp spread, and not some rage of tray wholesale pricing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i've been testing raptor lake, what i can say about this subject is that any potential cooling improvements will depend on the motherboard and it's socket

i tested the 13900k with a asus z690 board and saw no difference with a socket frame on vs the default socket.","however, using a i5-13600k on a msi z690 a pro i saw significant thermal improvements using the thermal right socket frame.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you aren't going to notice a difference without a/b testing or you did something like the other 12900k help thread yesterday where op spread the paste flat before putting the heatsink on which left an airbubble.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you probably should.,keep the old ilm.,they seem to have ok reviews on amazon.,are there any negative long term effects of the cpu plates?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's not explicitly necessary always on alder lake as is and raptor lake will likely be the same.,the most significant factors are how much thermal headroom you'll likely have with your use case and cooler selection.,some coolers and use cases absolutely do not need it and the risk of installing it (ie potentially voiding motherboard and cpu warranty) is not worth it.,i suggest seeing how you thermals are first unless you're opting for a cooler which regularly shows substantial benefit from a contact frame (in which case i'd reconsider the choice of cooler rather than a contact frame ideally).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just get the anti bending frame.,"it's not that expensive, is easy to replace and can only benefit you.",in germany it costs 13 euro on amazon since some time.,i got the exact same thing on aliexpress for 8 euro.,in general the 13th gen will have the same issue as the 12th gen. there isnt that much room to play with.,they will probably try to counter the bending a bit but overall the issue will stay.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gamers nexus got a 10 degree reduction with these things on a 12900ks.,i'll be getting one as i'll be using the same cooler they did in their review (arctic freezer2).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"probably, i don't see them changing the ihs.",i'm doing fine without a corrector though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there's no way they are changing their verified design to accommodate non-stock oc users or to improve their performance.,the risks are too high.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i bought one just in case,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i read that for z790 motherboards will be some modifications coming for grizzly frame.,the actual frame had problems with z790 mobos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it really doesn't matter if you have the proper mounting kits.,"with my noctua d15 and the 1700 proper mounting kit they provided, i saw zero benefit with the contact frame.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, it will, it's going to have the same ihs and we already know z790 have same ilm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're talking about the contact frame.,"it's like $7 shipped on the slow boat from china, and has been proven to work by gamers nexus.",it can offer up to 10 degrees celsius cooling benefit in the worst cases of ilm pressure.,is $7 worth it for peace of mind?,i think so.,"as long as you aren't a jittery mess when you install it, there's very little risk of doing damage.",there's plenty of tutorials on how to easily install it online.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, the ilm isn't changing, only the cpus.","if you get an lga 1700 cpu,  and you care alot about thermals, then yeah i'd get a bend correcting frame.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"we got them guys, just in case.",it was only around 10â‚¬ each and it's super easy to install.,thanks to everybody for the replies :d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am waiting for a 13900k and a asus z790 hero maximus... im taking no chances as these two parts alone cost me around 2000 dollars in denmark.,completely insane but that's how it is.,it looks like it easy and cheap safeguard even though one can be lucky and its not needed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got a z690 a pro paired with 13600kf and got no thermal improvement at all with washer mod.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is a $10 mod that takes 5 minutes to complete.,"dropped all my cores by 2-3c, for an sff build that's a lot.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
op is specifically asking about raptor lake (13gen) not 12900k/s (alder),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got a 0 degree reduction with it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i got a 10 degree reduction as well, using the thermalright one with mx-4.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>are you sure?,"because the socket, socket lock and cpu should be exactly the same.",i am unable to google and find anything basically around the frame and 13th.,gen.. also because the z690 and z790 are basically twins hehe.. very very small internal change in chipset but exactly same layout and design.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you notice any difference in temps?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how do you already have a 13600kf?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2-3c is absolutely nothing.,come on.,it changes nothing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2-3c is literally margin of error.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they use the same exact ilm on both chipsets, the cpu generation isn't the factor to consider.",it will be beneficial to either.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and what difference do you think that makes?,"this isnt an issue with the cpu, its an issue with the bracket on the motherboard.",z790s are still using the same retention brackets which means bending and even poor cooler to ihs contact out of the box will happen on any chip you put in them.,"the bending correctors also only work if the ihs and cooler contact plates are as flat as possible, if it doesn't work that means either or both of those are too uneven and not making good contact still, in that case the only option for improvement is to lap the ihs.",or it can also mean they were already flat with good contact to begin with.,"overall, using the bend corrector is far easier to do than either lapping or delidding, but for people it does nothing for then those are the two remaining options.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"with or without the same cooler (arctic freezer 2, size shouldn't matter as only the cpu mount does).","they did a bunch of contact tests, with stock retention bracket, the contact between the cooler baseplate and cpu ihs was horrendous, less than 50% of the cpu was touching the heatsink.","with both the thermaltake and thermal grizzly bend correctors, most of the baseplate was in contact with the ihs.","the reason the cooler is important is that it also has to be as flat as possible, and they said arctic freezer 2 has some of the most level baseplates out of most coolers.","if the contact frame did nothing, either the cooler base is not flat, or just out of the box the cpu could be even more uneven.",in that case the only way to get an improvement would be if the cpu was lapped.,also you mention 0 degree reduction as in you added it after already using the cpu and stock retention bracket?,is it possible that the cpus might even get slightly bent beforehand and then the contact plate cant straighten them enough?,(too small to notice by looking at it).,"i'll be wanting to put the thing on as soon as i get the 13th gen chip, so the ihs is as flat as possible, i never lapped a cpu before and really don't want to.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my bracket arrived today, though it wont be installed until i get 13th gen which will be when software bundles are added.","motherboard and case should arrive this week, but i'll use my 12600k without the bracket as you have to remove the bracket to remove the cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
100% confirmed by thermal grizzly support.,there are difference with screw lengths with z790 boards.,they will be selling bracket with screws to fit it.,in some z790 boards screws are shorter and its actually too short.,leading to situation when u start to catch one screw and the opposite one its impossible to get because its too short.,the bracket itself its same as 12 gen one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so far, about 7-10 degrees down compairing both mine and my friend's.",he didn't intall it so we could check on the differences.,"so imo, it's was totally worth itfor the price and the easy install.","plus, the cleaning of the thermal paste that might get on it is super easy too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i ordered one and they sent me lol...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
agree.,"unless you are oc'ing to the edge of the cpu's life, that small drop won't make a difference.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
every degree matters in a silence-focused build.,"it translates to more time spent in the inaudible range, and lower peak noise under load.",though perhaps everything takes so much power now that near-silence isnâ€™t achievable anymore.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mine dropped about 8c on a 12700k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i tested kraken x62, alphacool eisbã¤er and alphacool xpx pro water block.",all of those have a decent mounting bracket.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have bought a thermal grizzly contact frame yesterday, so what should i do?",cancel my order or ask thermal grizzly suport where can i buy the new bracket?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i would recommend getting the 13700k in your situation.,"the i7-13700k is going to be mostly equivalent in perf to the 12900k (same 8 p-core, 8 e-core configuration, slightly higher clocks on raptor lake) and is on preorder for between $420-$450 right now.",it also works with z690 motherboards (make sure that your motherboard supports qflash for the bios though).,"according to intel's slides, raptor lake (13th gen) is going to perform better at lower wattages as well [https://download.intel.com/newsroom/2022/2022innovation/13th-gen-intel-core-desktop-media-presentation.pdf](https://download.intel.com/newsroom/2022/2022innovation/13th-gen-intel-core-desktop-media-presentation.pdf) (see slide 32 comparing the 12900k vs 13900k, but it should be somewhat comparable for the 13700k).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m not sure where youâ€™re getting that conclusion.,benchmarks show that the 7700x from amd beat the 13700k in gaming but not in mt production.,"so if gn showed the 12900k not far off from the 7950 and ahead and slightly behind the 7900x, it will most certainly be better than a 13700",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
where?,"- exact same number of cores/threads
- faster frequencies (4.2/5.4 vs 3.9/5.1)
- greater cache size (24mb l2 vs 14mb)
- numerous other architectural improvements over alder lake resulting in higher ipc
- greater efficiency and less heat, but also higher expected pl2 (253w vs 241w)

something would be very screwed up with raptor lakeâ€™s architecture if the 13700k did not beat the 12900k.",it should likely even match the 12900ks.,"if it does not, then intel has every right to be drummed mercilessly by the media, because raptor lake would be a literal technological downgrade!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"why would 13700k not be better than 12900k when it has more cache and better frequency numbers, and better memory controller?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so youâ€™re just going off of paper and not actual testingâ€¦got it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
clocks donâ€™t equate higher performance.,the cache is only 10mb larger for l2.,thatâ€™s it.,the memory bandwidth is higher by 12.8 gb/s but that doesnâ€™t necessarily mean better.,that is all directly from the ark spec pages for each.,the illogical thing is where this slots into benchmarks when right now the 12900k is competitive with the 7950 & 7900â€¦so if the 7700 out-performs the 13700 (according to leaks) how could it magically leapfrog the 12900 just because?,i get frequency increases but the only other 2 things i mentioned are very marginal improvements.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, but it would be like the 12600 performing worse than the 12400. it would make zero logical or technological sense.",itâ€™s not an all-new architecture or something with many unknowns.,"itâ€™s an enhancement of something existing, so paper specs should scale traditionally, where bigger number = faster.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

msi a pro doesn't have bios flashback and they would need to update bios before putting a 13 series cpu in there (or need a 12 series cpu of course) - unless the manufacturer ships with an updated bios which is very unlikely.,"edit: i was wrong, this mobo has a flash bios button.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i am going through the same issue.,i found that the gigabyte aorus b660 master and pro ddr4 do support 13th gen and have the option of bios q-flash plus where you can update the bios without a cpu on board.,below is the manufacturer's cpu support list for your info.,it should be noted though that on pcpartpicker the mobo does not show up as compatible with 13th gen which may be due to an error on their side as the below list confirms the opposite.,hope this helps.,"https://www.gigabyte.com/motherboard/b660-aorus-master-ddr4-rev-10/support#support-cpu

my other option was the gigabyte b660m aorus pro ax ddr4 since it was matx too and had the q-flash option which allows you to flash bios without the need of having an older cpu, i just found the process finnicky and risky, especially since i live in the caribbean and rma or return/replacement is pretty much not an option right now due to very high ridiculous fees/prices for shipping to the us.",also if you search online there are not too many reviews of the gigabyte b660m matx compared to the msi b660m mag mortar which is considered by some as the best matx b660 board.,i still haven't build my upgrade pc with the i5-13600k but should be able to around the 10th of december when i get my new 850w psu that i ordered today.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

did you get the game bundle with it if so can you please explain exactly what you get with it....intel page seems to make it sound like you get all 4 games where newegg page says it includes 1 game (cod) and the pick 3 software bundle.,intel says it includes the pick 3 software bundle and then lists 4 games (no pick x number at all) and they list the aversge retail value of the bundle as basically the cost of the games and 3 of the software.,so please if you can shine some light on this for me so i can decide if it's worth giving the arc card a shot based on the goodies thrown in alone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

csgo runs at half the average frame rate in comparison to a 3060. don't take random comments for granted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think you should do some research on how these work,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how do you know going through dx9 native implementation would be faster?,most graphics card developers had dx9 in life support mode for a very long time.,"same on linux when using dxvk often made dx9 games run faster than ""native"" on windows.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 3070 is on par with the 2080 ti.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"actually vr does have more constraints, it needs the lowest latencies you can give it and it needs the best high fps consistency it can get.",also there are tons of algorithms and techniques that are used to make the experience good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it seems to do well at 1440p, so i figured maybe it would do good on weird resolutions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

nope,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's mostly for aesthetic.,else it adds some rigidity for big cards.,"for the cooling, i removed mine on my 3080 for a test and the temp was the same under load.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"temperatures, a core will only boost to 5,3ghz under ideal circumstances.",you could try running a benchmark where the processor should do a quick burst of performance in the beginning.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i donâ€™t get the b660 chipset with such an expensive cpu.,"although some boards have decent vrmâ€™s, there are nowhere near as good as the best z690 ones.","also, 5.2ghz is still plenty fast.",the only issue you are experiencing is the psychological one of not having the fastest on the block.,you wonâ€™t be feeling the difference under any situation of going a little faster in games or in application.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your b660 is the culprit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you wonâ€™t get 5.4/5.5 unless tvb is enabled in the bios.,most bioses do not seem to enable this feature by default.,5.3 requires turbo boost max 3.0 and will only occur on the 2 favoured cores.,"again, support has to be enabled, and sometimes it doesnâ€™t work for some reason.",i suspect that 5.5 would only happen with tbm 3.0 and tvb combined?,not entirely sure there.,tvb is usually +1 or +2 (and i think 70c or below only) so you could only hit 5.5 if tvb is stacked onto the tbm 3.0â€™s 5.3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the boost speed is dependent on temperatures, if the cpu decides to boost at all.",it will keep on boosting as long as temperature permits.,"the choice of an 12900ks with a b660 motherboard is interesting, to say the least.","i would expect that such an expensive, high-end cpu would be used in conjunction with a very high-end board.","it would make sense to me, as the b660 chipsets come with some limitations such as for power draw.","fortunately the msi b660 tomahawk comes with decent vrm's, so it can handle quite a bit.",however b660 board don't allow you to take any kind of advantage from having an unlocked cpu.,"a z690 bios is geared towards performance, unlike the b660 ones.",a regular non-k cpu would have been a more logical choice here.,either that or a z690 board.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i bought a b660 in advance and then found brand new 12900ks for a reasonable price, 570$ for 12900ks vs 520$ 12900f is a nobrainer.","and it's not us prices, 570 is a freaking steal around here",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah obviously it wont go to 5.3ghz because that requires significantly more headroom than 2 celsius.,"in gaming, it just deems not worth it to go 5.3ghz.","again, it only boosts to 5.3ghz if its ideal.",try running a benchmark and see if it boosts to 5.3 and this might only happen for a split second.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"oh i see, i didn't know that.",i shall update you after i have reapplied the thermal paste!,:),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do i need to clean off the previous thermal paste or can i just add more?,it has only been a day since the old paste was applied,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
undid all my undervolt settings and reapplied the thermal paste and now its 83c max!,almost a 20 degree drop!,thank you so much for the reapplication advice :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just updated my bios and fixed my thermal paste.,"without undervolt settings, it maxes out at 83c on the cb23!!",now it's time to play around to see if i can get this power consumption down to 115w :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

whatâ€™s the paste youâ€™re using?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sounds about right.,the set in is interesting as cure time for significant thermal performance is pretty rare these days.,but it looks like a decent cooler.,we slapped on some 19.99 amazon special on my brothers and unlocked power limits and his has been happily chugging along since release.,if your board locks power it can be worth unlocking it as there can be times under heavy sustained games where it will go past normal turbo boost time and down clock a little.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the one that comes preapplied to the ak400 heatsink.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for some reason at first the highest i got with cb r23 was 9990 points multicore and 1387 single core.,"now the lowest multicore score i get is 10192â€¦ 
and single core always in the 1400s scaleâ€¦",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> the set in is interesting as cure time for significant thermal performance is pretty rare these days.,is it really rare?,i review coolers & have a policy of waiting 3 days before testing thermal performance because of this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe a background program?,9990 -10192 is pretty close and could easily be something running in the background or even windows updates doing funky stuff.,but that cooler helps a bunch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is literally a background program missing.,"unless you do bclk overclocking all you did was reduce some noise, nothing else.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea i have not seen many paste now a days where i notice much of a set in at all.,there could be some pump out from a heat cycle that makes the paste thinner.,but i have not seen many paste now a day that call for a cure time other then artic silver there may be some more obscure ones that still do though.,the hardest thing for testing is probably ambient control as if coolers are within 2c of each other and the room changed 1c that's margin of error.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're fine.,"not every task is multi-threaded, so not all cores will be used equally.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if i remember correctly the ring bus of the new intel cpus is gonna be higher by default.,for example the 12900k has a ring bus of 3.6ghz which goes to 4.6/4.7 with e-cores disabled.,"(anyone feel free to correct me)

new cpu's have a ring bus much higher by default without the need to disable e-cores and will have more cache which would should  help in performance and 0.1/1%.",i'd honestly get the 13700k for the better 1%/0.1% since im anal about frametimes but that's just me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
won't matter at all unless or until you have a 3090 or better is my thought.,"if you're getting or have a 4090, you should probably get raptor lake 13th gen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 13 series will be better.,the 4090 is showing some cpus are bottle necking the systems in 1080p and even 1440p.,"but depends on what monitor youâ€™re using, ram too because ddr5 is already showing improvements over ddr4",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's going to be better, but not enough that anyone should care.",most modern cpus are more than capable for most games imo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"entirely depends on what video card you have, what kind of games, and the resolution you play.","surly for 4k gaming, single-player ultra detail 1440p, is utterly useless upgrade your good cpu.","and tbh even for competitive online gaming, a 12700k is already huge in 99% of scenarios.","as a rule of thumb, the cpu has very little impact on gaming performance.","random people that comment below stuff like ""huge increase u must upgrade bro"" are just wannabe nerds without a clue.","finally, waiting a few days both for potential promos on alder lake or surprising increase in the performance of raptor, cannot hurt.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm fully expecting the 13600k to match the 12900k in most scenarios when it comes to gaming.,with the 13700k beating out the 12900ks across the board.,the 13600k will also have a lot of gaming performance to gain from oc.,"now if it means anything at all for the setup you are running, is another thing entirely.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m concerned about about max power consumption because i donâ€™t want to renew my new evga 550w knowing that many amd cpus are literally 100w less with same performance (just for gaming that iâ€™m focused on),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not going to be noticeable really in the real world.,but its nice to have better stuff so up to you :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for sure it will be a close call, especially in our everyday life and not taking into consideration games and other heavy stuff.","the question you should be asking is, how i am supposed to cool this thing, when it consumes 300 watts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you definitely wont need to upgrade to 13700k if you already have a 12700k.,the fps gains visually would most likely be pretty dissappointing.,"now it's not out yet, so maybe it's 50% better, but it's probably going to be more like 15-20% better, which in average would give you 30-50 fps more in games like overwatch.","maybe 10 more in graphic intensive games like the witcher, rdr2 etc.",just looking realisticly at how it will probably turn out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
see 12900k vs 12700k.,13700k should be tiny bit better than 12900k.,probably up to like 10% better in some games vs 12700k.,nothing game changing but it should be better.,"it should do better in 1% lows, that's the main advantage you should look at, no avg fps, that's probably very similar for anyone to care.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m going from my avx-512 12700k to a 13900kf.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
better imc will also help with frametimes (faster mem support).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
| for example the 12900k has a ring bus of 3.6ghz which goes to 4.6/4.7 with e-cores disabled.,"(anyone feel free to correct me)

they're supposed to, but on some motherboards you can disable that functionality (clockdown?)","and i've got some weird bug, that cache clock doesn't nudge from 4.4 ghz, despite having e cores enabled and in use.",it used to drop to 4 ghz (same as e cores) but now it doesn't.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

isnt the 13600k going to be alder lake chip ?,or was that the i3 raptor lakes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can set a tdp cap of 125w on a 12900k and retain like 99% of the gaming performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"on my aorus master z690 with a 12700k, hwinfo reports my ring bus hitting 4.6ghz with my e-cores enabled.",i can't change this behavior either.,"even if i disable e-cores in the bios, 4.6ghz is the max ring speed i can get even if i specify a higher multiplier.",i'm not complaining.,"from everything i've read about alder lake and the 12700k in general, i've got a much better than average cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

all the locked chips.,13600k is the lowest rpl sku that we know of.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
only on z boards(?),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah you are right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, the 12700k is a beast of a cpu.",only reason i'd go with 13700k is because it will probably use less power.,meaning you save money each month on electricity bills.,"if you just care about good performance and want to save some money, just go with the 12700k.",i promise you the difference in fps wont be noticeable at all.,only if you benchmark them.,you won't be able to see the difference with your own eyes.,which will dissappoint you.,this is pretty much always how it is with difference from generation to generation.,they really don't get that much better sadly.,"it's always better to wait for the next lineup (14th gen) or go with the cheaper, and still just as good alternative.",if you upgrade from 2nd gen then it won't matter what you pick.,"either one will feel equally as powerful for you, i guarantee.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's not hitting 4.6 all the time.,"if you tried to set it to 4.6 static in the bios, it will 100% fail",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i tried the aorus master z690 and despite its outstanding hardware quality build.,it was a buggy mess of a bios.,"i mean a manual overclock in windows all core static clock speed on ultimate performance power plan, cpu clock speed fluctuated and downclocked all the time even not under load.","&#x200b;

never happened on any asus boards i tried.","&#x200b;

"no, it is a supported feature that any board can support.",it is unlocking power limits and setting things like unlimited turbo that is more restricted.,but most boards will let you limit the powerdraw.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i watched only videos from buildzoid and scatterbencher about the aorus master when learning to overclock this motherboard.,"when i first got it (open box from newegg), it really seemed like it was defective since it wouldn't post.",i had to put a single stick of ram in slot 3 and wait about 5 minutes for it to train.,it was on one of the first bios releases.,"after i got the latest bios on it, i was able to match the ram overclock i saw in the buildzoid video and largely copy scatterbencher's 12900k overclock (had to make some 12700k specific changes to allow a 55x multiplier).",i get 2150 st/25500 mt in cb r23 and 880 st/10450 mt in cpu-z with my setup.,"i don't have any of the issues you had, so i can only conclude you got a bad board.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gigabytes bios have sucked for countless years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wouldn't surprise me, those failed bins has to go somewhere.",that does make for a weird situation though.,since rpl at the same frequency should be a few percent faster than adl.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"- that card is mini pcie, not m.2 like your motherboard might have.","they are different physical interfaces, and you would have to buy an adapter to make it work.","- that card is 802.11n, which is not particularly useful with todayâ€™s wifi networks.",certainly not if youâ€™re expecting any kind of decent speed.,- you are going to need an antenna to make it work.,it will not work without one.,i donâ€™t know where you would even buy a desktop compatible external antenna with that style of connector.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

idk whatâ€™s wrong with e-cores??,for prductivity theyâ€™re insane.,"for gaming, you dont need more than 6 p cores",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whatâ€™s a e core?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i agree.,make something with 8 p cores without the e-waste cores which cause compatibility nightmare and e-waste cores are useless for anything except for providing extra threads for fully parallelized and thread heavy productivity workloads.,but they stink overall and compatibility buginess with apps and scheduling.,"&#x200b;

how about a 8 p core only model with lots more l3 cache to easily match or even exceed amd's probable upcoming ryzen 7000 x3d models.",instead intel is even with 13900k well tuned is likely to get beat handily by the upcoming ryzen 7000 3d cache 8 core model in gaming workloads as all that l3 cache games love.,"&#x200b;

intel could put a serious hurt into amd by offering an 8 raptor cove p core model with 90-100mb l3 cache that would blow 5800x3d out of the water and even handily beat 7000 x3d given that regular alder lake 12700k and 12900k are on par with 5800x3d and better in everything else even with e-cores disabled as its a superior 8 good core part to zen 3.","&#x200b;

3570k didn't really do anything the 2500k didn't already do though.,i'd argue if any i5 deserves to be commemorated it would be the 2500k.,though the 2600k really was the gem of that generation.,even today with overclocking its still a perfectly capable rig for 60+ fps gaming in basically every game.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

honest question (iâ€™ve been a bit out of the loop) but how does the system decides which core to assign a task to?,itâ€™s os driven or cpu driven and transparent to the os?,say if a game starts and suddenly the tasks get assigned to e-core instead of p-core,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i think they are doing e-cores because they canâ€™t compete with amd with actual performance cores, such as like putting 12 or 16 in there, they only have 8 even on the 13900k.",so the e-core is just a marketing effort to up the number of cores in a small space.,"event ht, true, iâ€™ve turned that off/on many times over the years cause you know thatâ€™s a gimmick as well, cores run cooler and faster without it, but â€” i have send specs where ht makes overall processes run faster vs. off, and even e-cores seems in to increase overall performance.",iâ€™d prefer just fast non-ht high performance cores only.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"cpu driven while transparent to the os, yes.","w11 has a improved scheduler that targets either p-cores or e-cores depending on a task's priority on the os, while the cpu itself has a scheduler that deals with it(we don't really know how, intel never released details on it).","if a game starts, it's likely that it was coded as high priority, therefore aiming p-cores.",only tasks that target the os as low priority will run into the e-cores.,"that doesn't stop e-cores from working, but that will fully depend on how the os handles the app.",intel did make it clear that devs could optimize less important tasks such as audio mixing or shader decompression to e-cores if they want to.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"absolutely terrific text, well written, thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
skylake was the longest serving for a mainstream top-of-the line consumer desktop and laptop chip on the same 14nm manufacturing process since intel couldn't get their 10nm process entirely right until alder lake.,"it can also be argued the p6 was just as long serving as skylake since the pentium pro, pentium ii and pentium iii were all variants of the same p6 from 1995 to 2001 even though it was shrunk through several revisions with increases in clockspeed from 150mhz to 1.4ghz along the way.",some of intel's old x86 chips were kept in production for the embedded market for a much longer period of time too with the 386 being made from the mid-1980s until intel stopped producing them in the late 2000s.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s so good iâ€™m still on the original.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think the biggest problem with intel's skylake rehashes was not the fact they were stuck on 14nm, but the fact they made no improvements to skylake itself between releases.","their 14nm node did get density improvements though library optimizations, but they used that to increase the number and size of gates per transistor instead of reducing component size.","instead of backporting sunny cove in 2020 from 10nm to 14nm, they should have designed an improved skylake in 2016 when it was clear 10nm had severe delays.","they could have added avx-512 for free, as the structure already had space allocated in the layout in skylake.",along with instructions added to goldmont+/palm cove/sunny cove which wouldn't take much logic to implement.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
loved skylake and the variants that came after it.,"we are truly spoiled....

raptorlake launches soon featuring at minimum 20 threads on even lower end chips.",all of them have a row of 8 e cores now.,20 threads is now the standard.,from an i7 9700k with just 8 cores and 8 threads (ht disabled.),"released in late

ok rumor raptorlake sku still have some with 16t (4 e core variants) but still.",entire minimum thread count has been lifted.,excellent.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the best part about sky lake existing so long is the market stagnation it created.,i can still use laptops as old as 2015 and they don't miss a beat.,"(arguably this extends to sandy bridge and i still use an ivy bridge laptop regularly, but efficiency didn't take off until 5th/6th gen mobile)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"(author here) ppro, p ii, and p iii are clearly p6 variants, but there are changes between those generations that make them different architectures.","for example p ii had 16 kb l1i/l1d caches, versus 8 kb ones on ppro.","p ii also had mmx support and better 16bit performance, which was a big deal at the time because there was still a lot of 16-bit software.",imagine a current-gen cpu doing badly on 32-bit code.,p iii introduced sse and shuffled the execution units around.,"you can kind of compare sse back then to avx-512 today, because it provided an alternative to the x87 register stack that everyone just worked around, along with wider vector width.",and yeah there are a lot of old chips in service because they work well for specific purposes and you don't replace something that doesn't need to be.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">instead of backporting sunny cove in 2020 from 10nm to 14nm, they should have designed an improved skylake in 2016 when it was clear 10nm had severe delays.",rocket lake was so late it launched 7 months before alder lake.,i think if they'd taken the extra time to actually design something for 14nm it'd have shipped after alder lake went on sale.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don't be modest,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'd argue it stopped at sandy bridge, which got rid of p6's rob-based ooo execution scheme (renamed registers are basically result fields in the rob) in favor of separate physical register files and the rob holding pointers to those.","snb also massively changed the branch predictor, added a micro-op cache, and brought 256-bit avx execution.","it still has p6's unified scheduler and port numbering scheme, but i'd be comfortable calling it a different architecture just as i'd call bulldozer and zen different architectures.","there are some traits carried on, but most of how the core works is different enough.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's because they only started work on backporting rocket lake a little more than a year before launch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s a fair assessment.,itâ€™s still amazing to me how long lived parts of p6 are.,this is the arch intel tried to kill with p4 only for it to make a come back and live on for years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's incorrect.,"rocket lake was already on roadmaps being shared outside the company two years before launch:

https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-roadmap-10nm-14nm-gpu-cpu,39163.html

development cycles take years, so probably started roughly around the time of the coffee lake launch when it first became clear that cannonlake wasn't going to become a real product.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's arguably gone now.,"unified scheduler went away with skylake, and sunny cove/golden cove split the scheduler even more.","you can still see traces of the port numbering scheme, and ports are still shared between scalar integer and fp/vector, but that's about it.","also, parts of p4 still live on, like the physical register files and micro-op caching.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes.,in the next few years expect many forms of accelerators for example ai like phones have.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not really.,"some configurations are getting close, arm is there already for the low end.","but i donâ€™t think the high end and workstation/server will ever be, because it would be too expensive and take up too much space to produce eg your 10g network module or a usb controller in a 5nm process or the range of configurations that are necessary.","but then again, everything is going pcie, so once you get to raw pcie replacing displayport, hdmi, usb and networking, perhaps you could do a soc server with a pcie fabric interconnect.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not all modern cpus are the same.,amd/intel are socish.,"apple/qualcomm/mediatek have full blown socs

you can tell the difference by looking at the pcb for an x86 itx system vs apple's m1 mac studio.",there is a very interesting shift happening in the industry where the soc guys are taking over the cpu guys.,very similar to the previous jumps in integration levels.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

fwiw the definition of soc nowadays tends to be ""all the (functional) ips for the basic/discrete system architecture to be on the same die""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
worth pointing out that in the past the southbridge would have things like connections for storage and to connect nics and maybe sound but i can't really remember how they are actively connected to a system unless it's a pci-e soundcard.,today the chipset is basically used to extend functionality.,"every mainstream cpu around from intel, amd, arm will all have usb, some sata/m2 and some pci-e type connections from the cpu itself then you use a chipset to add more usb/pci-e slots/sata ports to increase the amount of devices you can attach to a single system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
isn't the memory controller on the dimms themselves now with ddr5?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

only those with graphics.... at least until the 7000 series  which have graphics but aren't called apus at all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
apu is amd's marketing attempt at telling people the gpu performance is significantly better than the competition.,it was relatively successful but it wasn't necessarily because it was an soc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
actually no.,historically socs do not integrate dram on the chip since dram is made on different process nodes than logic.,"recently with advanced packaging it's becoming possible to put dram on the same package (if not chip), so that's starting to change but definitely not required (or even that common).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they don't have on board ram, it's just usually soldered to the mainboard of the device.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"intel g, p and u series for laptops have the pch and cpu dies on the same substrate, but they lack ram.",laptops with these cpus don't have a separate chipset on the motherboard...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they don't require chipsets.,"amd and intel cpus all offer native usb, pci-e/sata connections from the cpu itself, the chipset is used to add additional pci-e, usb and other ports to increase the amount of devices you can attach.",they haven't required a chipset in a long time now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
southbridge is just another pci-e attached device offering extra connectivity.,amd in mobile dies have everything to work without it and they are used like that in sff systems.,their desktop dies too but they are system-in-package these days.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

its the same every new ddr generation, high end previous gen beats new gen every time, and my 2x16 4400 kit was â£180.","i did the same between ddr2 and 3. bought some 1200 low latency ddr2 at the time, and when i did upgrade to ddr3 it still sold for more than i paid.","my ddr32 elipda modules never sold because they were only 2 gb modules when everything else at the time was 4gb+, the point with them was 1866 whatever tight latencies they ran in triple channel on x58, on dual channel they could do up to 2400 at much tighter latencies than ddr4 2133-2666 while 4 gb modules were still crap for frequency and timings.","i could easily flip the current ballistix max kit on ebay for at least â£250 because it isnt being made anymore, but ddr5 is a downgrade.","ddr5 isnt worth it until probably 6000cl26, and thats still higher latency than my current stuff, just maybe the bandwith will matter more once the latency is improved by that much.","6000+ 32cl is currently priced at around â£350, its simply not worth losing performance for that much money, nor spending it if it did give a tiny uplift.","same with when my current kit originally cost â£350, i wanted it but not at that price.",i kept an eye on the price regularly and bought it when it was slashed after ddr5 released.,"also igorlab reviewed ddr4 5333 cl20, it gets beaten by a few fps by 4800cl18.",so i'm hoping for either 4800cl16 or 5000+ cl18 on the new board.,ddr5 can't touch it.,3733c14 gear 1 is about the same as 4266cl16 gear 2 from what limited information i can find.,"as most tech review channels said, gear 1 is better than gear 2 'at the same frequencies', but everyone misses the part in quotes.","also all 5333cl20 ram is only 2x8 gb, the 2x16 ballistix max were rated for up to 5100 initially, but they stopped selling them higher than 4400 as users couldn't reach that on any platform at the time.","one thing i find odd is that the 2x16 4400 ballistix max sold out everywhere when it was reduced to â£180, but no one else that bought it writes anything online.","only 4400+ 2x16 kit i managed to find now is a 4800 samsung one, and it costs â£250+ which isn't worth it.",any 2x16 4400+ kit for under â£200 was a steal when those prices happened.,"by the time ddr5 is worth it, i will likely want 2x32 anyway.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

for starters have back fan exhaust hot air from your case.,make sure your cpu cooler is fully seated (all the tabs have clicked and popped thru the motherboard).,also as mentioned remove your side panel and check your temps.,should be able to run a stock cooler and game and not pass 80c on the cpu unless something is wrong.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's not overheating.,it will throttle when it reaches high enough and shut down when it overheats.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is your room temperature?,what case?,remove the side panel and see if that changes things (which would show bad case air flow).,you do not want all fans blowing into the case.,have front fan blow in and rear fans blow out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you peeled the plastic off the cooler right?,not sure if the stock cooler has it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
reseat heatsinkfan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i honestly think its the stock coolers performance.,i use a 12400 and a 240mm aio.,my idle temps are 30â°c and max i gess 60â°c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same here.,the 11400 is just plain hot.,"powerful, but hot.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is it possible some of the stock coolers clips are not down fully?,those intel stock coolers can be atrocious sometimes for mounting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"11th gen was fairly power hungry (especially if you unlocked the power limits, or your motherboard did it for you).",it doesn't help that you have no fans exhausting air and also (very likely) have a gpu that's likely just heating up the air in the case further.,"if i were you i'd take one of the fans from the front and put it up top as an exhaust fan and change the fan on the back to exhaust as well, or you could have it exhaust from the front and intake from the back/top so your cpu is less likely to reuse the air the gpu heated up.","alternatively, if it hasn't been long since you bought the cpu and motherboard, return them and get either a 5600(x) and am4 motherboard or 12400(f) and lga1700 motherboard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just to reiterate what others have said:

- change rear fan to exhaust.","general rules for pc cooling are: more intakes than exhausts, and front/bottom intake and rear/top exhaust.","- 45 idle is pretty hot, but the stock cooler is wimpy.",- definitely ensure the cooler is well-seated and locked into place.,- your pc should not reboot during use.,"either it is severely overheating, or you have memory/cpu instability
- if the overheating continues, i would look into replacing the cooler with something better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
according to his post it seems his pc does reboot for him.,i'm guessing he either has a cooler pin not seated or some other issue,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the performance difference will mostly be e-cores though.,"if you aren't maxing what you already have, probably smarter to invest in a cpu with more p cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is it really that insane?,it seems in mine with what a 12900ks would score with 8 extra e-cores and some added p-core frequency,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"honestly not many people talk about how much rnd went into intels ihs design to make it fantastic

the chips are actually really good at dissipating heat

amd's ~~5950x~~ runs so hot (95c) because it is completely ass at dissipating heat, delidding drops it to like 70c at full tilt, which is a massive improvement in temps

intel owns their manufacturing.,amd needs to outsource it to a company like tsmc which currently has the best manufacturing.,since tsmc wants to make money and knows they are the best they can price gouge because amd has no one else to go to and there's a huge line of companies behind that want to use tsmc.,to price their chips amd probably just took the cost of manufacturing and added their regular margin on top.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you mean 7950x.,"if i delided a 5950x or 3950x, that was also pushed to the same 230w or so, i'd probably also see a 15-20c drop in temperature on that, compared to the 20c we've seen so far.","densely packed, small dies, with a lot of power per areas gain a lot from a delid vs low power, or large dies.","a 7950x that's power limited to like 140w (like older skus) in both scenarios, would likely only see a 8-10c gain at most, which is almost average.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they're not doing anything special with the ihs though.,"intel is just still using a massive monolithic die and amd is on multiple tiny dies, that heat density and surface area is the difference.",intel will face the same issues when they start gluing smaller node dies together as well.,my 5800x would run just as hot if i feed it the same power despite the thinner ihs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
eh.,you can't really mess up a slab of copper.,"the issue is heat *density*, and that's just unavoidable if you're cramming all your compute onto a tiny little die, then cranking power through the roof.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
imagine how they fucked up with ihs..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"unlike previous zen generation, it's designed to run that hot.",it leverages temperature to push more voltage and frequency.,up to a certain point ofc.,"that's why it runs 95c on a cheap aircooler, top of the line air cooler, aio, and custom loops.",what changes with better cooling is more frequency and performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

linus keeps saying they arenâ€™t just some shitty cores called e cores but are more comparable to a 7th or 8th gen core!!,which is just crazyâ€¦.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>people are surprised how much performance those e-cores actually add in a mt scenario perhaps?,"yeah, 16x gracemont 4m l2 should have around the mt performance of a 10900k.",8+4 or even 8+8 is a weird configuration for demonstrating the the mt/area advantage of smaller cores because most of the mt performance is coming from the big cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there's actually a lot of variables to consider.,the ihs thickness matters.,the solder joint thickness matters.,the die thickness matters.,remember how the 9900k didn't improve much over the 8700k despite being soldered?,because the 9900k had a thicker die to allow for soldering.,"then with the 10900k they made the die thinner and still allowed for soldering again, which dropped temps.",">my 5800x would run just as hot if i feed it the same power despite the thinner ihs

thermal barriers always matters.",a delidded 5800x runs cooler at the same wattage than with the ihs.,"go take a look at der8auer's delid video of the 7000s series, and the insane drop in temps he got.",watch that video and tell me again that thermal barriers doesn't matter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

temp doesnâ€™t limit anything they can choose any arbitrary number based on layout and material properties.,watts in via electricity and watts out via heat transfer is the limiting factor.,"if a processor is kept at steady state temp of 95â°c with 50w in and 50w out, and clocks are raised until 300w in and fan speed increased until 300w out then thatâ€™s an obvious example of how temp doesnâ€™t limit anything.",the only thing that changes is the amount of power consumed and then sent into your room as heat.,source: thermodynamics and heat transfer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

have had one sitting on my test bench for the past week.,intel haven't able to provide a driver that actually works with the onboard arc a770m gpu.,intel's engineering team is meant to be getting back to me early next week with what to do next.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,it's $1699 before tax and the cpu/gpu are equal to about a 12400/3060m.,you can build a whole better sff system way more powerful for less.,this is e-waste.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is my anecdote: i replaced a 240 aio on my 7600k with a u12a and temps dropped by 10c and noise levels also dropped dramatically.,"nowhere near the same power draw as a 12700k, but this is consistent with most reviews that say it is slightly better than a 240 aio when noise normalized.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"hi newbie here

when i buy a ddr4 ram the only maximum speed my ram that my cpu can support is only 3200mhz??",i can't like overclock it up to 4000mhz or above?,"just a 3200mhz limit..

lets say z690 tomahawk and i5-13600k and ddr4 kingston renegade 3600mhz can i like overclock it to 4400mhz or above or it's impossible since cpu only supports 3200mhz?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"can go higher

i overclocked my corsair vengeance lpx ddr4 3200mhz c16-16-16-36 2x8gb to stable 3500mhz",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's the official specification.,it can run the xmp speeds very likely.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the maximum memory frequency will be limited by your motherboard, but ddr4-5000 should be possible with the right dimms on an msi pro z690-a ddr4 in gear 2, as that's about the limit for 12th gen...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"those numbers are jedec (standard, guaranteed to work).","you'll be hard pressed to find a *jedec* 3200 mt/s kit, though.","most 3000+ ddr4 kits are xmp, and xmp is technically overclocking, so it'll go above 3200 easily as long as xmp works (which isn't guaranteed, but works most of the time anyway).","that is, unless, xmp is locked to 3200 too, like it's on h610 mobos.","but if you get a 3600 mt/s xmp kit, then overclocking it to 4400 is probably a bad idea unless you really know what you're doing.",overclocking ram is *hard* and requires tons of stability testing because even occasional micro-errors can wreck your system gradually over time.,"so the safest bet is, unless you want to run at jedec speeds (which are usually around 2133 mt/s or something), is to simply enable xmp and let it do its thing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with cpu's you get the speed on the box kind of as-is.,"with memory, the manufactures actually advertise it as the highest overclock speed they are very confident you can get.","further, they build the info for oc'ing it into the chip itself in a xmp setup that your mb can read to do a super-easy oc from just telling the mb to look for the xmp setup.","all the timings and speed will just pop-in and it should work ok as that is what they tested at the factory, despite it being technically an oc.","you may or may not get to oc it to all kinds of other timings, voltages or speeds, but what is on the box is usually an xmp tested, built in oc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the shown speeds are what intel basically guarantees as compatible and is generally ideal.,any benchmarks intel produces are usually done at these speeds.,but you can go higher.,"you will not actually want to try for 4400, as while it should be doable in gear 2, there's basically zero chance you can do it in gear 1, which is desirable for performance.","for ddr4 and a k cpu, you're probably going to want to more try in the 3600-4000 range.","and 4000 will very likely require manual tweaking to be stable, which i'm not sure is what you're looking to do.","overclocking memory beyond a certain point does not significantly improve the performance of intel cpus, so unless you're overclocking for fun or benchmarks, you might just be best to go for a low latency 3200 or 3600 kit, enable xmp, and call it a day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"12th gen igpus have been listed on intel's website as compatible hardware for arc drivers ever since the first driver, and as of last month, 11th gen igpus have been added to that list.","i gave the arc driver a try, and it upgraded correctly, and everything still functioned as expected.","xe and arc share the same architecture and stacks, and a few months ago, intel split off pre-xe driver development into its own thing, so i think intel is onto something here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ok, thanks for the info.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no.,"because:

- a770 is the full large dg2 die

intel usually reserves i9 to mean xtreme editions or the highest end possible gear.,in other words overclocking.,"but from what i understand, their current offering does decently well in dx12 titles at really an affordable price point for most users.",these gpus aren't yet positioned as a premium product and i think that is the point.,they just want to get these into the hands of gamers or mainly kids.,limiting their good performance to dx 12 titles and decent performance for dx 11 means that their target audience should be young kids getting into minecraft (dx 12 ray tracing) and other newer games.,"for reference, traditional intel positioned the i7 as their flagship cpu for 6 generations of core series cpus.",it was during skylake 7th gen that intel first introduced the i9 series of cpus.,so we maybe waiting a while for them to intro this in their new product line today.,i think a simple product stack with good/developing software stack is the way to go and road to quality for intel graphics.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not happening and they need to really dive into their drivers.,"they are years away from driver competitiveness, let alone acing the silicon competition.",they should keep going but they are still early days.,probably be a couple of generations before they get a decent x080 competitor to halo their product line,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" the"" *90"" name is being reserved for when something competitive in contemporary high end graphics is being produced.","right now, nothing fits that criteria.","to do so prematurely would tarnish the *90 name, intel's image and damage sales for when there is a high end intel card worthy of the name.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

battlemage should have cards comparable with 4070ti or may be 4080 as well.,celestial is where intel is supposed to compete against even best nvidia card.,but that is all speculation until we get details about battlemage may be during next intel on event in may 2023.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
perhaps a b990?,ðÿ¤¯,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that was different xe hp and was on intel process.,intel seems to have given up on that one.,"they do have two tiles on the xe hpc gpu though, and think that one was built to support up to four.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
multi core package for gaming and for basically any other parallel workload are completely different things.,"non gaming workloads don't suffer from microstutter because the end user can't tell if some workload was smooth, you're just looking for the last result in most cases, or very low frame rate 3d rendering inside maya or whatever else.",only in gaming is a perfectly balanced workload and microstutter a problem.,two full normal gpus on one package doesn't solve any of those issues for gaming but it's absolutely fine for any other workload.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
isn't that the whole point of binning?,you pay for what the silicon is capable of.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if it's the top end of performance, sure.",this segment would make absolutely no sense though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because from what i've seen its somewhere between the 3060 and 3060 ti.,"it's beaten by the 6600 xt, but if ray tracing is involved it beats the 6700.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"battlemage will start from b so will have b300, b500 and b700",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
getting down voted for making a typo with a single letter?,what?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so far, i donâ€™t get what the second digit is supposed to represent.","like, why is there an a380 and a580 (coming), but only an a770?","with its hardware differences, why wasnâ€™t the a770 le just called an a780, considering the a750 and a750 le are hardware identical?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in vulkan and dx12, everything else it falls flat on it's face not to mention mandatory rebar and lousy perf/watt.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they are saying, it only 'beats' a rtx 3060 if it actually provides a good experience at the supposed frame rate, if it's crashing or has constant visual glitches so much worse iq, then it's not really beating it.","when it can provide a stable baseline performance with acceptable iq and it's providing >3060 performance then it beats a 3060. when they crash a lot and games have major visual bugs, it's just a bad card regardless of frame rate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes i've heard that a million times - its between the 3060 and 3060 ti...

the issue is, there is a big asterisk next to that statement that says dx12 only.",i'm not a nvidia fanboy and i'd love to see intel stick it up to those greedy fucks but the arc is just an unfinished product right now.,"i've seen some intel fanboys argue that most games that are releasing today and in the future will be dx12 so its fine, but that argument makes no sense, why should i be limited in the games i can play after spending my money :(",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"man, why does amd suck at ray tracing so much?",(ik why but /j),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thats highly depends on games tested, so far arc are all over the place.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh i'm looking forward to graphics cards sharing names with motherboard costs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so third gen will be c300?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel changed the name of a780 at the last minute just to make mlid mad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just don't buy this card if you're on a cpu without rebar.,otherwise it's not an issue,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
be prepared to endure a wave of downvotes by bots,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's never going to be finished.,"unless you can get a time machine to get day 1 duvets for every game that's ever existed intel are never going to have a ""finished product"" in your eyes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the cynic in me says that nvidia only does these things as a side effect of their datacentre processing endeavours (like dlss coming from their ml hardware), intel wants a slice of that pie because traditionally that used to be big multicore cpu work and they've been losing business to nvidia, and amd are constantly catching up because they've long since given up on their products being anything other than mid range toys for gamers.","that's not only why xess exists, it's the only reason arc exists at all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
however if this stays it can be one of the most sensible naiming conventions for gpus yet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just like amds cpus sharing names with gpus?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"c300, c500, and c700 (if not a c900 by then).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and that is entirely their fault.,why would i spend 350$~ and then not be able to play pretty much three quarters of my entire game library...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they've got 25 years of product here (if they're sensible they'll skip o) which is way longer than amd or nvidia have ever suck to a convention.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
next build: 7950x with 7950xt on a x770,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is possible for more than one thing to be bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
of all the things to blame intel for not having a time machine reveals you as an absolute lunatic.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"heh, i was actually planning to name my configurations for my hobbyist pc business in a similar way - for example, an a660x would be a first-generation configuration, with an i5-12600k or ryzen 5 7600x, and with an rtx 3060 ti or rx 6700 xt.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how does it become my problem that they weren't able to develop their products in time?,"there might be people whose entire library consists of dx12 games and for those people arc might be fine, i am not one of those people, i frequently revisit older titles.",i do not pluck free money from trees in my backyard.,"when i'm buying stuff, i'm spending my own fucking hard earned money so i damn well expect it to work according to my situations.","if you are still hurt about it, cry me a fucking river.","damn, this is straight up braindead level of fanboyism.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's honestly confusing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in a laptop, increasing the power to the chip is useless if the cooling system isn't big enough because the cpu will throttle back speeds when the heat isn't getting removed fast enough.",buy a bigger and thicker laptop if 6 watts is what breaks your work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"looking at the official power specs of a laptop cpu is literally meaningless, as almost nobody follows those.",every cpu is customized by the manufacturer to the cooling situation of their device.,just because intel says the 1230u is 9/29 and the 1235u is 15/55 is no way ensures thatâ€™s what your getting.,it could be higher.,it could be lower.,you might be able to change it with a program like throttlestop.,you might not.,it all depends on the model.,read reviews.,find other people with it.,then cross your fingers and hope for the best.,"for example, my oldish thinkpad x1 has an 8650u cpu in it.",official power rating is 15-25 watts.,but the cpu came configured to 23/29 watts.,and the supposed default setting for that cpu (which was not enabled) was 25/44 watts.,so you can see that the official rating was useless information.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah thats not how it works.,"tdp is thermal design power, its how much heat the cpu can put out.",the 1235u has some extra gubbins.,the main cpu is the same.,"https://www.intel.com.au/content/www/au/en/products/compare.html?productids=226266,226453

the 1230u would use less power, so potentially have better battery life",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"maybe, but do realize it's not 6 watts im worried about, its the 30% performance difference.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">tdp is thermal design power, its how much heat the cpu can put out.",tdp in intel's terminology is the same as power limit 1. meaning it is the maximum average heat output over some averaging period.,all the power turns to heat so input power and output heat are literally the same thing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ik how it works, but it is possible to increase tdp on some chips, idk if you read my question.",i asked how to increase the tdp from 9 tp 15 for more performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"tdp can be increased on desktop chips to boost performance, but usually is locked on laptops to roughly whatever the cooling can handle.",might be worth checking google for that laptop specifically in case ms decided not to for whatever reason.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are not understanding what you are even asking for.,"more heat is not more performance

as i said, the cpu is the same.",the extra heat is from the other stuff on the chip.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i asked a simple question.,"the dell 9315 is set to 9 watts, does anyone know how to increase it?","in some cases it does increase performance to lift the tdp cap higher, there are tons of youtube videos proving this.","[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iosxmezhc2o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iosxmezhc2o)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1-yqrzj-ea",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"use throttle stop to increase the power limit 
works on 95% of modern intel laptops unless the oem has specific disabled changing power limits",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s safe to assume every z690 board will need an oob bios update to support the 13th gen cpus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
**are 600 series boards compatible with 13th gen?,"**
- yes.","as far as iâ€™m aware, all manufacturers have announced full line compatibility.","however, do remember that while compatible, not all boards are ideally suited for all cpus due to power requirements, so you would not want to install a high-power 13900k in a h610 board, even if it is technically possible.",**will z690/h670/b660/h610 boards need their bios updated to support 13th gen?,"**
- probably.","new production from about july 2022 onwards should have compatible bioses pre-installed, but there is no way to guarantee production dates or installed bios versions when you buy a board.","even if you get to see the box, most boards donâ€™t say anywhere whatâ€™s installed.",**so how do i update the bios?,"**
- there are two ways:
1) buy a motherboard that has bios flashback.","this allows you to upgrade the bios with only the motherboard, a power supply, and a usb stick.",no cpu or ram required.,asus and as rock call this â€œbios flashbackâ€.,gigabyte calls this â€œq flash plusâ€ (not to be confused with plain q flash).,msi just calls it â€œflash bios buttonâ€.,evga calls it â€œspi flashing via usbâ€.,2) you will otherwise need to have a 12th gen cpu available to install in the system in order to upgrade the bios.,"if you plan on buying a 600-series board for use with 13th gen that does not have bios flashback, and you do not have access to a 12th gen cpu, i would try to buy from a store or retailer who will do the upgrade for you, or guarantee a compatible board.",**what boards have bios flashback?,"**
- mostly higher end ones, but it varies by manufacturer.","not all z690 boards have it (for example, asus does not support it on tuf or prime z690 models).","even fewer b660 boards have it (for example, no msi b660 boards have it, however it seems that most gigabyte b660 do).",- you will need to verify for each model whether the feature is available.,"typically, a motherboard supporting this feature will have a small button on the rear i/o panel for this purpose.","no button, likely no bios flashback.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
chances are it will require a bios flash.,with modern uefi bios this is not nearly as scary as it used to be.,there are some great videos on youtube to assist you with the general idea of what you will need and have to do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yup, look for boards that support bios flashback.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://videocardz.com/press-release/asus-announces-z690-motherboard-support-for-intel-13th-gen-core-raptor-lake-cpus     tuf and prime z690 will support 13th gen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, but not until you update to a 13th gen-compatible bios (160x or later, around july 2022), and as those models lack bios flashback, you need a cpu installed that older bioses support just to do the flashingâ€¦ and that sadly means using a 12th gen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seems like the driver team has a lot of work cut out for them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's very strange that basic functions don't work properly when intel has already been making igpu drivers since forever.,"they must have experience, unless it's a completely new team doing this card.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's selling like old i740 cheap and you could play any game at 640x480 60fps just optimize drivers in next 1-12 months and we have winner.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah but so far seems promising, pretty good mid range gpu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hopefully they are able to sift the reports from the cards they just sold and start optimizing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i imagine that with igpu's, people aren't benchmarking them or expecting crazy performance per dollar from them.","i believe their driver issues happen across all their graphics products because my i5 1135g7 won't open some games, and generally just acts really weird.","after looking at some arc videos, they act similarly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's a good cpu in terms of ipc uplift over 10400 and slots in nicely between that and 12400.

avx512 makes it an emulation monster.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've had mine for a bit longer then a year and combined with my rtx 3060 it's a great combo.,haven't had any problems with it for gaming(i came from using an i7 4790),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, something like a deepcool ak620 or a noctua nhd15 would do.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no not really.,i would only *consider* water-cooling if you are pushing crazy clocks or doing so on an i9.,"a good fan cooler will do fine, if not better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very nice.,"me and my friend wanted one, he wanted an arc a770 and contribute to driver development on linux.","sad ðÿ˜¢

seems they are selling well enough.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is this equivalent to?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"great man, enjoy your new card.","it's easy for me to tell others to be early adopters when it's not my money being spent, but someone needs to do the dirty work of buying new technology products, so the manufacturer can get user feeeback under real conditions and improve them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"intel doesn''t need millions of sales, they need like 20 k of them, to have users reporting issues to them, that knowledge will help to fix their driver and gpu microcode issues.",350 dollars for a gpu that have the potential to beat an nvidia 3070 with 16 gb en vram is not a bad deal.,"yeah right now drivers sucks, same happen with nvidia dlss 1.0",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

still not available in europe :(,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you get the game bundle with it and if so can you confirm what exactly it is you get with one of these cards?,"it's really confusing and hasn't been spelled out clearly anywhere news articles mention 4 free games and a ""pick 3"" software selection the intel promo terms and conditions seem to indicate the same but also mention having a qualifying 12th gen intel cpu and then newegg lists the cards as coming with a ""1 game + pick 3 software bundle"" with the one game being cod and no mention of any of the others.",so again if you can please shed some light on this for me.... i would truly appreciate it!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i also wanted to get one.,many such cases!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
stuff like this always sells out with the enthusiast crowd at launch.,the real test will be weeks and months from now to see if it can have sustained sales.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

sure feels like it at least.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""vat vs. sales tax  
a vat system is often confused with a national sales tax.",but a sales tax is only collected onceâ€”at the final point of purchase by a consumer.,"so, only the retail customer ever pays it.",the vat system is invoice-based and is collected at multiple points during the production of a finished product.,"each time value is added, a sale is made and a tax is collected and remitted to the government.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"simple answer:
there is no federal sales tax, there is only state sales tax and county sales tax.","state sales tax is ranges from 4-10% 

county sales tax tends to range between 1-3%, but usually is capped to a certain maximum (in florida county sales tax can only charge on the first $5000)

groceries are not taxes for â€œbasicsâ€ like water, eggs, milk, bread, flour, butter, produce, meats, etc.",during back to school season there is usually a week where there is no tax on clothing or school supplies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"because there are roughly 12,000 different jurisdictions within the us that have varied sales tax and due to outdated laws retailers are not required (never do) show prices after tax.","for example, i live about a half mile outside of a city.","inside the city limits, sales tax is 8.75% outside it's 7.5%.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"sales tax is even worse due to local taxes, rate is different city to city in the same state.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"other places have consistent taxes, so we know how much it is.","australia is somewhat weird in this sense, as we have 10% gst, but it doesn't apply to everything.","but you at least know its either 10% or 0%, and the receipt tells you which items were exempt.",(its mostly basic foods and medicines),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thatâ€™s a bit misleading in that how vat system works, it actually only ends up paid once.",all the value added is collected at the end of the chain.,technically they collect the tax from the value added at each step but in practice this means the full rate is collected only at the end.,so if the vat rate is 20% the total value added is the final price of the product and the 20% is paid from the full value by whoever is the end user (or technically the final seller but he moves the tax to the price).,if they actually collected the vat rate at every step of the chain the final sale should only collect taxes for the profit margin of the shop because thatâ€™s the value added by the shop.,this means in practice that most business to business sales do not collect vat in the price.,or if they in some cases have to the buyer can deduct that from the vat they have to pay for their sales.,edit: this is darn difficult to explain because the one who pays the tax is not the one who actually pays the tax.,and that sentence didnâ€™t make it any clearer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

talking about taxes in the us is actually fairly complex.,the us constitution talks about direct and indirect taxation.,indirect would be something like a tariff or taxing interstate trade.,"trade barriers to the us, for most countries, are virtually non existent.","average tariffs here are like very low single digit %, enough to run the administration of import/exports basically.","direct taxation, like a sales tax, can only be done in a way that is proportional based on population of states.","that's almost impossible to do for various reasons, and in fact the intention was that no direct taxation occur unless there was a war or some other national emergency.","as explanation of direct :

""in paying for a national emergency, the government would total the amount of revenue required and then divide it among the states according to the population of each state.","the state legislatures would then decide how best to raise the revenue in their state.""","so even in a direct taxation model, it's not a sales tax.",people - states and congress with the support of the public - actually voted about 100 years ago (1909)  \*for\* income tax in an constitutional amendment.,"that (income tax) was sold to people under the banner of ""soak the rich"" - no that's not a new slogan, it is over 100 years old.","state, county, and city governments are under no such restrictions and use sales / property tax for their revenue.",they can also tax income.,it varies from one state to the next.,people can and do choose where to work / live and retire based on this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"each state has higher or lower (or no) sales tax, property tax, or income tax as well as many different county, city, or metro area taxes which are each assessed at different points (point of sale, point of use, annual billing, included with housing payment, etc.).",some product types (e.g.,food that you prepare at home and medicine) are exempt in certain tax districts.,"in theory, if you live in an area that has a tax, you are supposed to report your purchase and pay the tax if you buy somewhere else without the tax.",lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for sales tax at point of sale by the retailer who then pays collected tax on sales to the state/local authority.,usually quarterly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the difference is whether the price tag and product line on the receipt shows the untaxed and actual price of the product.,"if there is no untaxed subtotal and a separate tax line, the tax is hidden.","its psychological and governments can change the amount of tax without the consumer seeing it directly, tax hikes can be hidden within the daily price fluctuations on most products.",an example.,"in the usa there are federal and state gasoline taxes.......i can guarantee 99% of the public has no clue what the rates are and i'd bet more than 50% have no idea both taxes exist, know how much the tax is or know the last time the tax rate was changed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> technically they collect the tax from the value added at each step but in practice this means the full rate is collected only at the end.,the gst in canada is collected the same way; businesses in the intermediate part of the chain can apply to have the gst rebated back every quarter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, like i said ""due to outdated laws"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in the eu, tax is always clearly marked on your receipt, during the checkout process for online orders, and sometimes on the product pages as well.",the only difference is that you're not tricked into thinking you're spending 10-20% less than you actually are.,having prices that don't reflect what you're actually paying for the product is plain silly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so your saying in the eu, your not tricked into bending over and grabbing your ankles for the government....hmmmm interesting custom",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for what its worth, while disclosing sales tax on the tag in the us would be nice and good for transparency, in general 10-20% is a pretty big overstatement.","a quick google indicates california is the largest at 7.25%, with counties and/or cities sometimes adding 1-3% on top of that.","anecdotally, about 6-8.5% feels like what i normally experience when iâ€™m in a state with sales tax.",another reason it gets complicated in the us would be online sales.,"you canâ€™t just add sales tax to the listed price since you donâ€™t know where the product is going - if it ships to a state with sales tax, they canâ€™t usually know the amount until they have the final shipping address.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm saying you should just admit you had no idea how it works over there and move on, instead of doubling down and moving on to expressing the other reasons you dislike the eu which are completely irrelevant to this discussion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"fair enough, although

>another reason it gets complicated in the us would be online sales

would simply require websites to use the last stored address (as amazon already does for example, although they won't display the tax until checkout), or even simple ip based location detection is precise enough for that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i made a lighthearted joke earlier about how ryan shrout was probably just personally driving a rental car to each store and dropping a few cards off, but the reality seems like it's pretty similar.","sounds like they just sent a small bulk pack to a few locations, and i'm guessing they were also outside of the normal freight schedule (direct ship) so their receiving department didn't have a real heads up unless they were paying close attention to inbound manifests.",it does happen.,hopefully subsequent restocks will be smoother.,:p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it outperforms the 3060 which is selling for 400+ dollars",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">*but but but arc is dead canceled* 
some trashtuber 


>*completely selling out isnâ€™t proof that it is doing well*
trashtuberâ€™s brain dead fanboys.",meanwhile with mining actually dead the hottest item in the pc space happens to be reasonably priced intel arc gpus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not yet available in eu anywhere,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got a hold of the a750 not long before it sold out.,wanted the a770 though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's available on backorder now, and it's working this time https://www.newegg.com/intel-21p01j00ba/p/n82e16814883001",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
definitely not ceremonial.,"it's just that it was an early morning launch, and the early birds snatched the first stock.",i was one of those early birds.,i think it was like 30 mins to an hour after us stock started showing up when i woke up just before 7am cst and bought mine.,"at the time, all versions of each card were in stock.","they ran out of stock at about 8, and then subsequent restocks happened throughout the day.",this was a much better experience with the 30 series stock as i was actually able to keep the newegg tab open and look at other websites before purchasing off newegg.,"to clarify, i got an a750 le.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wasn't able to get one.,i feel like they must have made 100 for the entire united states.,"because i can't see these being that popular compared to amd/nvidia, which have tons of stock.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got an a750 and it shipped last night.,be here monday.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i stayed up to get one, didnâ€™t even show up in the search index.",had to get a link from this community.,by the time i got my credit card out it was gone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yep, you got lucky!",that a770 went *quick*.,"the a750 bounced in and out of stock for a while, but when the other card went, it never came back (so far).",oof.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
got mine at microcenter before the a7xx launch - knew it get attention from this launch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"but, it's not really for most gamers.","falls short from amd, especially especially in pre-dx12/vulcan games.","it's mostly early adopters, nothing like the 30 series drop imo.","with that said, i'm actively refreshing pages trying to get an a770 le.",we're just not most gamers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yup, i stayed up until 4 am trying to find one and then overslept so i missed the 10 seconds they were available.",they really should have said when and where ahead of time.,this was a frustrating launch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ai folks are interested in this card due to its fp64 capabilities.,"unlike nvidia, intel didnâ€™t kneecap fp64.",seriously look up fp64 specs on 4090 vs a770.,$329 card smokes the $1600 one.,a pair of these makes for a top of the line ml rig.,"last card released by nvidia with good fp64 was the titan v, which still sells for insane prices, used.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there still seems to be a lot of ""not most gamers"" that are willing to tinker with these things, so that's great.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i kind of understand why intel has been seemingly so ""secretive"" about it because what they need are the cards in the hands of users.","if they said ""they'll be available here, here, and here, at this time,"" that gives someone the opportunity to customize a bot to buy a bunch of them, and that means the cards are sitting around collecting dust while a scalper tries to unload them instead of generating good data intel can use to improve the drivers.","obviously, i wish the launch went better and there were more cards available for resale...but i don't think i'd have gotten one if intel did this any other way.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the people who look at gpus from a gaming centric only perspective are teenagers that donâ€™t really understand what most computers are primarily used for.,"hint, it isnâ€™t actually playing games.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nvm.,just used ddu to purge 3490 and downgraded back to 3430. now no issues.,will have to block updates.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no best buy (or amazon either surprisingly) for arc as of right now.,only newegg and a select few micro center locations.,source: https://game.intel.com/story/intel-arc-graphics-release/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
weirdly the intel gaming access email sent out today has best buy logo listed along side newegg and micro center.,the release post doesnâ€™t include best buy though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have been looking, and cannot find anything on any us website except newegg.",no posts about it being on those sites either.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oos @ newegg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
aaand .. it's gone,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
true limited edition cards,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
had the a750 in cart and by time i went to check out it went out of stock.,bummer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so where's that discount code from the hpg scavenger hunt :/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fucking backorder won't go through.,just keeps putting me back at the secure checkout page.,edit: it's aggravating.,i work on a pc.,i had auto-refresh set every 30 seconds since this morning.,missed the first drop.,i got up to use the bathroom once and of course that's then they come back in stock lol.,"ugghhhh

edit 2 hours later: still won't let me add the backorder.",edit: 5 minutes after previous edit i finally got the backorder to go through.,had to use the phone app (i was able to spam the confirm order much faster over and over).,worked on the 5th try.,eta on the backorder is 10/19....if of course they get the stock in for it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if they had all this cards since february.... and they are gone... that meas this is it, there should be no more stock.",this is the first gpu in history to be designed as a collectible item.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
will there be limited edition cards in other countries?,afaik none of these retailers ship to romania,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
manâ€¦ what a joke of a launch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"where?, whereeee!",!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they delayed these cards for months in preparation for this launch.,how did they mess this up so bad??,?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
uk listings under ebuyer... interesting i'd have expected scan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so much whinning.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i really wanted one, so sad.","my friend also wanted one to contribute to driver development on linux but alas, no bueno.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
damn sold out at micro center as well!,"i wanted to pick one up, totally forgot today was the 12th!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
shrug,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"finally, when there will also be laptops with a770 gpus??",?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's almost like a reliable leaker (at least for intel products) predicted this yet no one listens to him because of jealousy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wish they wouldn't.,"they're only going to hurt amd's sales, and make the only credible competitor to nvidia less of a threat to nvidias market dominance.",we need to support amd if we want real competition.,"right now you can buy a 6900xt for $669, and it's in the top 5 of the fastest video cards you can buy right now.",don't tell me they're not offering a good alternative to nvidia.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea this launch has been kind of a mess so far.,the a770 and a750 went up earlier than they were supposed to on newegg and the a770 16gb sold out immediately.,"the a750 came in stock again on newegg but now it is also out of stock

**edit: the a770 can be backordered: https://www.newegg.com/intel-21p01j00ba/p/n82e16814883001**",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[this](https://i.imgur.com/lmvlxv0.png) certinaly doesn't help.,i hate newegg more and more with each passing day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
shame theyâ€™re all sold out on newegg now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://youtu.be/-dt7bx-b1mg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm waiting for the collectors edition painted in metal gold.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's a paper launch.,they had the chips made back in february but logistics mismanagement mean they could not get full cards out by launch.,will take a week or two for stock to be available,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"we're getting gift cards instead, apparently.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"unironically, i think a *lot* of these le cards are going to end up as shelf art.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think the parts (like coolers) have been made since february, but that doesn't mean that full ready to ship assembled cards have been waiting in retail boxes that long.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
complete mess.,release a budget friendly card with all this hype....but don't tell us officially where or when we can buy it until an hour after they sold out of the a770?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
newegg now accepting back orders for a770â€¦ shipping on the 19th.,just placed my backorder.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also when?,wheeeen!,!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"its my bad, i bought them all",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a couple teardowns i've seen so far had cards with production date codes from back in *february*.,it's possible that the rumors about intel producing a small amount and just sitting on inventory while they were working on drivers were true.,it will be interesting to see the ranges of date codes that are showing up when retail cards are in the hands of consumers.,it could simply be that intel had a production run at the beginning of the year and hasn't had enough faith in future sales for the near-term.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
extra-breathy winning...  i like it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
such a whimper of a launch.,they must have made one whole box per country.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
newegg made them available at 12am pacific.,their chinese overlordâ€™s probably made them do itâ€¦.but itâ€™s also newegg so they could have just fâ€™ed up per usual,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, i had it in my newegg cart but by the time i got to the payment screen it kicked me back and said they were out of stock.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m curious how much stock does newegg have,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
paper launch as usual.,intel should have known better .,guess things won't change,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah its quite a joke, been trying to get an a770 for a while now",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what's the difference?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's where the external rgb control cable and not going to the pcie bus becomes very handy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i donâ€™t think it would have mattered.,"the a770 sold out in minutes on newegg, which leads me to believe they probably only had a few dozen at most.",iâ€™m curious why the stock is limited.,"is intel purposely holding back, or is this really all the stock they had sitting for months?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the a770 was out of stock before the article saying they were released was even posted ...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i canâ€™t believe youâ€™ve done this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"770 was gone in minutes, but the 750 was up for maybe an hour.",does seem the quantities were limited still though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
werent a ton of these things supposedly sitting in warehouses for months?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe demand is high?,sounds a little like copium,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not much at all apparently,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
true,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a gift card could be used to buy any number of things, whereas a coupon would've been a discount specific to getting an arc card.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oo, good point!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
scalpers gonna scalpâ€¦the shoe market is slowing and ps5â€™s are in stock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"dumb thing to scalp, frankly.","these are the higher end models, and there are already better nvidia and amd cards in the used market.",prices on those and new old stock of 3000-series cards keep coming down.,no one is going to pay much above msrp on an intel arc card today ðÿ˜‚,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>scalpers gonna scalpâ€¦the shoe market is slowing and ps5â€™s are in stock.,f me people are scalping shoes now?,man i'm getting old..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
youâ€™d be surprised.,someone will pay $4-500 for the a770 i guarantee it.,people pay for convenience.,i already see them listed on social marketplaces,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you completely avoided pop culture news for the last 3 years?,ðÿ˜‚,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just the dumber parts of it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what went so drastically wrong that it seems only a few hundred gpus were made available?,"intel certainly is no stranger to product launches, i wonder if there was pressure just to launch something at this point.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
about par for intel with how the arc gpu is going.,"so many people want them to succeed after being fleeced by nvidia and amd over the last couple years, but that just can't deliver on the demand that is there waiting... i almost went to my local micro center in fairfax, va but glad i didn't waste my time",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no 770 at overland park.. i hope there are some,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i hope they have more than 100000 gpu in stock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i stopped by the nj microcenter in paterson.,they said that they just did not receive them yet and to check back tomorrow.,i also called their support line and it seems like they don't really have any answers.,edit: spoke with a store manager and they confirmed that intel barely sent any stock.,"they suggested to keep an eye out on the site and to check back in on delivery days (wed,fri).","they also said they did not receive any promotional material, whatâ€™s going on intel!?!",?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what a ðÿš€ launch intel!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i actually just got one.,they just received some at the dallas store.,the funny thing is that no one here seems to want one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep that seems to be the case.,the fact that they only had stock at a handful of micro center locations is a pretty big red flag.,meanwhile my single micro center location had over 120 4090s this morning.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"all these cards were made back in q1, only 4 million arc cards were made overall and that covers the entire stack from a380 to a770 (not sure if that is just discrete cards or whether that includes laptop gpus as well).",it's pretty much a case of get these cards from somewhere now because they ain't coming back (great for gpu collectors though),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">certainly is no stranger to product launches, i wonder if there was pressure just to launch something at this point.",i heard they didn't want to sell directly to people because there is no margin.,"the plan is to try to bundle with systems, and cpus to make money.",\>> the source is moreslawisdead and some one line articles.,couple.,nobody is on the record but is the likely explanation.,"&#x200b;

my take:

so i'm cool with companies making money and such, but they annoying thing is this isn't' how ti was marketed, and i'm kind of annoyed about it tbh.",wasting our time with a marketing gimmick if true.,my guess: it's all about money though they have cards.,"they are trying to look like a release, part marketing stunt, and part use it as a loss leader as part of the stunt to sell more computers etc.",right because once you bundle the idea is it can help sell some chips.,i can see the point.,"so weird to have a release of product like this that you don't intel to really sell, so you don't believe it in but your customers do.",never seen anything like this i can think of.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nice, did you receive a software bundle email from micro center?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wow, that's a lot of 4090s...who has the money to blow on a 4090?!",i was hopeful with the 770 to finally get a gpu with good specs at a reasonable price.,gonna have to hope my 1070 holds out a little longer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's a lot of foot warmers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's what i feared, i would happily buy one if i could get a 770",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just to put this all into perspective, nvidia + amd shipped together something around ~50 million desktop units for 2021. this is likely 4 mil all in, including mobile.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so, if they produced these back in q1 is production done or what?","surely, we'd see more form aibs etc later on.",i have seen rumors about how the entire gpu division is done for.,i am having a hard time reading the market and seeing if they are in this for the long haul or not.,i ask bc what's the point of fixing this if they aren't?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, just walked in and got the card no bundles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in the uk, only seen listings so far for just one major online retailer and the big pc one (overclockers) , haven't heard anything from them.",there is zero volume but hopefully it's the sort of thing where it'll be available on off for a few weeks on newegg for you guys,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"when gamers nexus did his teardown, confirmed that that die was produced in q1 and the rumours have been of a warehouse full of alchemist dies waiting for the software to catch up.","as far as i'm aware in terms of alchemist, that initial q1 run was it, especially considering 6nm is in much hotter demand than it was back at the start of the year.","the gpu division isn't done for but i think it's going to be a very very long time before we see the arc division on parity with someone like amd where obviously they have the cpu side of the business, while also being able to make half a dozen different gpu dies for their products stack.","current rumours are intel focusing on data centre and laptop (which makes a lot of sense) and then just keeping some sort of presence in the discrete market, so maybe just one gpu die for the battlemage launch to keep costs low.",this is a awful market to be launching a new gpu into when supply is far outpacing demand.,"so long story short, intel is in the long haul for the graphics business but no one including intel has a clue about them being involved in the discrete gpu space long term",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
okay if you don't receive the bundle email you can reach out to intel directly and they should be able to help you out.,you're supposed to get a copy of modern warfare 2 and some other digital software goodies.,here is the link: https://softwareoffer.intel.com/support,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"makes sense, thanks for the insight.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it seems i did.,i looked back at the receipt and i got cod mwii for free.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at least they're something different.,"the features are interesting, too.","&#x200b;

>""we've studied the need of live streaming for a long time, and here comes our first livemixer that helps streamers to stream in great quality with its well vrm design, additional pcie slots and twenty-plus usb ports.""","says chris lee, vice president of asrock motherboard & gaming monitor business unit.","with a maximum of **23 usb ports** to connect external devices, users will never run short.","hook up every peripheral, whether it's mice, keyboards, microphones, headsets, multiple cameras, fill-lights, macropads, and much more.","equipped with dual pci-express 4x slots & thunderbolt header, the livemixer allows users to connect a graphics card, a high-speed capture card and a thunderbolt add-in card at the same time.",hot damn.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
should have called these grape soda and orange soda.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i donâ€™t get as rock.,"a creator-themed motherboard is nothing new (asus proart, gigabyte aero) and, as a creator, this actually sounded interesting to me.","hearing all the â€œlive mixingâ€ branding, i was expecting to see a new, quality onboard audio implementation that was actually usable for creators.","something beyond the standard realtek crap that boards get, maybe like those crazy aopen tube-based motherboards back in the day.","but what the bleep, it still has a noisy bottom-of-the-line alc897!",and thatâ€™s when i realize this is all just marketing.,"the unique features as i see it are,

- 23 usb ports (18 of them gen1 or 2.0)
- graffiti design

the 2 x 4.0 x4 slots are not especially hard to find on z790 boards.","the asus tuf, for example, has 1 x 5.0x16, 2 x 4.0x4, and 2 x 3.0x1.",a thunderbolt â€œheaderâ€ is not special.,realtek lan?,the 14-phase 60a vrm is average.,the msi z790-a now has 16-phase 80a.,"like many z790 boards it does have a 5.0 m.2 slot, if you feel like slowing your gpu to x8, and 4 other 4.0 slots, which is at least good.",is it necessary to mention â€œlegal biosâ€?,unless itâ€™s designed to be intuitive for lawyers?,i guess it depends where on the pricing spectrum the board falls.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"unless your pc theme is jet set radio then i wonder who would actually buy these

i like it..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
donâ€™t know if i trust asrock.,has their quality increased over the years?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'd like to see more variety in motherboard designs but this ain't it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i noticed on their product page for the z790 mixer board it says it has 23 usb ports.,"stupid question, but how bc my eyes clearly ain't seeing that?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ok, where to buy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"perfect, i love the color scheme.. just bought it, alongside the 13700 and some fresh dd5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gigabyte actually did it first: at least one of their new z790 boards has **24 usb ports**.,"although, considering as rock is normally extremely usb anemic, itâ€™s more meaningful coming from them!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16x+4x+4x pcie x16 layout indeed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this is awesome, i donâ€™t know why everyone is hating on this.",iâ€™m a usb gizmo addict.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
asrock fanta orange/grape series.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's mostly been their low budget tier boards for 10th/11th gen that were especially bad.,everything else has ranged from decent to excellent.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oc formula is still good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've had 3 asrock mobos and never had issues with them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they are still the only board vendor to support and validate running ecc memory for socket am4 and am5 with consumer chips.,they put in the effort for their products.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"considering their niche from inception, i would say yes, tremendously.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably including the usb 2.0 headers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bought mine monday night,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"total credit to both, it's great to have another option.","there's *someone* out there who just saw these boards and super, super happy now.","i salute you, usb aficionado, wherever you may be.",o7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i will be looking for an excellent affordable z690 board.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i *really* wish they would have released one for z690 (closest thing was the aqua, but they never made it to retail and still lacked some of the ocf features).","no rumblings for a z790 version either, although that could change down the road of course.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
still got my z170 oc formula and it's 4 full sized pcie slots sleeping on a shelf.,never selling that thing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"same here, rock solid.",asrock does awesome mobos.,and usually not crazy expensive with the same amount of features of higher priced brands.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, i looked at the spec tab and the z790 board breaks down like this:

    total usb:
    1 x usb 3.2 gen2x2 type-c (front)
    2 x usb 3.2 gen2 type-c (rear)
    2 x usb 3.2 gen2 type-a (rear)
    8 x usb 3.2 gen1 (4 rear, 4 front)
    10 x usb 2.0 (6 rear, 4 front)
    all usb ports support esd protection
    
    rear i/o:
    2 x usb 3.2 gen2 type-a ports (10 gb/s)
    2 x usb 3.2 gen2 type-c ports (10 gb/s)
    4 x usb 3.2 gen1 ports (usb32_23 are lightning gaming ports.",usb32_45 support ultra usb power.),"6 x usb 2.0 ports

and i donâ€™t mean average gaming rig builders who visit reddit or watch ltt.","i mean joe blow who has no idea that intel is new to gpus, they just see a reasonable price and know f*ck itâ€™s intel like my cpu, thatâ€™s probably a good choice for that reason alone.",and thatâ€™s actually a pretty huge market.,"intel is targeting the mass sales segment, not the boutique or premium end where you need a psu more expensive than the a770 just to run the gpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i agree with you.,i woke up this morning a little late (intel never said what time it was launching) i think it was around 11am and there was nothing.,no way these cards are that popular.,intel probably made 100 total for the whole us.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"my suspicion is either they have yield issues, which would explain why there seemed to be many more a750s available, or theyâ€™re purposely slowing supply so they have more time to improve the drivers.",they wonâ€™t be slammed with as many bad reviews and tech support problems if they release the supply slowly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"they did, despite what ayymd crowd says, the new arc cards are actually great according to ltt",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably a paper launch tbh.,i'd bet the actual sold amount is pretty low.,they probably rushed the launch to piggy back on nvidia not having any mid level cards announced.,i hear micro center as a whole got 42 770s total not just 1 store,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can you get one for very cheaply?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
jump to 12th gen. that's 6 years ahead of where you are.,or 7 years when raptor lake launches.,there are some affordable solutions for 12th gen and soon there will be discounts do to lack of sales.,so you may find a whole ton of bargains soon enough.,i say upgrade completely for security and more updated functionality.,for example usb-c is nonexistent on your current motherboard.,but it is available on a newer system.,and that means faster data transfer rates and other benefits.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it depends.,if you are gaming at 60hz the 7700k is still adequate.,but even a new i3 is much faster...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"unless u can get one for dirt cheap, a 5600+b450m or b550m is probably a far better deal.",r5 5600 goes on sale on newegg for 100.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at least i3-12100 performs far better than 7700k.,and 12th gen even supports your current ddr4 sticks.,personally recommend a budget upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"7700k is arguably way too expensive (around $150+ on ebay), 6700k is decent for not having to change motherboards (around $80-100 on ebay), they have the same ipc so only difference as far as the cpu itself goes will be frequency, 7700k clocks 300-400mhz higher (4.5 vs 4.2 single-core, 4.4 vs 4.0 all-core), 10% difference in all-core frequency and 7% in single-core frequency.","ryzen 5 5600 has become dirt cheap ($130 on newegg) for the performance it offers, motherboards can also be bought for decent price (b550 start at $90, b450 as low as $74, although those cheap b450 don't even come with vrm heatsinks, which really tells you how cheap they are), of course it'll end up being more expensive even a 7700k, but it'll offer more performance.","12100f is pretty cheap as well ($95 on newegg), motherboard's are also at a decent price (b660 start at as low as $90).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
unless you get a 7700k for free your better off upgrading to a 12400 or 12100,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12100 and cheap mobo?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what did you end of going with.,im in the same boat.,my 1060 6 gb holds up well i think but the i5 drags everything down.,30 fps on warzone 2 isnt good enough for my liking,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"unless you are getting stuff for free, i don't think any upgrade from older mobos other than at least 8700k is worth it (ofc with good price that's cheaper than newer i3/i5 mobo combo)

why 8700k in particular?","6 cores 12 threads = modern-ish system for gaming/multitasking 

and tbh it kinda sucks too... i'd recommend going to 9900k since it fits the same mobos (z170/z270/z370/z390 with some modding required for the older ones)

why 9900k?","8 cores 16 threads and hyperthreading = solid modern system

not even gonna mention 9700k (also passable btw) because we all know older mobos upgraders only aim for bis cpu ;)

p.s.",don't even bother upgrading if your cpu is 5th gen or older.,just build a new system.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this.,i7's carry way to much value on the used market.,wanted to upgrade my 7600k to a 7700k but it was just more beneficial to completely upgrade my platform.,"for the starting price of 150 to 200 on ebay, you could just as easily get a i5 10400 and an lga 1200 compatabile board.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

to summarize:

- base pay is $1.25m
- annual cash bonus up to ~$3.57m
- $10m in stock to match pat's own $10m stock purchase (if he holds for 3 years)
- $20m in stock, vesting over 3 years

performance-based awards (whose targets he has 3 or 5 years to reach):

- $20m in stock if intel stock outperforms the s&p500
- $20m in stock if intel stock outperforms the s&p500 by 25%
- $30m in stock if intel stock increases in value by 30%
- $10m in stock if intel stock increases in value by 50%
- $20m in stock if intel stock increases in value by 100%
- $20m in stock if intel stock increases in value by 200%

as noted in the filing, pat forfeited ""approximately $50m in equity awards"" when he left vmware, as justification for his non-performance grant.","and clearly if you check intel's stock price, almost 2 years in, he's nowhere near any of the performance-based targets.","hence, that's $120m that he has a lot of work to do to actually earn.","personally, if he were actually able to turn the company around/create enough shareholder value to make the company worth 2x or 3x what it was worth when he joined, considering intel's size and the importance of what they do, he would imo have rightfully earned the honor of being the highest paid ceo in america.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

afaik bk was never involved with architecture/design as deeply as pat was,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in my opinion pat is leading intel in a good way.,he want to build fabs with partial government funding.,"he wants to build the best products for intel having multiple design teams on chips like cpu, gpu.",also focussing on stability.,you have to know that currently the whole wide world is in a recession.,so the current share downfalls are for the whole market for the most part,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"intel has shown a 34 (p-)core raptor lake desktop processor, so a return to hedt seems likely.",whether they call it an i9-13980xe remains to be seen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's because the 12900k is two or three years newer.,at the time the best that intel had to offer on consumer desktop chips was the 9900k.,"the 10980xe and the rest of the ""x"" series cpus were hedt chips, similar to ryzen threadripper, equipped with more capacity and quad channel ram support, more pcie lanes, etc etc.","they weren't limited edition, they were classed as hedt.","as mainstream consumer cpu core counts have grown, hedt has become less popular and neither amd or intel seem to care about it that much.","amd basically priced threadripper 5000wx so high it makes no sense for anyone to buy it, and intel either doesn't feel the need to compete, or doesn't feel that their architecture is capable of it.","a 12900k with 8 p and 8 e cores already sucks down 250 watts, can you imagine trying to make a 16 or 32 p core sku plus e cores how many watts that would use?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they're still more expensive because intel hasn't actually released a replacement for their hedt platform so they maintain the prices due to the more professional feature set that isn't offered on other intel consumer platforms.,"more pcie lanes, quad channel memory, u.2 support, etc.",more professional features that alderlake is missing despite having higher overall performance.,"for reference i'm using 44 of the 48 pcie lanes on mine, i don't have an option to go to another platform right now without having to remove pcie devices or run them slower.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel could get away with selling anything with more than four cores for exorbitant prices until ryzen came along.,"they still havenâ€™t kicked the habit, sadly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel's processors have a weird price lifecycle.,they tend to never get official price cuts until they are replaced.,"after awhile though, the top end skus start to creep back up in price.","since they're the top performing chips in the socket, they become in demand for anyone upgrading, since it's cheaper than buying a newer chip and a motherboard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hedt platform, more of basically everything but without being a server

i feel you big time.,i've been wanting to upgrade to something a little bit cooler and less power hungry (as cool as the feat of keeping 450watts below 90â° is) but the only option is threadripper and that's just the amd equivalent to the xeon line up in terms of pricing at this point.,hopefully intel can bring back some competition back to the hedt market and give us what we need.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

a 4690k won't have rebar; so an arc gpu doesn't seem like a good fit.,at least in the gaming tests without rebar it was pretty unusuable.,only 10th gen intel onwards has it; and i think 3 series amd but not sure on the amd side.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

maxes out about 70. that's when the cpu bottleneck kicks in.,"i haven't overclocked mine btw so you could prob push more our of it, but cyberpunk is a cpu intensive game.",i'm getting 120-200 on other games.,lol.,so yeah won't get much higher in this game on an 8700k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"american silicon independence is a great idea that can be realized for a cost higher than any government, corporation, or consumer will be willing to pay.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"this should help with more things like that ig it  seems like their making sure the foundry team inside intel treats all the other groups using their nodes with the same processes/systems like they were an external customer buying capacity i.e: amazon,amd (fabless companies who use nodes from tsmc/ifs) getting treated just as if they were treating ccg,dcai(groups of intel).","etc etc...( i think this would be better phrased as ""internal groups of intel are seeming as if their going to be treated like external customers""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

> silicon will become a commodity as isas move towards open standards combined with custom ip blocks.,not the argument made.,silicon might be a commodity.,silicon manufacturing at the bleeding edge is not.,margins are through the roof because there are very few companies that can do it and keep investing in it.,a closed foundry model was eventually going to catch up to intel given the massive investment requirements to keep the edge (which they lost years ago).,> arm is just a start.,is not an open standard.,"> in this new world where intel potentially doesn't develop the ip blocks

"that's why their foundry people are always talking about offering all of advanced packaging, risc-v ip, their own x86 ip and etc to foundry customers and allow them to mix different chiplets through ucie which intel's pushing as a standard",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not necessarily.,"for example, if the 13th gen ihs is lower in height than the contact frame surrounding it.",i have thermalright contact frame on my i5-12600 and it dropped my core temps by 6 degrees.,i recommend it for even these lower end cpus that are not overclocked.,i hope that the frame will work with 13th gen cpus as well.,unfortunately i haven't found any information about the 12th vs. 13the gen ihs measurements.,"we know that there are some changed ""under the hood"", but what about the hood itself?",we'll see.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
perfect thanks!,it's my first build so trying to absorb everything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
where did you buy your part?,i wanted to pick one up also.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for letting me know.,it's fixed now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you update your bios?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wouldn't it also make existing cooler mounting kits incompatible?,that would be a rather silly design decision.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
got mien on amazon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yea , but i found the problem and its now fixed and working.",i updated the me firmware on the board and it fixed  it.,everythings works now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, the issue would be if intel made the pcb on 13th gen thicker, but the die and ihs thinner which is possible with how intel makes these cpus and has happened before with 8th, 9th, and 10th gen. coolers were still compatible but any kind of frame was not.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
silly?,certainly.,but it's not intel's problem.,they expect us to use their latch mechanism even when it has its own design problems with certain aftermarket coolers.,"i didn't measure the thickness of the contact frame, nor did i measure the original latch mechanism either.","i may be wrong, but i have this mental image in my mind that the contact frame was thicker.","in other words, there seemed to be less ihs protruding than before.","anyway, thankfully we don't need to wait long anymore.",i'm sure all the info we need will be out soon.,i can't wait to read detailed reviews!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i bought a asus tuf 690 with 1601 bios and it worked perfectly with 13900k no need bios update before install,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"considering 13th gen should be reverse compatible with current 600-series boards, it would be a bit nonsensical if the raptor lake chips had different ihs dimensions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
true.,i totally agree with you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the question will be if 600 boards will come with 13 gen ready or you need to buy a 12 gen cpu to flash it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"all 600 series chipsets support 13th gen, all the way down to h610.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what?,no.,you mean h610.,but yes.,"600 series will work with raptor 13th gen.
just like 700 series will work with alder 12th gen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

looks nice btw did you go for a relatively high end board so that you can change the 12400f later on?,the 12400 can't be oced so a b660 board would've been cheaper tbh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"two issues with mine:

1. poor case ventilation.","had to install extra fans, including in places where they wouldn't usually go.","2. weak psu and no in-bios overclocking, undervolting capability",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can definitely build your own 12700/3060ti build for that or even less than that if you're savvy.,xps builds are bad.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"see how much it would cost to build it yourself

it doubles as a mini bake oven.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
were you getting crashes?,"looks like this one has 460w, that seems too low...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i heard pretty bad things about them too, but this xps also includes 16g ddr5 ram, 512gb sssd + 1t hd.","for everything thats included, it seems like a decent value.","just found out i can get it for less than $1000 with discount code, so its getting real enticing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it quite a bit cheaper to buy dell.,building my own would cost like $1500.,"with cash back deals also going on at dell, the xps would be less than $1100.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no crashes, mine is actually 360w",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
discount code?,it's showing up as 1249 with the $400 already taken off when i click on that link you sent.,"the 4400mhz ddr5 memory seems very sluggish on paper, they don't even list any timings or give you the memory ic to look up.",how much do you know about pc hardware/how much are you willing to know?,even if you just want to plug and play and never bother with any technical knowledge i know there are other prebuilts i could recommend that will give you a better experience.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you dont plan any upgrades buying a dell prebuilt is fine(except bad ventilation),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10% cash back + college code from friend which is another 10% + credit card deal from amex can potentially take it down another $350 from that $1249.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seem like dell is desperate to sell their inventory rn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ah yeah those discount stacks are neat af.,i'd say if you can really score it for $900 then it's a good deal.,i put together a part list for you [here](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/ncqth2) if you've got your heart set on the 12700f/3060 ti combo and are willing to spend more to have a better pc and upgradability in the future.,i left the gpu out of that because you can easily get a used 3060 ti on ebay or craigslist for $300 or less.,"most used cards on the market are only used for gaming too so as long as you can vet the seller and have enough confidence in its condition, it will perform identical to a new card.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

first world problems (your cpu is too good),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes i have same issue on win 11 only task manager shows right cpu usage interesting, af and process hacker even hwinfo64 don't tell right usage but this happens in games actually, if i use any kind of stress test they all will report 100% usage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah windows 11 doesn't report the correct cpu usage for me either.,only 1 thread shows realistic usage and the others are all 0 or very low.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
disagree.,the 12600k is a fine cpu.,the whole point of why the 12400 is popular is because it's cheap and can be easily paired with a basic h610 or b660 motherboard and you'll get 99% of the performance of the 12500 or 12600 for less money.,"adding a 12500k would also require you to get a z690 board, which would add a lot of cost for very mild performance gains, assuming you even bother to oc.",what intel should have done is had the 12600 non k also have e cores.,that way each sku would have its niche.,"as it stands now the 600 is literally a useless sku, and offers nothing over the 12500 except for 100mhz turbo.","ideally it would look like this:

12400 - budget bargain

12500 - adds better igpu

12600 - adds e cores

12600k - adds overclocking",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12600k would sell poorly then imo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
honest question since iâ€™ve been out of the loop for a while.,can you get a 12600k and pair it with a basic b660 motherboard if youâ€™re not going to overclock?,i never did oc my k processors before yet i still prefer to buy them because they either come a bit oc by default (6700 vs 6700k for example) or have higher cache than the non-k version.,edit: are the 12600 and 12600k exactly the same bar the capacity to oc?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
.. and?,i dont agree that it would anyway.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> can you get a 12600k and pair it with a basic b660 motherboard if youâ€™re not going to overclock?,"yes you can, but it's a bit sub optimal since you lose out on the unlocked multiplier that you paid for.",> i never did oc my k processors before yet i still prefer to buy them because they either come a bit oc by default (6700 vs 6700k for example) or have higher cache than the non-k version.,this gen they do.,> edit: are the 12600 and 12600k exactly the same bar the capacity to oc?.,"nope, which is my whole point.","they should be, but they aren't.","not only is the k unlocked for overclocking, but it also has four extra e cores and 2mb cache over the 12600.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's why you don't have the product you're hinting at,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you.,"so for someone who donâ€™t overclock, it is still better to buy the 12600k and it is ok to pair it with a basic b660, since you wonâ€™t need to use the unlocked multiplier but you will still get the benefits of 12600k over the 12600.

thatâ€™s what i wanted to know, thanks.",edit: i did that with my skylake 6700k.,i didnâ€™t oced it for most of its life but i didnâ€™t get the 6700 because 6700k was better already out of the box.,at the end of its life i did some oc but by that time i had to upgrade anyways.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe intel should make 12p+8e core 13900kx.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the 13600k is going to be a great value.,it destroys the 7600x in multithread as expected and even the 7700x.,the 7900x isn't that far ahead of the 13700k so demanding a $100+ premium is not a good look.,"i'm going for the i7 since i won't upgrade again for 5+ years, and i'll probably be glad i got those two extra p cores at some point.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"nice, all the results are close enough that price should be the deciding factor.",i can feel a price war coming!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"at the end of the article, the author says it looks like intel has the potential to win back the multi-threaded performance battle, is he talking the over the next few generations or with raptor lake?",cause it looks like 7950x is still beating 13900k unless it wasn't fully maxed out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"lmao idk why amd even bothered with the 7600x... as usual the i5 is the best value, if that leaked report is anything to go by, we will be seeing a similar story as 12th gen i5 vs ryzen 5/7",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it would be 13900ky at the price it would run,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i definitely cannot guarantee it comes out in january, but it's been a couple weeks since they started production on them, so by january they should be ready for launch.","but then again, i have a feeling everyone is waiting for them right now considering how good the 5800x3d is, so availability might be an issue at launch anyway.","apparently they fixed the issue with heat build up that kept the 5800x3d from running at full speed, and they also fixed the latency issue that kept them from making 12 and 16 core versions, so i don't doubt they'll be something we're all going to want.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gaming isnâ€™t the ultimate pc use case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in fairness am5 is much more expensive than say z690 is right now for the same feature sets.,5800x3d is competitive only in games that take advantage of the cache otherwise itâ€™s still behind.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"personally, i think that's why they lowered the launch price of the 7950x to $699, because they're planning to launch the 7950x3d at the old top end price: $799.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that argument is the same for intel.,they wouldn't have been competitive at the previous generation tdp (now up to 350w),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at the moment the problem for the 7600x are the ridiculous mobo prices.,until that is sorted i don't see how it can compete with the 13600k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so it's more a case of the changing landscape rather than any inherent flaw in adl/rpl itself.,"appreciate the reply, is there any particular upcoming architecture which in your opinion stands out?","i understand any answer is obviously going to be speculative as information is ofcourse limited, but i'm not particularly in a rush to buy a 13th gen processor if say meteor lake shows particular promise, as my 9900k is still going strong.","it's just certain edge cases like late-game rimworld, factorio, paradox titles and the ever unoptimized mess that is the average niche wargame where i wouldn't mind a bit more on the top-end.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if it is 6+4, wouldn't that be like the 12600k?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
last i heard the talk was febuary or march.,ive also been getting tired of waiting but these am5 mobo prices have helped me wait some more.,not too keen on intel these last few gens with the insane power draw and bending cpus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
disagree.,its easily the highest weighted/most important metric.,"see: 7700k vs 1800x, 8700k vs 2700x, 9900k vs 3900x, and 10900k vs 3950x.","amd regularly dominated in mt, yet as long as gaming performance was in intel's favor, amd competed as the budget option.",ryzen 5000 and 7000 pricing reflect what happens the moment you take the gaming crown.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the default pl2 is the same on 13th gen...?,intel would destroys zen 3 even at 125w in everything but highly threaded tile renderers.,golden cove is >20% faster than zen 3 cores.,it's not the same situation.,"they didn't increase tdp to compete (though, certainly, they wouldn't have been at the top of every chart if [they had reduced tdp](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/intel-core-i9-12900k-alder-lake-tested-at-various-power-limits/2.html))",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
true and im with you on that the 670e boards are crazy overkill too.,the b650 have all the need features though they dont lack for vrms etc either most have atleast 1 pcie 5 x16 and a pcie 5 nvme.,i bought the asrock 670e steel legend and its been a solid overclocker but i dont think i really gained anything over some of cheaper b series mid range boards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nothing i know of stands out.,"the thing about those ""everlasting"" cpus is that you don't know which ones it will be until they're long out of production.","zen 4d might be great, but it might also struggle in the future thanks to the neutered infinity fabric transfer rates between the core and io-die.",i know for a fact that my 12900k does a very good job at running crusader kings 3 and stellaris if that helps,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah.,i've read otherwise though (like it being 6+8) but yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oops, that's a typo.",i meant 12600k.,the 13600k is meant to be 6+8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think it's well established that they'll be presented at ces, which is in early january.",the question is if it's also a launch.,"since we know they started production a couple weeks ago, it makes sense to launch at ces since the lead time from production start  to launch is usually 3 months.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 3950x was more expensive than the 10900k.,and outperformed the 10900k in single threaded apps except gaming.,single thread is not gaming only.,and demanding games arenâ€™t single threaded.,pricing reflects more than just performance.,it also reflects the place the brand name is.,1800x had amd at a completely trash position after the fx abomination while intel has been the go to choice for almost a decade.,they couldnâ€™t do otherwise they had to undercut intel.,same with the 2700x.,they had improved their position but hadnâ€™t established the brand name they had now.,they asserted dominance with zen 3 and they have completely dropped the ball by releasing 6 cores and 8 cores for 299$ and 399$ respectively completely trash value.,expect a 7600 non x for 180$ soon after the 13400 releases.,and a620 motherboadds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

appreciate it!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 3950x was more expensive than the 10900k because it blew away intel's entire hedt line up including the $2000 9980xe.,it also did not have better st performance than the 10900k.,you singled out that chip to refute my assertion but the issue is that you ignored the context in which that chip was launched.,"still, people preferred the 10900k over the 3950x because unless you were using it for work, gaming mattered more, and far more people care about gaming.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

donâ€™t get caught up on the meaningless i3/i5/i7 monikers.,do research and compare actual performance for the cpu of models youâ€™re looking at.,a 9th gen i7 is not going to outperform an 11th gen i5 or even a 12th gen i3.,"and yes, a recent trend has been to put too much cpu into laptops not capable of handling the power draw or heat output, so something like an i7 ends up performing the same or even worse than the same model with an i5.","again, you need to be smarter than the manufacturers, because they want to sell you super high-end impressive specs, without telling you that theyâ€™ve actually severely gimped its power levels, or the thing will just throttle constantly.","personally, i would try for at least 11th gen for better igpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"at a glance, all your parts look good.","the only thing i might caution is that if you buy a z690 board and intend to use a 13th gen cpu, you *might* have to flash the bios of the motherboard to the newest version.","since z690 came out with 12th gen, it *might* not come pre-loaded with the firmware to support 13th gen. it's still fine, and supported, but you will probably need to use msi's bios flash feature to load the newest bios.","it's possible that if the board was manufactured recently, it might come pre-loaded with a new enough version of the bios to support 13th gen out of the box.",[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cu7zmmsmu20) will give you an idea of what would have to be done.,"you could alternatively wait for z790 boards to release along side 13th gen, but they will probable cost a hair more and not really offer any additional value.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most 690 boards require an updated bios in order to support raptor lake.,your motherboard may or may not have the updated bios.,you should download the latest bios onto a flash disk and use the flash bios to update it before assembling the computer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for the detailed answer!,is there any issue in updating to the latest bios?,iâ€™ve seen a few of those clickbait videos â€œi updated my bios and now my pc bricked!â€ and that makes me anxious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so, the process for flashing the bios with a usb can be finicky, but so long as you look at what the motherboard manufacturer requires (type of usb drive, how long you need to wait, wait for led lights to flash, etc) then you should be fine.","there are often reports of people's motherboards getting bricked during these processes, but its hard to determine why things went wrong and if it was something like pulling the usb too early or something.","like i said though, it's very possible that your board will be manufactured recently enough to get the newest bios out of the factory.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think the biggest issue with bios flashback is simply the lack of proper documentation.,"i wanted to do it on my z690 hero, and it didnâ€™t seem to be workingâ€¦ and had a heck of a time figuring out what was supposed to be happening (because both success and failure could apply to the poor description asus used, and not once were any potential issues described).","in the end, it didnâ€™t like the usb stick i was using (despite it being an old cheap one what shouldâ€™ve been fine), and things went smoothly when i changed to a new one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh god, yeah i donâ€™t trust myself enough to do it specially with a first build, iâ€™ll have to find a pc shop to build it for me, either that or just go with the 12th gen now that they are cheaper",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i mean i saw jayztwocent's video of him bricking an intel 11th gen board and he was doing something crazy like using no cpu, no gpu, no ram, and just the motherboard and psu.",and even then i believe he wasn't even connecting all the power connectors either.,i was under the impression that you need to at least give the motherboard a cpu and ram to make sure the handshake works right.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can also just wait and see what it looks like when 13th gen hits store shelves.,"if you're willing to wait and see 13th gen, you can make the final decision then.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, as far as i know the entire point of bios flashback is all you need is the motherboard and a power supply, likely with just the 24-pin.","the point is the system never actually turns on, so cpu and memory never see any power even if installed - the entire process occurs while the system is in standby mode (otherwise known to most people as â€œoffâ€).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah i guess, itâ€™s just iâ€™ve been waiting for so long to make this, now that prices are (almost) normal i want to upgrade from my gtx 1070 laptop to a proper setup.","it looks like the mobo i want has a flashback port in which i can use to update the bios, i wonder how temps are compared between the 12700 and 13700, i heard the new ones run cooler.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no respectable reviewer is trashing them, they are just not recommending them at the moment for obvious reasons.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"seriously though, the software is broken, the drivers are, understandably, lacking a decade of micro-optimizations for specific titles, basically amd and nvidia have been soft-subsidizing game developers with their own r&d budget for years - or putting in workarounds for unintended but within spec/api uses of their hardware - it really a toss up between the two on any given fix.",it's a tough sell for little jimmy fortnite.,"that said, if you're excited about the prospect of amd/nvidia getting the kick in the proverbial nuts *and* have some money to spare without expectation that it will, indeed, get better *this* generation - you are in no way obligated to support intel, but it would be a lot cooler if you did.",cards in the hands of people who will put them through the gauntlet of common and not so common use scenarios are probably worth more to intel now than whatever revenue they could get out of this generation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm very happy to see another competitor on the market, and at a good price point too.","if i were in the market, i'd buy one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
biggest issue in my mind is games failing to play correctly at all.,"slowness in old dx is sort of a temporary problem, as future gens of this get more powerful, even if they dont make dx emulation improvements, it's still going to be fine as long as they sort out breaking compatibility issues.","from a forward looking perspective, most newer and more demanding titles will be supported, so you can expect perf to match up with hardware specs much better for this, which is probably strategically a lot more important for intel in the long term.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i want intel to have a fighting chance too, but lets acknowledge that most people buying gpus for themselves are gaming, and only a small fraction of those livestream or would otherwise frequently need av1 hardware encoding.",even linus says in the beginning of the video he's not recommending the card for gaming.,both nvidia and amd are coming out with av1 hardware support next gen. to me that doesn't seem like very long that intel will get to hold this crown.,"i hope that intel can improve drivers to deliver better performance and stability, but i wouldn't be generally recommending it until then either.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh yea, it is great to see a youtuber recommend consumers buy an inferior product to ""support"" a $100 billion dollar cooperation who stagnated innovation and screwed over consumers for a decade because they had no competition.","&#x200b;

he just reiterated that he still refuses to recommend arc gpu's for any kind of gaming.,"he said in his a770 review that it's a product designed to take on the 3000 series while nvidia has moved on to 4000, but it actually even fails to take on the 3000 series.",i kind of agree.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
linus should put his money where his mouth is.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i couldn't ever get one due to lack of backwards dx compatibility, and can't recommend them due to that.",and no i don't care for emulated older dx support.,i still like to play a lot of old games and i doubt these intel gpus would ever support my library of gog games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to be honest itâ€™s not our responsibility to make a 100 billion dollar companyâ€™s products sell well.,"they botched arc, basically never delivered on any of their goals and lied about details on multiple occasions.","if their product is inferior to everything else, then it should rightfully fail.","and as much as i wanted arc to succeed to have a proper third competitor, intel instead took over the reputation amd had for the longest time.","and if rumours are anything to go by, arcâ€™s days might be numbered.",but letâ€™s see how this develops.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm just waiting for plex hardware encoding support to throw one in my server and retire the 1080 that's currently in it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i really hope intel went into this knowing 1st gen was going to be rough and have a long term plan to go at least 3 or 4 generations in before pulling the plug.,i know they have battlemage planned but not sure how much itâ€™ll improve over 1st gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm pretty shocked at how little coverage there is about how good (or bad) the drivers are in creative applications.,"i mean we've known for years in the laptop world, that intel's igpu drivers are rock solid in adobe applications and wipe the floor with amd igpu drivers despite the amd igpu's being more powerful.",i feel like the same thing should be highlighted here.,"i don't know for sure bc so few people are talking about it, but in theory, the a380 should be a killer budget creator card in any application where the intel's xe igpu also has good drivers, right?",i get it intel is new to the gaming space and their 3d dx drivers need some work but can we compare the gpus as whole not just gaming?,nvidia has clear strengths in gaming and creative apps but at insane prices.,so lets compare intel and amd in the sane $200-$400 segment.,"amd has better drivers for games sure, but intel arc has some power under the hood.",does arc beat amd in creative apps?,that would be good to know.,"gaming is a hobby, but i need to use adobe apps for work.","i would not mind having a solid price to performance gpu for adobe apps, while i essentially beta test intel's gaming drivers in my spare time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"long live competition, trio if all goes good.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so we should support a multi billion dollar company because linus said to!!,"no brother the product is shit, they need to do better",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah sunny cove(ice lake and rocket lake's architecture) was supposed to come out in 2018 but got delayed until intel's 10nm was finally ready(for ice lake).,after all they were supposed to ship 10nm products by 2017/2018 so the timeline fits.,"and sunny cove was a major improvement over skylake so it's not like intel did nothing while 'waiting', sunny cove is more advanced than ryzen at the time in many ways(see this detailed [analysis](https://chipsandcheese.com/2022/06/07/sunny-cove-intels-lost-generation/))",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"so, it's a bit more complicated than that.",intel's plan was never to sell quad-cores ad infinitum.,it was to sell cpus that software is capable of taking advantage of.,"even back in 2016, the benefit of going beyond a hyperthreaded quad core was basically nil for most people, as most (consumer oriented) software was fundamentally single threaded.","they had the hedt platform for the workloads that needed more, but otherwise stacking more cores on consumer desktop wouldn't really benefit most people.. at first.","it'd just cost them a lot of extra silicon, and the benefits wouldn't really be obvious to most consumers (remember ""an i5 is all you need""?).","instead, intel was working with software vendors to improve mt capabilities across the board, with (presumably) plans to release higher core counts on mainstream once software would be capable of properly taking advantage of it.","so yes, it would have hurt them, and no, it wouldn't have been particularly helpful *at the time*.","while i don't doubt that if intel had simply released higher core count skus, developers might have been more likely to make mt-oriented software, i don't think it's really fair to say they should have just added more cores and merely hope it would all eventually work out.",anyway.,"ryzen then rolled around, and by the time it did, so did improved software more capable of using more cores.","and as software rolled out, so did intel release higher core count skus.","it seems plausible that ryzen accelerated that transition, but to what extent, i couldn't tell you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is on point.,ryzen zen 1 to zen 2 were undercutting intel by even half the price in some cases.,for anyone who wanted  a budget pc it was a no-brainer which gave amd the best sales they had in a decade.,that's how you increase marketshare.,"arc is not doing the same, even at its price point it has to compete with 3060 and 6600xt which are already very established in the budget territory with proper working drivers, full  support for dx9/dx11 and a much more advanced software stack/features.","av1 encode/decode is nice for some cases but lets be honest, by next gen (if not this one) every single gpu in the market will have full av1 support so that kinda negates this advantage.","right now av1 barely works with multiple bugs, crashes and hang ups let alone most big platforms still don't officially support it.","so what exactly do you get besides ""a toy for tinketing, if you have spare cash laying around"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not the same because early ryzen had a defect that was fixed in a revision.,i have one of the 1700x chips affected and it worked fine for awhile but then i could reproduce daily with certain software.,it was not fixable with bios or microcode.,as far as we know publicly the intel problems are just software so far.,much easier to fix.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,the key bit of context you're missing is that the person i replied to was saying consumers should purchase the card even though it's not ready in order to convince intel to improve their product for next time.,fuck that.,they're the multi hundred billion dollar corporation.,they can fund their own r&d.,i'll show interest when they can compete.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"key thing is, you asked if you can get ""everything"" out of the 13700k, the answer would be ""no"" if you went ddr4 and/or b660 and/or stayed on a 600 series board vs 700 series.","to get everything such as ability to overclock later when you want more, you will need a z series board, the 700 series will squeak out a bit more on ddr5 based on initial insights of the builds.","lastly, ddr5 in the end will eventually outdo ddr4, it just isn't as of now and probably won't be much better till another year or two.","now, can you have a great god tier build despite not being on a z790 series ddr5 build...yes you can.","if you want to save and honestly don't plan to overclock ever, then go non-k sku with a b series board (it will handle it).","take the savings and put it towards being a ddr5 platform to keep you on ""current/future"" tech and other parts you can make more future proof like psu/gpu.","if you really need/want more than that and truly are planning not to build till raptor lake hits, then i would just go all out :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
im doing the same upgrade path.,i went with z690 and 32gb ddr4.,the mobo cost $150 and the ram cost me $90.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you don't already have high performance ddr4, then its worth buying ddr5 instead now, mainly because 2x16 premium ddr4 are no longer easy to find or cheap.","considering that, amd's latest gen could also be an option for you.","for people like me who already got premium ddr4 for cheap, 13th gen is the final option to max that out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"initially i meant z690, since from what ive heard is not gonna be much change between 690 or 790 in terms of performance, and 13th gen is fully compatible with 690.

but yeah gotta wait for the benchmarks, hopefully we will see some comparatives with ddr4 and ddr5.",thank you!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what 2k games do you play?,mafia?,gta4?,if you meant qhd or 1440p: no bottleneck for gaming at that resolution.,it ainâ€™t the fastest chip for competitive games but itâ€™ll do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"despite the fact that 1440p is not 2k, no, you won't see a bottleneck from your cpu.","at higher resolutions, the gpu starts to become the bottleneck, so even if you buy an 11700k, it won't make that big of a difference for the money you'll spend on it.","to conclude, you are good to go with your specs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hi mate!,"link is down, recently i got a ""new"" vidcard for an old computer my son uses, it's a rx580 and apparently i need the bios 0042 in order to boot the system, can you upload the files again?","thanks so much if you could, in advance c:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"what exactly are you using to view the temperature, or where exactly are you expecting to find it?",have you installed a modern program like hwinfo64?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
previously i could use task manager to view my cpu temperature under the processes tab.,"i also use speccy as that is familiar to me, but same issue.","iâ€™ve just downloaded hwinfo64 and i am able to see the temperature now, thank you for your suggestion!",i was getting worried the cooler wasnâ€™t doing enough for the cpu under heavy loads.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what could realistically damage electronic parts over years is heat cycling (going back and forth between hot and cold).,"this can cause material fatigue, especially at points where two different elements are joined together (every material stretches differently) so those spots are under particularly high stress.",but again this stuff is only something to worry about in the long long term.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

they can run for years at 90 c without issue.,it's really only when you go above 100 c that it gets risky and they throttle down to reduce temps when they hit that point.,"it's actually pretty hard to kill a cpu with temps alone

case in point: i had an old computer with a 3770 that was running at 90c when /idle/ because of a poor cpu mount and i was broke and busy to bother fixing it, it was slow as hell because it was constantly throttling at the first sign of load but it never died",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you got award of they day for most stupendous question.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, this happens on my 12600k all the time while playing civ 6.

temperature monitor graphs show 78c max, while core temp reports even 99c max, its like not even for a millisecond if it doesn't register in afterburner.","occt large ffts max after 30 mins is 84c, small ffts hits tjmax sure but no games do.",i also bumped it up to 5.1 ghz pcore and cache now that summer is over and its only got a 140mm rad and inside a media cabinet with exhasut fans.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, sudden thermal expansion always has an effect on all materials that shortens lifespan.",itâ€™s doubtful that youâ€™d notice any effect before the software and security requirements dictate an upgrade.,the question is how many times can you do it before it fails.,that answer depends on a complex set of variables that include humidity and pressure.,iâ€™d expect though that anything intel sells will have at least  5 year operational average at those extremes.,"iâ€™d guess that this average has fallen over the years and used to be close to a 10 years, older stuff for 20+ years.",things made in the 80â€™s will still work today.,intel has shown that theyâ€™ll sacrifice future productivity to compete in the present market.,"and since all new cpu iterations require a new motherboard they can shorten the life-term average for their products and get away with it, as most people switch out their computer after 3-4 years now due to software updates and processing power requirements for new software.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"donâ€™t worry about it

chips are pretty resilient nowadays, only worry about temps if you see it start to thermal throttle

why the hell is your pl1 and pl2 set to 4095?,those values are supposed to set your turbo boost headroom depending on the cooling capacity of your laptop.,"set them to sane values, like 15 w pl1, and pl2 depending on the package power when boosting to max turbo.","also, have you actually tested whether the undervolt is stable at -150 mv offset?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

depends on who's on top.,"5600x launched at 299 and stayed there until the 12400 was out, then amd launched the sub-200 5600.

if intel is on top, amd will drop prices.","if amd is on top, intel will launch a few good budget products (ex 12100f, 12400f)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

please do not get 11th gen for a new build.,"people can be enthusiastic about what they have, but that can lead to bad advice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no don't listen to him.,11900k is a terrible processor and slower than 12600k.,just go directly to 13600k or 13900k if you can afford it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"my understanding is that there is a small button on the back io port area, usually near the usb ports.",should be called out as a motherboard feature.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you download the manual online you can see whether it has a bios flashback button.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok thank you.,whatâ€™s the point in the z790s are they just more efficient at running the 13th gen?,from the videos and things iâ€™ve watched people are saying the z790s lack features as itâ€™s early days for them so i thought supporting 14th gen would be a big reason to get them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok iâ€™ll keep that in mind thank you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've been looking at z790 mbs and they list ddr5 transfer rates.,the really expensive boards list higher rates.,will a board rated at 7000mhz be able to go higher?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i got the msi pro z690-a wifi, i think itâ€™s decent.",the bios seems pretty easy to use the only thing iâ€™d suggest is maybe opt for a z690 with ddr5 support but iâ€™ve not looked into wether or not ddr5 is worth it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in terms of cooling as well i have 3 fans at the front 1 at the back and 1 on top with a h100x water cooler for the cpu.,nothing goes over 35c while in use other than the cpu which hits 39c.,it all sits at around 28-30c in standby and i havenâ€™t adjusted the fan speed yet either.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they are not.,"i have an 11900k and 12900k, the 12900k is more than 25% faster in games",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ok thanks!,iâ€™ll keep my eyes peeled for info on them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they won't be particularly better at running the 13th gen compared to z690 boards.,"they'll have native 13th gen support, so you won't need to ensure you buy a motherboard with bios flashback (although so many of the z690 boards have bios flashback that this really means nothing), and that's maybe a benefit but a tiny one really.","they'll have additional pcie 4 lanes, and slightly improved ddr5 layouts for better data rates.","all in all though, i would recommend going for a z690 board with a 13th gen cpu if you only want to use this for gaming, as you have no real need for those additional lanes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
z790 is newer.,thatâ€™s usually a good enough reason to get it.,"but it also seems like prices are being jacked up, so unless thereâ€™s a good reason to pay moreâ€¦ why pay more!","from a technical perspective, basically chipset pcie 4.0 lanes have increased, and pcie 3.0 lanes decreased.","however the interconnect between the chipset and cpu remains the same, so the ultimate usefulness of this extra â€œbottleneckedâ€ bandwidth is questionable.",did most people feel that z690 boards were lacking in features or capabilities?,"perhaps in useful expansion slots, but that doesnâ€™t seem to have been addressed with z790.","thereâ€™s not more lanes, theyâ€™re just faster.",iâ€™m waiting for reviews to see if there are any meaningful improvements to things like memory trace layouts.,"many premium z790 boards, like the z790 hero, seem unchanged from the z690 version.","certainly comparing photos in the vrm and memory sections show no differences in components or placement, so exactly where is any motherboard-based improvement coming from?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1) it provides drop-in compatibility without need to update bios.,2) people like shiny new things and mainboard companies love selling them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think i'm leaning towards the meshify 2. now i'm deciding between compact or regular ðÿ˜…,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
he was talking about the 12600k though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sure if you compare it to 12900k, but the price difference is more than twice for 25% faster.","if you feel that is worth it, then sure go!","i don't think i will notice the difference, nor do i care if it is.",i doubt it it has significant impact on my overall experience and i'd rather save $400-500 myself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is very good.,"but think about the igpu when troubleshooting something, it could help.",for example if the pcie slot is busted then no way for you to test.,i would buy 13700k when it comes out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for explaining everything ðÿ˜š my only other question is are z690 boards also capable of overclocking 13th gen too or is that exclusive to the z790,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did they improve thr support for higher frequency ram?,i remember people were having stability issues with 6000+ ram,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok thanks!,i also saw many of the boards looking the same to their z690 counterparts too and iâ€™m not wanting to pay an extra â£100 for what is essentially  the same thing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i saw that a few times, i nearly got it i just thought the z3 looked cooler but i was fooled by its good looks it guess lol.",it seems like a good tower iâ€™m sure the z3 is if i go full water cooler mode on it but iâ€™ll think about that in the future.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™ve rebuilt in the corsair icue 4000x and itâ€™s awesome.,better airflow better cable management and the fans it comes with are great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 12600k is 20% faster in games, and something like 10% faster at stuff like cinebench",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok thank you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'd like to answer in a general manner.,motherboards with only z series chipset allow overclocking when it comes to intel platform.,and cpus with the k suffix have unlocked base clock multiplier(which means overclocking the cpu is supported) .,"so if z690 supports a 13th gen, then you should have no problem with overclocking 13th gen assuming it is a k series spu.","so in short overclocking support isn't determined by which gen they belong to, rather which tier of chipset it is.","if older gen motherboard supports newer gen cpu, it will allow you to overclocking with no problem whatsoever:)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not according to reviews, [an example from capframex](https://cms.capframex.com/api/assets/capframex-com/e73f9caa-3da5-41e6-b938-2508491e7123/grafik.png).",most games have the 11900k and 12600k on par with each other.,some games do better on the 11900k while others do better on the 12600k but on average they're the same.,i can't believe you're basically suggesting there's only a 5% difference between the 12600k & 12900k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
brilliant!,"thank you, you explained it perfectly.",iâ€™m planning on the i7-13700kf so i should be good for overclocking,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have u considered a 13600k?,its has similar multicore performance to the 12700k and has a better value for the performance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
win10 has been out for 7 years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they are still available from the microsoft update catalog,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and windows 8.1 is still supported till 12 of january.... really, why even removed it?","its not taking 100 terabytes, neither draining the bandwidth.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what's your point?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the windows updates are, but not the hardware drivers itself.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they likely only wanted to do one cleanup

often win10 drivers still work on win8.1, and the old drivers are likely untested",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so long as your case, cooler, and motherboard vrm can handle it, all intel cpus should really have their power limits removed - or at least adjusted to something appropriate.","i donâ€™t really get the motivation of differentiating cpu models by core count, frequency, and then artificial power limits on top of that.","for the amount they charge for the 12700 or 12900, the 65w pl2 is almost criminal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it won't affect gaming though.,most games at least.,"but sure, for multicore taks it is an improvement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1st thing i did with my 11400f was unlock the power limits.,get a stable all core clock of 4.3ghz with and arctic esports duo.,rarely goes over 75c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i spent some time googling today, but have yet to find any sort of ""remove power limits for dummies"" guide.","according to throttlestop, my 11400 never draws more than 65w under load, but i don't know how to go about changing it within the program (knowing i don't have options in my bios)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you try activate smart load line calibration?,in my asus board with the option of unlock power (ape) is the option for smart load line.,with  smart load line actã­vate the temps are go down and consume less with the same power increase.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yep.,the stock cooler doesnâ€™t allow me to go much further.,i canâ€¦ but then temperatures rise to 90+ celsiusâ€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you using throttle stop?,i'm looking for the proper settings for the 11400 using the software.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
should have power limits unlocked by default.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whatâ€™s your system?,"certain prebuilts and especially laptops or small format systems may not make it easy, or even impossible, to remove the limits.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bios option on enthusiast boards.,if oem you might need to run intels  xtu and hope the system doesn't lock the power limits.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't know if msi have the option of smart load line but asus yes.,this option allow to unlock all the power but consume less and have less heat and temps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
idk what is that.,i have active in bios ape (asus performance enhanced) and smart load line calibration (last one is for less consume power and less temps when enable unlock power),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's an 8940 xps with an 11400 and a 1660 super.,i installed an aftermarket cpu fan and 2 additional case fans.,cpu temp never breaks 60c under load rendering video in premiere pro or handbrake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
xtu is not available for the 11400,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can run xtu on any intel processor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

do you have another gpu connected?,the bios may be preferring a dedicated gpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
think the last fix i heard for this was clearing cmos.,how old is the system?,do you know what the bios version is?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is quite odd.,the igpu should have no problem working in the bios.,any chance your monitor has a displayport you can try?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are there other video outputs like displayport?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
had this problem also when enabled 'csm'.,you need to enable uefi.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in windows, go to system -> recover -> advanced startup and it should load the windows recovery menu which should allow you to tell it to boot to uefi bios.",that might allow you to get into bios even if you can't see the splash screen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i do not.,there are no pcie devices installed.,thanks though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for replying.,"it's brand new, i've cleared cmos several times, and updated the bios to the latest (when i had a discrete gpu installed).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the motherboard has displayport but i'm connecting to a tv that only has hdmi.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the motherboard has displayport but i'm connecting to a tv that only has hdmi.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
interesting!,thanks for that.,is there any way to do that without being able to see the bios?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you cleared cmos since having the dgpu installed?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it might be that the tv canâ€™t display the resolution that the bios uses.,i would try hooking the pc to a proper monitor and see if it displays properly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think that tv is the issue, it doesn't support the lower resolution that is in the bios.",do you have a monitor you can use?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,i've tried installing a 12700k in there as well and it has the same issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i tried a monitor which also didn't work over hdmi.,"i can move the pc to a monitor for displayport temporarily, but the problem is that the users of the tv will need to be able to get to the boot device select menu on a regular basis so they can choose whether to boot into windows for game pass or linux for emulation gaming.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's very strange, if the displayport monitor doesn't work then there's an issue with the motherboard display outputs.","there is a setting within some bios to enable ""full hd uefi"" which may provide better compatibility with tvs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks, i'll take a look for that.",cheers!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
update your bios.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2 sticks i assume?,you can try playing with the various voltages that influence ddr5 stability.,first thing i would try is just bumping the memory voltages up (vdd/vddq).,you can safely go to 1.4v as kits come with that as the default.,also try moving the cpu sa voltage up/down within a range of 0.95v to around 1.3v.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i don't think the imc can handle that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"no, it does not.",itâ€™s about one generation too old for that.,"before igpus, motherboards use to integrate simple video chips designed for that purpose.",particularly on servers and inexpensive prebuilt systems.,"intel even made those chips, but so did ati and others.","so, you would have to know what the motherboard is to figure out more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nope.,"if you have integrated graphics, it's because the chipset on your motherboard has integrated graphics.",(usually intel g series or one of nvidia's nforce ones),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,"you need to check the motherboard, not the cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you probably got intel gma graphics, which is integrated into the motherboard 

many 775 boards had some kind of igpu (gma 3100, gma 4100 etc)

they are obsolete for anything other than the most basic office use",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the overall multicore performance of the two cpus is going to be very similar, but getting there in different ways.","youâ€™re losing 2 performance cores, and gaining 4 efficiency cores.","for a gamer or average user, this is probably a moot point.","personally, between those two i would go for the 13600k/f.","youâ€™re getting real raptor lake silicon, improved imc and efficiency, and bigger cache.",just like i would go for the 13700k over the 12900k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"13600kf - 6p+8e = 20threads
12700kf - 8p+4e = 20threads



13600kf will be better due to higher clocks, bigger cache, higher memory speeds and better e cores.",you may try searching for the leaked single thread and multi thread performance.,there are leaked game benchmarks too comparing 13600k to 12600k with 2% to 11.5% faster on average framerate but the best increase are minimum fps at 10% to 14.13% increase,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's a good question, i have the same question and decision but also throwing the 13700k and 12900k in, it's a question we won't know the answer to until reviews are out.","for me, right now i can get 12700k at $350 at microcenter.",the 12900k is $499 right now as well.,that 12900k won't sell at that price after 13th gen launches.,"i have no idea how this is going to unravel, but i can guess :

12700k $300-$350, 12900k $399 vs 13600k $339 and 13700k $459

i think at the more enthusiast-oriented sites (the ones that don't use jedec timings), we'll find that raptor lake can easily do ddr5-7200+ and with that ability along with - its larger l2 cache, + higher mhz, + higher ring bus speed, + higher e-core speed, + lower core-core latency, + reworked prefetcher, it may well blow the doors off 12th gen.  

so as appealing as gen 12 looks right now, that might be an illusion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13600kf is basically a better 12700kf.,so 13th gen for sure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"that will be one hell of an upgrade then, whatever you end up choosing :) if i may, just go for a cpu with an integrated graphics.","it won't add much more to the budget if you consider how much you are already spending, and you will have a backup to use your pc in case your gpu fails or you need to take it away for whatever reason.",i have a 10700f and i definitely needed the igpu sometimes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you could probably use that card for years still.,i upgraded from a 2060 super...well upgraded but waiting on a 3070ti.,the 2060 was still doing an awesome job on all games i've played and vr.,"in other words, i agree, get that cpu.",your gpu is good for the future still.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the amd 7000-series launch laid bare how gaming does not really scale beyond 6 cores, in fact even the budget 4-core 12100 beats older 6 or more core cpus.","in fact, in many cases the new 7600x beat the 8-core versions because it could maintain higher single core performance due to less heat.","it is likely that in the future this will change, but by then the current cpus will be obsolete anyway.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yes i know that it will be a huge upgrade, i am just considering what would push it a little more in the future, since as you can see i do not upgrade very often :d for example if i had a i7 4790k instead of a i5 4690k that i have, would i be able to push it a little more who knows.",thats why i am not really sure if i should go for i7 or i5 which is 1 gen newer.,"as for the versions with integrated graphics it depends on the prices in my country, on some models it is 50+ euros which i believe is not worth, but i will check it out for sure, thanks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

any ideas here?,the issue is 100% reproducibly caused by simultaneous keyboard inputs.,if i hold down two or more keyboard keys at once it happens every 500ms (such as moving forward and holding shift to run.,"or holding down w and s to strafe)

"ok update (haven't tried that yet tho)

basically my frametime graphs there is a latency spike consistently every 500ms on the graph.",i know its not being caused by the monitoring software iself because the stutter is the reason i installed it in the first place.,this is happening on a clean windows11 and i even tried both of my nvme drives separately -- same exact problem no matter what i do.,it's obviously being caused by some background process that's updating itself every 500ms and i can't figure it out.,if i cap my fps at 90 it goes away but only because the frametime spike is shorter duration.,"if i cap at 120fps the spike is noticable and if i uncap my fps, the spike becomes insane and hits something like 300ms frametime which obviously totally destroys playability",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thoroughly depends what you plan on doing with it.,programming?,games?,server?,"if games, what resolution and framerate target?",do you care about ray tracing?,you cant ask such a broad question and expect to get a useful answer that will apply to you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for gaming, cpu performance is largely a checkmark, whereas gpu is more of a sliding scale.",is your cpu strong enough?,6 cores minimum for today's gaming i would say is required.,"i7 8700k / i5 10400f / 'zen 5 3600x is where i would draw that minimum cpu line, without compromising too much performance.",i wouldn't buy any of those today (better options for same price) but those can get you by for now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on which you plan to upgrade first.,"it's easier to swap in a new gpu 

a better cpu will reduce stuttering and improve your lowest frame rates, but a better gpu will improve your average and maximum fps more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok thank you guys for your answers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
usually most games are gpu bound and will profit the most from a stronger gpu.,"for example, you're much better off with say an old i7-8700 cpu with a relatively recent rtx 3070 than a recent 12900k cpu with an old gtx 1060.

this has some limits on the lower end of the cpu spectrum.","for example, anything with 6 threads or lower ( i5-8600k and lower ) will struggle with a lot of modern games ( you'll have a lot of stuttering ).","so then you're better off upgrading the cpu ( preferably to something with at least 12+ threads, or 8 threads if you have a very low budget ) before upgrading the gpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
stronger cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
any modern 6 core cpu is fine.,spend rest on gpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think majority of users will benefit more from a really strong cpu and a weaker gpu.,what are you using it for?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it actually depends on the resolution you're playing at.,"at 1080p the cpu is more important, so go for a lower end card.","at 2k or above, the gpu starts to become more important.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"stronger gpu,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gaming,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's not necessarily what resolution he's playing at but what framerate he's targeting.,people just say resolution because that usually implies a lower framerate.,always best to ask what target framerate is.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok thank you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah like what games?,league?,dota?,cs?,valorant?,cod?,apex?,pubg?,if those games then get a better cpu.,stray?,god of war?,assassin's creed?,dark souls?,get a better gpu.,"but most importantly if you play at 1080p or 1440p, the better cpu will benefit you more often than having a better gpu.",although you still need a decent gpu and cpu for both cases anyways.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
okay thank  you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s a weird design choice on the taichi.,"i fully expect many people to not pay enough attention to which m.2 theyâ€™re installing into, assume that #1 is the way to goâ€¦ resulting not only in their gpu dropping to x8, but the cpuâ€™s dedicated 4x 4.0 lanes also going to waste, since theyâ€™re no longer physically usable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lack of bios flashback on the taichi (and a few other z790 boards i've seen) is just due to it being an end of cycle platform.,"it ships out of the box compatible with all existing 12th and 13th generation cpus, including the 13900ks.","it's unlikely intel will release any subsequent variants which need an update to boot, and even es/qs or regional models like 13490f will still boot but just show an unidentified intel cpu until the cpuid strings are added.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you seem to know well on that subject.,what would be your z690 board recommendation for a 13900k?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m staying with z690 especially since intel will change the socket after raptor lake which is ridiculous but hey they stuck with lga 1700 for a few years soâ€¦..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and there's only like 3 itx options,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, very strange.","i imagine it's just because they physically ran out of room (the z790 pch has a fairly large package footprint, even if the die itself is small), but you're spot on with the user error aspect.",the dedicated gen4x4 is 100% going to waste if someone does decide to divert the second slot's gen5 lanes to a single fast gen5x4 m.2.,"you'd still have three chipset m.2 slots, but it seems entirely unnecessary.","worse still, it's also compounded by the additional waste of the ""last"" four gen5 lanes which can't switched away from the second slot, due to how alder/raptor lake refuse to bifurcate x8/x4/x4 properly.","in a theoretically ideal setup, this board could support five drives: 1x native gen4x4, 2x gen5x4 via bifurcation and 3x gen4x4 via the chipset.",that would have been pretty cool.,"as it exists, though, it's kind of a wonky design.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

oh they are?,mmmm maybe waiting for next gen is best for me then if thats the case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i know everyone was originally expecting raptor lake to upgrade the 4x 4.0 lanes to 5.0, but when that didnâ€™t happenâ€¦ why couldnâ€™t they at least implement x8/x4/x4 bifurcation?","this is one case where intel took a lead (getting pcie 5.0 out first) but when given the chance, did not improve things to make it competitive with amdâ€™s new implementation - with up to 24 lanes of 5.0, which seems to be configurable as x16/x4/x4 or x8/x8/x4/x4.","the 5.0 ssd support situation on adl/rpl is sketchy, and only really â€œsafeâ€ until both 5.0 ssds and gpus are out.","and, at least for the latter, that doesnâ€™t seem to be happening just yet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that's a big grey area there.,i doubt intel would offer refunds just due to drivers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"aren't you ""scared"" of the ""weird"" performance because of the drivers?",i thought of buying one too but the drivers kinda scare me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i mean having the opportunity to beta test dgpu hardware from intel that hasn't been seen on a consumer level in ages from them, and may possibly never be seen again if this launch doesn't go smoothly or the drivers can't be remedied would be worth it imho for the asking price.",if they do decide to axe it (which i don't see happening with the amount of money they have invested into arc) you then own a collectors item and just something really cool to hold on to.,i've got the utmost confidence the issues they are facing in most titles will be fixed with driver updates within the one year mark though.,"the card is already phenomenal for budget workstation style tasks and has a better encoder for streaming and general video encoding than both nvenc / amf, those reasons alone make it worthwhile.",though that is a perspective that obviously will change per person based on use case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

for context, the cut down 10gb rx 6700 is currently available sub â£350 (6700 sits between the 3060 and 3060ti) or if you're wanting better rt support and all the other goodies you can get from nvidia, 3060s are available at â£370 now.","respectfully, buying a a770 in the hope that it will match the 3060ti in a couple of months is delusional, what you're buying here is vega mk2.","that really hurts to say because the performance that this card has in stuff like topaz is rediculous, but, stability is too wack and performance is all over the place.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well i wish you good luck.,i remember being an early adopter of first gen zen.,wasnt the best decision ive made.,the following gen with zen 2 was much better and i barely had any issues.,"even if you want to support intel here, id heavily suggest waiting and see when people like gamersnexus say the drivers are somewhat stable because right now theyre not.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'd delay your purchase for a couple of months at least then.,"it does sound like you're underestimating severely the problems with failing, freezing and crashing that currently plagues this product.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
arcâ€™s performance in games where it *isnâ€™t* held back by crippling driver issues is quite competitive for a first-gen product â€” the hardware theyâ€™re shipping absolutely has good performance potential.,"whether theyâ€™re actually able to fix the software side to unlock that potential more consistently, and not just in certain ideal edge cases, remains to be seen.",but the issues do seem to lie much more in software.,very reminiscent of where amd used to be.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
psssst: you're not wrong.,zen has never been really ready.,the agesa code is still a terrible mess.,especially when running an 2700x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the driver/performance issues probably won't be ironed out this generation if we're being honest.,this is going to be a multi generational effort to fix.,kind of like rdna 1's issues and how rdna 2 still had driver problems.,not trying to rain intel's parade and i am confident they can overcome this challenge.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

32gb?,iâ€™d definitely do ddr5.,i own 128gb ddr4 so i am staying with that as 128gb would cost $800-1000 or so iâ€™d rather spend on a new meteor lake 14900k or something later when the price of ddr5 is also much lower.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if you can get ddr5 6800 or 7000+, then thats where you see gains.",this is just my own personal experience and people from overclock forum.,"and you do need 2 dimm slot ddr5 motherboard such as unify x.

in short, wait for 13th gen and z790.","there will be good deals on black friday, so just wait a little bit.",go with the best deals you can get.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you have the option and money isn't an issue go with ddr 5 but its really not essential at the minute and you probably won't notice any difference between the two,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ddr5 and i would not get lower than 5600mhz period, with the lowest latency  memory your board can manage in xmp profile, gear one.","imho that should be the minimum for the platform, higher is better and new revised jedec for ddr5 speeds.","most high end z690 boards accept the new 13th gen (when launched) via a simple bios upgrade (mines ready to go, asus rog strix z690 g gaming) many more will eventually be supported too.",good luck and cheers!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"personally i have a z690 (12700k) and 32gb 5600 ddr5, its good enough for me without being too slow like ddr4 or too expensive like the 6400 ddr5, besides ram can always be overclocked (xmp settings).",i will probably upgrade to another 32 for a total of 64gb of the same sticks once the prices of ram drop more.,its dropped around $30 since i got it in late july.,i suspect ddr5 sets around this speed will be around $100 by early next year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ddr5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

how much was your 12900k and how much 13900k preorder costs for you?,"if it's $200 difference then probably 13900k not worth it, but you can check 13700k, it will be just as powerful as 12900ks (has the same frequency and core configuration) and could be cheaper.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"got the i9-12900k for about $500 the new one is about $700ish pre ordered, so iâ€™ll deff keep an eye out , had to buy a new motherboard due to the socket so knowing the 13th gen is 1700 socket is cool",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13700k will be both cheaper and faster than the 12900k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it doesn't make sense to get a 12900k right now unless it's a decent amount cheaper than what the 13700k will cost when it comes out in a week and a half.,the 13700k is just going to be faster across the board.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

looked up the error code and the link below tells you about it.,https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000088393/graphics.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"most user applications including games doesn't scale well into multicore, anything beyond 6 or 8 cores is a waste for them.","if you do happen to use an application that can scale indefinetly with core count, you will gain more performance from the 16 e cores, rather than 4 additional p cores.",this is because 16e uses similar die budget to 4p cores but yields more multicore performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"because once you're using workloads that scale with >8 cores, it becomes more space efficient to use the smaller e cores to boost performance.","in other words, there is no benefit to using more p cores.","it wouldn't help single core performance, and it wouldn't help multi core performance.",">so i need to ask why it actually matters to choose intel this time,and why not amd

both are good options right now, really.","unless you're doing productivity workloads, nobody really needs the i9 or r9 parts, though.",they are a bit overkill and bad value for gaming and normal tasks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would just wait for the benchmarks in a few weeks time and make a decision after that.,don't forget that the i9 also has 16 efficiã«ncy cores.,those can be compared to skylake cores ( 6th gen core achitecture ).,so what you have with the i9 are 8 raptor lake cores and 16 skylake cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if intel used 16 p-cores the chips would be too large, expensive and power hungry (at full tilt).",the last issue can be dealt with by reducing speed/frequency when doing all-core (multithread) work.,that is what amd does.,"however, this obviously doesnt solve the first two issues.",amds cores are smaller and amd divides them into chiplets which reduces cost so amd can afford to put 16 full cores.,the issues amd has to deal with are heat concentration (cause cores are small) and power.,"by using e-cores, intel can make the chips smaller and less expensive and still get multithread performance as long as they put in a lot of e-cores.",its a smart solution given intel tech/arch's weaknesses and strengths.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think someone said that the e-cores are about as powerful as a 9700k, but i could be completely dead wrong.","if that's true, then that's quite insane considering i was on a 6700k like a year ago.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gaming doesn't need more then 6-8. that's why.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for now amd reached parity with intel in games but in application they are ahead in most of them.,i expect intel to widen the gap in terms of games and also catch up a little more in applications.,what also should you build?,intel will change mainboardâ€˜s after i-13000 series and that means you cannot upgrade to another cpu from i-14000 series and will be stuck with what you have for years.,"amd may not have the performance crown after i-13000 release but am5-platform(mainboard) will enable you to update your cpu to zen4+, zen4 x3d, zen5 and possibly more.",as third option you wait out intelâ€˜s i-14000 in 2023 to get a solid ground like amdâ€˜s am5 platform.,the choice is yours to make.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"because to be competitive with amd, intel have 2 options

using 16p cores on a massive and expensive monolithic die, with insane power consumption

using only 8p cores, and using an e core which has much better perf/w than the p core (because it cant clock much past 4.2ghz\~) and much better perf/area (its tiny with like 70% of the ipc of p cores)

e cores allow intel to stay competitive

modern games currently dont scale past 8 threads, so only 8p cores works for now (if a game ever needs more than 16 threads, it it suffer from the e cores, but it will probably wont happen soon),

productivity apps can utilize both 8p + 16e cores if optimized correctly (like making sure editor view stays on p cores)

&#x200b;

is 16 p cores better?","in performance yes, the 5950x in mt clocks at around 4ghz only and is matching a much higher clocked 12900k (p core at 4,9ghz, e at 3.9 i think)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well reason to go choose intel now will be price.,cheaper platform and cheaper cpus than am5 + zen 4 while offering similar performance.,"for example two performance-equal builds:

i5 13600k, msi pro b660m-a ddr4, 32gb ddr4 3600 cl16
$330 + $130 + $130 = total $590

ryzen 7700x, asrock x670e lightning, 32gb ddr5 5200
$400 + $260 + $150 = total $810",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you use vms, then go amd.",the big.little setup intel is using is a pain with multiple virtual machines running.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the reason is the size: the performance cores are huge, between 3 to 4 times the size of an efficient core.",even amd produces their 16 cores using two chips.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14th gen might have more than 8 p-cores for the top model.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for gaming you don't need more than 6 or 8 big cores.,they simply won't be used.,same for multiple other consumer applications.,"having the extra e cores take any extra load away from the big cores (any background task, like recording, discord, google tabs, etc) makes more sense, as it lets the p core only compute the game, and games run on mainly 4 cores, maybe 6 for newer stuff (and in some cases 8, can't think of any though).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you're a gamer you won't see any benefit from more than 8 cores anyway, that's not likely to change anytime soon.","but on the other hand, the e cores on the 13900k don't help gaming either, some people even disable them in the bios to get better gaming performance, in which case you're stuck with an 8 core cpu for both gaming and other tasks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is my overly long and non-expert opinion.,ecores are kind of a gimmick.,"8 pcores are enough for almost every if not every modern game, and most tasks in general.",and it would cost more money to add in more pcores which is kind of pointless since most tasks can't scale that well.,but then they look awful compared to ryzen and their multi-core parts and in tasks that benefit from multi-core.,this is where the ecores come in.,instead of adding a few more performance cores like the ryzen they add an ecore because they're cheaper.,it's an easy way for intel to shave off every single possible dollar of cost while still doing their best to maintain the appearance of the best cpu.,and i know what you're thinking.,this may not be a gimmick.,this is just a dollar saving measure.,that kind of makes sense since most power-hungry tasks cannot utilize the ecores properly.,"the problem is where all these ecores are on chips like the 13900k, which while it's fantastic for gaming, is kind of a multi-core professional workload-ish cpu.",assuming it's a fight against the 7950x and other chips with that kind of core count type deal.,it really should shine in the workspace.,i mean if you only need a handful of pcores for gaming then it makes no sense to get a 13900k.,if you need a working computer with humongous computational power then the ecores are waste and if you're an enthusiast and spending all this money just to enjoy it.,you would think you would be getting maybe not the best bang for buck but the absolute highest horsepower.,"next someone is going to say ""what about when you're gaming and you have background tasks?""",well first quit that.,you're in control of your computer.,but two instead of a six 6pcore 12 thread cpu (12600) and six pcore and 4ecore 16thread (12600k) you would jump to a 8pcore 16thread cpu.,which is still 16thread but 8pcores when you need it and not some silly background cores.,just extra cores that can be used at background cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it does promise a nice speed-up for many applications in data science.,"for example, it can almost [double flops in n-body simulation](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341347623_optimization_of_the_n-body_simulation_on_intel's_architectures_based_on_avx-512_instruction_set).","deep learning models (onednn) and software like numpy can also use it, but i am unable to find any meaningful benchmarks.",i have not yet found any game engines that really utilize avx 512. but if your game has some heavily vectorizable gameplay code (n-body simulation in a game?,"), avx 512 could be useful.",i would imagine it could also be useful in the physics engine.,so it is useful for only specific use cases.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"avx512 doubles the number and size of registers, adds mask registers which let you operate on parts of a vector, and adds new instructions for operating on different types data that were difficult or inefficient on previous avx versions.","the new mask registers also make things that were possible but very complex a lot easier to implement, so hopefully we will see more software adopting avx.","in the long term it will become a standard part of all programs, similar to avx 2. for now it's mostly used for video encoding, emulation and 3d rendering as well as scientific/engineering applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

these performance gains are heavily influenced by the fact that the market/architectures are heavily fragmented in which avx-512 instruction sets they employ.,"there is no current standard for consumer chips for avx-512, so it's just a botch job right now.","honestly, this tech isn't ready for consumer market at all, and probably won't be for a long, long time, if ever.","even though it has real benefits, the actual current implementations (yes, even zen 4) and market make it not worth it -- couple that with the fact that almost nobody outside of people that care about \~55 fps ps3 emulation (i.e.",not ideal) are the majority of people clamoring for this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"another use case for avx-512 would be video encoding, think of hevc/h265/x265 encoding.",i'm not sure whether avc/h264/x264 does benefit from avx-512 but i do know for a fact they benefit from avx2.,"anyway as the post said above, it's a niche use case scenario instruction set, if not a niche within a niche since these days everyone (youtube & netflix) have their eyes set on av1, not hevc/h265.","i for one, wouldn't invest in a cpu based on avx-512 being supported \*unless\* i would be interested in heavy video encoding... or... ps3 emulation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it was supposed to have been this generation with zen 4 and alder lake both supporting it.,however intel ran into technical problems and disabled it just before launch.,it's really annoying.,"i'm sticking with avx2 now in my software for compatibility, but for a lot of things avx512 would be both easier to implement and faster.",hopefully intel gets things sorted out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you might have to go with a custom wc loop.,"the noctua nh-d15 is one of the best air coolers, but may not fit your case.","however, as previously mentioned, the system shouldnâ€™t crash.","the cpu will simply throttle itself and you lose a bit of performance, but the game will still run.",sounds like something else is causing the instability.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if the radiator warms up then there is nothing wrong.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
afaik multicore enhancement makes the all core boost frequency the same as the single core and usually applies stupid amounts of voltage to do so - this will definitely not be helping.,it was really on by default?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bad mount.,did you use the right stand-off size?,reset bios to optimized defaults and only use xmp.,this board is not enough for overclocking a 11900k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yep it's on by default, then constantly lowers the clocks 24/7 because it gets too hot then the pc gets sluggish because it slams my clock speeds below the base clock so i had to disable the auto frequency change when it gets hot so it stays at whatever it's set to, otherwise it gets 100c and slams my speed on top of it making it pointless lol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, and the cooler is mounted firmly, this happened on my old air cooler too, the aio is doing literally the same temps.","bios is set to default, if i let it do default clocks, it sets to 5.1ghz or so and 1.4v on the core which immediately overheats.",so i have to drop down the clock and voltage to keep it usable for light gaming and web browsing otherwise it will just shut off from hitting it's thermal limit.,"can't use xmp at all, it won't post if i touch mem freq, xmp has one profile and it fails to post, if i change the speed up or down from stock it will refuse to post.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i'm using arctic mx-4 thermal paste, after removing the heatsink the paste is spread across the entire ihs just very small bare spots on the corners.",i tried multiple times with reapplying the paste but there was no temperature difference.,"the case is clean, barely any cables visible.",all the cables are tucked away and tidy.,"i have 6 case fans, 3 at the front blowing air in, 3 in the back for exhaust.",there's a lot of airflow through it and the case air is pretty much the same as the room.,the room is cold.,"the heatsink is secured as tight as it lets me, i tried adjusting it to see if maybe it was over tightened but loosening didn't change temps nor did trying to tighten further.","my original thought was the same, it acts like the heatsink isn't attached.",both an air cooler and an aio do the exact same temps and immediately spoke in temps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's bizarre.,i had a mobo that was slightly thinner than your typical mobo and my heatsink wasn't making good contact to the cpu.,it was an asus branded mobo and i had to add rubber washers on the back end so that it would be tightly sealed.,after that it performed normal and there wasn't a drastic spike in temps.,it could very well be a bad cpu too maybe?,i don't know what else to try if you've done all that you said other than your hand at doing a delid and putting liquid metal in there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if the paste is not conducting you just have to worra about the pins.,"you could basically put non conducting paste all over the socket, damn i even think vaseline was working if i remember correctly.","runs a bit cooler, but you have like, shit in and around your socket",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's probably toast ðÿ˜¬,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
welcome to the club.,for the next time you learned an expensive lesson,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sorry but even of you straighten up the bent pins, the chances are it might not work or your system might be unstable.",by the way how did it come to that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is one of the reasons i wasn't thrilled with the switch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i once bend the pins on my asus board..then i returned it to the shop i bought it and they shipped it to asus for a repair where they swicth out the socket.,but it cost me 100 $ since i ruined the board my self.,so if the board was expensive then create a rma on asus site if its asus board.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
get something with a plastic tip that is skinny enough to fit in between the pins and start cleaning with that.,"if there's bent pins, dont go hard, and try to bend them back in place.","my current mobo had a pin bent backwards (along a few others bent a bit), and after 30-45 mins i bent them all back and it works very well.","if there's pins literally broken off, then go look up a chart of what they do and if they're needed.","a lot of the pins on these mobos don't carry any data, they may just be a ground pin, or do nothing really, and if that's the case you should be fine too",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how did you do this i have to know!,ðÿ¤£,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if they're only bent and there is literally that bit of thermal paste on it it's fixable at all.,just take a pair of tweezers and some isoprop alcohol and a soft brush or toothbrush and really carefully get rid of the paste.,after that very carefully use the tweezer to bend the pins back in direction.,no big deal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
use isoproblabla alcohol to clean of the termal paste and use the tip of a scharp knive to bend the pins back to the original place.,i have done this a couple of times for people and worked every time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what brand of mobo is that?,the cpu power socket placement is making me twitch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"f

too many fallen soldiers",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ignore the paste.,"i don't think that will cause issues, even though it's not pretty.","without any experience, i wouldn't try to fix the pins.",you'll just make it worse.,"there's a slim chance it'll still work with the cpu installed, as even bent down pins might still have enough contact to the cpu.",however you should also be aware that you might fry your cpu if you install it and try to get it to post.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fixing it will be cheaper then buying a new one.,just don't break them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
take it to a pc repair shop.,they might be able to repair it.,i had broke some of my mobo pins too and found someone that fixed it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is one of those problems that i will never understand.,like when i hear about people getting hit by trains.,donâ€™t want to get hit by a train?,then donâ€™t.,"some problems require no skill, brains, or effort to avoid, but still seem to happen all the time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, run a razor blade or credit card between the gaps to fix them, use steady pressure and be slow, very slow and careful",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it takes a special kind of a genius to bend socket pins.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
huh.,never thought about that.,watch repair is almost like mechanical surgery.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah same.,"i've only ever gotten pent pins on a board after ordering it second hand, it booted but coudnt handle dual channel ram so i returned it.","but i dont get how someone can do this on a board themselves, bending so many pins in the process, probably dropping it with the corner of the cpu hitting the socket",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no paste involved, but in my case i actually knackered several pins trying to re-fit the protective cover.","on socket 1366 the cover sat under the ilm, for 1151 it clips into the top.",of course i didn't realize they were different until after i tried the former on the latter.,"fortunately only 4 pins bent, and after some prodding and poking it posts and is stable, but the ram won't exceed 2800 mt/s",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
propably the cpu slips and drops the worst possible way while removing it from the socket?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,thatâ€™s not it works.,iâ€™m assuming he put paste on the cpu before it was in the socket then went to put it in and dropped in on the pins.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"slotting in the cpu is definitely the most stressful part of a build, if you fuck up, you could wreck the processor and the mobo at the same time.","just be careful, nice and slow.","quadruple check everything, and all should be good.","some people slot the cpu in before they put the mobo into the case, as you're gonna have better access/lighting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the pins are leaf springs.,"they're supposed to be very slightly bent when the cpu is in place, and straighten when not pressed.","thermal paste is viscous enough to prevent that, and the contact pad itself might be covered and thus insulated.","in short, any contaminants in the socket are hazardous, conductive or not.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"got a new aio, didn't build pc myself, bought a screwdriver kit, unscrewed the pump, saw paste, used tissue to clean it, removed chip coz it was all over the ihs, some paste on the ilm fell in, dunno how the pins bent tho, i'm broken af rn",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lga 1700 mb pins are too small for even that.,youâ€™re probably thinking of pga amd cpuâ€™s.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lmaoooooo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this is absolutely how it should be done, you mount the cpu before you do anything else with the board so you have the socket protected",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think ltt did a thing where they did that.,compound was made for that specific reason of course.,otherwise you are correct.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
damn dude im very sorry to hear that.,"i take back my laughing, that really sucks ðÿ˜”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

>in stress tests like prim 95 it goes even lower like x41-x42 (4200mhz).,"when stopped it goes back to x50-x52

that sounds like throttling.",check in xtu and see why the cpu clock is dropping under load.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe you should fix it with screws.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i had xtu installed but i can't use the multiplier, it is greyed out.","also, where exactly should i look in xtu to see the reason for throttling?","i'm almost sure it power related, i think.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it ain't yo butt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can plot the status of each throttling indicator.,they should all stay at false.,"if any of the indicators say throttling true, the clockspeed is being reduced for the reason indicated (power, temperature, vrms, etc).","if you think power, raise your power limits.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1. disable ring clock down bin.,this is what drops ring down to 36x when e-cores are out of sleep.,2. set cpu l2 voltage to manual 1.3v: this controls the voltage of the e-core l2 cluster which is the bottleneck for the ring clock with e-core enabled.,"manual works better than adaptive here 

3. set ring multiplier max to 40x

4. run an all-core workload like h265 or av1 encoding to test stability

5. increase or decrease ring multiplier max as needed",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hello, this is a bug/feature of the latest bios.","to unlock ring overclocking, disable ""cpu under voltage protection"" under bios\oc\advanced cpu configuration\cpu under voltage protection.",good luck and happy overclocking!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"is there a ""cache svid voltage"" option in bios ?",on my asus z690 board that option is available and i need to set fixed voltage like 1.15v or 1.2v in order to get the ring to run at the set freq of 4.2ghz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are the temps too high?,do you have a sufficient cooler?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'd suggest a repaste.,i'm also running a i9-9900k and when on idle the temperature sits around 25-45â° (depending on which season we got going) and when gaming it reaches around 60â°.,"depending on what kind of thermal compound you (or whoever built it) have used for the aio it is possible that it's just dried, so i'd go for that before starting to mess with the bios and either risking to mess up the system by changing the wrong settings or leaving performance on the table by underclocking",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"along the lines of what others have said, the chip will throttle itself before any damage is done.",only problem there is the performance degradation.,i had a workstation at work that slowly got slower over several months.,i finally checked the temp and it was stuck at 100c.,i can only imagine it was running like for months.,some new paste and everything was fine!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes when idle, the temps are around 45-50 celsius and while gaming/high load it reaches up to 85 which seems very hot.",i have a nzxt kraken x53 water cooler so i donâ€™t think thatâ€™s the issue,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
those temps are perfectly fine and seems very normal with your cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"your idle temps seem high, your â€œhigh loadâ€ of 85 is perfectly fine, however 85 for gaming might be high.","but nothing can be said without the context of your ambient conditions, case cooling, whether youâ€™re set up for silence or airflow, etc.","however these temps are almost certainly due entirely to your system coolingâ€™s performance, and not because of some misconfiguration of your cpu.","for reference, nothing is actually a problem until 100c, and even then itâ€™s more of an issue with throttled performance than any actual â€œproblemâ€.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s good then.,do you recommend i change anything in my bios?,or just leave everything the same.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes thats how i seen it when buying the parts.,last year it would of cost a hell of alot more to build and at the end of the day its still a high end build in my opinion.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes i was very happy with everything i was able to add , like all the fans and cooler etc compared to prices last year .",so i think price to performance is definitely there right now if not jumping on hype train.,i ordered the 011 evo in white and they sent me a black 011 standard case i believe.,"i couldn't wait to return so i went ahead and build it , to be fair i love it now lol.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

they where in that picture lol but have since been changed .,caught on when the pc sounded like a jet plane haha,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah, $300 in fans for this build lol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for high power gpus you *really* need to use dedicated power cables per plug.,the daisy chain cables like you are using will cause you nothing but trouble.,if your psu is modular then it should have come with some.,you can also buy single 8pin pcie cables.,"there are also ""pretty"" options for bundling them together so its not an eyesore, if that is what  you are worried about.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah but better than daisychaining,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're only being powered by one cable split for two connections.,they have single stranded cables without the splits on them.,i'd rather be properly powered than fashionably failing.,a lot of times the manufacturer will include one or two single stranded pcie power cables.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the two sets of fans where â£180 thats sl120 infinity fans then the cooler is the sl120 â£169 ( don't think they have made a infinity cooler yet)  i also bought a single infinity fan for â£30 but it didn't fit at the back lol.,what i love from all them fans and cooler fans i had barely any cables.,so in my mind was worth the money.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"idk, iâ€™m sure noctua fans are great.",seems like any good fdb fan is in the same ballpark.,iâ€™m currently using some old scythe fans that reviewed really well at martinâ€™s liquid labs and have a box of clearance thermalright fdb fans.,good fans donâ€™t have to be expensive.,that said i donâ€™t know who does quality fan testing anymore.,martinâ€™s liquid labs is still untouched in that regard.,and noctua never seems to underperform.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and what happens in that case?,performance is throttled or something more catastrophic?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah the actual color could maybe have been called ""putty""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

a single cable will pull 150w.,the pcie slot provides 75w.,"the card is limited to 225w, throttling perf on higher powered cards.",if the card somehow pulls more than that you're at risk for a damaged connector.,or a melted one that's on fire.,it's just not a wise thing to do unless you know for certain the card won't pull over 150w from its two 8pins combined.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"you should've got the ax410 (the regular, non-cnvi variant), the ax411 won't work with a 11th gen cpu.","the reason it doesn't work is that cnvi cards relies on hardware found inside the chipset of the machine, the hm570 normally used in conjunction with the i7-11800h isn't wi-fi 6e capable, thus it doesn't work with newer cnvi modules like the ax211 or ax411...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the thing that's throwing me off though is the current card i have is a cnvi2 module.,i thought if it supports one it would support the other?,"also, i didn't see anything on the ax410 card on the intel site.",i'm assuming that's the 6e non cnvi module?,i'm looking and it seems the only non-cnvio card is the ax210.,i'll order an ax210 and see if that works.,just so wierd that the ax201 is cnvio2 and when replaced with another of the same protocol it doesn't work,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"cnvi cards are ""dummy"" in a sense they only contain the rf transceiver part and the accompanying signal processor, everything else is contained in the pch (aka the chipset).","wi-fi 6e requires more substantial changes than just a new rf transceiver, since it can work on a whole new frequency band (6 ghz), so just replacing the cnvi module to a 6e capable (like the ax211 and ax411) isn't enough.","the non-cnvi version (ax410) will work fine once it gets released (or you can go with the ax210, which is already available and also 6e capable), since it's a standalone card containing everything it needs to work, not relying on any hardware from the pch...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for the further details.,that explains why  the device manager sees the network controller as missing.,depending on avaliablility i'm gonna grab at the ax210 or the killer ax1675.,both are pci for the interface so it should work.,for some reason i can't find anything on the 410 only the 210. so i'll get that 6e card.,the other annoying part is some ax210 cards were manufactured prior to bluetooth 5.3 so some are 5.2 and some are 5.3. not that it's a big deal but i'd like the updated,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ax410 apparently isn't available yet, but it should launch soon.","about the  bluetooth version, i had a intel wireless-ac 9260 in the past that launched with bluetooth 5.0 but it eventually got updated to bluetooth 5.1 via a firmware update that shipped with the driver, so it's not a big deal, the same very likely will happen to the ax210 too if you get an older one with bluetooth 5.2...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, all ax210â€™s are 5.3. itâ€™s just a software update, even if intel or other manufacturers continue to state 5.2.

the other guy was saying it's just an update.,so i just picked one up on amazon and will do all the updates to it.,some of the ax210s on amazon are 5.2 or 5.3 so looks like just an update as they were saying.,so once i get it i'll make sure to update it fully,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

who even said battlemage would be 2023?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel, they going for yearly release just like there cpu side.",unlike nvidia and amd who release there new gpu arch every 2 years,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
some early leaks yesterday said intel confirmed battlemage is in development and is planned to release 2023-2024,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel needs the yearly release schedule to get up to speed with amd and nvidia's performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i honestly see this as a great opportunity for intel as well.,"nvidia and amd already release around the same time, so intel can release every year instead",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i track pretty closely.,please show me where they've said 2023 for battlemage.,and i'm not talking about the bs that mlid makes up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can you link that leak?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
correct but not only to catch up but to get ahead.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no one is talking about mlid.,intel has announced their gpu will release in yearly cadence just like there cpu.,https://cdn.videocardz.com/1/2022/02/intel-battlemage-cellestial.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if you really want to undervolt change one thing at a time.,don't do mutiple changes thayay affect stability at once.,but it may just be easier to unlock the power limit unless you are trying to make do with the stock cooler?,be cautious with -offset undervolt also as it can affect idle stability.,and also rember just like overclocking undervolting requires stress testing to make sure it's actually stable to avoid random hiccups down the line from an unstable system,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

windows 10 has integrated e/p core management - thereâ€™s a ton of misinformation out there.,so what does this task look like?,is this an application you were minimizing / running in the background?,or is this some window-less background service?,in such cases itâ€™s expected to be restricted to e cores.,or was it using a fraction of cpu even while in focus?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

youâ€™re probably using way more battery power driving that 2.2k oled screen than you would save by tinkering with the cpu settings.,"i found this quote from a review of your model:

> power consumption can also be higher when simply idling on desktop since oled is more power-hungry than ips when displaying white colors.","idling on a predominantly black screen at the maximum brightness setting, for example, would consume just 6 w while an all-white screen at maximum brightness would consume over 19 w.

they also said:

> we're only able to record a battery life of just 4.5 hours when browsing the web on the balanced power profile compared to almost twice that on the msi modern 14 or lenovo yoga slim 7i pro.","this is probably just a case of â€œyou get what you pay forâ€, and in this case youâ€™re getting a nice screen and good performanceâ€¦ but crappy battery life.",not much youâ€™re going to be able to do to fix the way it was designed.,https://www.notebookcheck.net/hp-pavilion-plus-14-laptop-review-oled-90-hz-and-12th-gen-core-h.635546.0.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most of the battery drain comes from idle power consumption and unnecessary power drawn from short bursty loads (e.g.,: opening a program or refreshing a webpage).,"you can't do much about the former, but for the latter, you can try disabling turbo boost using something like throttlestop.",setting the power mode in windows settings to balanced/best efficiency also limits the boosting behavior on some laptops.,"here is a video that discusses this issue:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0h8q6d0s74](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0h8q6d0s74)

lowering the tdp / disabling cores actually won't help much with the battery drain.",those short bursts typically use only a few cores and won't hit the tdp limit anyways.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"should gotten 1250p or zen 3+ based laptop instead, or m1 if battery time is your primary concern.",but see if you can cap your total tdp,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"one small easy think that could make a difference, is if you stick background processes and things you don't care about the speed of to only run on the e cores with process lasso.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
unless you are running malicious workload which makes more computations when more cores are available (like running games with uncapped fps) disabling cores will change nothing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"change your wallpaper, themes, and apps to black/dark mode.",will save you some battery for sure.,disabling cores will improve battery as well.,"but as others have said, the screen is killinâ€™ it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes and cutting off your leg will make you lighter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
disabling cores will not help with battery life.,cores donâ€™t in general use power unless there is something for them to do.,and laptop cpus idle at very low.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah throttlestop is a good idea.,"i use disable turbo on my i5 8275u, results in a max power draw of around 15watts + no cooling fans needed.",i don't see a visible difference in speed or lag,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i've been trying to optimize the shitty battery life on my jasper lake laptop, and after lowering the turbo boost and base frequencies what i noticed is that the system agent draws more power than the cores at idle and there's nothing you can do about it.",don't know about the op's laptop but also the ssd or ram might not be optimized.,"overall my little jasper lake laptop pulls as much at idle or light loads as a 14"" i7 yoga.",it's a bummer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i found out how to disable it through windows power options settings, would that work too?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the beautiful display is exactly what causes the battery drain at idle.,people don't realize this.,now you know.,there's no way you can upgrade the battery.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

intel driver and support assistant is a flaming piece of turd.,this happens almost all the time.,"you just have to manually locate the driver on the site, download it and install it yourself for it to work.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i just wanted to add that i have already tried uninstalling and reinstalling intel dsa, so please donâ€™t tell me to.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you managed to solve the issue?,i'm running into the same thing...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
everything on the intel site seems to fail if you block third-party tracking js.,they even managed to have cors security failures between their own servers.,they screw this up now and then with the overcomplicated mess that is their website.,"if you really want it to work, you need to disable adblocking and tracking prevention features.",or you can download one of these and skip the update page.,"current release dch:

do you need to update?,you can also download the driver directly and if it fails it's not gonna work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there is no point manually downloading it... the useless bastards keep screwing up the driver, and have to release a new version every few days lately, and they dont even make it easy to find update notes to see exactly what they keep screwing up, and wether its worth updating again.",they need to fire their qa/testers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bro wtf is this go to intelâ€™s website lol fuck whatever tool youâ€™re using,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ok iâ€™ll make sure to try this.,thanks for the advice!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is literally intel's own driver assistant.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can probably just stay on the older driver for some time unless you have a specific need for the new driver.,the update assistant usually gets its shit together after a few days and the download will work fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
shit never works loo use the site,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what ambient temps you have and see what temps you get with open case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

someone need to benchmark it to confirm.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gaming temps should be fine.,if you stare at blender and cinebench benchmarks all day then temps probably wonâ€™t be great.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there are no reviews out yet.,no third party data.,the best you'll get is guesses.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've seen a nh-u12a handle a 12900k in a airflow case.,you can undervolt it a little bit to bring the temps down a bit.,i'm just waiting for reviews myself then i ll make a decision on what i'm getting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on the use case tbh.,gaming nh can handle it fine but if you are planning to do some cpu heavy task then aio or custom loop.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was planning on using a noctua nh-u12a for it.it techincally should be fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, you'll be fine gaming and overclocking.",even a $30 air cooler can handle a 13900k in gaming.,a faster cpu does not use significantly more watts in gaming than a slower one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the noctua u14s has a threadripper variant and is able to cool 250 watts, so a d15 ought to be fine for 13900k.",the 13900k can draw up to 350 watts so itâ€™ll probably run like 85-95c but thatâ€™s still fine.,like you wrote though weâ€™ll see the reviews and definite numbers in like 12 daysâ€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 13900k uses a larger die than the 12900k, so the thermal density will be lower.",it should be easier to cool,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nope!.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just limit your pl1 and pl2 to something reasonable like 125w and you will be just fine on air.,if you use the insane 200w+ pl1 then you won't have the best time unless you get an aio.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have this exact setup.,"13900k, d15 in a fractal torrent with 4090. cinebench r23 runs in the 70â€™s with offset under volt of 0.060v.","without it, it runs 90â€™s plus an throttles.",iegu (intel extreme graphics tuning utility) runs 60-low 70 with the offset while drawing 187tdp.,3dmark is also good.,memory stress test in iegtu will pull 260ish tdp and temps with hit as highly as 95 but immediately drop/scale with voltage.,"worth noting, the bottom third of the rear of the case will leak cool air from the bottom fans- itâ€™ll never be warm in that area.",i tried blocking just the vents and left gpu area open but donâ€™t see any noticeable gain.,"also, using an exhaust fan at the top rear hurts temps.","without that fan, the flow of the case is greatly improved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

same.,there's a good video from robytech where he does a big airflow build using the u12a.,probably what i'm going to do myself,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
294 watts peak?,what are you measuring that with that seems crazy high.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
np.,i should mention i think air is best if you need heat to be vented away from you or from under a desk.,you give up oc headroom and leave some small percent of performance on the table for a lot of money but itâ€™s better imho than it being 80 degrees under a desk.,"also, get a third fan for the d15, it makes a huge difference.",so did the thermal right cpu bracket.,but custom loop would be king for performance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"it will undoubtedly trickle down to consumer hardware, copper trace lines can only go so far.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how would cxl be implemented on consumer devices?,i'm struggling to see how that's possible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's intel.,it'll be years late and used to segment their server platforms.,"10 years later, it might enter home computing, but someone else will have gotten there first.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cxl is a protocol layer on top of a pcie physical layer.,"a ""consumer"" cxl device would look like any other pcie device we already have.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this is a step in the direction of making it much smaller, this is a just a big step.",we are already reaching the limits of what a traditional motherboard can accomplish without help from silicon along the way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel showed a smaller connecter here, and a die that has both photonic and electronic circuits.","in the future, those would be great way to attach gpu's, memory, and storage.","i mean, we're already at the point where pcie requires redrivers on some motherboards.","a smaller optical connector, or even one that's integrated into the slot, has clear advantages over more and more complex copper connections.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
grade a hater,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and the switching is electrical, right?",or will it use si photonics?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that doesn't change that this is for cxl.,i'm not seeing the connection.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
he's not wrong though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"again, cxl is a protocol.",cxl 1.x and 2.x use electrical connections currently being used with pcie 5 (you can basically think of it like an alternate mode of pcie 5).,"cxl 3 is based on pcie 6.

something like si photonics could also be used for expanding the capabilities of a newer pcie generation.","si photonics just makes it easier to extend a cxl link out longer distances, they're not inherently tied to each other.",somewhat of a comparison would be an amd being able to have an epyc use pcie lanes for external devices or using infinity fabric for socket-to-socket communication or how they do connections to multiple instinct cards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

how does your case not fit a larger radiator?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
recently watched [this ](https://youtu.be/hgnfo_laanm)video from hardware canucks and they tested at 155w with ryzen 5950x and 5800x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have a 12700kf ocâ€™d to 5.2 ghz and use the nhu12a by noctua.,never has hit 70c in gaming loads.,the peerless assasin is half the price of the noctua and cools just as good so iâ€™d suggest that if you donâ€™t wanna get a new case for a bigger unneeded aio,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm using noctua's nh-u12a and it's been fantastic even over clocked.,full load at 225w never exceeds mid 70c range.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"get a ak620, fuma 2 etc.",212 or 120 aio are not enough.,that is if yiu want the full potential.,you can run it at 65w if you want to.,i use u12a but its too expensive imo.,ak620 is a better deal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
corsair carbide 100r specs said 120m radiator but maybe iâ€™m missing something?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
okay that indeed says 120mm.,such a huge case and doesnt even fit a 240mm rad.,120mm is probably fine as long as you dont push it to itâ€™s limits (for gaming not a problem).,but itâ€™s not ideal.,iâ€™d personally get a new case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can install 2x120mm on top at least.,measure if you can also fit a radiator on the top.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™ll measure it and check it out.,iâ€™ve never done water cooling before so iâ€™m not sure what i have to look out for but can probably give it a shot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25mm for the fan + 30mm for the radiator usually.,if you have 65 mm clearance from top to the edge of the motherboard you should be fine.,"edit: seems very tight, https://www.pctekreviews.com/reviews/100r.aspx

z790 boards so far seem like z690 rebrands with jacked up pricing and minimal feature improvement,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"z790 boards are advertising higher ddr5 speeds, but not sure if that's due to better implementation of memory topologies or improved imc for 13th gen cpus.",could be a bit of both i suppose.,unless you absolutely want to shoot for the absolute top ddr5 speeds possible i'd say z690 is more than sufficient.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as a z690 owner thereâ€™s not enough value in me â€œupgradingâ€ to a z790.,it adds what?,more usbs and a few more pcie lanes?,yeah iâ€™ll stay put.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
700 series chipsets are a very â€œnonâ€ upgrade.,thereâ€™s nothing even vaguely critical changed on it that would make 600 series obsolete or inadvisable.,"yeah, if youâ€™re buying new and theyâ€™re the same price the 700 series is obviously the better choice, just because it is an enhancement.","but if you can get a good deal on a 600 board, go for it!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™m leaning towards just getting a 690, donâ€™t particularly need pcie 5.0 or faster ddr5, and i canâ€™t see any other big improvements besides ease of use.",guess weâ€™ll see what the prices are,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the most annoying thing about using an old board at launch is making sure the bios is updated,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
z790 with hynix a die ddr5 can go high.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i grabbed a  asus z690 strix-e for about $300...nothing about z790 seemed to offer anything over what this board does (including pci 5.0 m.2 support which many boards don't have z790 included)

 it also has 6 sata ports vs 4 on almost all asus z790 boards (and i needed 6 so z790 was gonna have to be anything but asus and i like asus)

it has some features like led code readout that many similar price boards skip (on either gen)

so to me it was a pretty good fit high end-ish but still a solid deal especially vs the same board on z790

13700k is already ordered and i borrowed a 12700k from someone for the time being (and to do bios update)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"gigabyte z690 aorus master (with updated bios) is a gem at $299, and this is coming from a msi fanboy.","z790 buys you very little that i can see, at least on paper.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think there aren't many low end z690s with bios flashback buttons and they almost certainly will not have 13th gen bios in them yet.,"so if you are new to lga1700, you may be forced to borrow a chip to flash bios if you go z690.",i think ddr5 boards may have improved memory topology / layouts on z790...  maybe.,i think those are the only real concerns with choosing to go with z690.,"also, i fully expect z690 inventory to disappear pretty quick such that this is no longer a choice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
personally the z790s itx i looked at are actually cheaper,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've seen asus proart b660 d4 go for 150â‚¬.,is it worth it at that price?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i dont think theres much of an improvement to go z790,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in some cases, features have been trimmed.",i have yet to see a z790 board with thunderbolt outputs that have dp inputs (so you can use your dgpu rather than your igpu on thunderbolt displays).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
z790 is physically the same chipset as z690.,"the only difference seems to be more bandwidth for the chipset, and an extra usb 3.2 20gbps port.",it's otherwise identical to z790.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it all really depend on pricing from what iâ€™m seeing z790 is going to be 30-70$ more than a 690.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i feel the same way, i got the z690 because until prices come down for ddr5 ram, there isn't really any point.",computers are really fast right now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
definitely not the z690i gigabyte ultra lite.,it is dirt cheap,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep and asus has ditched 2 sata ports on almost every single one of their boards but the highest of high end.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the gigabyte aero has it (it's the one board that usually has it, but i think it's not thunderbolt) and the msi meg ace (actually thunderbolt).",kinda wish video cards never gave up on it because it's useful for graphics tablets...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i ended up getting a z690 ddr5 board, i feel like ddr5 isnâ€™t too bad if you forgo rgb models and donâ€™t try to get super high speeds.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ooh thanks for the meg ace recommendation.,i hadn't seen that one yet.,"now i have to decide between a z790 atx board, or a z690 itx board.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yessir i've got the z690 aero and while not exactly thunderbolt, it effectively does the same thing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh yeah i also got a z690 that does both ddr4 and 5, so that when it does go up iâ€™ll be taking advantage of it.","until then, if i donâ€™t see any stuttering iâ€™m in a good spot.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what board did you get?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you don't have very many options on the z690 itx front.,overpriced msi & asus boards for ddr5 and a lousy asrock and a controversial gigabyte board on the ddr4 front.,"if you don't mind pcie 3.0, the gigabyte lite revision version is a no brainer.","for a zx90 board, it is ridiculously cheap",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'd say go for it but expect dx9/11 problems.,i suspect the interim solution to that is to either run linux in a partition on a arch/fedora based disto to take advantage of proton and the built in dx9-12 translation to vulkan for problem games.,assuming that doesn't scare you.,or figure out which particular dxvk dlls you will need to make the game run on windows and setting startup parameters needed and locate the appropriate folder in the game to place the dlls in to override dx9-11.,certainly a bodgier solution than letting steamos or the linux steam client sort it out for you (dxvks target is linux and in particular the steamdeck) but with some fiddling you could use that to get some potential performance back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if it doesn't have rebar it will lose some performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

tb contains pcie connectivity and rebar is a part of pcie spec.,the only difference is that pcie traffic over tb goes through the cpu (i/o phy) so you lose some performance vs pure x4 pcie connection.,the more i/o happens the more visible it may become.,plus for some cards x4 pcie 3.0 bandwidth limit can play a role.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think we're all rooting for intel to succeed with arc.,"i was thinking of grabbing an a750, but its about $40 too rich for me personally.",but everyone should be hoping they make a meaningful impact.,anything other than that is clown behavior.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"for them to succeed, you have to buy them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they have a promising gpu but the driver is just awful.,"when it can spread it's wings it can fight toe to toe with rx 6800xt and rtx 3070. 

let's hope intel is not going to be another case of ""competition"" where most of the gamers just want nvidia gpu to be cheap.","if amd and intel can't kick nvidia out of the pedestal, we can't see true competition and intel, if they finally have a stable gpu driver and a gpu that can compete with the incumbents, will force to sell gpu at a premium like amd did because everyone is still going to buy nvidia!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was kind of up for the whole second card to tinker with.,then i watched the gn tear down and a lot of it is glued on taped on or just flat out strangely put together.,it uses the same rgb connector that the 20 series cards had issues with.,i don't give a shit about rgb but don't use something known to be problematic.,it just screams of corner cutting from a company that knows cutting corners doesn't work.,it's not even going to be a decent cheap professional card.,i would rather use the old amd firepro card in my 7 year old z book for rendering.,okay in dx12 and ray tracing applications it looks okay.,oh and rebar is pretty much a must so 9th gen intel down is a no go.,i don't often use this word but whoever gave the green light for this launch is a retard.,i can't see any 9900k users running out for a new mobo and cpu just to buy an arc card.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was extremely glad that the rumors of intel cancelling arc were false.,"hardware wise, there's nothing wrong with them at least from what i can tell (besides power consumption but that's eh).","and if rdna1 was anything to go by, these first gen cards will only gain performance (hopefully) due to driver improvements.","better late than never, i always say",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

arc made sense in a world where gpus were hard to get and super expensive because of crypto.,that world doesn't exist any more.,do we need an underdog to root for to offer a better value than nvidia?,"yes, but we already have that.",amd.,it's the same with upscaling technologies.,do we need an open source competition to nvidias solution?,"yes, it already exists, it's called fsr.","xess just divides the game dev support with another option, we need fsr to become the standard that every game dev uses, to battle nvidias proprietary tech.",we don't need to fragment the battle against it and make it weaker.,we needed arc a year ago.,it was designed for a world that no longer exists.,badly designed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i don't know if i'll ever end up buying an arc product (obviously depends on price/perf), but i'm happy for the same reason you are.",competition is a win for the consumer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm happy too.,i'm a huge backer of amd but the more gpu chips the better because each driver has tons of hacks for games and replicating those hacks is painful and it puts the #1 driver ahead.,"but with more competitors, there are more customers to complain about bad experiences and hopefully the game developers will focus on not having to have shoddy hacks put in by gpu-making company developers to cover up for their problems.",it's a bit slanted to view it this way as it's a more complicated situation than that but it's good for amd to have intel join the gpu market.,you can see this a lot when certain games have dramatically lower frames in a review compared to the cards powered by other gpu makers chips.,it's not always down to this but...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm most interested to see what blender raytracing perfomance is like.,"yes we've all seen the gaming benchmarks by now, but specifically in rendering amd is hot garbage and there is zero competition.","assuming they were targetting the 3070 but fell flat due to compatibility with game-specific quirks, it's entirely possible that it might match the 3070 in blender, which is an amazing value proposition",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"don't take this wrong, it's not bashing or trolling, but rooting for it: as soon as the arc line has something offering the same performance as the better cards, i will get one (an example would be if there was one right now, on the same level of prformance as a 3080ti).",i hope they get there.,the reason i would get one would be to support competition as well as trying new technologies (what i enjoy).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah, mlid was just quoting other youtubers (hub) on the bad performance.",nothing positive to say at all.,all negatives.,i think they want intel to fail or are just doubling down like you said.,"edit:

ltt said it best i think.",they understand that it is a first launch.,and i generally like their approach to the topic.,my thoughts on arc is that it is geared towards new gamers.,new kids who will be playing newer dx 12 games.,gamers who don't have a computer already and/or an existing library of games.,so i think intel has a chance.,tons of kids become gamers everyday.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
he's probably pissed at intel because he got the raptor lake msrp prices completely wrong.,he also said that arc was dead and what he said was widely reported everywhere so he wants it to die really bad in order to be right.,"mlid is a complete joke, he once ""leaked"" something that a friend of mine is working on so i asked my friend and he explained to me in detail how the leak was complete fiction.",mlid just makes things up and some people believe his lies.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

a 6600/6600xt costs 300/370ish where i live which is both faster and more power efficient without the caveat of requiring rebar and flaky drivers.,"that's australian dollars with tax included btw so about 200 usd, so it's not even competing on the budget side here.",that's if they release them in australia.,forgive me if i'm not all that impressed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"they didn't make them from scratch, they built their drivers on their integrated graphics drivers.",that's the main reason they can't make them work right.,"this is the 5th time intel has tried to be succesful at making a gpu, they have been in graphics longer than amd.","to be fair, amd didn't start from scratch either but bought their graphics business, but they've been handling it pretty well lately.",i have a feeling rdna 3 is going to disrupt the market a good bit next month.,could mean lower prices for nvidia and intel cards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i disagree!,the competition intel is bringing to the table may not be what people expected/hoped for price to performance but the features they're bringing to the table certainly are.,the a380 supporting features like hardware accelerated encode/decode while being powered only from the pcie port is one great example.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what are you talking about?,"his prices were spot on for all segments, except the 13700k which was off by $10 (newegg and b&h confirm this).",and he said arc would be effectively canceled *after* the alchemist launch where battlemage will most likely be a single low end die or something.,maybe just laptop.,however they will keep it going for datacenters.,it's fine to criticize mlid.,but at least get his claims correct if you're gonna do that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"can you link any sources about ""different intel people denied it""?","specifically, mlid said that intel canceled new consumer arc dgpus, while still working on data center and arc igpus.","so someone at intel saying ""arc isn't canceled"" doesn't count, they need to specifically say that they still have plans for more consumer dgpu generations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have to agree with you.,"while it would be nice to benchmark every game, the priority should be the current games.","now some of that might be under the assumption that if a card can handle the latest games, then it should be able to handle older games as well.",i think iâ€™m still going to get an a770 le (if the pre-orders ever come out) but it would be nice to know that some of the older games that i play would still work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or just use 2 benchmarks one with golden oldies and one with latest releases.,some people play older games and they are probably better of with different cards as those who want to play newer titles with rt.,the good reviewers showed us what the strength of the card is but also the weaker points.,that's good so people can decide for themselves if the card is a good buy for them or not.,"cs:go players (still a lot of people) for example should not buy arc at the moment, nothing wrong with also showing that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

because alder and raptor are stop-gaps until they get to a product that really â€œwowsâ€ consumers.,they are not great at fabricating cpuâ€™s otherwise the product roll-out from 9th gen through now would have seen them push the envelope way earlier instead of chips that offered little improvement and neglected adoption of tech-see pci-e and being constantly behind amd.,"their 14th gen is truly what i believe will be worth going â€œall inâ€ for and will force amd to do something way sooner than they planned, being that am5 has a minimum 5-year socket support road-map they will have to respond in kind with some major improvements with an 8000 series.",but 7000 series being on 5nm now and intel yet to break below 7nm isnâ€™t necessarily room for concern but rather worth highlighting their fabrication short-comings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the ""this is just for production ramps"" theory doesn't make sense, as alder lake is ""intel 7"" and shipped in november 2021.

change of plans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if it's ready for mass production then products are usually out in months.,risk production is largely when a node is ready but yields are being improved and that often takes around a year.,they usually push out a lower volume product in that time.,"when it's ready for high volume production, when the risk production is done, it's when they are ready to start mass production right then.","it's usually 2-3 months to stockpile supply before a launch, not 6-12 months.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

> so intel spent half a decade on 14nm getting advances on it each year that almost equaled a new node in everything but raw density.,"no they didn't, people just absolutely talk nonsense about their gains on 14nm.",they largely decreased density to deal with more leakage from upping clock speeds.,they openly said that's what they did.,"14nm wasn't a bunch of 'new nodes', certainly not massive steps either and absolutely nothing about any variation of 14nm almost equalled a new node, nothing even close.","there are two major things new nodes bring, density and power efficiency, 14nm decreased on density and didn't improve power efficiency in any appreciable way.",in literally not a single metric did it come anywhere near equalling a new node.,intel never claimed anything of the sort and no one claimed it for years.,then one video popped up with some electron microscope images showed up and people badly misunderstood what it was saying.,it broadly speaking showed not massive size difference between 14nm and tsmc 7nm feature size and people thus decided 14nm had made lots of gains and closed the gap.,mostly people don't understand area and 2d vs 3d.,"they expected 7nm to have half the size features, but 2x2 = 4 and 1x1 = 1, a 75% reduction in size.","the size drop show in the video at about 40% difference gives 1.4x1.4 ~ 2, so about double the density.",the entire argument for 14nm almost bridged the gap was one extremely poorly understood video.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ur right, tho idk how u made the calculation at the end.","if you used actual nm then in theory it's correct, only that both companies name the nodes however the f they want.","that's how we ended up with intel's 10nm being similar in density to tsmc 7nm, if not slightly better (hence the rename to intel 7).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no feature is actually 7nm so computing areas like that is useless.,the actual transistor density depends on how the transistor cells are constructed.,reduction in number of fins makes a lot more difference than any shrink of any feature.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"even tsmc has got rid of ""nm"" has nothing in the process was actually at that nm.","so now you have n7, n5, n4 and versions like n5p, n4x, n3e etc.",there was a time couple of decades ago when the nm meant something.,"i would rather foundries publish the actual density for respective process for sram, logic etc but they like to keep it as much under wrap as possible.",but we do get breakdowns when actual chips are released.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's definitely an lga 1700 chip at the very least.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the discoloration?,both my 8700k and 9700k had/has discoloration spots.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i bought a 9900k from microcenter with a spot just like that in 2019. itâ€™s been nothing but fine and i still use it in my main build with a hefty overclock.,i would run some benchmarks just to test though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"finger mark,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s fine.,iâ€™ve seen many direct from intel chips with the same discolouration.,often times it can just be oils from a finger.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"some contact cleaner should do the job,doesnt look burnt just odd.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my 12900ks has the same spots brand new.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you should be able to remove that rust with a belt sander.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™ve had numerous intel cpus new and never had discoloration.,maybe you bought a returned one and the last person touched it and the oils got on it.,i hear alot of people returning chips in hope for a better binned one in exchange.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
try ipa... but should work,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i hope it was a good price considering the 13700k is only two weeks away.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
uffff eso tiene pinta de fallo en la junta de la trã³cola,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
were you told in advance about it?,if not iâ€™d send it back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my 12600k looked exactly the same and is working good.,dont worry.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"use some 91-99% isopropyl on it, see if it comes off.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just use it and see if you get scores that 12900k should be getting in benchmarks & no instabilities,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i received my gamerdays prize two days ago.,maybe they're just slow to ship yours?,have you checked your email spam folder?,mine didn't come from intel directly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

your 1% lows will definitely suffer a bit.,averages shouldn't change much.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
leave turbo on and change power plan to balanced.,"it will allow cpu to hit max speed if/when needed, and also allow it to clock down when/if needed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s going to depend on the game.,is it cpu bound or gpu bound?,also resolution.,at 1080p you may hurt performance dropping cpu turbo.,you just need to test it for your favorite games and see what happens,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you getting loud fan noise and heat when youâ€™re doing nothing right now?,"if so, then your system is likely misconfigured.",cpus should not â€œblazeâ€ when the system is idling.,"they idle and sip power and, thus, would not put out heat or cause the fans to ramp up - unless there is a demand for them to be doing something.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the games are gpu bound i believe (i listed them above)

also, its a 1080p res screen.",i tested it for gow and didnt see any much difference.,felt exactly the same.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if it feels the same, you should keep turbo on.",itâ€™s going to be beneficial with some tasks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the dude who singlehandedly ruined arc discussion has the absolute audacity to say everyone else was being too easy on these cards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love that he infers this is a high end product.,yes this is the largest chip that intel has for alchemist.,but its being marketed as a midrange card at most not a highend.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the only time you should be considering any kind of raid array is if you need it for data redundancy.,"with the advent of ssds, and especially nvme ssds, raid will not improve performance in any meaningful metric.",the point of having an ssd over an hdd is that the seek times/access times are orders of magnitude lower.,maximum theoretical sequential read/write times do not matter for 99% of actual use case scenarios.,raid can potentially increase your maximum sequential read/writes at the expense of increasing your access times.,there may be a impact to iops as well but i'm not sure if it's a positive or negative impact.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think the question you need to answer isâ€¦ why?,the point of raid 1 is *mission critical availability*.,"which is, when a drive dies you want the system to keep going without downtime.",itâ€™s not a proper backup solution.,i have had a raid 10 array go corrupt when the system messed up and the corruption was literally mirrored to all drives.,"raid 0 does still have its place, but you have to be okay with the data potentially going bye-bye.","so, it needs to be backed up elsewhere.",i have two 4tb pcie 3.0 drives in a raid 0 that gets slightly better overall performance than my 2tb 980 pro drive in pcie 4.0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
asus has always gone a little heavy on the default voltage since the 7th or 8th gen cpus.,"on 8th gen they added an ""svid behavior"" option to the bios on all the z series motherboards.",basically asus has 5 or 6 different voltage curves which can be used if your using auto voltage.,"by default they use the worse case scenario option, which uses the highest voltages.","this is basically to ensure any cpu can run xmp and do some overclocking out of the box without needing to tweak voltages, etc...

i'd try first typical scenario or intel default and see if that's better.",you can also try best case scenario for the lowest voltages.,but be aware in some cases if your cpu isn't quite good enough asic quality you can get bsod crashes or post failures.,my 9900k for example doesn't handle the best case scenario option.,it will post & boot but will normally crash in windows if i try to run a benchmark.,also make sure that asus multicore enhancement is disabled.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what case?,also are you tightening the cpu cooler enough?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what are your temps when gaming ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe try and give the contact frame a go?,"if the tg is a bit pricey, go for the thermalright one.","you need every bit of help you can get when trying to tame 12900k temps, and thatâ€™s not exaggeration.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
turn up the kraken pump to maximum.,make sure it works.,set power limit to 250w or so and then see how your temps are.,also disable the multi core enchancement or any auto overclocks.,"if the coolant temperature and the radiator temperature rises, then the pump works and you are just generating too much heat.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you sue your pc for rendering?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sounds like contact issues,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thank you, this is great advice.",will give it a try tonight.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
open air test bench.,and i'm pretty sure i'm tightening appropriately.,"as another data point, if i swap in a 12700k it yields me a cinebench score of about 24000 on the same board with the same cooler, which is about right.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have no games on here.,this will be for rendering long-form video but i haven't gotten that far yet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the pump 100% works.,i pulled it out of a working system.,if i swap in a 12700k it all behaves as expected.,"will give the power limit a try when i get in front if it, thanks for the reply.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i will, yes.",i'm currently using threadripper but evaluating other platforms because my software may benefit from higher clock speed versus more cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i thought so too!,have remounted at least a half dozen times with two different coolers and the paste application looks good.,maybe my ihs is warped?,anything i can do about that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
try to turn the aio around a bit.,maybe you trapped air in the pump?,some people have had issues with 12th gen socket.,a contact frame or a rigid backplate might help.,"it did nothing for me, but i did have an alphacool eisbã¤er which has a sturdy mounting mechanism.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you can't read the text on the ihs after removing the cooler, your contact is sub-par",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wait.,is that a typo?,"do you mean ""if you can read the text""?",because i'd think a proper paste application would prevent you from reading the text.,unless i'm misunderstanding somehow.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, that's no typo.",here's how a proper paste application should look like: https://imgur.com/a/9qwlwb1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"appreciate the clarification, thanks.","yeah, i think my paste application is good.",when i swap in a 12700k it behaves as expected.,but it could very well be a contact issue because the literal second it's under full core workload it throttles.,it doesn't even take any time to ramp up.,but the cpu was bought from ebay so there may also be something wrong with it.,thanks again for the replies.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it might have been delidded, or perhaps the ihs is bent?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m really curious what the performance of the dx 11 and 9 titles are like on linux through proton.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"patience my boy, patience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they support it.,you can also try dxvk with older games and see how it runs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"first of all, they have native support for dx11, only no native support for dx9.",check your facts buddy.,shadow of the tomb raider - a dx12 game and it still performs poorly.,"secondly - this is more about overall software issues which is just not up to par with hardware, lack of optimizations for majority of games within drivers and well as lack of optimizations for intel arc architecture in games (as all of them were made before intel arc was even a thing)

lastly, there are other issues aside of performance in games, which makes it hard sell to mainstream consumer.",in it's current state - it's pretty nice thing for enthusiasts as it definitely won't keep you bored with everything working as intended.,but mainstream wants near flawless experience out of the box that's not there yet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have to mention how much of a dealbreaker this is for me.,"i play civ 6 a lot, and the number of mods i use limit me to using dx11 mode as they make dx12 mode crash a lot.","even without mods, lots of users report instability in that game with dx12, the suggestion always being to run it on dx11 instead.",also i play a lot of old games all the way back to dx6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yep, indeed.","just fyi, there is no directx on linux (as that is microsoft proprietary), but there is proton (which is a patched version, by valve) compatibility layer, which translates directx calls to vulkan, and makes windows games run on linux, sometimes even faster than on windows itself.",it's nicely integrated in steam and it's what valve uses on the steam-deck.,"point is, as directx is being translated to vulkan, and these intel cards support vulkan just fine, older dx9 and 11 should run much better on these cards on linux than on windows.",theoretically eh.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
those cards don't support linux,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bruh it's emulated,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dx11is emulated as well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah dxvk, can install it in normal wine as well.","(i do that for quite a bit of non-steam games), and the performance of dxvk is surprisingly great.","and its what helped gaming on linux quite a lot, because wined3d... was... quite slow when it came to dx11..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
uhmmmm.... yes they do.,why wouldn't they?,"intel support for linux is just fine, the drivers are even open-source and baked into the kernel so you don't need to do *anything*.","well, you need a recent kernel obviously, as this is new hardware.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the support kernal v6 i think,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they do,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sure.,my mistake.,https://www.phoronix.com/review/intel-a750-a770-arc-linux/7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's an api.,"*all* directx calls are ""emulated"", that's the *point*.",it's the job of the drivers to take the system-agnostic commands and turn them into the specific machine code instructions for the gpu in question.,"ideally, the game should have no idea what you are running on - including software rendering.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
idle is normal.,your other temps are completely subjective.,"run a known quantity like a cinebench r23 test, or prime95 small ffts and see what temps you get.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's perfect, i have 12700 too, for 10-15c less you need 240-360aio.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gear 1 means the memory controller and memory speed are equal (1:1) and gear 2 means the memory controller is half of the memory speed (1:2).,"the max officially supported memory speed that is not considered oc for the 11700k is 3200 mhz, which is actually running at 1600 mhz because it is dual data rate.","this means that in gear 1, the memory controller would also be running at 1600 mhz.","you can easily push the memory controller in gear 1, probably up to a 3600 mhz (1800 mhz) kit and some good samples might even be fine with a 4000 mhz (2000 mhz) kit in gear 1 without issue.","as you go higher in memory speeds though the memory controller will eventually be unable to match the speed, at which point you can run in gear 2. for example, if you had a 4400 mhz kit, your cpu will not run it in gear 1 but switching to gear 2 would drop the memory controller from 2200 mhz to 110 mhz, providing much better stability with a fairly minimal impact on performance in most situations (memory heavy applications will certainly see a hit).","you might be able to hit 3733 gear 1 without issue, but you will not hit 4400.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i took my 4400 kit, clocked it at 4600 without touching anything else, and it seemed to outperform just about anything i could do on gear one minus a little bit of latency.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"max 'supported' is gear 1 2933, gear 2 3200 it seems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah i think you are right.,setting auto gear mode puts my 3600 mhz kit at gear 2 aswell.,"which is wierd because with a good bin (which i have, thank you sm best buy) i can hit 3866 on the imc with around 1.4v on gear 1

"*probably* a few months after 13th gen releases (just like alder lake), but *supposedly* the i5 non-k's this gen are just going to be reusing alder lake cores, so it'll basically be a 12600k that's clocked lower / 12490f (which was a china-exclusive, it was basically a 12600k that was locked with lower clocks), while you do get the e-cores, they aren't very useful if you're only using it for gaming, unless you want something to run in the background; then again, this is coming from rumors, but **all** of the rumors were pointing to reusing alder lake cores for the i5 non-k's.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hey has that changed since?,i think i read somewhere recently that intel decided in the end to use raptor lake cores for 13400f.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
could be wrong but doubt it would be from intel.,probably a board partner.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks intel.,"two big takeaways:

this thing was really expensive to design and assemble, but with no good reason or benefit.",it's just inefficient and dumb.,where did intel get the people who designed the assembly for this card?,the february manufacturing date on that plate.,there were lots of reports that intel had tons of cards manufactured and sitting in boxes doing nothing for months over the summer.,i guess those were true.,"that card (or at least most of it), was manufactured back in march/april/may and has been sitting in a warehouse all this time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looks semi janky and inefficient but honestly seems okay for the price and first gen product.,looking forward to seeing how they improve upon it in the next couple years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this is probably the most nitpicky video i've seen from steve

then again, his nitpickiness is based in much more knowledge and years of experience than i do so his opinions are probably valid

it's probably rooted in the fact that he knows the potential that intel has to make a great product, and he wants them to do better because they can be a serious competitor in the space if they iron out some big kinks",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"fr, all i want to know is when i can drop an a770 or two in a plex server and how many transcodes from 50mbps to 10mbps can each handle concurrently.",some see steve as being nitpicky but the number of *different* fasteners alone is worthy of his ire.,"personally, i think of the design, fit, and finish as truly deluxe but the pita involved with a disassembly and reassembly is enough to probably enough to open a gyro shop.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i feel like this review came from a guy who made up his mind before he reviewed it.,"he must have said ""screwless design"" like 5 times, whereas the intel slide he showed clearly said ""screwless shroud"" -- an aesthetic choice which is obviously going to have some ease of disassembly trade offs.","now, i think his right to repair/ease of service arguments are valid, but they're more valid coming from someone who at least can appear to be giving something an unbiased look.","he was whining when the interior contained screws... which *obviously* it is going to, he would have bitched if it hadn't contained screws, because that would have basically meant zero serviceability and would have been a terrible decision.",damned no matter what.,barely acknowledged at all in the whole video that the shroud was an aesthetic choice and was going to have some trade offs for function.,"personally i'd prefer serviceability just like he apparently does, i would have loved to see magnets instead of tape to hide screws.","however, it's hard to watch a video like this and assume that you're getting a fair unbiased take of any positives or trade offs that might exist, the whole thing just reeks of confirmation bias made manifest, not journalism.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think he has valid points and its a fun video.,if a fan stops working it should be easy to replace.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how can you possibly make something that complicated :/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

in this day and age people expect everything to be perfect.,being average or slow at anything is not an option in tech!!,"having worked in an automotive company where things are much more relaxed and kinder, in tech though it's just hatred everywhere!","newbies are being pummeled mercilessly, these reviewers ask for affordable components and if one comes up with some tradeoffs, they just blast it mercilessly so that they favor another team, have a stake on the other company or just blow it up unnecessarily so they can milk money from the views.",they don't care about ethics or values.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this guy keeps recommending old amd tech over modern cards.,it's like that uncle who keeps talking about how ice cars are better than evs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

glue is used when the product has to be thinner or to save cost on screws and screwholes.,"it's not a 3.5 slot card, which is good, and imagine if it had even more screws!",the lighting is just something i would disconnect on day 1. is there a cheaper version without it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"those fancy shrouds with custom ring pcbs, light strips an what not inflate manufacturing costs for no reason.","also, that screwless design is such a gimmick when gpu still has freaking ~56 screws and only that backplate cover is glued :) and it's highly impractical.","based on die size - this supposed to be at least tier higher card, but software crippled performance (which is not on par with hw) forced to sell it at tier lower pricing and even then the value is not quite there.","for the first gpu line up, i think they should have been far more conservative and more basic with all this stuff to keep as much price adjustment headroom as possible for all the software problems that set the performance below expectations.",regardless - i think it's nice gpu to buy for enthusiasts (maybe for some 2ndary pc) with some spare cash to burn - but it's sadly real hard sell for mainstream user who is as much experienced as launching a game from steam.,hopefully they are self-aware that they don't shake the market and won't step on neither amd nor nvidia toes with their first gen of dgpus.,"but potential is there - in some games where software clicks they hit rx 6800 / rtx 3070 level performance, the ray tracing seem better than amd's first iteration.",it's definitely not trash product and imho the worst part of all this is delay.,"if this launched last mid last year or earlier to capitalize on whole bullshit market, they'd have far easier time selling it in that crazy market.","now it's end of current gen and they're only launching, which automatically puts them in rough position.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the fact he is complaining about a budget card being built a certain way.,if your going to buy a budget card then most likely you aren't going to take the thing apart.... the guy complains about a $1599 card then a budget card comes out that hits higher then its msrp and he complains about build quality.,the guy is annoying lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

first gen product?,this is a titan in the industry not some start up renting two suites side by side.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i agree that this is very nitpicky.,this isn't a product people are going to tear down because it's a mid range card.,for example the fact that the backplace is taped on isn't a big deal because it looks like it's still sticky even after being removed.,even if it wasn't sticky you don't actually need to tape it back on because the cards works and looks fine with it removed.,"also most of the pain in the ass when disassembling and the ""complicated"" design is because they added that extra board with the rgb controller.",this means the arc cards that don't have the rgb stuff are likely going to be easier to open which is something that he doesn't mention.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah the whole time i was just wondering how much he gets paid by either amd or nvidia to act like such whiner about these things.,it literally is just about the same level of hassle to replace the fans as most any card i have ever replaced.,double sided sticky tape is basically the standard method to assemble phones.,i have open and closed plenty of them without any issue.,sometimes i will by the couple of cent tape kit to reapply just in case any of it comes off.,not really a big deal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the regular user should at least be able to replace the fans.,fan failure is the most common rma.,a sapphire fan replacement takes 2 minutes with a couple screws.,this one it seems like you have to go through the whole disassembly process to get to the fans.,itâ€™s an anti-consumer design.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i agree that he is going a bit overboard here but you are most definitely on something if you think this is the average difficulty for replacing gpu fans.,every gpu i've ever owned has been 4-10 screws and then the cooler just pops off and you can replace the fans.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i would disagree that fan failure is the most common rma.,i have seen many gpus fail but i have not yet seen any fan failures.,usually it's the solder that fails because of the temp cycles.,"the diy fix for that is to reflow the card in the oven, i have fixed a few cards this way.",i have seen other failures too that i suspect were the power stuff failing.,zero fan failures so far though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
regular users shouldnâ€™t be buying these cards in the first place.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the card has a 3 year warranty.,if it overheats or has issues you can rma for overheating.,also iâ€™ve never had to repaste a modern gpu by choice.,thermal pates last for years and years without need for replacement.,if the job was done i correctly or we see widespread overheating then that is a whole other issue.,but reports are good temps across the board.,and you have a 3 year warranty should an issue arise.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

a310 and a380 at the bottom, a580 in the middle, and a750/~~a780~~ a770 at the top.",when we move to the battlemage generation the letter will change to b. i personally like the naming it seems a lot clearer than their cpu stuff as of late.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

honestly driver need a lot of optimization but for the first time making gaming gpu intel did a good job.,based on synthetic benchmark a770 outperform rx6600xt and rtx 3060 by a lot which clear indication it can also outperform both card in gaming when intel optimized their drivers.,"for other products intel have decent records for their stable driver, it just matter of time until they can maximize their arc gpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what is causing your 3070ti to be trash?,the 770 at least now is a good bit below a 3070 in most titles and has a host of driver issues that i'd be surprised if they are cleared up by launch.,you would probably want to get a new amd rdna3 or 6900xt or some cheaper high end 30 series gpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why tho?,i mean i get the nvidia is bad reason but a770 is very buggy now with horrible drivers.,"leave having almost half the performance in some games compared to the 3060, the a770 has problems detecting monitors.",that is unreasonable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the 3070ti has 6144 cores compared to the 5888 of the regular 3070. it also packs gddr6x memory instead of gddr6.,"none of that is worth the extra power draw, let alone the $100 price premium, but saying it's a slight overclock is incorrect.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

completely ragging on one company's entire product line versus praising another and not ragging at all is a bit one sided.,imo they helped to fuel the conspiracy that intel products ran hot.,(hint they don't in normal use cases).,but it doesn't matter youtubers need revenue and they lit the fire.,hub does not carry the same weight for me as a reviewer.,they had 5 or 6 out of 12 tests for a cpu comparison be tests on gpu bottleneck scores.,basically the scores showed an average across the board for all cpus with the same exact avg fps score.,like why test if you cannot tailor your test to stress the cpu?,and they had the audacity to remove my comments on youtube for pointing that out?,talk about being a critic and not being able to take proper criticism?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think some games perform well enough on a 3070ti versus the a770.,he might be playing newer games.,a lot of kids play newer games today.,"or 

he may have bought the 3070ti for $1,200 (like i did during the 2020 gpu shortages - sad i know i bought from a retailer who price gouged me).",and instead re-sell it for $700 or something close to today's market value.,"now with his recouped losses, he can purchase the a770 for $329 and he can have equal to or better performance in the dx12 or vulkan game that he plays.",that could be a legit reason to switch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they never sold for a difference of $100 dollars.,"the entire time they were on sale, the 3070ti was $1,200 dollars and the 3070 was not $1,100 dollars.","even today at the onset of 4000 series launch, these cards are not 599 or 499.

"i'm pretty impressed with the card given its their first attempt, in a few games it was only ~5% behind the 3070, which says that the hardware is at least good.","amd and nvidia have had years to optimize drivers for their hardware, so i think intel is almost definitely leaving a lot of performance on the table here due to how behind they with optimization.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as someone on the market for a new gpu, the thing that scares the shit out of me is the rumors that intel is considering pulling the cord out of its dgpu, drivers improve with time if effort is put on it, but that is the catch.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"770 destroy the 3060 in rt at 1440p, and better when xess, go intel go !",\*in digital foundry review,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the performance is there, it can compete with its targeted nvidia, amd counterparts.","but without a serious discount why would customers buy intel instead of more tried , proved nvidia,amd?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the fast sum up is that the hardware is mostly ready but the software is not.,my guess is if you get an a770 youâ€™ll get additional 10% performance on average when drivers are more mature.,but intel needs to fix stability issues for the top 100 games played on steam.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm thinking about building a computer for my family and think the a770 might be the gpu for me.,"will have enough gaming power for whoever in my family wants to game, and its relatively cheap.",i don't think they would care that csgo doesn't get 300 frames per second.,i think it paired with a 1080p 120hz monitor will be a good combo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for the first time on making gaming gpu intel did it good.,it took amd more than 10 years to get decent driver and to this day still amd making crap driver like what happened with rx5700xt compared to nvidia driver.,intel driver will get better overtime but as long they sold their gpu with competitive prices than its fine now because amd and nvidia selling far overpriced gpu right now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gamers nexus said the card would not even work with 3 monitors they tried.,this card is a shit show.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pretty impressive performance for the price especially at 4k.,i would definitively buy this card if i was looking for a card in that price range.,if you assume that performance will improve in the next few months because of driver updates and the fact that it has good open source linux drivers it's really a good deal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that is honestly just about where i am at even though i am using a higher resolution monitor than the a770 can really handle.,it is still going to be better than the 1070 i have been using.,there's just no motivation for me to go to nvidia--as good as their cards are--at the prices that they are asking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i feel like the buzz around the arc branch coupled with the fact that they seem decently performant for the price means they will internally consider alchemist a success.,"driver polish will hopefully keep coming, and then battlemage (or celestial) will take the fight to the flagships.",i just don't see them cancelling this line (or i hope they don't).,"it's a low-mid end fight now, and to be honest that's where we need a fight right now.","with nvidia psychologically grooming gpu buyers to accept higher prices and amd releasing the 6500xt with 4gb, arc only seems like it will improve the situation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"buy cheap now, wait for driver upgrades while hitting some bumps in the road for a few months, have a card with superior price performance in the near future.",people with more money than time can spend two or three hundred dollars more for some guaranteed gaming hours a week.,"not everyone has extra dollars and for these people who are looking for maximum performance per dollar and advanced tech like rt and ai optimization, this could be a good buy if they are willing to endure some bumps in the road.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i mean, [looking at the average graph](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/intel-arc-a770/31.html) it seems like there is as much distribution as the [6650xt](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/msi-radeon-rx-6650-xt-gaming-x/30.html).","maybe its not as fast as it should be for its specs, but it seems consistent enough.",better raytracing performance than the 6700xt too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
honestly driver need a lot of optimization but for the first time making gaming gpu intel did a good job.,based on synthetic benchmark a770 outperform rx6600xt and rtx 3060 by a lot which clear indication it can also outperform both card in gaming when intel optimized their drivers.,"for other products intel have decent records for their stable driver, it just matter of time until they can maximize their arc gpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"it's obvious that there's two things holding this card back:

1. driver optimizations for the massive breadth of all pc titles.","this is going to take years to improve, just like it did with amd.",2. cpu bottlenecking in the driver as evidenced by performance \*increasing\* when going from 1080p to 1440p.,"this is going to take a while, but like raja said in his final video yesterday, they likely need serious work on making the drivers more multi-threaded or just have better throughput.","given these two things, i think this gpu will very much age like fine wine.",there's a ton of perf left on the table which is currently locked behind sub-optimal drivers.,"a decent launch (incredible delays notwithstanding), xess has huge potential, and ray tracing perf is honestly incredible.","battlemage is going to be innnnteresting, but that's 2 years away likely.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why on earth is intel using dxdx instead of dxvk which is used on linux for pretty much every game there is and it barely if at all has any performance drop !,?,"since before today i was thinking of actually buying one, specifically a770 16gb since i already own a 1070ti, but since it's gonna be so limited i would go for a750 instead, very cheap and powerful upgrade for games running dx12, and then for every other game use linux(via it dxvk).","but this dxdx situation has me really confused, dxvk exists and works very well on windows as well, which i haven't used personally, but others have.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's a shame they don't show a steady performance on all games and resolutions.,even the 'old' dx9 games from steam.,i like troubleshooting but 350 pricing is too high.,"if they give it with 25-30% discount maybe but nah, intel has enough money to beta-test their stuff before sending it to the market.",painful to see.,yes you can call that an outrage.,intel speed run this way too hard to show the world its capabilities but it was wiser to work it for a few months longer.,maybe 6 months longer.,or just take the time.,intel is not going to starve as a company.,but we will see the driver-updates.,maybe a second chance at christmas.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
skiming through a few video and written reviews.,it looks like its pretty good at matching or even beating the 6600xt in games thats its optimized for.,the problem is it takes a beating in games that its not and an even bigger problem is that there are games out there where its an absolute disaster.,"power consumption is also crazy high compared to the competition across idle, gaming and full load.",its also apparently unusable on systems that don't support resizable bar so anyone with a ryzen 2000 or intel 9000 series or before should stay well clear.,drivers also still seem nowhere near rdy for release.,all in all feels like a product that probably should have been delayed for another few months but intel just had to get out of the door this year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

>tl;dw massive performance potential crippled by iffy driver and lack of optimizations for specific titles.,"while there's certainly room for improvement from drivers alone, there's probably also a hardware bottleneck in the architecture.","[both cards hit the exact same brick wall of 147 fps in csgo](https://youtu.be/xtomqxuyk4s?t=697), heck, even the [a380 pretty much performs the same](https://static.techspot.com/articles-info/2513/bench/csgo-p.webp).","this is a parallelization problem of some sort...

trusting intel to price competitively wishful thinking 770 should be like 250 maybe less to compete retail add in that people are selling old nvidia cards for dirt cheap and this is going to be a very hard road.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
â€œsuper affordableâ€ does not mean â€œ$400-$500â€,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

a a750 or 3060 or rx6600 would be an 80%-100% perf uplift to your 970. more if you're using more than 3gb vram.,if your budget is 400 dollars you can stretch up to a 3060ti or one of the rx6700-ish cards and be way ahead of a770.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it does, it's a very advanced gpu with a ton of features, it's just their drivers and their very odd choice of dxdx(directx to directx translation layer) over dxvk(to vulkan), which works with almost or none at all performance drop on linux(the #1 software that has made linux gaming infinitely better than it would of been otherwise).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's a pretty big 6nm die.,it's not unreasonable to assume that there's more power in there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"doesn't really no, there is theoretical performance and real performance.",optimising for a 100% predictable benchmark lets you run a driver that knows exactly what frame is coming and precisely how to optimise.,"this is hte crux of intel drivers for a long time, ultra optimisation for a few benchmarks for gaming and trash level optimisation for 'normal' gaming.","some games are very very narrow in scope, like say f1 2022 where the games have a strict track, nothing going on off track and a very limited game which makes it easier to optimise for while other games being far less predictable can't be done the same way.",there are also pretty obviously painful limitations in the architecture like looking at counter strike performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's strictly indicating intel focused on getting 3dmark scores high, than making sure drivers actually work in real world.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ya saw this and it verified that a380 i tried did the same bs.,monitor output is just wonky.,shame,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i dispute that characterization.,"i tested the a380 with admittedly a more limited set of tests and it was acceptable all around with only minor hiccups, such as time spy crashes when overclocking it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
honestly just grab an rx6600.,it'll be such a staggering uplift over your 560 and they're on sale for ~230 usd regularly.,"rx6600 can do 1440p 60fps in cyberpunk with reasonably optimized settings, for example, and that title is kind of the baseline for the current generation.",but i don't think an a750 would disappoint you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well good luck my friend.,theyre not gonna sell a whole lot on the desktop market.,their best shot and probably their plan was to sell them via oems and discounts and we know all too well about intels too good relationships with some of the oems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
honestly if they had used dxvk none of this massive performance drop on older than dx12 problems would of existed.,i don't see any obstacles other than somehow a driver forcing dxdx over dxvk to ruin that.,"dxvk works with near or none at all performance drop, resulting in intel arc being incredible.",does intel not know of dxvk somehow ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think there's a big chance intel will announce cancellation of the gaming gpu project very soon, like q1 23 probably.",realistically arc 770/750 at those intel prices won't sell because they both get beaten by ~$250  rx 6600 .,"then intel will have to lower pricing, at that point they will be losing lot of money with every part sold, after earnings report to intel leadership they very likely might put a stop sign.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i imagine because dxvk is an open source project and i'm not sure what license it falls under.,using it on windows is a bit of bodge with sticky tape to get it set up per game.,dxvk is much more integrated with the linux steam client and proton so it is a 'one click' type of deal with the occasional bit of game startup parameters via the client.,"proton and thus dxvk can also be used with lutris and heroic launcher to cover other game stores like epic, gog etc.",replacing dx9-12 is how you play a lot of games on linux.,steam deck and steamos 3.0 relies on all this stuff.,so years of effort have already gone into it.,whereas on windows replacing the graphics api just isn't a thing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it doesn't even match 6600 xt, until it's 1440p or 4k, as radeons have laughable memory bus of 128-bit with 6700 xt sporting 192-bit, against a770 having 256-bit and that difference gives arc a boost in higher resolutions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fascinating how arc seems to do well at higher resolutions.,"inversely speaking, its performance doesn't seem to scale well with lighter workloads.","ampere also exhibited similar behavior relative to rdna2 but in nvidia's case, it was due to issues with core utilization.",i wonder what bottlenecks lie in alchemist then?,"what needs to be tested though, is ray tracing performance but no reviewer has seemingly bothered to try yet - which is disappointing as intel makes mention of significant ray tracing considerations in its design.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"barely beating (in dx12 or vulkan (and actually more like matching)) an old card that's going be be replaced in a few months for *more* money is not ""pretty good"".","xess seems about on par with fsr 2.0, both of which are slightly behind dlss 2.0, leaving intel's main advantages being av1 and rt performance.",quite honestly this is expected but still disappointing for people hoping intel would be competitive this generation.,"hopefully next gen intel will have a more competitive offering once the software has matured and they can use the knowledge they gained this generation, but until then i think you need to look for reasons to justify the a700 series instead of just going for a 6600.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
their biggest issue is it's a 400mm^2 6nm die to achieve what it's achieving.,"if this was a 200mm^2 die it would be an ultra solid product, not least because it would use half the power, but mostly because it would cost intel some 60% or so less to produce them, meaning they could sell them at current prices while making a profit.",the future of the program rests in how much efficiency they gain by the next generation.,"doesnt' have to match amd/nvidia, but it needs to close the gap enough that it can be competitive within 1-2 generations.","the other major issue being drivers, delaying another few months just isn't enough.","they stated their intent to improve drivers massively from 2017, that means their igpu drivers should have been improving massively but didn't, and they've had an insane amount of time to work on arc drivers.","the a380 has been out for ages and is the same architecture, it's inexcusable at this point.",they've had years as these gpus themselves are almost 2 years delayed already largely down to manufacturing problems.,"that is the design was largely done a long ass time ago and driver work starts when design is done, not when they come back from the fab.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why the hell the upvotes.,wtf.,i would like to +1 this.,is there any news on rdna3 pricing?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, they release announcement will be held on november 3, but there's absolutely no reason why would amd cheap out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"matching rx 6800 in few games certainly shows the hw is really capable, the software isn't on par tho.","also games don't have any optimization for this architecture, nor do drivers have many optimizations for individual games.",again - this is totally expected for ne player on gpu market.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as for cs:go, intel's gpus don't have native dx9 support - which is what that cs:go uses.",that's why performance is butchered there.,the bottleneck is on the emulation layer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm really hoping someone will test dxvk soon.,microsofts translation layer to dx12 as far as i know is really new.,dxvk was initially released by doitsujin in 2018 and has seen massive development backed by valve and more parties and the results on linux (look at steam deck as example) speak for themselves.,if the vulkan driver is working well on windows we should see some good performance in older dx versions running on vulkan (as long as it's not stuttering creating the shader cache).,on the linux side (where i'm at) i'm looking forward to the advancements in the anv driver (intel's opem source vulkan driver).,"once valve backed developers or collabora devs get their hands on these cards i expect some rather fast moving development there (for example mike blumenkrantz, let that madman make some more [spaghetti recipes](https://www.supergoodcode.com/meatballs/) for intel).",the opengl performance is looking [pretty nutty](https://www.phoronix.com/review/intel-a750-a770-arc-linux/6) though.,honestly these cards don't look attractive at all today but i'm looking forward to seeing if there's more untapped potential to squeeze out today and where these cards will be in a couple of months.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i donâ€™t know how you even come to the conclusion that csgo would expose a hardware bottleneck.,thatâ€™s clearly the drivers being bad.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't think they have any more headroom.,"this was supposed to be tier higher product, but software is just not on par with hardware.","selling at a loss is not something they want to do i think, no one does - even consoles when they do that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for the advice!,!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the microsoft layer is the better choice because it's going to implement directx more accurately than dxvk.,dxvk is a bit of a hacky mess that's focused on performance and not accuracy so there's a bunch of stuff that doesn't work on it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> it's a pretty big 6nm die.,it's not unreasonable to assume that there's more power in there.,not a good metric.,"vega 64 die size 486mm2 vs. 314mm2 to the gtx 1080. vega 64 only hits close to the 471mm2 1080ti in scant few engines, while having more transistors.","unless you're calculating bom, though, don't even look at die size.",look at real world perf.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just like the mythical ryzen 1700 hidden performance that got hidden so well they can't find it even today?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no i don't think that's quite right lol.,"nobody in their right mind would go out of their way to design a gpu just for 3dmark, or spend all their time optimizing for a benchmark.",what you're actually seeing is how well a properly optimised workload is managing to take advantage of the hardware.,"they key thing being of course, that games are very rarely that, so drivers have to put in some work and improve that, and intel's drivers are not really doing much of that.","csgo performance probably has nothing to do with the gpu itself, and everything to do with the dx9 to dx12 translation layer.","it's *extremely* cpu heavy, and in a game like csgo, which is of course entirely cpu bound, you'll feel it.",a lot.,calling this architecture limitations is hilariously short sighted.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'm from india dude.,"here a 6600 is at â‚¹26,000 minimum (~$320) (that's the cheapest i could find) 

i'm just praying intel pricing is good.","but judging by a380m pricing of â‚¹20,000 (~$245) that doesn't seem possible!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"dxvk is not officially supported on windows, and microsoft provides d3d9ond12.","also, intel's drivers as a whole are not very good including vulkan and dx12 so using dxvk would not fix intel's performance issues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"everyone is gonna want an intel arc gpu for streaming due to av1 encoder giving 2x the performance per bandwidth, resulting in overall much better quality and acceptable quality for people with worse internet.",the amount of streamers and people wanting/trying to stream is not insignificant.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> i think there's a big chance intel will announce cancellation of the gaming gpu project very soon, like q1 23 probably.","this isnt another larrabee though (and even that found a new life somewhere with xeon phi), what they started has larger applications throughout their product stack (like introducing a gaming nuc that's all intel).","they definitely have something here hardware wise, drivers are the only huge issue at the moment, which isnt surprising for a new entrant (it's happened before in the past), and should take time to fix.","secondly, only (other) source of this 'cancellation' i've seen is mild, who is, putting it mildly, a hack.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"spiderman performance is exceptionally good due to that, the game loves memory bandwidth.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's not even remotely fascinating, when you compare memory buses between cards, this is entirely expected behaviour.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this also compounds the issue of less value for most people.,"this kind of reviews tend to impact initial launch buyers prompting them to ""wait"" it out for proper pricing to take effect.","if reviewers say that only buy if scenario then ""better get another"" is usually people will go to.","as much as intel wants to sell these, nvidia and amd are going to drop prices anyway thus making their current price obsolete at launch",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">i think you need to look for reasons to justify the a700 series instead of just going for a 6600.

absolutely 0 reason to upgrade from 10900 to 12xxx,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why do you want 12900k?,12700k would be just a couple percent slower and much cheaper.,with 13th gen on the way i would just wait for 13700k with z690 mobo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i9-10900k is this cpu still relevant for gaming at 1440p?,- of course bro.,it is a waste of money upgrading to 12900k for a 5 fps difference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is enough mate.,"if you watch comparisons, they differ in performance on 1080p, but become almost identical at higher resolutions.",all you need is a high frequency ram and you are set for years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10900k will be relevant for years to come,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if you are strictly gaming, the 10900k is still fantastic for 1440p.","if you plan on gaming, doing productivity, using multithreaded apps, or multitasking a lot then there are benefits to buying something like a 12700k or a 13700k for those e cores in combination with win11.",the updated thread director technology is fantastic in offloading background apps and services onto those e cores freeing up those p cores for your primary task such as gaming.,this is where upgrading to a 12th or 13th gen system will benefit you over a 10900k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"you can, but it will be pointless, running on one dimms is like running on one leg - you can do it, but don't expect spectacular results.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what board do you have cause z-690 useually has more then 2 dimm slots.,if you have a z-series board it should work with only one stick,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

they may have made some misteps in the past, but you can't judge one product line to be representative of the whole company.",intel is a huge company.,over half the chips produced in foundries are made by intel today.,they were the first investors/inventors of euv.,real pioneers.,but somewhere in the mid 2000s they took a mistep and went full quad patterning and they stuck to it.,so 10nm was very delayed because of this.,but this was before pat took back the helm.,"edit:

"his comment about sapphire rapids:

> that project was started five years ago, so itâ€™s in-flight.",i canâ€™t just reset the methodology of a product that began five years ago.,"> it didnâ€™t start well, either.","it had way too much complexity in it, with three major new systems, or interfaces, in that design â€” a new cxl (compute express link), a new pci gen 5 (peripheral component interconnect express), and a new ddr5 (ram) â€” and there were no backups on any of them.","it was like, â€œhow did we take on so much risk and technical challenge in one program?â€ i canâ€™t undo those products.","we have to gut it out and get those finished, even as we are launching the new products on new methodologies with new approaches.","so i said, â€œwe have to flush the pipe of those projects.","we have to finish them, get them done, and get the quality culture back.â€ we do this even as we are starting new projects with the disciplined culture that we expect and are going to be executing in the future.","and 10nm:

> **this is a key point.","you mentioned the tick-tock cycle, and you said the words â€œrisk-managed,â€ which i want to push on a little bit.","the tick-tock cycle, very famously, was where intel would invent a new processor design and move it to a smaller process node, increasing its efficiency.","then you would have a new process design, and you would move it to an even smaller node.",this was a very easy way to consistently increase performance of processors over time.,implicit in that is mooreâ€™s law â€” the idea that transistor density is going to double every 18 months â€” and that intel is going to invent some new process technology to make that happen on that cadence and de-risk it because that processor design is proven.,"that has not happened for intel in the past decade, though â€” this â€œlost decade.â€ the packaging improvements, the process node improvements have not happened for intel in that cadence.","they have happened elsewhere, at tsmc and at samsung.",part of it was because intel didnâ€™t take enough of a risk on some of the process technologies.,"**

> itâ€™s actually the opposite.","we took too much risk, and we failed.",it is a managed risk methodology in that sense.,"when i came back, we had said we were going to do five nodes in four years, which is an audacious plan to lay out.","even inside of the process of technology development now, it is a very risk-managed, cadence-focused delivery, where we have essentially paralyzed the 10-7 team (10nm - intel 7 processes) from the 4-3 team (intel 4 - intel 3 processes) from the 20a and 18a team.","these teams may build and leverage each other, but they are parallel, each becoming its own tick-tock execution environment.","many years ago, i was running a project for inel, and andy grove joked at the finish of it, â€œi gave pat an unlimited budget, and he exceeded it.â€ similarly i went to our head of technology development when i came back, dr. ann kelleher, and i said, â€œyou have an unlimited budget, and you are going to deliver five nodes in four years.","we are going to get back to unquestioned process leadership.â€ some look at that and say, â€œhey, thatâ€™s just nuts!","nobody has ever achieved that cadence in the history of the technology industry.â€

> there are three things that we have done toward that goal.","first is that we have put in the teams, the capital, etc., because a lot of innovating at transistors is that you run more wafers, run more experiments, and have more ideas going on.",we gave them the capital and the r&d to go forward.,"secondly, we created this model of parallel execution inside of the td teams so that the 20a and 18a team is now operating independently of the 4-3 team.","third, we had a whole bevy of component research ideas â€” inventions that were in our period where we stumbled.",we had a whole bunch of ideas that we could quickly put into production.,this was all complemented by intel becoming somewhat arrogant.,"we were like, â€œhey, just drop the equipment off at the front lobby, and we will take care of running it.â€

...

> **right.",this is what i was saying.,i think it wasnâ€™t a risky enough bet on euv.,"**

> we were betting against it.","we had taken a lot of risk in intel 10 when we were like, â€œhey, we donâ€™t need euv.","we will go to advanced quad patterning of the lithography.â€ we were doing other things to avoid needing euv, and those things just werenâ€™t panning out.","it might have been a good decision when we did it, but as those things slipped, we were on the wrong side of euv.",tsmc grabbed euv because of that.,"by the way, intel drove the creation of it.",how did we not monetize and leverage something that we created?,"at a minimum, we should have had a parallel program on euv that said, â€œif we get this wrongâ€¦ if we get quad patterning or the other techniques weâ€™re doing in this self-aligning wrongâ€¦â€ we should have had a program for that, but we didnâ€™t.",we were betting against it.,how stupid could we be?,i'm interested to see how pat's work will yield results in the 5 and 10 years span.,"for intel to take so much risk with 10nm and sapphire rapids, required years of cultural/organization problems that discouraged intel from at least taking more precautions in the event that a project doesn't go the way they expected it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i feel like the industry is growing tired of proprietary isas.,i donâ€™t see how anything heâ€™s doing is going to help with that.,"china is pouring massive r&d into risc-v and arm, accelerators, and ml chips are giving all of the major cloud providers experience developing ip cores.",why would they keep using intel?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sounds like heâ€™s remaking the old intel where every new risky leap technology had a backup alternative in place that would still be cutting edge.,luckily for them they have a ton of capital to throw at this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
their project planing and project management was really bad (ignorant and stupid).,but i think many people don't understand how big effort is to change path of company with size of intel.,"but after reading this, i have higher hopes for intel than before.","&#x200b;

>""we had stopped doing okrs (objectives and key results).",people wrote books about that as other companies adopted it.,"we invented it at intel, but we stopped doing it.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they were executing exactly like they had a non-engineer ceo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ruh roh, the same old ""we run node teams in parallel so there won't be delays"".","they said 10nm wouldn't be delayed because it was done alongside 14nm, then for 5 years they've been saying 7nm (the real one) isn't delayed because it was done alongside 10nm and yet it has been, badly.","that he's just saying we've changed it to be this way, when intel have claimed it's been this way for the past decade is odd.","it's also worrying when someone says ""well many years ago they gave me an unlimited budget and said just do it"" so i did the same today, that is as stupid as it sounds.","if unlimited money was the key factor then everything would be solved and quickly and any engineer knows that is a corporate answer, not a real one.","i hoped for a new intel with a ceo putting out realistic expectations, 5 nodes in 4 years wasn't realistic, in fact it's absolutely outrageous unless he's maybe talking about say 1-2 real nodes and several smaller tweaks to them.",seems like a pure stock protection quote and frames gelsinger as going even bigger in bold statements that make shareholders happy but sound like unachievable bullshit.,"even stuff like they bet against euv, did they though?","7nm was supposed to be ready around the time tsmc and samsung got there, their issue was 10nm was monstrously delayed and they seemingly had issues with cobalt and reducing metal pitch below 40nm.","euv doesn't solve those things, if it did or if intel's only issue was quad patterning they'd have just scrapped 10nm and moved to 7nm, which had a parallel team working on it as well.",euv makes it easier to make smaller features but the other problems with such small features aren't solved in any way by euv.,"they bet on euv being ready around when it actually was, their node simply wasn't ready for it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same happened in amd with lisa.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the e cores are a bit sneaky.,but they really do help and conserve wafer space.,"if you need more larger cores for your workload, there is no shame in switching over to an amd solution.",the intel solution is more for the gamer and one in a while compiling/render workload.,or dvd rip or wahtever.,so the p/e core solution will help with the masses.,i don't think we will see hedt for some time as current consumer solutions have already surpassed cutting edge super computers from the 90s,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"mainstream's not happening, but if you're really intent on discriminating against small cores, you can always wait for the spr-x hedt platform.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i mean he boarded a sinking ship,soâ€¦â€¦â€¦.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's why intel is opening up it's fabs.,"if they can catch tsmc, people will use intel to make these chips.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
china can't invent the chips.,they barely figured out how to make the ball point pen just recently.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as it's the same excuses intel has been using since 14nm delays it really doesn't sound like he's remaking anything.,even in this he contradicts himself and what intel have said for years.,"they've stated they have parallel process teams for years which is ""why there won't be delays on the next node"", yet there were and he's stating they've now created parallel teams so there won't be delays....

he's also saying they weren't aggressive enough on nodes so we're going to do that again... but also said they were too aggressive on 10nm and that was the issue.",this all sounds like same old intel making the same excuses and focusing on good messaging for shareholders rather than executable solid plans.,"5 nodes in 4 years sounds like garbage, not least as one of those nodes was literally just renaming 10nm to 7nm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
both tsmc and samsung are both outspending intel in capexâ€¦.,"they lost the fab lead while making more money, now that the finances are more even, it is going to take a screw up from tsmc for intel to catch up.",not saying that they canâ€™t do it.,it is just going to be a lot tougher than gelsinger suggests.,"as while they are throwing tons of money at it, so is tsmc and samsung,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hmmâ€¦ no.,brian krzanich really was the one who was there much of the time when they sat on their laurels stuck on the skylake recursive loop.,"bob swan was more of a figurehead and bench warmer with little say or any idea, just biding the time while they scrambled to secure a real leader like pat.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
eh?,"brian k had a bsc in chemistry and worked as a process engineer within intel, gradually rising through the ranks and ending up as coo and then ceo.",he was also intel's worst-ever ceo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yup, i think people are naive if they think tech companies never ran parallel teams for huge projects (which fab nodes definitely are).",pretty sure the tsmc team doing 3nm isnâ€™t the one that handled 5nm.,there are already teams working on 2nm and beyond right now.,"there are teams at apple working on the m3 and m4 chip right now and iphone15, 16.  amd is planning zen6 and beyond.",i could go on and on.,"hell, even call of duty had 2 different studios work on their titles in parallel.","people also have to remember node advancement  doesnâ€™t just depend on intel,tsmc, or samsung.",there is a lot of tech from asml and the like that needs to be there as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"youâ€™ve never been to china, guaranteed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no contradiction.,he talks about how they should have had another 10nm team for euv efforts instead of betting everything on a single team's effort.,"for example now they have the issue of high na schedule, and td group is saying that 18a has both versions, with or without next gen euv.","there's a difference between 10nm and being ""aggressive"" about euv.",he's basically saying that they won't try to limit euv use like they did with the old 7nm.,and it's not like they went from 0 euv in 10nm to 25 layers in 7nm.,intel 4 i believe uses less euv compared to n5.,"also what's the issue with renaming if the current naming makes them look terrible compared to samsung and tsmc, while the tech has comparable performance and density?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"capex is also (mostly, really) building new fabs.",which is somewhat tangential to the actual development of new nodes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i seriously don't understand all the hate bob swan gets.,all of intel's serious problems were clearly developing well before he became ceo while brian krzanich was in charge.,"and even when swan was appointed ceo, it was very clear that he was a seat filler while they searched for a longer-term option like pat.","bob swan did exactly what he was hired to do: keep the money rolling in, record profit quarters, and protect the stock value while the company was in turmoil.",and he did those things.,"yet he somehow gets the majority of the blame for the state of intel because of the common narrative that *""he was a non-engineer ceo who ruined an engineering centric company"".","* 

sorry, that's a fun narrative to craft, but it's simply not true.",bob had almost nothing to do with what went wrong at intel.,he was just the guy left holding the bag and trying to keep the ship afloat while they searched for a solution.,"if people need someone to blame for intel's engineering failures, they should take a closer look at **brian krzanich and murthy renduchintala.",**,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
executing as in: sapphire rapids 2 years behind schedule.,"discreet aic gpus 2 years behind schedule... 

almost like how 10 nm was effectively 4 years behind schedule... under non-engineer ceo.",except now with fewer business units and the company is now unprofitable to gamble on the riskiest and most problematic business unit that actual engineers at intel are relying less and less on for future products...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"perhaps an engineer is a benefit, but keep in mind that the real downfall for intel happened on bkâ€™s watch.",he was an engineer.,"swan hid the margin destruction using what he knows best, accounting.",the kicking the can down the road that he did is coming home to roost just as the overall demand is deteriorating.,the multi billion dollar restructuring charge intel takes in q3 will erase a lot of what swan pushed out into the future.,"as for huang, his decisions regarding eagerly chasing crypto revenue long after it was obvious itâ€™s days were numbered has put nvidia and its shareholders in a precarious position just as the bottom falls out of the entire market.",maybe an engineer that isnâ€™t an egomaniac is what works best in the semi industry.,"maybe geslinger isnâ€™t egomaniacal, but he is definitely an attention whore.",he actually sounds like a freshman business student with fantasies about being a ceo and regurgitates management buzzwords he just read in a textbook.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"dude, what are you talking about?",being an engineer or not doesn't matter.,it does not affect how you work as a ceo.,"&#x200b;

let me guess, you watch linustechtips, correct?","linus (and therefore his fans) seemed to think that intel is an example of why business people should not run a business, and then they hype up ""an engineer is running the company!"".","they seem very oblivious to the fact that it was when an engineer ran intel that their issues started to happen, and bob swan was only there for two while they looked for another ceo.",intel's problems began when brian krzanich was its ceo.,brian is an engineer.,he took over as ceo after they had released sandy bridge and didn't quit until mid-2018_x000d_.,"bob swan was only ceo for 2 years, between 2019 and 2021, and he did a surprisingly good job navigating the sinking ship that an engineer left him.","_x000d_

in both amd and intel's cases, engineers have done a horrible job running the companies, and people with management and economy degrees have done a pretty good job._x000d_

that does not mean having an engineer as the ceo is bad.","nvidia is a good example of it working well, and lisa su seems to be doing a good job as well (depending on how much credit you want to assign to the ceo).","all i am saying is that if people want to argue engineers should run tech companies over business people, intel and amd are terrible examples to illustrate that point.","&#x200b;

if we want to attribute the success of a company to the ceo (which i think is a dumb thing to do) then both intel and amd are examples of companies doing great when a non-engineer ran them, and then both performing horribly under a ceo with an engineering degree.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what are you talking about?,most of the poor decisions at intel took place during the reigns of paul otellini and brian krzanich.,"paul otellini (2005-2013): ba in economics, mba, completely non-technical.","brian k (2013-2018): bsc in chemistry, began as a process engineer at intel and worked his way up the company.",both presided over stupid decisions.,otellini was responsible for 14nm's delays.,brian k presided over 10nm's abject failure.,"now let's look at the next ceo:

lol wow so stock price is indicative of company performance?,"you need to get that notion checked, amd is down from $160 to now 60s should lisa su be gone?",so is nvidia is jensen trash also?,"stop being emotional, if you canâ€™t hold the stock sell it and buy amd cause they have better market sentiment, other than that fixing the company takes time",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"usg is annoyed all the money they give them ends up in foreign companys' hands, i.e., tsmc",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> also what's the issue with renaming if the current naming makes them look terrible compared to samsung and tsmc, while the tech has comparable performance and density?",what's the issue?,"i literally said exactly what the issue is, if you make a grand announcement of making 5 nodes in 4 years, which is absolutely and truly absurd to a single person who followed the node industry to literally any degree, then the first of those 5 nodes is literally just renaming an existing node.",it immediately shows that the 5 nodes in 4 years was intended to be misleading.,in another 3 years it will turn out that 3 of the 5 nodes were just renaming shit.,intel for pushing a decade lied about the state of their nodes in nearly every financial call/quartly report.,"a new ceo who wanted to get intel back on track should have started being honest, making realistic targets that can be achieved and started racking up simple wins to rebuild reputation.","people started off believing gelsinger, but his early statements about what intel would achieve were actually bigger, more ridiculous lies than intel were making before he joined.","companies that keep misinforming their employees and their customers only end up with everyone working under crunch, under pressure to achieve things their ceo has promised that are simply not possible.","unrealistic targets makes the work environment worse for engineers, a ceo after making unrealistic claims end up under pressure and putting that pressure on engineering teams to do what he's claimed they can do.",none of this is good for their long term future.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> brian krzanich and murthy renduchintala.,thank you.,"for example, many of their failed or failing acquisitions that they took in during their mass buying spree occurred under brian krzanich's watch.",the members of the silicon gang on twitter who constantly berate and badger bob swan for intel's woes myopically forget that the (poorly) calculated decisions with implications five to 10 years out at that time all point back to krzanich.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"pat, unlike bk or swan, ran another company for about a decade.",heâ€™s actually a pretty seasoned ceo and heâ€™s trying to leverage his passion for intel to energize both investors (including the board) and the employees of intel.,this style of high energy and large promises puts off a lot of people but it can energize others who see a leader that wants to push the envelope.,"itâ€™s a gamble but it can work..

fair.,give pat few years either better or barely improving at all.,feels painful watching pat presentation compared to lisa su.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yup, saying engineers need to be ceo of semi conductor companies is such a gross generalization.",like all engineers are the same and all non engineers are the same.being a ceo doesnâ€™t mean you need to make the technical decisions.,you think lisa and jensen are the ones deciding the how to proceed with nodes?,maybe they have the final say but their decision is based on those they hire and trust and not because they have the knowledge themselves.,a non engineer ceo can hire good engineers to take care of the technical.,an engineer ceo can hire good business people to take of the business side.,it is like saying linus is a bad youtuber because he didnâ€™t go to media schoolâ€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pat summarized it best.,we all are fully aware of how tsmc/amd chased away intel's legendary skylake chips.,basically 14nm.,we all joke that all the lakes after skylake were just rehashed skylake variants.,except rocket lake.,rocket lake was just that hot as a rocket.,but it did blast off.,so to each their own.,and how pat summarized it was this.,intel grew too cocky and proud of their manufacturing prowess.,they focused on the wrong thing quad patterning in order to achieve results and high density 10nm.,there were mistakes and they had no backups for those mistakes.,which is why we saw the sku games and ht games and core games.,they did not have a tik-tok solution and a backup in case their risky design did not pay off.,"(it did not until tigerlake 10nm esf and alderlake intel 7)

but they did all that without euv.",and he again mentions that euv was pioneered by intel.,it was invented by intel yet they did not pursue it until it was too late.,"intel 4 will be based upon their euv implementation (meteor lake =)

what did they have against euv?,was it because they didn't want to share profits or attribute their process node development to anyone else but themselves?,kind of silly not to be working on using both technologies when either tech could hit a snag while in development.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have no clue on the insider knowledge on why they pick one technique/technology over another.,i think they were just proud and decided to go with the overly complex quad patterning.,"you have to remember, they invented euv but it wasn't ready.",it was in development for decades.,and euv was considered risky back then.,so these type of decisions were made years in advance before things were ready.,sometimes you just make the wrong decision.,and that is that.,hindsight is 20/20 and easy to judge.,but at the time they likely thought they were more than capable of solving this challenge.,i would listen to theverge podcast on this interview again.,pat explains it better than i ever will.,https://megaphone.link/vmp5937632564,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

nope!,i7 at the most.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
go for 13700k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13600k and you will be happy if that's all your really doing.. you will be very happy.,if you think you might stream or do professional workload stuff then get the i9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

idk do you?,"when it comes to video, if you are a professional, i'd say yes.",if it's just a hobby youtube channel then probably not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its always about yoru budget and how often you would like to upgrade.,for gaming its always best to compare to the consoles if you are asking yourself these type of questions.,i personally wouldnt buy a cpu that has less cores then the current gen of consoles.,mid cycle upgrade coming up next year on the consoles too.,since you are doing video production i would spring for it if you can but others will spew i5 at you all day and then in the next sentence bring up how amazing 2600k/2700k was.,(2500k not mentioned much anymore),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,"without the i9, you'll be left with extra money you won't know how to spend.",(also the i9 is like buying an rtx titan instead of a 2080 ti),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the only question you need to ask yourself is whether you can reach your target frame rate.,"if yes, you donâ€™t need to upgrade.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,it isn't worth it at all.,i upgrade my hardware every 3-4 years and i have an ryzen 7 3700x.,you should be good for gaming and videos the next 2 years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"u should get 20900k for gaming nd video, anything less than that won't cut it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,if you want more performance you'd be better served upgrading your gpu.,"of course, i recommend waiting before you do that, new gpus are coming and they'll be a fairly significant upgrade.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on what you mean videos.,just watching them?,12600k is fine.,editing them?,yeah do the 13900k upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as much as i agree that a six-core variant is enough.,"if you're looking to hang on to it for a while, i would consider the 12900k/13700k.","if you upgrade more often than not, i would take a hard pass on 13th gen, given you already use a 12th gen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

they should be out there but i doubt it.,a 4+2 chip would be very interesting to see in gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 13100 has already been leaked.,"4+0, but itâ€™s just a 5% faster version of the 12100.","13300 has not been leaked, but if it eventually exists it would probably just be a slightly bumped up 13100, as 4+2 is not a possible configuration (e-cores operate in clusters of 4).","maybe 4+4 or 6+0, as the 13400 is already 6+4?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you can adjust it with throttlestop or there is also a batch file running around on the handheld forums that can adjust this alongside other factors.,"to the other questions:

safe: yes, it's just a feature of the cpu that isn't in the windows menus.","more battery life: no - it just adjusts the relative power to the cpu and gpu sides of your processor

change back and forth: yes, it takes immediate effect and can be set in a few seconds.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

>kinda sad for this guy to be stuck in a board without the ability to have dual channel memory

does your motherboard not support dual channel ram?",most modern motherboard support it.,in many cases you can just buy a ram identical to the ram in your laptop and plug it into the motherboard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
apart from you can compare your exact hardware to other people with the same hardware and see that your system is underperforming in comparison?,i've used this to help multiple friends remotely who don't know a thing about xmp profiles or cpu overclocking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"alright, so i've been messing around with it for a while.",i've been running unigine heaven benchmark at the basic preset + the cpu-z stress cpu in the bench tab.,"i've tried 1/31, 31/1 and a few settings in between and looking at the results.","so, this is a gpu benchmark (heaven benchmark) and a cpu benchmark (cpu z stress test) running at the same time, so both are under full load.","with my i5 1135g7, on my acer aspire 5 with 18w tdp:

power balance 1/31 (31 to the igpu) got me 41.6fps in heaven and 773.4 points in cpu z

power balance 31/1 (1 to the igpu) got me 5.5fps in heaven and 1802 points in cpu z

power balance 14/18 got me 41.8fps and 885.7 points

power balance 13/9 (which i believe is the default) got me 44.0fps and 1005.9 points

seems like the default actually works best in this case.","for reference, running these benchmarks separately instead of at the same time nets me 45.8fps in heaven and 2036.6 points in cpu z. i ran some of these more than once and they were pretty consistent and didn't deviate much from the numbers i showed.","i think testing real games is a better way to really make sure which setting is best, but i think it would vary from game to game and how cpu vs gpu dependent they are.",i'll leave it at the default for now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks, it does actually help quite a lot.",i used to get 45 fps on overwatch and now it's a more stable 60,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you save time by launching cpu-z and hwinfo, instead of opting for a scummy benchmark, that isn't even properly scoring.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, sorry, i am talking about games, not synthetic benchmarks.",something similar will happen in timespy - youâ€™ll tank the cpu trial.,but in practical gaming on the 1165g7 you will predominantly see xe-limited performance and so 31 favoring gpu will be beneficial a lot of the time.,sometimes default is better as you say.,but most games are less cpu dependent than heaven.,"(with all the other usual qualifications - esports games at high fps are cpu bound but you are not going to be playing games at 300fps on an 1165g7, for instanceâ€¦ there are some non-esports games that seem to get cpu bound - iâ€™ve heard spider-man does but itâ€™s not a game iâ€™m interested in so i havenâ€™t tried it.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sweet.,you almost always want 1:31 for gaming.,sometimes the difference is really marked.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would cpu-z and hwinfo have pointed out that the issue is related to single channel memory as you indicated?,or would userbench have indicated that the ram is performing in a lower percentile because it's single channel?,"i use both cpu-z and hwinfo myself, but don't really see how it would have helped in this situation?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, that makes sense.",i think it might also be a factor that it's more relevant on the i7 1165g7 because both the cpu and gpu draw a little more power but are still constrained to the same tdp.,i've seen reviews where the i7 can actually do worse than the i5 just due to that.,what do you think about the other settings?,"i'm not entirely sure what speed shift changes yet (i believe it's associated with turbo boost behavior but i don't know in what way), power limit 4 didn't seem to change anything for either cpu or gpu, tdp level at ""up/2"" seemed to make the igpu about 10% faster in synthetic benchmarks and pp0 power limit didn't seem to change anything either (i can't set the timer on it, it always resets).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"a lot of people who game on intel 11th gen just set pl1/2 to the same (thereâ€™s a kind of peak of big gains around 18 watts i think but you can go a lot higher, depending on thermals.",speed shift is basically epp - what it does is clamp down your processor to save power and reduce heat and noise.,what youâ€™ll notice is that youâ€™ll have a pl1 of 20 watts but youâ€™re only using 12. sometimes with games itâ€™s overly aggressive and then if you lower this number you should see power consumption near pl1 and better frame rates.,i use 215 as my defacto and then lower as needed.,some things are really frame rate dependent like some emulated wii and wii u games - like they just donâ€™t work right if you canâ€™t lock 60.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
appreciate the response,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh i see.,"yeah, i came to the same conclusion of using 18w for pl1/2, but beforehand i was trying to use 24w as my pl1/2 but in games it would just lock to 18w no matter what i did, even if the thermals were fine.",so you recommend starting with speed shift at 1/215 and working it out from there?,any tips for the other power limit settings?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if youâ€™re trying for performance, set speed shift really low (like 60 or even 0) and then increase it until you see a performance drop.","if youâ€™re aiming for battery life, iâ€™d say then 215 is good and then lower it when needed.",:),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

have you checked the temps?,it might be overheating causing it to shut off.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thank you for posting the solution!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nh-d15s can handle 200w no issues.,despite the 11900k being a toasty boi you shouldn't have to restrict the cpu that hard.,you can mannually set pl1 and pl2 in msi bios to ~200w to get more performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've used that heatsink on that cpu with unlimited power limits and had no problems.,you really should not be resorting to throttling your cpu when (most likely) you just have a problem with your cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i can highly recommend you switching to an aio.,"this way you will have more headroom to overclock, thus reaching better performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wow 60 degrees with full bench on a i9 ?,my i5 11400 is touching 85 and everything's repasted properly...i guess this is because of stock cooler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good to see you made it!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
adjusting the power limit isn't considered overclocking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hmm i just redid it though and replaced thermal paste.,i also went into bios and changed the setting to a box fan making it run at 125 wattage (i think 125) and itâ€™s not going past 62 while playing cold war right now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, i changed a bios setting to boxed fan, it drops the wattage but keeps the degrees around 60 at 100% load.",changing it to the air tower setting destroys my temps though.,the difference in wattage is 288 to 125 i believe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no thatâ€™s cause the pc is on lol, itâ€™s mounted properly plus thereâ€™s a fan on top exhausting as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no itâ€™s definitely very hot cause my room gets hot within 5 minutes when it says 100 degrees.,air is very very hot too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to be fair, on idle any cpu should be pretty cold, since whether it's 225 watts max or 150, on idle they all consume a fraction of that.",i'd check the core temp app.,"it shows frequency, temp and real-time wattage.",i have it below 20w on idle and <30 degree on i5-8xxx with pretty much the same cooler op has.,check that the mhz on idle is the same as in the description of the processor.,"with i9-11900 he should have roughly the same ~30 degree, since his tdp is the same 65w i have.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

all fans have proper air flow.,all the arrows are pointing toward the back of the pc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bios had a water cooled setting on so i changed it to air tower which limit the wattage to 288 still was overheating then changed it to box cooler which limit it to 125 wattage.,now running cooler but iâ€™m sure iâ€™m losing performance with a lower tdp.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"already solved, this was actually the problem tho.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i found the problem, my mobo was forcing tdp to 288 and stock for this cpu is 125. so it was overclocking my cpu tdp.",whole rig playing games is about 60 degrees now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"lol no, my tdp was overclocked for some reason.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that isnâ€™t going help much as that air cooler trades punches with some of the best aios.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not at all familiar, so guesswork here.",looks like bios settings of â€œair towerâ€ raised cpu tdp from 65/134 watts all the way up to **255/255 watts**.,wouldnâ€™t that indeed be overclocking?,your cpu is rated 125 tdp on intelâ€™s site.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my nh-d15 struggled with my 3950x during video encoding and the use of  ai image correction or video upscaling when i raised the power limit to about 200 watts in the bios and had pbo enabled.,the cpu would thermal throttle even at 100% fan speed by 10 minutes into the workload.,this was in a high air flow case.,remounting the cooler and using different thermal paste didn't help.,the only way the temperature could be managed properly was lowering the power limit in the bios.,it may be due to the different way amd and intel calculate power consumption.,slapping on a cheaper 360mm aio solved the issue and allowed for a 250 watt power limit in the bios without thermal throttling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"125 is stock tdp lol iâ€™m not throttling shit iâ€™m using stock settings

edit: that sounds cocky lol donâ€™t mean that in a cocky way",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are they hard to install,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
will be doing this eventually.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it indeed is.,i was actually surprised to see 60 degrees myself lol.,it spiked to 80 for a split second when starting the benchmark and then right back down.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably using the wrong mounting mechanism for the socket.,check if you have the correct standoffs and the correct washers and/or no washers (some coolers require only the thin paper washer for your socket).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you already did i'm sure but check your bios & see if anything ""auto"" oc/intelligent (insert marketing crap here) or the likes of it is enabled or even default, sometimes default means on/off depending on the brand.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
set all fans to 100% in bios and i believe you should be using air tower.,"use these settings while diagnosing, not permanently.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
okay thatâ€™s the problem.,that cooler is only designed to handle a max tdp of 183w.,"if your cpu is putting out 288 watts, then itâ€™ll be become saturated in no time and cause those temps.",youâ€™ll need an aio cooler to handle that high of a tdp at full draw.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"reset everything to default, set xmp and leave everything else alone and see what happens.",not sure why your bios is boosting wattage with air tower maybe it means something different to that mobo manufacturer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes theyâ€™re right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

is the underside of the cooler hitting the ram?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so you are limiting by power, for 11th i9 besides thermal you have power limiter, which prevents overcooking.","anyway sth is wrong... check with hwinfo what is going with cores' freq., voltages, running processes.","if using auto settings, try limit max voltages, lower load line calibration.","undervoltage is also good option, but for this fan, should not be must have.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel has a misleading tdp pl targets, its annoying.",glad u sorted it :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh, ye, 288 w is defo way too much for d15 xd.",limit to 220 and it should be fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
changing the power limit isn't considered overclocking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it would be but also enabling certain memory profiles is also.,i have a noctua u12a and a 11900k.,if i enable some bios features to increase power the system will flat out hang under test after passing 90c.,iâ€™m not surprised the cooler canâ€™t handle the higher setting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>  looks like bios settings of â€œair towerâ€ raised cpu tdp from 65/134 watts all the way up to 255/255 watts.,wouldnâ€™t that indeed be overclocking?,"no, it's perfectly fine to raise the power limits to unlimited.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™m not sure, i didnâ€™t overclock it, i am too much of a default to mess with overclocking.",it was set to the water cooled setting at first so i swapped it to air tower which has it at 288 watts then swapped it to box cooler which lowers it to 125 watts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its just because its an air cooler relying on heat transfer capabilities of heatpipes.,these new high heat density cpus are just too much heat in a small surface area for heatpipes to take care of that you really need watercooling now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, air coolers are nice, cheap and quiet, and the fans usually ramp up less aggressively because of how quick they can transfer heat to the fins.","unfortunately tho, big aios do have more headroom.","the biggest air coolers can compete with a very solid 240/280 aio, but ultimately the high-end aios will leave the air coolers eating dust.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lowering the power limits throttles the cpu.,that's why it runs cooler.,it's throttling.,you shouldn't need to throttle the cpu with a high end cooler.,i have the same setup and can run prime95 continually unthrottled.,you should be able to as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you said your idle temps are 40-50c, which is high for nh-d15 unless you live in a very hot place.",it is possible your cooler or thermal paste isn't applied properly.,i idle at about 30-33c (room temperature 25c).,nh-d15 should be good for about 200w+.,11900k is fast for gaming with just 125w so you can leave it as it is if you don't want to bother.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so i figured it out.,my cpu was set to 288+ wattage.,default is 125 wattage.,my motherboard changes wattage based on the cooler you select.,"itâ€™s running 60 degrees smooth now, even playing 2 games at once still 60.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea so air tower bring the wattage to 288 but if you look on intels website default wattage for this cpu is 125. itâ€™s most likely this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"d15s is 167w with only one fan, this is found on noctua site if you google ""noctua performance rating""

intel xtu tool can show your cpu's live tdp and intels docs say the 11900k is 125w.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> that cooler is only designed to handle a max tdp of 183w

no it's not.",show me where that's stated.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yea not sure, everything is good to go now though!",60 degrees full load.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, i have low profile ram.","also i solved the problem, thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all of them are auto i triple checked.,"it cause my mobo was forcing tdp to 288 overclocking my tdp, stock tdp for this cpu is 125 on the intel site.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think itâ€™s cause my mobo air tower fan sets my wattage to 288, stock tdp for this cpu is 125. itâ€™s running cool at 125",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"maybe ur pwm is plugged to the pumb header, make sure you connected it to the cpu fan 1 header.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i figured it could be something like that making air coolers less effective.,the heat is concentrated in such a small area now.,"i've noticed that even with aios and waterblocks, some new cpus are harder to cool than older high wattage cpus.","i've also noticed that there isn't much difference between temperatures under load between a $60-$70 cpu universal 115x/am4 water block and a $120+ water block with the 3950x and 5950x even with overkill radiators, probably due to the same reasons.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"steve from gamersnexus said that with the 7950x and how hot it runs and with how the 13900k might run, custom liquid cooling might now actually be worth the hassle for maximum performance since even aios are being pressured by these chips now.",gpus might soon run into the same problem too but we'll have to wait for future benchmarks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i didnâ€™t lower it, i set it to stock, stock for my cpu is 125 go look at intels website.",itâ€™s first is 125 watts and second is 250 just as it is set.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is your mobo/bios/uefi name?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it seems that the 11900k was entering a turbo mode or something which was causing the tdp to spike to 288w like the op was saying.,since they changed the bios to boxed mode that brought the tdp back to stock which is inline with the 125w tdp you stated.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> d15s is 167w with only one fan, this is found on noctua site if you google ""noctua performance rating""

no it's not, if you had actually bothered to ***read*** the article, you'd know that yourself: https://noctua.at/en/noctua-standardised-performance-rating

an nh-d15s can cool a lot more than 250w on the right cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you want the cpu to run at it's rated turbo frequency at all times, you can raise the power limit.",it's still stock speeds.,that cpu won't use 255 watts unless you tell it to by raising the voltage.,if it's running at 100c with power limits removed it's probably a bad mount or lack of thermal paste or something like that.,might double check to make sure the protective film that comes with the cooler has been removed and make sure to tighten the cooler evenly a little at a time with adequate thermal paste.,you could also try locking the voltage to say 1.3v adaptive and setting the core multiplier to 4.8 or maybe even 5 ghz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes its exactly that issue.,this is also why the 11900k at 300w is easier to cool than a 12900k at 250w though since it has a much larger die.,its all about heat density that's affecting temperatures not so much the heat output since that actually stayed similar over the years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gpus won't ever get as hot as cpus because even though the tdp is high its always spread across a huge die with many little cores consuming little power each.,cpus have a few big cores that consume most of the tdp that are not spread out throughout the die area.,the problem is getting the heat from the silicon to the cooler.,not dissipating it to the air.,so air coolers like the d15 or 240mm aios aren't even struggling to dissipate it to the air rather they're struggling to extract the heat from the cpus.,cpus in comparison to gpus needs massive temperature deltas between the die and the cooler base to move enough heat from the die.,due to the heat density and then made worse by having to go through an ihs which needs its own temperature delta to transfer heat through it.,this is why gpus with massive tdps can somehow be cooled by air coolers with less surface area than the d15.,since they're direct die cooled and have much lower heat density that the temperature delta of the die and the cooler doesn't have to be large.,which in turn lets the whole heatsink run at a higher temperature which gives a larger temp delta to the air which means it can dissipate more heat with lower surface area.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yea mine has no issue cooling a 11900k with abt @ 250w (manual limit cos unlimited it has those 300-350w spikes ofc).,i can even go a little bit higher with 100% fan speed on everything but i can't tolerate that much noise though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i love it when you talk, baby, tell me more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yea you have a point, a big reason why cpus not only suffer from heat transfer issues is a combination of multiple factors, including low core count that contributes to the heat due to higher power per core, the fact that all cpus come with ihs' with do contribute a few c in inefficiency, heat density in general, etc.",tbh though this does make wonder if we're truly hitting the limits to cpu cooling via air and now liquid will become not only recommended but borderline necessary now...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what about?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 'extra' 10% is less in the average / max framerates, and more in the 1.0% lows due to the additional cache on 13th-gen as well as internal bus changes that decrease latency all around.",this is why i'd get a 13700k over a 12700k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

depends what youâ€™re using it for.,"the 13700k is going to beat the 12900k and the 13600k is going to beat the 12700k, according to all the leaks iâ€™ve seen, but really, if youâ€™re just gaming thereâ€™s no reason to get a cpu that expensive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you would be better off putting the money into a better gpu.,so go with the 12700k and bump up your graphics.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i went with an i7-12700k as i wanted to use air cooling and still get a minor overclock.,the newer chips have a higher boost clock and slightly better performance but also higher temperatures.,"either way, you will certainly not notice any real difference in performance except for benchmarks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
budget minded: 12th gen and ddr4.,futureproofing: 13th gen and ddr5.,"but, ddr5 is kinda new in the consumer market, and the new chipsets might still have bugs.","don't think the memorycontroller is gonna be buggy though, as they have experience now with xeon lineup.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's not much of an improvement at all to get a 13700k, there's not really any point to it, especially if you're not using a top end gpu that can actually push a cpu to its limit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the question is what you do.,just gaming?,probably doesnâ€™t matter and either will do.,production work?,may want to look at the 13700k range.,keep in mind you will have the flash the mobo bios for raptor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"just curious, what motherboard and cooler?","going the 13700k myself, just for a little extra perceived longevity and power that i don't actually need.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whether there will be any noticeable difference completely depends on what gpu you're going to end up with.,if you're not going ultra-high end (3090+) then it's entirely possible the 12700k and 13700k give you the exact same frame rates (depending on resolution).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
honestly i feel like i'd stick with the 12700k and then completely upgrade it like 4 to 5 years down the line.,"currently running a core i5-10400 with a 1070ti, really good for both gaming and productivity in my opinion, consistently get 70 to 80fps on high to ultra settings in games and video editing doesn't lag too much when playing back a preview.","edit: that's what i'd do since my main source of income is selling stuff on ebay while being an 8th grader, if money isn't of much concern, i'd go 13700k w/ ddr5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"one slightly concerning thing, why did you already buy a mobo without a cpu or gpu

i am guessing old pc just asking.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i am going to get the i5-13600k.,i was going to buy the i7-12700k but i get to pay less money and get 5% more performance than 12th gen with the new cpu coming out in 2 weeks.,also supposedly uses less power when idle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"what sucks for me is i have all parts ready, including 12700k months too late to return.",so deciding if it's worth selling at a loss and getting 13700k.,"and also using a nr200 case so not good to have more hear, although honestly i will only game or edit occasionally, so most of the time it will be irrelevant, but so would the extra performance potential.",lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

central computers is selling 13900k for $599 and no tax.,so about the best price youâ€™ll find anywhere.,https://www.centralcomputer.com/intel-core-i9-13900k-13th-gen-processor-8p-cores-16e-cores-32-threads-5-8ghz-p-core-boost-4-7ghz-e-core-boost-box-bx8071513900k.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"typical of intel launches, retailers mark up because they can.","in a month or two they'll be at ""msrp"" or rcp, whatever you want to call it.",happens every time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
$589 is tray price is it not?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"$589 isn't the msrp, it's actually the ""rcp"" which is the price that intel sets for selling them to their clients (a shop in this case) and it's only given to the shops as long as they buy -+1000 units of each processor.",don't expect it to be found for less than $600 anywhere.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"make sure you pay attention to newegg, they are not offering any kind of return or refunds on the pre orders.",they are only offering replacements......i noticed this today and cancelled my pre order.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wait,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah same problem here, and.",i need two of them.,"iâ€™m a little reluctant to buy before reviews, but i think will be easier to obtain via pre-order.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the $660 is the retail price, the $590 is the x1000.","that said, you are likely to see sales of it soon, when i was trying to get 12900k, took a month to drop to $630, but there were better sales in time $580-$600, even atm you can see the 12900k on sale at $590 on newegg.","likely that you will see prices like that on the 13900k once the ks is released, but for now i doubt we will see too much discounts.","unless amd drops prices and intel reacts, which is not likely to happen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hey friend good luck on getting new cpu haha, i had same setup as you and upgraded to 12700k it is huuge lift in perforamce especially for vr i notied the difference, i just hope you didnt get ddr5+msi motherboard, mine have issue with xmp3.",what is your motherboard?,thought about custom ilm for bending issue?,i got thermaltake from ali express and my cpu is running cooler.,"my advice is wait, i know tha there is a chance if you missed pre-order you will wait longer but what if the performance numbers advertised isnt real?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there's an extra tax on top of the normal price for people that pre-order cpus without seeing independent third party reviews first.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do not pre-order.,"seriously, don't give/lock-in your money for a product that's not reviewed yet.",just wait.,look at 7900x and 7950x - they are still available and still msrp.,inflation is high and demand wasn't same as last generation launches.,don't give in to the temptation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15 hours before your post?,https://www.reddit.com/r/intel/comments/xu3fpp/where_would_be_i_able_to_purchase_13th_gen_at_msrp/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i thought it was the price per 1000 units, hasn't it always been like this?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
best buy i believe had the 12900k for msrp at launch day if im not mistaken.,was sold out for the first month.,i know this because i was trying to get the price match since i bought from micro center that was $50 more expensive but they wouldnâ€™t honor it because it wasnâ€™t in stock.,i donâ€™t think scalpers will be that much of a problem this time so id try there first.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol didn't someone made post few days ago claims leakers pricing is inaccurate.,i wonder if he can show you where to find the cpu for msrp,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i had a feeling, i know they release on the 20th.",so theyâ€™ll probably be at msrp by then.,"i know newegg had accidentally posted the 13900k for their preorder price before the intel event, and was hoping theyâ€™d update pricing after the event.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
antonline will probably have it up on their ebay storefront as well.,their web storefront has it for $620.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
never heard of these guys.,how trustworthy are they?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just pre ordered through them i assume they are pretty reputable?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ha ha ha i went there and bought 2 for $599 ea., guess what!",they cancelled my order immediately.,what a scam.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes people are saying the $589 price is rcp.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[removed],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a minor correction.,that's the guidance price that intel uses if you order a box of thousand units.,"however it is just a guidance, intel changes it as needed.","also, i don't think you can order a smaller amount from intel directly so that is the price for the smallest possible order.",the actual pricing is per customer depending on how much they order.,and even mid size retailer would be ordering tens of thousands of cpus.,intel cpu retail price tends to end up at that guidance price in a few months after launch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh thatâ€™s bullshit.,they didnâ€™t make that clear at all when they announced their processors.,iâ€™ll have to wait around and see if it lands at rcp.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as someone else noted, central computer has them for about the best price iâ€™ve found.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah iâ€™m probably going to wait for reviews now before i get the cpu.,"if the 13900k doesnâ€™t have a ton of uplift over the 12900ks then iâ€™d buy 12th gen. 

my motherboard is an asrock razer taichi board.","from my research there are no issues with xmp 3 on the board, but thanks for the advice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i actually was in the midst of an upgrade when rumors were coming out about 13th gen intel.,i have everything except the processor.,i was originally going to go with the 12900ks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">rcp

didn't people review the 13th gen and already overclock it above 6ghz?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my bad, i shouldâ€™ve searched this sub before i posted.","didnâ€™t realize anyone else posted this question

your comment on that thread pretty much covers it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i managed to get a 3900kf which arrived today from cclonline for â£640 delivered, only â£70 more than i paid last year for my 12900kf.",any1 else get theres delivered today?,cheers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very.,theyâ€™re a california company with a lot of store fronts.,sort of like a microcenter.,they ship in the us though if youâ€™re not local.,"iâ€™ve purchased a 10900k, 12100f and g7400 from them all without issue.",very reputable company.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep.,they are,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love the canadian cpu market.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"mind you, they've ""reserved the right"" to increase the price before delivery, which they've apparently done in the past.",it might just be bait pricing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, but itâ€™s also not exactly new, so most people are aware of this if theyâ€™ve been paying attention to previous announcements",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> they didnâ€™t make that clear at all when they announced their processors.,they are doing it that way for more than a decade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you're getting downvoted, but you're right, most consumers are not purchasing 1000 units.",it makes the chips look 10-12% more price competative than they actually are.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"of course they didn't, they want everyone to think that they have better prices than amd, in any case if you wait enough the rcp will become the msrp, that did happen with the 12th gen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"regardless, there is no point in paying more money now.","just because you preorder today, its not gonna launch any faster.","reviews are gonna come at least a day in advance, at which point you can make the decision.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ya if you gotta but a whole new system just go with 13th gen. unless you can get 12th gen for dirt cheap.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"when you say you have all the parts, then motherboard and ram too?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what?,no.,embargo date is rumored to be oct 20.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s fineâ€¦ finding stuff on reddit isnâ€™t the easiest.,just thought the info might help.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yup making a huge jump.,"i was originally going to jump to 12th gen, but by the time i had everything but the processor 13th gen rumors were circulating and i decided to wait a month.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m jumping from 6700k to 12900k or 13900k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no ill go 5800x3d after ive seen prices of cpu and mainboards and their power consumption per gaming performance.,dont need 24 threads parking for a cpu price where i can get mb+cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks!,sounds like iâ€™m gonna be preordering from them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can also vouch for them.,i shop them locally and they've been good to me.,their return policy does have restocking fees for working items but that shouldn't be an issue since most people don't tend to return cpu's.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not in stock yet tho...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol most people weren't aware.,there was a whole thread dedicated to ragging on that mlid pricing video.,now there's nothing but pikachu faces around here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

my brother !,3080 and 8700k here.,iâ€™m going to the max  for a 13900k just for shits and giggles when my ltt screwdriver gets here in december.,our wait is worth it!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm in the same boat!,still going with the 8700k.,it's been such a good cpu haha.,thinking of the 13700k if all things go smoothly.,i need a new cpu just to video edit haha,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yep, i pointed out that though mild was still wrong, they were likely a bit closer to the actual launch price than the rcp suggests lol.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what shop is this that has them for $599?,i'd do that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in one shop (not exactly a popular online retailer) - yes.,closer to launch - it will be more retailers with definitive shipping times and better customer service.,"i have no experience with that shop, and if others are comfortable - it's upto them.","if you think you will get a good chip likely if you pre-order, then go ahead.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, definitely.",return if you are within return window - not sure how you can update bios (does one need to update bios or will it at least boot into bios with 13900k?,- check that as well).,you can still buy 13900k before launch day since reviews come 24h earlier at least.,"right now, 13900k is for 659 preorder.",may be at launch day- you will get closer to 600$.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am talking about reviews and this is an engineering sample overclocking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
going from 6 cores to 24 is going to be great.,iâ€™m honestly really excited.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same setup here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i went from a 4790k to a 12900k, it was worth the upgrade (price), hope to keep it just as long.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"same boat 8700k + 3080, wont go s1700 or am5 because of power consumpftion and itx mainboard prices.",5800x3d will be my next platform as i even can reuse my ddr4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this processor has served me well for the past 5 years, but i know itâ€™s a bottle neck for my 3080. iâ€™ve also started to learn programming and blender.",so this upgrade will be great.,iâ€™m thinking the 13900k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my 8600k was my best performing and longest lasting cpu from all the abuse i put it through.,i got a 10850k because the 10900k's were being price gouged at the time.,it's already giving me issues.,i'm in the boat for a 13900k as well.,probably going to just camp out at microcenter the day of and try to get my hands on one for msrp.,(if they have it at msrp),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how was he wrong?,he was off by $10 for the 13700k but got all the other prices right.,"so he was *technically* not 100% accurate, but still pretty dang close.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
asrock has already confirmed the board will support 13th gen processors and has usb bios flash back capabilities.,so i can power on the pc with the 13900k installed.,iâ€™m most likely going to order the 13900k after reviews or on launch day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is blender hard to learn?,i want to learn it!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great!,cheers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it takes some getting used to, i learned a lot from youtube tutorials.",i know people who learned blender in 6 hours,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what cpu r you using right now?,i'm upgrading after 11 years.,my i7-2600k will finally get its long due retirement.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they launch on the 20th, thursday, so i think the 17th, monday, at the earliest.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13900k should be able to reach the maximum performance of 12900k at much lower wattage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you actually going to use all of those e cores?,transient spikes alone could cause your system to crash.,"perhaps consider the 13700k, it still has the same number of p cores as the i9, so if you're mostly gaming, the loss of 8 e cores isn't going to matter.","also, you could run the 13900k in 65w mode and get the same performance as a 12900k which should be fairly safe.","there's also the option of just turning off the e cores as well, of course this is under the impression gaming is your main concern.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 400w power draw you read about was most likely from someone who was ocing the crap out of the preproduction sample of that cpu.,"official limit of power draw from intel is 253w, 10w higher than 12900k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you might have to undervolt both to achieve stability if the power spikes are too high.,you could probably shave off a few hundred watts that way and make the whole build fit into your power budget while gaining performance on the gpu ( no joke with a uv&oc combo ) and not losing any on the cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lmao where did you read that power draw?,the cpu running stock within intels power guidance will have it boost to 256watt under full loads for up to i believe 56 seconds and then it falls to itâ€™s normal 125 watt tdp for the rest of the workload whether itâ€™s gaming or rendering.,unless you overclock or tell your board to ignore the power  limits intel has defined for optimal perf to energy consumption you wonâ€™t see anywhere near 440 let alone 300. most workloads or gaming specifically wonâ€™t even have the card using its 125 watts more like 60-70 with your gpu using its full rated 350 or whatever a 3090 uses under gaming load.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the review should be available at october 20th.,"the pl2 is 253w, so if you run it in a default settings it would stay under that limit, and down to pl1 when the boost time runs out.","if the you set the pl limit to unlimited, 13900k should be able to do 400w+ at default voltage / frequency with an unlocked pl limit, given that it can already use 340w+ in aida64 fpu.",but you need something as intense as the small fft option in prime95 to do it.,"in most of the normal workloads you won't get even close to that number, especially in gaming.","plus, there is always an avx offset (that thing may be turned on by default, depend on your motherboard) and pl limit settings on the motherboard.",just cap the pl at a resonable degree and you will be fine (the cpu automatically downclocks when it draws that much power).,if you are worrying about power spike would overload the psu just don't leave the pl limit settings at unlimited.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so i'm going to take the stance that you should pre-order it.,let's look at the scenarios.,"one, you get it and it rocks your shit exactly as you wanted.","two, it's not going to really work after embargoes come out but guess what you can now scalp it, or you can sell it for exactly what you bought.","either way just get it, and decide after.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
360-420 aio and 1200w psu for 5+ years of full time pleasure and tranquility.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3090 on a 850watt is already pushing your luck, depending on the psu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
from what iâ€™ve seen the gains arenâ€™t huge over the 12900k so the most likely move is for intel to allow a very minimal amount of time between reviews going love and the start of product sale.,so my guess is the 19th would be the earliest but i feel like itâ€™s going to be the day of launch that reviews go live.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your specs scream bottleneck lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hi, its 17th, monday.","sorry, i found your thread by chance and had to comment.",but i hope we get reviews by 19th very least.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
agree intel showed a chart that 13th gen could do about 600mhz higher at the same voltage.,so figure 400-500 mhz higher at same wattage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes and i think its possible for op to run 13900k with 240mm aio, it was intel's big selling point this year with the 13th gen",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"on a z690, it's was tested to use 80w to reach 12900k stock performance, i expect slightly better results with bios update and a z790 board, so 65-70w to match 12900k doesn't seem impossible",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was thinking same thing but 13900k has more cache - not sure if that comes into play much.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's true.,"the highest 13th gen will go to is 350 watts, at least without overclocking.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
never buy a psu based on the average load.,you buy it including the peak transient load.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 3090 will draw up to 664w with a transient spike.,now add in 40-50w for ddr5/mobo/cooling/storage power draw and you can see why op is concerned.,"forget 256 watts, the system could crash with the 13900k using less than 150w.","the other issue is that 850w is the highest you can go with a sfx psu, so op can't exactly just get a better psu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> sell it for exactly what you bought

who's going to buy a 2nd hand cpu for exactly the same price as a 1st hand new one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah massive bottleneck for sure.,i had a 1080 ti for several years.,"when the 3080 ti went on sale a few weeks ago, i couldn't resist.",i wasn't even sure if such a new card would work with a 11 year old mobo&cpu but worked seamlessly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this is incorrect, or else we'd be seeing gamers nexus and linus reviewing the 13th gen chips",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there hasn't been a mainstream i9 that can't be cooled by a 240mm aio,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i doubt it my 12900k hits 354w with a 50mv undervolt running prime 95 smallfft avx and is being throttled at 354 due to 2 cores hitting tj.,"max there's no way it will do 5.5ghz all core with 8 more e cores at less wattage

https://i.postimg.cc/t9tbr15w/untitled.png

my cpu uses 286w doing an aida64 fpu stress with said 50mv undervolt @ 5.1ghz all core
raptorlake uses 350w in the same test so at a guess your looking at 430w+ for worst case stress testing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"850 w sff does not handle transients nearly as good as atx, due to it being much smaller and having less overall capacitance.","though i'm running 3080 ti at 350 w and overclocked 12700k and dual rank b-die kit at 1.55 v and i have no issues running cinebench and furmark simultaneously with ssr-750fx (focus gx first revision), which was said to be uncompatible with amperes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there are 1000w sfx psuâ€™s now.,asus and a few other brands are also launching 1000w and 1300w atx 3.0 psuâ€™s in the sfx form-factor very soon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just sit on it and wait for the reviews then sell it unopened.,he doesn't have to use it immediately.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you been living under a rock for the past 2 years?,people are still selling their 2 year old clapped out ps5 for $100-150 over msrp.,if the 13900k is out of stock like we know it will be someone would buy it off ebay in an hour.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh cool,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how much ddr3 are you using?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the performance boost by upgrading to something as simple as a i3 10100f will be massive for you.,"the increased memory speed, higher cache and ability to run pci 3 will boost your frames by 40-80%.",a better cpu such as the 5800x3d will boost frames to over 100%.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's 19th now, no reviews, so earliest tomorrow i assume",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16 gb,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i know, i am sadness :-(",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do not get an arc gpu if you do not have rebar capable hardware the performance hit is really major.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"rebar is pretty important on arc this gen. around 25% improvement on average, could be more or less tho.",wait for benchmarks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"pc breaking, actually, it's not even about performance breaking, when arc without rebar literally crashes pcs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you have a source for this?,i haven't encountered any crashing with rebar off.,all i've seen is reduced performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well i was optimistic with the best case scenario thenðÿ˜…,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"witcher doesn't work without rebar, forza crashes and in some cases trying to alt tab results in permanent artifacts, that does not fade away and you need to restart pc.",plus this [https://www.youtube.com/shorts/hrtjocslmbg](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/hrtjocslmbg) on world of tanks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if you plan on buying a gpu then you donâ€™t need the integrated one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it deppends.,for 30 bucks maybe?,"but at least imo it starts to be not worth it, do you have another gpu laying around so you can troubleshoot in case your main gpu fails?",in my case i went with the 12700kf because i have a couple of old gpu with me that i can use in case the main it fails (gtx 470 and r7 280x) and the price difference with the 12700k was like 50-60 â‚¬.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
$30 is a lot of money for an igpu.,i would buy the f sku.,you already have that rx 550 for a video adapter in case something goes wrong.,you can keep it instead of trying to sell it when you upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1. you donâ€™t need a pcie 4.0 motherboard to use pcie 4.0 gpus, they are all backwards compatible.","the only performance hit you get is a few % in gaming performance, which isnâ€™t even noticeable.","2: if youâ€™re jumping to a new platform, why not get on the latest platform anyways?",the 11400f is already outdated by 2 generations and is on a dead socket.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends if your motherboard requires igup or not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"got the regular 11400 :)

better to have the igpu without needing it than needing it and not having it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the main benefit of igpu is fallback.,"if your dedicated gpu fails or needs to be sent for repairs, youâ€™ll have the igpu to continue use of the machine.",can also be useful for diagnostics.,"if you have an old spare gpu laying around, igpu is less important.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

he said he was getting it for a gpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
exactly what i was going to say,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
imo it's worth the extra money over the headache of trying to diagnose your system if your dedicated gpu fails it's not that much extra money,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i run a discreet gpu and i still have maintained an igpu on my recent rigs for a few reasons.,"firstly troubleshooting, it's one more component you can remove when testing a minimal setup (which is handy if you're trying to identify which component is causing a likely hardware fault).","the next useful one is i've had times where even resetting the bios my dgpu wouldn't initialise, the card was fine, the default bios settings were just being stubborn, or in another issue which is less relevant these days my board was uefi but the gpu (a gtx 680) had bios firmware so would not boot without csm being enabled which was disabled by default.","the final use case for it is additional display outputs or if the device you are outputting does not like your gpu you can try the igp - i have an older receiver which seems to hate working connected to my gpu, i also use 3 monitors + a tv via a receiver so in the past some gpu's have had insufficient display outputs.","there's a number of reasons why an integrated gpu can be useful, i tend to run into a lot of them ;) so most the time i go with a cpu that has integrated graphics.","it's $20-$30 for convenience and peace of mind you might need it, you might not, but when you do need it, it's very handy :).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that seems familiar to apples solution (soc).,efficient  and much larger bandwidth but takes from the experience of building an rgb pc a little bit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also used pretty extensively in other modern socs if i'm not mistaken.,many are shifting to stacked dram to increase memory bandwidth and decrease latency.,"maybe intel is also proposing this as a means of increasing on-die cache, or for boosting onboard graphics performance.",amd was at one point rumored to be putting hbm2 memory on their ryzen chips with onboard video in order to provide a big uplift in performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is actually a different idea.,the patent covers building a very large l4 cache using on chip memory; so this is closer to amd's zen 3d cache models than apple or qualcomm putting system memory on package.,"the difference with amd is they envision that instead of stacking a separate sram chip on top of the primary logic die, they would start with the base logic die and then fabricate dram directly onto the logic die.",the patent then covers the design of a cache that is fabricated on the silicon directly above the cpu logic layer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

just get the thermalright peerless assassin 3. no need for anything more expensive than that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a d15 is a good cooler but nowadays expensive for what you get.,coolers like the scythe fuma rev 2 b or ak620 are a lot less for basically the same if not better cooling capacity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it ain't,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,shit channels.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the a770 is not reaching rtx 3070 performance.,that should have been an immediate red flag there.,if it was intel would be screaming it out of the top of their lungs in marketing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i mean, just wait.","if you want to be responsible with your money, wait for the in-depths reviews and look at the real life prices from the retailer of your choice and not msrp.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fake benchmark channel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hey look it's an rtx 3060ti and an rtx 3070, and also some unrelated text overlays!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"seems pretty fake to me and as much i would love arc a770 to match 3070 even 3060ti, intel themselves would be advertising everywhere if their $300 card was outperforming rtx 3070.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no idea, but that's very much in the ballpark of where i expect performance to be, so seems plausible.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's not responsible to buying a gpu only relying on a yt channel with unknown way of testing and not even knowing if tests are real.,"just wait a week or two untill embargo expires, we don't know how a750 and a770 will perform in a variety of games and engines, or it driver bugs that gn mentioned with a380 were resolved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i hope itâ€™s legit!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"their other tests seem legit, so who knows",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i always assume these channels are fake.,they never show physical hardware.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the fact that average and 1% and 0.1% are so close hints that it is the same architecture,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i donâ€™t know they get away with this crap.,itâ€™s annoying,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seems fake.,the only benchmark channel that is real is this one.,"https://youtu.be/ckvecvccrha

they have a store and that is why they have the hardware for all the benchmarks they post.",and don't show benchmarks of products that haven't been released months before.,that been said is ok for someone else to have the gpus before release because they need to have it in store days before.,but this looks fake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"card pcie in wrong place, it will occupy top slot instead bottom?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeee, i mean, it does seem very sus to me, specially since it's a small channel and non of the big tech youtubers has uploaded anything related to benchmarks of these gpus... although, i do hope the a770 8gb will perform like this, it would be pretty brutal for 1440p or 1080p at $330",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the channel ""testing games"" is one that does seem to be real.","it's a guy who actually works in a pc components store that gives him access to the parts to test, who has shown the actual hardware setups at least a few times.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"testing games and benchmark are legit i think, but the smaller ones are usually fake",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it does reach 3070 performance in *some* games,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
super hyped for the card but this 100% like no itâ€™s not that close in perf nice try tho ðÿ˜‚ðÿ¤¦â€â™‚ï¸,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not if they borrowed it from their employer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a 3060 ti clocked at 2510mhz?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is it?,are people really expecting 3070-ish performance in raster and at times better in raytracing?,thats just setting yourself up for a massive dissapointment.,not even intel is claiming that and they'd be the first to do so if it was the case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
me too!,"i planned on getting any of the rx 6600 xt variants but the dollar went up and it stopped my plans of upgrading, if this is real it would have been a good thing i had to wait lol.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i doubt intel would have sent them a review unit so it's unlikely they have one for test.,the review embargo is still on so the actual reviewers are not posting anything yet even though some of them got the card already.,i don't think intel even provided them with drivers yet so even if they somehow got some sample unit from china they could not have actually tested it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"tech youtubers are still under nda, they can't post anything.","if this channel is legit, it's probably some guy in china who is close to an oem and has access to cards.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
\-unrelated text overlays-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel claimed a decent jump over the 3060, especially in optimized titles, so it doesn't put it too far away from conceptually being in that 3060 ti range.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's expected.,they invested a lot in raytracing so no reason to believe they are not able to outperform the 3070 on that in some situations.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mr huang needs a kick in the butt for his thoughts on gpu prices where the days of cheap gpus are overâ€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would think they'd get drivers pretty early to run tests and make a video at their leisure.,nda lifts in 8 days (i think?),so i'm sure they have drivers already.,"edit: i was wrong, release date is in 8 days, nda lifts in two days.",they definitely have drivers by now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intels own marketing says the a750 is ahead of the 3060 is some games.,behind in others.,when you average their big comparison slide they pretty much trade blows.,the 3070 is about 30-35% faster than a 3060.  given the specs jump from the a750 to the  a770 there is no way intel is bridging that gap.,its just not a realistic expectation.,the 3060ti is a more realistic target.,and even then you have to take the marketing inflating numbers a little into consideration.,anyways the reviews are close so not long to wait now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeeee, although i kinda get it, but still, if it is getting so hard to make profit out of selling your products at a decent price to your costumers, then maybe they should take more time, try out a new design or something, because i don't think anyone is prepared to pay so much for their gpus if the 40 series pricing continues like that, at this point we'll end up getting the 4060 non ti for $500 and then the mid range will be most certainly dead... hell, getting a ps5 here in my country may be cheaper than getting a pc that compares to it lmao.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
unfortunately that's been the case for a while now.,"there used to be a time when you could build a decent pc that would perform better than a console for a slight premium, but you made up that cost and then some with cheap games.",now the cost to build a good pc is sooo much higher than a console it's practically impossible to break even overall.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
consoles used to be sold at a loss because the cost of the games more than founded that margin.,now consoles and games are all pretty high in costs.,i donâ€™t understand it but perhaps iâ€™m missing the bigger picture.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yes, z690 boards should generally support them with a bios update, most manufacturers have already released suitable updates.",if you do not already own a 12th gen cpu and are buying a 13th gen cpu for use on a z690 board be sure to get one with flashback (or a similar feature that allows for flashing a bios without an installed cpu) or that already has an appropriate bios flashed just to be sure you can get it running with your cpu :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no idea.,the intel driver i had from.,lenovo was like 5 years old and not maintained.,had to uninstall it via device manager before the proper intel one would install,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hp bios is the most crappy bios i've ever seen it doesn't has a single useful option,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that level of motherboard should surely have the ability to flash the bios without the processor installedâ€¦.,check the specs for flash bios functionality.,i have done it before and it works like a champ.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why donâ€™t you just get another z690 motherboard that does have bios flash?,tough question to answer because the majority of z690 boards will still be on the shelf.,"if you really want to wait, maybe give it until spring 2023 and youâ€™ll have to stalk reviews on the board, or ask asus or whatever company directly",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sadly, the z690 tuf does not actually have bios flashback.",none of the tuf or prime boards do.,"so, if the board does not have at least bios version 160x on it (i think julyish?","), a 12th gen cpu will be required.","unless the seller is willing to guarantee a specific bios version, then i would honestly recommend a different model board in this situation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it does not have bios flashback nor is any usb port marked as bios on the back io so i don't think so.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"because i'm a bit of an asus fanboy but honestly if microcenter can't guarantee a 1720 bios or newer, i just might have to go with msi.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"amd tuf boards have bios flashback, its just the intel ones that don't for whatever reason ðÿ˜•",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, i meant specifically for z690 boards.",not all boards in general.,"the z690 proart has it, but the b660 proart does not.","actually the only asus b660 with it is the rog strix model, while seemingly every gigabyte b660 has it and no msi b660.","itâ€™s very erratically implemented, but i really feel like this should be, by now, a standard feature on all retail consumer boards.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its honestly a shame because i really like asus boards but if microcenter can't guarantee a bios version then i just might have to look at a different board,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

do they do it for free if you buy the board from them?,their site says they change $30.,ill have to call and ask.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

where are you getting your msrp numbers?,"you might be looking at wholesale prices, not retail.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"13th gen isnâ€™t out yet, so youâ€™ll pay a premium for presale.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i havenâ€™t seen any cheaper on the 13700k than bh.,i saw this video that iâ€™ll link here on how intel â€œdroppedâ€ the price of their processors to match their last year prices and are expecting retailers to not take as much profit per cpu.,"in short, the videoâ€™s assessment is that retailers may be less likely to drop the price of intel 13th gen (even to â€œmsrpâ€) since theyâ€™re taking more of a hit to their bottom line.","[https://youtu.be/wu7rvw0hw5c](https://youtu.be/wu7rvw0hw5c)

i preordered a 13700k from bh.",also you can get tax free on it so thatâ€™s quite a savings depending where youâ€™re at.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you are looking at the pricing intel gave, that is rcp pricing which is wholesale as others have said.",the retail and online environments have to market it up a bit so they can profit too.,i pre ordered the 13700k and i think the rcp was $409....i paid $449 which is a %10 market up......this is completely normal by the retailers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
practically everywhere if you wait a few months.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pretty much a lot of sites reported it.,"like tomshardware, trustedreviews etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looks like they are reporting the rcp which is the wholesale price.,same prices as intel ark.,"for example:

[removed],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just wait.,companies are price gouging right now.,you will be able to buy raptor lake for within $10-$15 of the so-called wholesale price posted on intelâ€™s site and reported elsewhere.,best buy usually prices this way.,"but itâ€™s not out until around the 20th, and there should not be any availability issues.","canadian sellers are already listing raptor lake for what works out to be similar or less than intelâ€™s posted price, so thereâ€™s really no excuse for neweggâ€™s price, other than greed.","edit: canada computers has:

- 13900k - $799 = $580 us - $589 on intel
- 13900kf - $759 = $551 us - $564 on intel
- 13700k - $579 = $421 us - $409 on intel
- 13700kf - $549 = $399 us - $385 on intel
- 13600k - $439 = $319 us - $319 on intel
- 13600kf - $409 = $297 us - $294 on intel

and as iâ€™m sure you can guess, canada does not normally get deals vs the us.",so iâ€™m sure things will improve when theyâ€™re available.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how?,"800 cad is 580 usd which is more than the 409 usd wholesale price, not less.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"alder lake does not explicitly require it, some coolers however do benefit from it.","i anticipate it'll likely be the same with regard to raptor lake, afaik there's no significant changes to the ilm or ihs.","i didn't bother with one for my 12700k + lian li galahad 360 on cinebench r23 mt runs even with a 288w pl (essentially uncapped) it doesn't exceed 80c, that's stock paste, with fans exhausting over the rad and a very quiet fan profile (i replaced my psu and that's audibly louder than my fans even at idle) so there's a lot of room for improvement thermally, undervolted (-125mv) it doesn't exceed 70c @ 21c ambient so frankly i haven't bothered to even consider a contact frame for it as there's been absolutely no need.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i used the frame on my 12900k, but with my noctua d15 and the new mounting kit for alder lake the noctua produced i saw zero improvement with the addition of the contact frame.",the contact frame will only improve things for certain sitautions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
alder lake never required the contact frame.,you could do that if you wanted too but many of us especially on air coolers never had any issues with the stock ilm.,most people that had contact problems were using super flat aios/cold plates and even then their temps werenâ€™t anywhere near bad.,iâ€™m using a nhu12a air cooler and my cpu temps are excellent and the temp variation between cores is between 1-3c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's not just heat, i was chasing serious ram compatibility issues until i installed the thermalright frame on my 12700k/gigabyte z690 gamer-x ddr-4.",i'd assume intel left the new socket retention setup the same from the 600 series chips unless proven otherwise.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"same experience here, also with the d15.",i also saw very little (if any) reduction in temps with the contact frame.,"btw, i strictly followed the installation instructions i watched from gamers nexus.",i will use the contact frame nevertheless when i do the drop-in upgrade from my 12700k to the 13900k as i have removed the stock ilm already.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">i used the frame on my 12900k, but with my noctua d15 and the new mounting kit for alder lake the noctua produced i saw zero improvement with the addition of the contact frame.",what sort of temperatures are you seeing with the d15 on your 12900k?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my 12900k disagree your opinion.,"before the bcf it was hitting 100c instantaneously on any stress test, xtu, r23, cpu-z.",any.,after the bcf i can handle it below 89c.,using 360mm aio.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a friend of mine is using eisbaer 420 mm with 12900k, dropped 15-18 c after using contact frame, i dropped around 20 c after sanding down the ihs on my 12700k, liquid freezer ii.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"same, noctua nh-d14

the old ilm had a noticeable bend in it too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
aios typically are much flatter than an air cooler though.,any time iâ€™ve ever seen someone with issues itâ€™s been aio users 9 times out of 10. so i guess i shouldâ€™ve said the contact frame is needed if youâ€™re an aio user.,iâ€™m upgrading to a 13700k and i have the thermalright bracket on hand that i never bothered putting on.,may see what temps i get with everything stock.,hopefully i can maintain that 1-3c delta between cores.,if not iâ€™ll use the frame and see how it goes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
like i said the problems usually are if youâ€™re using an aio.,itâ€™s well known intel cpu have always been concave.,air coolers typically match up better with intel cpus than aios as aios have a much flatter cold plate.,so in your case the new contact frame helped your situation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, probably to decent results i would need to sanding down my 12900k.",but iâ€™m lacking courage to do it.,i canâ€™t use voltage above 1.340v and keep it below 100c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"generally speaking the aio are more prone to the problem, however the 12900k is where the heat is even more hard to keep it below acceptable limits.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i changed my aio too, the new one isnâ€™t flat.",deepcool ls720.,but the frame makes the bigger difference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s why i went with a 12700kf actually lol.,i was worried about the heat and not wanting to buy an aio to cool it.,i just reused my u12a.,hopefully raptor lake doesnâ€™t see the 13900k running as hot but iâ€™m betting it does.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's the best processor you can drop on your existing coffee lake motherboard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because people think it's still worth buying unfortunately.,the fact of the matter is a 12600k is flat out faster at everything and if people were thinking logically they would realize they could buy an z690 mobo and a 12600k or even a 12700k for less than the price of a new 9900ks.,but people don't think logically.,they get fixated on the idea of reusing their old motherboard and so they don't even look for newer better options.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its not in production anymore and most likely being sold by a third party,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"cause it's an i9, also cause it's the best cpu you can drop on a coffee lake board.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
price gougers who got it for 200$ cheap at microcenter and would rather die than to sell it and lose 50$,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ralk to intel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"people still think its worth a lot when it just isn't anymore..

its only value now is if you already have a z370/z390 system and can find it cheap otherwise 9900k or just upgrade.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s worth what people pay for it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ask the seller.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well it not worth the money, but a 9900ks along with fast ram,something like 4133cl15 and a decent overclock of 5.1ghz+ all core, still beats 10900k, 11900k, and any ryzen processor aside from the new 7000series and 5800x3d.",my 5950x gets less fps than my overclocked 9900ks.,the only reason why i use 5950x is for productivity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sounds like time to replace that coffee lake mobo.,can buy a nice z690 board and a 12600/12700k for less than thr price of a 9900ks.,reusing that old z390 board is a poor decision.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i can definitely second this.,i picked up an x99 board recently and the price difference between the 6950x and the 5960x is roughly 3-4x the price despite being only 2 more cores and some more cache.,just because it is the best processor on that platform.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wiorks with a bios mod on most skylake/kabylake boards too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this is why i hate people who sell products based on brand, they don't care what generation or how old the product is, as long it has i7 or i9 name on it they will sell it like it was the current gen cpu.",it's happened on my country and i absolutely hate people in here for doing this bullshit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is your country?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not op but in my country, the dominican republic, sellers also do the same  they tout the i7s like crazy and when you check, it's almost always a gen 1 to gen 4 i7, and they think these things are worth the same price as they were when they were brand new, i don't even bother with these people anymore",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 1260p is 4/8 core up to 28/64w, the 1255u is 2/8 core up to 15/55w.",however actual power/performance levels are going to depend on what the manufacturer allows for a specific laptop.,"so for example, one laptop with a 1260p is unlikely to perform the same as another.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think that you might confused at the first table.,it said â€œallâ€ of intel p codename have 8 e-core.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you so much.,"so, i am confused between vostro and inspiron.",i know inspiron would probably give me a better gpu but i am okay putting that aside for a while.,vostro is providing me intel 1260 p and inspiron 1225u.,could you please suggest what would be better?,perhaps there is a website that gives this type of information.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is hard to answer because it really depends a lot on the specific laptop.,"you should ask on a more specialized subreddit like r/laptops 

you might find in notebookcheck reviews for the specific laptops youâ€™re trying to buy.",in general the 1260p should be faster than the 1255u but not if it is thermally constrained.,"also, check the other specifications, how good is the screen in each laptop etc",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so long as a bent pin does not short vcc to vss (ground) you should be okay.,looks like j-30 is the most problematic pin.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have similar issue with two pins at left bottom bend.,"it looks like these are pcie related as i have only 4x in first slot and 8x in second slot, even without nvme drives.",how did you straighten up these pins?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks materidan!,"i have no idea why it's problematic since i'm learning about this while i'm trying to fix but  
if the vcc short to vss then the cpu would be in danger too right?",or only the motherboard?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i bought a simple magnifier on shopee for 5 bucks and used a needle to straighten up them.,at some point i thought i'd break it because i have no experience in doing it.,i'm gonna test it today with a friend's processor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"mostly because it still looks a bit wonky in the photo, and itâ€™s a power pin between two ground pins.",there was someone here maybe a week or two ago with an lga1700 socket with a similar issue where vcc ended up shorting out to vss.,"if it shorts out there will be arcing, the pin will likely burn, the cpu contact pad will be scorched.",and that might be it.,"in the case i referenced above there seemed to be no lasting functional damage, but damage definitely could happen.","i suspect you will be okay, just make sure the pin is definitely leaning in the correct direction and install the cpu very â€œflatlyâ€ so it all just settles into place.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've fixed it the same way just now.,thanks for posting the socket schema with pins description!,great stuff!,now my gpu runs at full 16x pcie lanes :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks again <3 these informations gave me more courage to try it!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"you have normal temps, throttling temperatures for most cpus are above 95c.",run cinabench multi core and check the temps.,if your cpu cooler is in good condition and installed properly the temps shouldn't hit below 90c and it does you could see how the power that is fed to the cpu is going lower and the clock of the cpu will lower that is what throttling means; mobo doing safety messure to keep the cpu below his max operation capability.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"run xtu, check the throttling indicators under load and see what's going on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your cpu isnâ€™t really â€œoldâ€ and very few games put a full load on it with gaming.,that usage looks normal as do temps.,if your fps isnâ€™t unexpectedly low for what ever your gpu is supposed to get then all is a okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for reference i have had my 11700k in an nr200p case with a fuma 2 cooler and was about 60-65c in far cry 6 at 1440p.,in my current dan a4 h20 case with 240mm ek aio i get about 58-62c in the same game,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hey, if it's still meeting your requirements that's awesome.",i don't game much anymore and have a ryzen 1700 for my desktop.,i can't imagine needing a more powerful cpu than this 5 year old 8 core monster - even if modern chips are more than twice as fast.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that was such a good generation for intel.,"i loved my 2500k

plus you have to remember, the latest and greatest cpus are massively overpowered in gaming, unless youâ€™re trying to push like 300fps in a competitive style game like cs-go

yes some do.,"there are 4 b660

i am not sure about that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i donâ€™t think there has been a processor in the last 10 years that can get 30-40% from overclocking outside of ln2.,youâ€™ll be lucky to get 5-10% tops.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the asus boards are better because ddr5 imo because you can achieve better memory overclocks with low vccsa on d5 vs d4.,.95v vccsa is enough for 6400 cl32 d5.,but the boards are generally more $$$ and at that point maybe just get a k chip and cheap z690,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nah it reboots fine.,i never had that issue.,was an issue with msi boards but neither my asus nor this asrock have any issue with boots or reboots.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's happens every generation.,a motherboard manufacturer will allow some models to overclock or some models slip through.,but generally b boards don't allow it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

eh 12400 cpu can be overclock on some motherboard i think,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have terrible news for you, because that won't happen.",if you want to overclock (still for no more than 10% gains) you're better with a z690 and a 12600k or better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ahh.,never went that high for mine.,150bclk would require me to lower the multis which i didnâ€™t need.,i think i was max low 130s or high 120s depending on cpu.,"iâ€™ve oc a g7400, 12100f and 12400. they all oc so nicely.",now dailying the 12400 in one of the rigs at 5.2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

are u sure about that cuz i see plp get 30% gains on 12400 oc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"g7400 has only 33x ring multi, which means you need 152 mhz base clock to hit 5.0 ghz ring, the chip reaches the limit out on ambient cooling basically.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah sorry people can fake things real easy these days,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you won't get a stable 10% oc on a b660 board regardless.,they aren't made for oc and all you will be doing is upping the base clock.,"a z690 board is made for oc and you can tune voltage, clock, ect.",even then... 10% would be huge on these current cpu's.,"intel already pushed these things close to max to compete with amd

edit: spelling",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
u might be confusing boost clocks vs base clocks.,"those happen automatically tho, no need to oc anything.","and as others have said, more than 10% out of an oc is not really gonna happen with these modern cpus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can you share a video or an article of the 30% gains.,i canâ€™t find one anywhere,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no.,b660 boards are not designed to overclock.,very few have the ability to even change your base clock and not screw up the clocks on other board components like usb controllers or sata controllers.,"honestly, for the minimal gains you get these days for overclocking, it's not even worth it when using a k processor and z690 board.",i highly doubt it's worth the major effort to try to oc a non k cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok thx,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> very few have the ability to even change your base clock and not screw up the clocks on other board components like usb controllers or sata controllers.,"base clock doesn't affect pcie or dmi frequency, it's a completely different clock domain on lga1151, lga1200, lga2066, lga3647, and lga1700",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
z390 100% is re-bar enabled.,iâ€™m going to be doing a theme build with a 9700k and a a770 soon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what platform?,i think even more critical than the pcie 3.0/4.0 issue is rebar support.,"without that, performance tanks significantly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it will most likely not make much of a difference.,"the arc a7 cards have a full x16 bus, so the bandwidth at gen 3 should be more than enough.",i can test it out on an a380 which would be more susceptible to performance loss as it only has an x8 bus.,edit: i did some tests with the a380.,"it showed no difference on two of the games, but there was a 2.6% loss on one game (war thunder).",all games tested at 1080 high presets.,chart [here](https://imgur.com/varagas).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this will be interesting and i think game dependent on how memory and bandwidth is utilized.,i know some cards donâ€™t perform as good on pcie 3 x16 vs even 4.0 x8 so it remains to be seen.,people are right to point out tho officially according to the boxes and specs intel wants people on 10th gen or newer and windows 10/11.,probably to ensure 100% that someone using the card has rebar as 9th gen and older users didnâ€™t 100% get the support and it varied mb vendor to vendor.,not to mention official pcie4 came on 10th z490 platform.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it should work but you need rebar for these cards.,so if it is something older than 10th???,gen i think you don't want to do it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i currently have the asus z390-p with i7-9700k and amd 6600xt and i can activate re-bar in the bios and the activation is confirmed in the amd driver software...i keep it activated but honestly i haven't noticed significant differences in games with re-bar active...i don't know if with the a770 there are notable differences if you activate re-bar...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most 8th/9th gen boards got a bios update for rebar.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1.  any good?,itâ€™s ok for integrated graphics.,but not that good.,so-so.,not really up to any real gaming.,"2.  the fix is to buy a new laptop, this time pay closer attention to its specs, most importantly what graphics card it has.",because your computer does not have an actual card.,the graphics chip is integrated into the cpu.,and no you cannot change your laptops graphics card.,this is why you must carefully make your choice when buying.,you get what you get,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what games are you trying to run?,"i have the exact same chip/igpu as you and i've been running games like: batman arkham trilogy, metal gear 5, resident evil village, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
one thing i would recommend checking is what resolution your laptop is natively.,"my dell xps has an 1185g7 with the integrated graphics, but since it has a 4k display it natively tries to render games at 4k which caused horrendous problems.",make sure your games are set to 1080p or lower.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"thank you, i'll do that the next time i try playing smth.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,i would say your assumptions are spot on.,"she wants you to be a good student, not a good gamer.",just remember to look closely at the specs of the laptop you are interested in before actually buying it.,and look up reviews.,the specs are actually decent on the laptop you have now.,not bad at all for a general use/college laptop.,itâ€™s just not a laptop meant for gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the absolute cheapest laptops with an actual ""gaming"" gpu start from 700$ (including tax) in my country and they come with a shitty 1650 which is again very weak for modern and demanding games.",to get something decent you would need to spend at least 1200$ and even then the performance would leave a lot to be desired.,on the upside if you have a good connection you could easily try cloud gaming like amazon luna or geforce live.,that should be your cheapest option.,the other thing you can do is to try to find a part-time job for a few months and buy something like a console/steamdeck/nintendo switch.,pc/laptop gaming is mostly considered a luxury since the upfront cost to entry is the biggest out of any other platform.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the thing is, this isn't *only* about pushing moar cores, it's about litography limits.","it's no secret to anybody in the industry that litography development has been slowing down and everyone is worried we might get to another point of stagnation, one where intel, tsmc & samsung are stuck, which means we would be kinda screwed.","they've begun to get creative with new methods, such as 3d stacking & multi chiplet modules.","the idea around e-cores isn't efficiency itself, it's scalability; sure, you could pump more p-cores.","but p-cores are hot, power-hungry, and if giving more p-cores doesn't increase performance in a meaningful way, they're pointless(aka waste of die space).","therefore, the solution would be adding small cores to bump with brute force over issues they can and add a decent amount of bigger cores that have the extensions you'll need to deal with issues the small ones can not.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the point of having different cores is that single core performance doesn't scale very well with core size.,this means in the space it takes to make 1 big core you can make 4 small cores and the sum of performance of those 4 cores will be more than the big core.,how they actually decide to configure their cpus really depends on how much future apps/games are programmed.,"most high end phones (qualcomm socs) have 1 big core, 3 medium cores and 4 small cores.","i wouldn't be surprised if intel or amd went this way in the future (maybe something like 2 big cores, 8 medium cores, 32 small cores) because with a configuration like that they can dominate single thread, low multi thread and high multi thread while using the least amount of silicon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

let's be real.,the e cores on alder lake have been tested to not even be more efficient power wise than the p cores at anything above ultrabook speeds (https://chipsandcheese.com/2022/01/28/alder-lakes-power-efficiency-a-complicated-picture/).,so these e cores aren't actually power efficient at the clocks intel runs them at in alder lake.,and i'm assuming will be a similar story in raptor lake and beyond.,"the e cores are only much more die area efficient than the p cores, using almost 1/4 the die area of a single p core.","so the e cores sole purpose, which intel won't admit, is to pad out multithreaded scores to win against amd.",simply because if they try to compete in multithreaded performance with p cores their die area would be huge compared to amd's chiplet design.,"it's not a bad strategy, as you can get high single core performance with the p cores while increasing the multithreaded performance using lots of small e cores.",on alder lake if they went all p cores they'd have only a 10-core cpu with slightly larger die area.,and on raptor lake it'll be a 12-core cpu.,at some point though you really get diminishing returns as lots of people's applications don't scale well to many cores and less but faster cores are better most of the times.,"the marketing spin of using e cores for background tasks is bullshit because aside from the challenges of the task scheduler properly doing that, if you just have more p cores then what's the issue of running background tasks to the p cores?",it completes faster and those tasks use up the same amount of computing power regardless of running in the p core or e core.,if you have heavy enough background tasks to run wouldn't you want them to finish faster anyways?,its better to just offload them to a different pc altogether ot just have more p cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i hope this helps answer your question.",there is a limitation.,intel has an advantage with e cores in that they take up less space on a wafer.,so they can produce more chips per wafer.,which gives intel a coat advantage over a competitor and manufacturing in taiwan.,taiwan and us manufacturing costs are similar.,"so if you can pack more cores into a wafer, you will eventually win the long run due to better cost control.",amdahl's law always applies to parallel computing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the point of the efficiency cores is definitely to have higher efficiency than the performance cores (hence the name).,they're also not particularly scalable due to the shared cache and slower interconnect than the p cores.,the design is all about using as little power as possible for tasks where performance is not important.,"intel's scalability focused architecture is the xeon scalable, where they trade some clock and ipc for a high throughput interconnect that can scale to huge numbers of processors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that's also a question of what chipsandcheese tested.,with no power limits both p-cores and e-cores will boost way past their efficiency points.,however chipsandcheese data clearly show e-cores are more efficient at intended ranges.,how would the efficiency look like if you ran a 12900 at its stock setting of 65w?,when you only have 6-7w per p-core and 1-2w per e-core or something like that.,what about the 13900 at 65w when you have even less per core?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

>i get that on laptops you might want to run away with e cores like on an iphone and get better battery life if thatâ€™s what you mean.,but â€œdiverting more power to the p coresâ€ is how it always worked.,well at least since the past 20 years or so.,i'm not saying it is new.,"heck, even the idea of p and e cores existed long ago including co-processors.","i mean by diverting power, is that the chip has an upper tdp that the chip designer wants to stay in.",that's regardless if it is a laptop or a desktop.,"so if you need higher single threaded performance, you need to ramp up the frequency on p cores which requires a lot more power, but your limitation is still tdp.","otherwise, everyone would just ramp the power up as much as they want and even exceed the socket allowance and disregard cooling ability.",we will all be cooling our cpu with liquid nitrogen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"exactly, so why did intel bother to use e cores in their enthusiasts used desktop cpus where even the non k skus don't even respect the power limits on most motherboards.",its not for efficiency here its for padding multithreaded performance to compete with amd.,you show me then where the e cores are actually used in their efficiency range because i don't see it except for maybe in low power sub 35w cpus in laptops.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">that is what we are doing here, yes.","i have not seen anyone else provide any data either

this is foundational stuff that everyone learns their first computer arch course.",no one's going to provide data here because if you're asking such a clueless question you're not going to understand the explanation either.,"if that's not a satisfying answer, go get a textbook.",">that said, if this was such a genius idea, then wouldn't we all be using gpus instead of cpus?",we do use gpus for massively parallel problems in the vast majority of cases.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ok, then try some with just some numbers.",assume p-core runs 5ghz (not really too realistic for heavy multithreaded workload in a large cpu but let's assume it anyways).,assume e-core runs 4ghz (a bit below gracemont top speed).,that means you have 25% higher clockspeed on p core.,let's also assume we have an embarrassingly parallel workload so performance == throughput.,"then remember that p-cores run two threads, which in heavy computational workloads usually means at most 25% more performance.",so now one p-core with hyperthreading runs around 56% more performance than one e-core.,let's then add some ipc advantage.,let's be generous and say 30%.,that would make the one p core with hyperthreading a bit over 100% faster than one e-core.,but a cluster of four e-cores is only a bit larger than one p-core.,so you can have almost twice the performance in that cluster compared to one p-core with just a small area increase.,not to mention running at top speeds is not really at all energy efficient.,in actually heavy computations you would want to clock down both the e-cores and the p-cores quite significantly.,edit: in general when you compare parallelism with clockspeed in embarrassingly parallel workloads two cores is directly equivalent to one similar core at twice the speed.,so it should be pretty darn clear that many cores will always in practice beat one faster core.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i might be out of the loop here but donâ€™t intel cpus already go past tdp?,some go past 300w,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because e-cores are more performance per area?,seems pretty straight forward.,"but also, there is the same point why intel has gpu in their enthusiast cpus even though practically nobody uses it.",the enthusiast k chips are just binned bulk chips.,if they want to sell i5-12600 with gpu to all the office users they have gpu in the 12900k too.,"setting power limits is about motherboard, not the cpu.",diy motherboards donâ€™t usually follow any limits but most computers are not diy.,most chips go to relatively small size cases with small motherboards with small vrms.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> this is foundational stuff that everyone learns their first computer arch course.,no one's going to provide data here because if you're asking such a clueless question you're not going to understand the explanation either.,"if that's not a satisfying answer, go get a textbook.","look, i'm speculating.","i'm not hiding that, but you claim facts, but aren't providing any proof.",provide the proof or just stop.,>we do use gpus for massively parallel problems in the vast majority of cases.,"for a lot of stuff yes, but we aren't using it in place of a cpu, are we?",that should give you a clue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> edit: in general when you compare parallelism with clockspeed in embarrassingly parallel workloads two cores is directly equivalent to one similar core at twice the speed.,so it should be pretty darn clear that many cores will always in practice beat one faster core.,it really depends on the type of parallel load.,otherwise we would all be running on gpus instead of cpus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they do, but there is still an upper limit i.e.",by temperature.,"so they can go up for a short amount of time, but overall the cooling system still needs to be able to dissipate all that heat.","the main point is that, there is a maximum power draw, and how and to what you distribute that power draw matters.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they're more performance per area only in multithreaded tasks which is very rare and few for most people.,so most people would likely see better performance having more p cores instead.,i actually use their igpus.,they're useful for media encoding capabilities not necessarily to drive games so yea i would want igpus.,i still haven't seen proof of a single desktop sku running in the e core efficiency range.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> look, i'm speculating.",this is like speculating that 1+1=3.,you're going to annoy people if you keep doing it.,at a certain point you need to stop arguing and just spend a few minutes on wikipedia to look up how things work.,">for a lot of stuff yes, but we aren't using it in place of a cpu, are we?","for massively parallel problems, gpus have almost completely replaced cpus.",did you really not know that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gpu isnâ€™t like multiple cpus.,gpu is more like multiple very wide simd units.,it can do certain operations very efficiently (namely certain matrix-vector operations) but not run others well at all.,the parallelism of a simd engine is limited to one instruction that is executed on multiple data (which is extremely useful in said matrix-vector operations).,"a gpu workload typically involves first compiling the task to the form that is easy to feed to the gpu, and that can obviously not be done on all workloads.",multiple cpus can execute multiple completely independent instruction streams at the same time.,"what i said about clock speed and core count should stand for all embarrassingly parallel workloads, with obvious caveats about memory system bottlenecks of course.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that makes zero sense.,there are 8 p cores for lightly threaded latency sensitive workloads.,anything that needs e cores will be multithreaded enough.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"many 12th and 13th (z690, z790, h670, h770, and some b660 and b760) support pcie 5.0 graphics.","the cheaper the board, the less likely it will be supported.","some 12th gen and somewhat more 13th gen support pcie 5.0 ssds, however 12th and 13th gen have the same technical specification and 5.0 ssd support can only be obtained by taking 8 of the 16 total 5.0 pcie lanes away from the gpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,"that being said, the new gpus (both amd and nvidia) are pcie 4.0. if you use a top-tier card (e.g.","the 4090) you'll probably be bottlenecked since the x16 lane will be split to x8/x8, and being only a gen4 card, that 4090 can only send information at pcie 4.0 x8 speeds.",check the motherboard specs to see if it requires the x16 slot to be split.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the answer!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if say a z690 or z790 have a 5.0 m.2 ssd slot, but you use a 4.0 ssd in that slot, does it still take away 8 lanes?",the reason i ask is the block diagram states 1x16 pcie 5.0 + 1x4 pcie 4.0 lanes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,because the 5.0 slot is hardwired to the 5.0 lanes.,"it doesnâ€™t matter whether your pcie device is 5.0, 4.0, 3.0 or 1.0, if itâ€™s plugged into the lane itâ€™s using them.",there will be a specific m.2 hardwired to the 4x 4.0 lanes as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you.,that helps me pick out a motherboard.,i wanted 4 nvme drives but don't want to use 8x for gpu.,so essentially a motherboard without 5.0 storage is what i will look for.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"basically, yes.",there are a lot of 5 x m.2 6xx boards where all slots should be usable.,"on a newer board like the asus rog strix z790-e, it has 5 slots and one of them is 5.0, but the other 4 are all safely usable (and pcie 4.0 - note that most 5x m.2 6xx boards will have one 3.0 slot).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

synthetic benchmarks are as useful as quoting the chip's frequency to determine performance.,it's a dick measuring contest that is utterly irrelevant.,a fx9590 could do over 5ghz.,and gets smoked by an i3 that barely manages to boost to 4ghz.,i find it extremely embarrassing that both intel and amd rely on such numbers.,at least cherry pick some real life applications to show that your chip is *clearly* superior to the competition.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

amd cultivated an extremely dedicated fanbase by depicting themselves as the plucky underdog who brought budget options to the table.,they got a great reputation that way as a way to save on your budget.,"now, however, amd are certainly not an underdog, nor are they providing much of anything that could be considered 'budget friendly'.","their fanbase still holds on to the idealistic underdog depiction of amd allowing them to rationalize away their bad decisions and anti-consumer practices, while being hyper-critical of intel's (or nvidias) because intel is 'the big bad evil corporation' and amd is 'the gamers' savior'.",there is no better example of that then the intel's 5800x3d performance comparison slide 'controversy' that just happened.,"when talking about gaming performance of the ryzen 7000 series, amd didn't mention the 5800x3d *at all* and only compared their 7950x against the 5950x and 12900k.",this isn't necessarily a bad thing as the 5800x3d and the -950x and 12900k line aren't really direct competitors (my reasoning being content creation and productivity performance of the top chips vs the underclocked 8 cores of the 5800x3d puts them into slightly different product categories).,"however, in intel's presentation, they compared the 13900k to the 12900k and 5950x (exactly the same way amd did), but intel decided to add an *extra* tick mark to represent the 5800x3d in gaming comparisons, something that amd didn't do, and something amd and intel didn't really *have* to do.","so, who got accused of being misleading and trying to hide the 5800x3d?",amd who didn't mention it at all?,of course not!,*intel* got dragged through the mud because they only added a tick mark and not a full bar and people said that the tick mark was so hard to see when scrolling past the chart.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah if you're not really into extreme overclocking then i'd personally be looking for a cheaper board.,the msi z690 a pro ddr4 board is the best value mobo currently on the market.,"and given the fact that samsung bdie ddr4 still outperforms all ddr5 kits on the market for less money, the ddr4 board is exactly what people should be buying!","the only motherboards that will outperform it are the 2 dimm $500+ xoc boards (evga dark, msi unify x, asus apex (non shit version) with heavily custom tuned 7000+ mhz ddr5.","other than those boards which all use 2 dimm slots, there's really no sense buying an expensive 4 dimm motherboard when the a pro board can do everything for < $200.","it's not like more expensive boards make your cpu run faster unless you overclock anyways and the money you save could be invested in a better gpu, or better ram, or better cooling etc.",all of those make a bigger performance difference than buying a more expensive motherboard (unless of course you leverage that more expensive mobo to overclock your memory more agressively).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that one is a lot less than i was thinking, i was looking at z790 options, but this msi z690 is a lot less.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yea i think the only difference is a 5.0 m.2 slot for an extra â£100.,"the asus matx ddr4 z790 doesn't have a 5.0 m.2 slot and costs the same as my asrock z690, but it has the same crappy vrms, just a few more of them so thats pointless to get.","unfortunately i can't stick to itx for a decent ddr4 board, but already have a lian li air mini case to use anyway (smallest case with full atx support).","the msi one you mentioned is 14+1+1, but the z790 equivilents are 16+1, which might be important for the 350w mode on a 13700k so i'm unsure.","i'll wait until after release and reviews, and also for a software bundle on the cpu, theres no rush as i can sell my 10900k parts as soon as i grab an i3 first for my h670, just waiting for any possible price cuts on the 12100.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

for consumer cpus?,"unlikely, the e-cores are area efficient not power efficient (at least not at the 3ghz+ speeds that intel gives them).","their purpose is to allow intel's cpus to be competitive with/beat amd's in multithread and cost to produce while still using a monolithic die, which historically don't scale well over 10 ""p-cores"".",and they have done a very good job at that so i will not be surprised if future chiplet designs (beyond meteor lake) with over 8 p-cores still have them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's not the point of e cores though.,the fact that they have 16 of them suggests that e cores are not for power efficiency at idle or something.,"if their only purpose was energy efficiency in basic tasks, alder lake would only have 2 or at most 4 of them, like apple's m series.","this is just the direction they have taken, but they will eventually have to split the cpu into chiplets even on desktop due to enormous cost of leading edge nodes.",i wonder if they'll split e cores into a separate chiplet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sapphire rapids hedt will be >8 p cores and no e cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

unlikely.,but what exactly are you doing with the cpu where all p-core design would be better?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they should have named them something else to avoid the improper comparison to apple's e-cores that keeps happening.,"i don't have a perfect name, but i am not a marketing department, there has to be a term that hits the head of their purpose (dedicating some die area parallelizable workloads better).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is evidence of the misnomer alone.",future designs (edit) having 32 of them (purportedly) is even more of a sign that saving energy is clearly not the goal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nah meteor lake is a mobile first launch followed by arrow lake which is rumored to have 32e cores.,"they do kinda save energy compared to an equal p core configuration, while most people think of idle power efficiency cores.",btw meteor lake will be adding low power cores for that exact purpose of lowering idle power and extending battery life.,"so they'll have p, e cores and lp cores.",though they only really matter for mobile segment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i updated my response to be more precise in the spirit of what i was saying.,at least the lp cores are properly named.,"the e cores should have been like m cores or some other term to imply they are for their ""mega tasking"" term they like, anything but e.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

reproduction steps:

- boot a virtualized windows 10 with arc a770 (vfio)
- install the intel arc dch drivers for windows, including arc control and the intel driver & support assistant
- verify that the a770 is now detected in the windows device manager and arc control

- notice that any monitors connected to the a770 are not receiving a display signal

- go to windows display settings and notice that none of the physical monitors plugged into the a770 are detected
  - expected behavior: all connected monitors are detected

thanks for the reply.,sadly it still does not work.,even tried fresh windows 11 install.,even the built in stress test won't launch.,only thing i can think off is some raptor lake and asus strix a d4 z690 compatibility issues.,and me firmware update causing issues for stress test not working anymore.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

vcore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
use the vcore from the motherboard.,"vid is the ""requested"" voltage from cpu and vcore is what it actually gets from the board.","simply speaking if you fix a voltage, the board would ignore vid.",if you provide an offset the board would aim to add that offset to the vid.,cpu-z reads the vid so it is also not the most relevant cpu voltage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so 1.359 seems to be it then, is that a safe vcore at 5ghz, 100% load?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"don't really know how 9900ks do, i would recommend you searching for other overclocking reports on the same cpu.",my only experience with a 9th gen is on a qqby and that thing struggles at 4.1g with about 1.20v.,9900ks should have a much better silicon quality that that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you on windows 11 and using an msi board?,"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/windows-11-update-kills-overvolting-msi

*a recent windows 11 update is halting overvolting and undervolting software enablement on msi motherboards that use intel cpus.","in effect, this means anyone using software-based overclocking utilities such as xtu on an affected system, will be prevented from undervolting or overvolting the cpu with software tools in windows.",*,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
undervolting isnâ€™t dead.,windows just no longer allows you to access some hardware registers from software.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just use the bios?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no it isn't.,you need to disable undervolt protection to use vf offsets on newer bioses.,"if you do that, it will work even in xtu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there are exploits which take advantage of those voltage tweaking features, unfortunately.","see  https://plundervolt.com  and because the exploits affect sgx, an enclave that intel has billed as being a hardware-backed root of trust, it can be used to defeat things like drm.. which it turns out some suit folks don't like so much.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

my 12700k is under a nhu12a and has never broken 65c and all cores are within 1-3c of each other.,i think mainly the issues are with the extremely flat cold plates on aios though not all experience issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bummer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gn testes this extensively and showed improvements above 5c easily.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ive been using a corsair block since day one and never had an issue with temps, friend has same block as well, ive always said its the mounting pressure on some coolers used that causes it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yah not true.,"you donâ€™t understand pcb, or how cpuâ€™s are made.",flexing at any degree over time is not good.,the issue is there is no way to measure to what degree and how much force it is under.,intel is only saying itâ€™s â€œwithin specâ€ because they know these will start to fail outside of warranty.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's not a super big issue since the fix is cheap and some don't even have to do it - but regardless it exists in some form.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
on some specific coolers.,"i got an absolute 0,0c change with the frame.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
on what coolers?,"aios with perfectly flat bottoms, or air towers with convex bottoms?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and 5c is not a big deal.,"it only is an issue for those really pushing their system, or those with marginal coolers.","for the vast majority of users, 5c is nothing to worry about.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i guess i will order a contact frame then.,but the installation seems could cause issues as well if done incorrectly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i dont remember now man, just watch their video.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5c is minimum.,people have seen 10c too - not sure about average.,"it's not just temp reduction but the ""bending"" part in the long run.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, if your temps are higher than what others report, then do it.","if i buy 13700k, i will definitely do it.",i have a custom loop on 9900k and will continue to do the same and what's the point of doing the hard work of custom loop and not do this.,"whatever temps i gain, might be lost due to this issue.",so might as well do it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> not sure about average.,"lower, and irrelevant.","the ihs bending a little isn't going to hurt your chip, a few degrees more aren't either.","or, to be more precise, they'll last just about as long as any other intel cpu, and performance isn't really affected either, unless you're specifically trying to push things.","if there's one thing i believe intel on, it's their take on chip longevity.","so when they say the bending is within spec, it's probably fine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for your case the answer is probably no (weâ€™re in guessing land until benchmarks arrive).,the intel cards are generally compared against the 3060.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"definitely not, no.",performance will probably be about equal to the regular 2080 if it's going to be a bit faster than the 3060.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, wait for reviews before buying it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
okay thank you i appreciate your replies a lot!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the base 3060 is much closer to a 2060 super tbh so if it's near the 3060 the 2080 will just be an all around better card,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

haven't watched the video but i remember hearing this gpu needs resizable bar to work at its best.,z490 is the oldest platform that can enable it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i recently acquired a working pc with an asrock z370 mobo & 9900k for very cheap.,iâ€™ll be doing some digging if they released a bios update with rebar.,if confirmed iâ€™ll definitely consider buying an a770 after benchmark reviews are released.,the le version looks dope as hell.,if it can match or exceed a 3060ti for $50 bucks less intel has my money.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rebar/smart access memory is required.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wonder if there is any difference between pcie 3.0 and 4.0 as i currently have 10700kf.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

rebar works in z390 also (9900k),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it works on amd setups that would otherwise be compatible with ""smart access memory"", also.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"maybe not accross all boards from that generation, but some z370 boards support it with a bios update.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so if iâ€™m on 9th gen, i wonâ€™t have that?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hopefully its minimal, on 10th gen too and am still happy with the performance.",no need to upgrade for a few more generations.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
check your motherboard's website and see if it got a bios that supports rebar.,"afaik, asus, gigabyte, msi and evga (not sure about asrock) released bios updates for z370 and z390 boards so they could support rebar.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

whatâ€™d be the best cpu possible for my specs?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"mobo = motherboard xd
since you have a i5 8400 6c 6 t 

the only best cpu for  9th gen is a i7 8700 6c 12t, the i7 9700 have 8c 8t but is overpricing like i9 9900 8c 12t , the cheap version are engienering samples ( es versions ) but is to you know if your bios have the microcodes

the most cheap/perfomance/low tdp is a mutant cpu ( mobile cpu adapted for desk pc) , almost are engeniering samples from i7 8700-i9 9900 ( mobile es version ) 

somes xeons can be put in lga 1551 6th -9th gen intel, but you need ""magic "" for add microcodes for works in your mobo coffe time cof cof bios mod cof cof",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"dell xps8930: the motherboard has a z370 chipset but looking at the board itself, i doubt it has the right vrms to run unlocked chips.","two cpus i think will be the best are the following:


1. i7 9700 non k
2. i7 8700 non k


the 9th gen cpu has 8cores and 8threads and has better performance in games and specific task compared to the 8th gen with 6cores and 12threads though having higher threads will be beneficial for multitasking.","from your other comment, more threads will benefit you for browsing and gaming so i'd say go for an i7 8700. if you like to game more, the i7 9700 will give you higher frame rates.",these suggestions are assuming you got a good cpu cooler and the weak oem dell power supply included in the build.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so best bang for my buck is a i7 8700 6c 12t?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would i need a special cooler for the i7 9700?,i just have fans.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yea, maybe if you find a i7 8700 or es version for very cheap ofert, 

es version are more cheap cuz are a early version, sometimes turbo boost can be on without demaning process or some like this",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the a770 counterpart is the 3070. they are both ~220w and use 400mm dies, on a 256bit bus.",heck intel is using ~22b transistors while the 3070 only has ~17b.,it's clear as day that intel was trying to make a gpu to compete with the 3070 tier.,they just failed really ***really*** badly.,it performs like a 3060 so they are pricing it as such.,the a580 is just salvaged a770 chips.,"it has -25% fewer working cores, and -20% boost clock speed.",should be up to 25-40% slower than the a770.,that puts it well below a 3050.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel is comparing the a770 against the 3060 though in all their charts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,because it sucks.,they missed their mark by a significant amount clearly.,you don't spend 22b transistors trying to beat your competitors 13b transistor design from 2 years ago.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i donâ€™t think it even stacks against my 1070 from like 5 or 6 years ago, which only pulls 150w - well at least in rasterization itâ€™s probably about the same?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

does anyone else see a giant molex connector at the end?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think this is the first standalone dgpu to feature both an axial and a radial fan.,pretty neat design.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
since when is acer even a gpu aib lol?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's a damn good looking card!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the aesthetics of these intel gpus are 10/10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that actually looks pretty nice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
imagine evga have been working with intel in secret this whole time.,it would be hell of a surprise.,kingpin a770 faster than 3070.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looks beautiful,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
could this be the first gpu to have either a blower-style and a regular fan for cooling?,looks great tho.,"also, another entry to the gpu aib market, which is great.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
giveaway when?,"jokes aside, this card looks pretty dang sweet, and much different from the same old, same old year after year from team green and red.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm looking forward to the review of this card.,i'm loving the unique design,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" >*uh buh but arc is dead only one aib, newegg doesnâ€™t matter buh but but*

a whole bunch of mouth breathers with room temperature iqs to justify why the clowns they follow cannot be doubted.","i seriously love how there are numerous aibs a fe equivalent with the limited edition cards, and how tom petersen and ryan shroutâ€™s video yesterday went out of their way to use newegg figures as their base line for msrp pricing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

and the name is pretty cool.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
actually a pretty nice cooler.,too bad it's such a mid tier gpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is that a real product image?,is this futuristic and interesting design the sort of thing we can expect from intel based cards?,just the new design elements is a welcome inclusion in the gpu market.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am 100% buying,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looks fucking cool,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can't wait for the gpu war.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if i didn't need a 4k card, i'd buy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what a weird design.,"part blower, part fan tied to the cooler.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gonna have to get one for testing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

since today!!,naw they've had prebuilt-specific standard dgpu designs before but this is their first standalone dgpu.,intel must be convincing the non-mainstream potential gpu makers to take a chance with arc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"since dell, lenovo and hp have been",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean they sell samsung b-die ram too.,so acer going for gpus isn't that surprising haha,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

was there ever a mid-tier kingpin card though?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if there turns out to be an evga kingpin a770, i will cum.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> kingpin a770 faster than 3070.

why though?",the power consumption would probably be through the roof for performance that amd can deliver sub 200w with a rx 6800. and the price of a kingpin probably makes it really unattractive as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
until the fan dies?,"what year is this, 2002?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

early 2000â€™s is when pc manufacturers were just starting to figure out how to create better fan technology.,at that time fans died allot quicker and more frequently.,"now days if you have fans dying on your pc case, mobo, or the gpu than that manufacturer is stupid for not testing the product properly and for not making it more robust.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">foreseeable future 

hopefully next round of cards evga and intel can work something out.",would be nice if intel would allow their aibs to buy their own vram modules instead of vram to be sold with the gpu.,could easily see evga putting highly binned vram on their cards if this happened.,"they did it briefly with the 1080ti, and apparently nvidia was pissed when they did that with a specific sku.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"we don't have enough information to determine that yet, but i would be astounded if such a low end device is a power hog.","like yeah, it may not be on par with amd or nvidia cards of this performance level, but it's hardly going to be a 4090.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"more of a preview than a review, i didn't know what flair to use.",i love the arc branded toolkit they're giving reviewers for teardowns,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looks like the gamers nexus toolkit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looks promising but lower end than i was hoping.,if it was on par with a 3070 i'd jump.,still might simply because i can probably afford it!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11900k actually has really good frame time consistency for gaming.,still possibly the best product available right now for that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is no bad products.,only bad prices.,11900k is unironically awesome for fun of overclocking at the current discounted prices.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12th gen is more fun,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you tweak uncore here?,"i've heard that the i9-11900k has higher cache latency than ideal for gaming, so maybe a bit of uncore tomfoolery would improve gaming performance for a relatively small power hit.",just my two cents.,i'll have to try it out myself on my own i9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, everyone keeps on dumping on the power usage and ""bad pricing/timing"" whilst in reality it is a supremely good cpu and the extra power used is negligible on your power bill and with a proper cooler the temperatures are easily handled (can confirm as i own a 11900k now along with a h110 with quad industrialppc-3000 fans, though only at 50% speed).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea if you overclock the shit out of it too and pair it with super low latency ddr4 it actually games really really well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> 11900k actually has really good frame time consistency for gaming.,really?,"why would that be the case, i don't recall any differences vs. 12th gen that i would expect to result in better consistency on 11th.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it might be, but i tried a non k 12600 initially and it was better in everything including cinebench than my 10900k clocked to 5.3 ghz, but the 11900k does have much better per thread performance than the 10900k.",i only swapped it to a 12600k because it couldn't overclock my ram due to my ignorance of not knowing about the locked sa voltage on non ks.,the power draw from 10th and 11th gen overclocking is not worth it at all when an alder lake i5 smokes them in everything at stock speed.,anything pre alderlake from intel is just a waste of sand at this point.,"also it took 1.35v for 5.2 all core on my 10900k, vs 1.23v for 5.0 pcore on my 12600k, much less heat, runs in an itx case again with just a 140mm aio, and so much more performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's a bad product due to 14+++, power consumption is insane even for 6 cores.","tiger lake, the actual product, is intels coolest running cpu ever.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for making me feel better about my purchase lol.,got a z590 and the 11900k for $300.,gonna put it under water in a custom loop and see how much i can get out of it!,5.4-5.5ghz single core perhaps?,"edit: going by the information cb is giving here, it seems this was done on sub-ambient cooling.",probably only 5.2-5.3 ghz then with a reasonable voltage.,damn it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"mainly due to the uarch being updated from skylake, and ipc being very high along with the high core frequency.",cache latency is something different and that's why the 5000 series just about keeps up with these 11th gens in gaming.,a little uncore tweakery might increase raw fps; i'll get back to you on that in a few days once i get my i9 rig up and running.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for sure even a 12600k destroys this at half the power probably lol.,but its fun to play around with and the motherboard and ram to go with is cheaper than 12th gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> i only swapped it to a 12600k because it couldn't overclock my ram due to my ignorance of not knowing about the locked sa voltage on non ks.,how much further improvement over the 10900k did you see after switching and doing the ram oc?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and i'd buy this bad product for $30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea but for just over $200 i don't mind it lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wow i thought i got a great deal getting my set for $400 ish.,that's a great deal haha.,definitely overclock the shit out of it that's what rocket lake is good for.,i was only using a 240mm aio cooler for my cpu to achieve these scores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have the benchies somewhere and posted them here in the past.,"even the 12600 non k stuck at 3600 cl16 was around 30% better in single core, and 10% or more better in multicore than running the 10900k at 5.3 1.4v

ram went up to 4800cl17 using gear 2 with the 12600k but i cant remember how much difference it made, also 3600 cl16 was unstable on both my micron kits which can each pull off 4200cl16 on dual rank e die, and currently 4800cl17 on the single rank e die.","e die was â£150 on a 3200cl16 kit from before any company binned 2x16 any higher (sammy b die was at least â£280 for unbinned 3200, â£300+ for 3200 cl14 at the time), micron b die went down to â£180 for 4400 2x16 right after ddr5 launched, and you can currently only get the 2x8 for â£158.","if i do end up getting a 13700k and new mobo, i will have to upsize to matx for a decent ddr4 board, i already have a lian li air mini to do that with, but it will be a shame sticking that case in a hidden vented closet tv from couch build.","i just had another check and the z690i aurous ultra plus was still never released outside the us, i could still import one but that gets no warranty,and no way i'd be running anything higher than the 12600k on the current aseock z690 itx which has budget weak vrms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how'd you get it for 200$ o_o.,maybe i should upgrade my 11700k lel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's not worth it for sure - and this is coming from someone who swapped a r5 5600 to the aforementioned i9-11900k.,just spend that coin on a capable cooler and overclock the 11700k to 5.1 or 5.2ghz all core.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sometimes i wonder how do people like this even get the money to buy top end products..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you like to play at 720p?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there is always a bottleneck no matter what setup you have and the bottleneck will be a different component depending on what you are doing / playing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's more of how you can maximize the use of your gpu(3090).,"if you aim for such build, i assume you will be playing at 4k or vr so the 3090 might limit you if you like to play on high fps.","else, lower resolution than that, you will have high frame rates already.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i don't quite get how losely people use the term bottlnecking ?,"i have an i9-10900k and a 3080 rtx ventux 3x oc i can say i spend all this money only for getting flight sim as amazing as it can be (msfs) with everything turned all the way up (today in ocotber 2022 that means dlss on terrain slider realism is all the way up to 400 and all options maxed out) i will get as low as 22 fps in lets say new york city discovery flight..... pressing alt-r shows with detailed performance view, i can see that the cpu is only working at about 25% maximum , it never goes past 25% ... the gpu however always used to show 99% however with latest sim update that number now varies between 76% up to 99% .... so clearly i have more cpu power than i need and not enough gpu to get higher frames.","i have ordered a 4090 for a z490 motherboard ... anxious to see how that goes ... also i 'm convinced if i swap out the z490 mother board and get a z690 board with an i7-13700k instead of i9 it will beat the crap out of i9-10900k and even i9-11900k and possibly beat i9-12900k

yes in some games,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"probably in some games, especially at 4k.","edit: not sure why i'm getting downvoted, nobody provided any actual criticism or counterpoint.",i thought it was common knowledge that higher resolutions put more pressure on your gpu and make it more likely to be a bottleneck.,"it's kinda a silly question anyway, they're both very high performance components and you're always going to have something be the bottleneck.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

something like metro or control likely would be at high resolutions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why?,at 4k you're basically always gpu bottlenecked.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the gpu is more likely to be the bottleneck as you go up in resolution.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i added another downvote.,reason is at 4k it still doesn't matter what cpu / ram setup you have as long as its not too old.,"yes the gpu is the bottleneck, but its bottlenecked by the resolution and not the cpu.","this is why i 'downgraded' from a 10900k to a 12600k for a 4k build, and dont want to bother with x700 or x900 cpus anymore.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
context matters.,"at 4k, its almost always gpu bottlenecked however op's questions specifically refers to high end cpu.","so, its bottlenecked not due to cpu but the resolution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"question then, why is it with my outdated ass card can i play some games at 4k, framerate isn't high but everyone here acts like its impossible, im expecting to 4k game with a 40 series if they drop the price",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that not a bottleneck and that's not really a downgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but a future gpu could make it a cpu bottleneck.,saying it's the resolution is like a cop-out and implying there's not a bottleneck.,but there's always a bottleneck.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

> i assume the shift to 4nm will be a really decent step up in efficiency and thermals.,efficiency?,sure.,thermals?,probably not.,"intel (and amd) keep pushing their cpus harder and harder every generation, and smaller node size means more thermally dense, so it'll end up harder to cool (especially for you considering you're coming from a locked 4 core, which also was less thermally dense), the issue here is intel (and amd) haven't been lowering the power consumption, they've been increasing it, more power+more thermally dense means harder too cool.","> if i update now i'd probably stick with my current ddr4

depending on what you do, your performance may suffer, for example, it's already showing certain games can take advantage of the increased bandwidth, might even end up worse in your case since i vaguely remember the memory back during skylake being much lower clocked than the currently available ddr4.","and by the time 14th gen is out, i would expect ddr5 prices to be much much lower than they are now (they've been on a pretty steady decrease in price since ddr5 launched), which means far more incentive to upgrade, especially since you're *likely* on somewhat low clocked ddr4 (which, again, may decrease your performance if you were to upgrade to 12th/13th gen, assuming you bought memory when skylake was new)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in the same boat as you.,will finally make a move from i5-6600 to i5-13600k around black friday.,i don't intend to change the system for 5-7 years at least.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes and no.,and doesn't matter.,yes that's intel renaming nodes.,"no there is no part of intel 7 that measures 10nm, the numbers have been meaningless for many nodes.",it's equivalent density.,doesn't matter because intels node names were changed to match the naming of tsmc and samsung.,intel 7 is very comparable (better?),than tsmc n7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

nice!,thatâ€™s a exactly the cpu iâ€™m considering; it hits the right price/performance for me.,big question is whether i upgrade from 16gb ddr4 (4x4gb sticks) to 32gb ddr5 or stick with what iâ€™ve got.,itâ€™s lots of $$ for not much gain i think but also not future proofed (locked in with mobo choice),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

slightly harder decision with already having 32gb as well!,"i think 16gb won't be enough for much longer so will probably make the jump to ddr5 (given i've got 4 sticks, i can't simply add more on the cheap",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'm not sure why you've set the 'cpu1 temperature' to report in rtss instead of the 'cpu temperature'.,per core temperature readings tend to fluctuate a lot more than the die temperature and depending upon the reported core can often be higher than others.,doesn't mean the cpu is overheating.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had the same issue and replaced the stock intel cooler with a vetroo v5.,my temps never went above 60 celsius during gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

had the same issue here.,bought an aftermarket cooler from deepcool.,now temps don't go bast 75. used to throttle at 100 degrees.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you apply thermal paste?,/ did the cooler come with thermal paste?,"(some come with it pre applied, some dont)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 70-80 degree range is fine.,but that sudden spike to 85 and then back down gives me some bad cooler mount vibes.,are you sure you have all 4 pins all the way pushed in on your cooler.,these can require an uncomfortable amount of force sometimes.,they should make a sharp click when properly pushed down.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"anything low 95 degrees is fine, but you could look into better coolers.",stock cooler exists to just make sure it doesnâ€™t kill itself when running.,"not ideal, but would do the trick",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

are you measuring a single core temperature or the cpu package?,there is a big difference as single can hit much higher than the package or average will.,"&#x200b;

secondly, i too am on stock in 4000d case with 1 intake 1 outtake fan and rx 6700 xt and i hit max 76, usually hovering around 60, idling around 40.

make sure your fan is properly set and that you used sufficient force.","when you tighen the cpu that is tight as hell, same goes for the fan.",it really has to be on it.,"thirdly, make sure you used sufficient amount of thermal paste.","don't fall for the ""its too much paste"", there can never be too much but there can always be too little and you'll be overheating like you are.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
id say its airflow on your case.,and where you keep your case too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not even that bad for a stock cooler.,and that's fine since amd just say cpu are designed to run at 95c 24/7 no problem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

case temp?,?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
add more quality thermal paste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
better thermal paste and an aio cooler unit.,the fluctuation in temp makes me think the paste isnâ€™t making full contact with the cooler and cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

gaming loads generally aren't very thermally intensive.,try prime95 and watch the temps liftoff into space.,the intel stock cooler is barely enough to keep the i5 from throttling under heavier loads.,even a $40 tower cooler would make a massive difference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s $34.99 on amazon.,if you want you can spend a dollar more for thermalrightâ€™s peerless assassin 120 se which is $35.90 and iâ€™m currently using it for my i7-12700kf.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the biggest one for a while was microstuttering on games,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i used to be on team amd.,"when i first started computing, the computer store that sold me the pc recommended me an amd system.",because back then 2000s they were more affordable than intel systems.,i was a dumb kid.,i was just happy to have a gaming rig/system.,it underperformed like crazy.,gpu wasn't top of the line.,but i was happy.,"fast forward to when i was in college, and i had an amd system still.",i picked up that tahiti gpu (7970ghz ed.),i think they were matching nvidia stuff.,i figured why not.,let's go team red.,at that point i switched to an intel i7 930. the first generation core.,at that time intel was doing great.,they introduced the core2duo and they were performing great.,so why not pick a good performing cpu?,so i was intel/amd during that time.,but then i started noticing that my games and drivers weren't so hot.,and it turned out that ati/amd just did not have the best driver support.,i think i dropped gaming for a bit until mid 2010s for work or life or whatever.,and then i finally jumped ship.,from 7970ghz ed tahiti to 1080ti gpu king!,(bought maybe 2 years after release).,and man was that great.,gaming was good.,now i am on intel despite similar performance from amd.,i mean you buy what you buy.,the market isn't really all that big.,i could go either way.,amd/intel for the cpu or nvidia/amd for the gpu.,just go with what gave you a good experience in the past.,they are all good stuff.,and in the past amd had no cpu presence in the laptop space.,they just did not have a competing compelling product in that segment.,so it was only intel.,the intel stuff got a bad rap because well.,laptops have a designer and those guys are always going for thinner devices.,but you need cooling.,just is what it is sometimes.,my 2 cents.,sorry for bad formatting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lower latency memory controller for better gaming performances  and frametime consistancy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
familiarity with the platform and gaming performance is generally better on intel.,amd is still great though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i bought an i5 10400 only because it was the cheapest option at the time, i mean i payed a lot the motherboard but it was still cheaper than if i would have bought a ryzen 5. i don't prefer intel over amd and viceversa, just buy the option for you",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had really bad issues with an ati graphics card a long time ago and swore to never buy anything from that brand ever again.,until last year when amd cpus where just too good to pass up.,unfortunately after a few months of use the motherboard died.,"i still use the cpu now but i always have in the back of my mind, that something could go wrong at anytime.","i know it is just bad luck, but that just never happened to me with intel/nvidia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
look man these companies are like hoes to me.,i go for whatever does the job better for the money.,recently build a 12700f system for myself.,had a 2700x system before that.,recommended/built for other people countless intel and amd(the last few years mostly amd as they were offering more performance per â‚¬).,currently i tend to recommend intel unless you can get a 5600+decent b550 motherboard for  cheaper than a 12400f+decent motherboard combo.,or you already have a am4 motherboard and selling both cpu+motherboard aint worth it and upgrading is better.,will likely recommend amd again if their prices come back down to earth.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

stability.,"i've used amd in the past and back then it was terrible, last amd cpu i had was the fx-8150.","they may have improved, but i'm not spending â£700 or more to take that gamble.",i'll just get something i know works.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"mostly a matter of things have less issues on intel (historically), they have integrations with more technologies and software quicker than amd does.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
confidence.,a very long time ago i had an amd that kept having bugs and compatability issues.,"i've never had it with intel so i have confidence, and the i7 i've had for 5+ years i honestly think is still good enough to do anything.",so i want another i7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel has better looking motherboards.,"nothing against amd, my current system is a 1800x and 6800xt and my previous one was a phenom ii based system.",the only issue are the plain looking motherboards,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
stability.,"my current desktop pc is an intel, and has been running 24/7 since 2017 and has never frozen, bluescreened only once and that was due to the driver of a chinese development hardware.","my current work pc with a ryzen i've had for little over a year, and it bsods or freezes on average maybe once per couple of weeks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thunderbolt and decent integrated graphics was a selling point for my current laptop.,amd didn't have a good 2-in-1 at the time.,be careful using past comparisons as a key decision point.,performance can change a lot over the years with updates and the current generations out of amd are a whole different beast than the a10 gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i don't prefer any cpu or gpu vendor, i always try to buy what makes sense at the time.","for cpu-s, this has meant intel for almost 20 years now (my most recent amd cpu was an athlon 2800+ that i bought in 2004) but i'm always open to all options!","right now, i'm very much considering a 7600x or 7700x but i will wait until intel's 13th gen releases, look at the benchmarks and decide then.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i did until 2 years ago.,now i prefer them equally.,originally it was because it was just straight up superior.,it also worked better with less bugs then ryzen.,i knew something was changing when intel refused to change their manufacturing node.,i had the 8700k then 9900k.,both were top tier.,10th gen was good but that's when amd caught up.,11th gen was a huge failure and amd surpassed them.,imo....what's happening is a flipping.,amd used to be the king of workloads and intel the king of gaming.,i'm a few months the 13900k will be the king of workloads and the 5950x3d the king of gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i used both.,i liked both.,depends on what you need to buy.,"i needed a cheap ass cpu in 2017 so i bought a4-3300 then wanted a better cheap ass cpu with relatively good igpu so i bought a10-7860k in 2018. then i decided to make a good pc after saving some money, at that time, 9400f was a price efficient choice.",so i got it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"when i bought my 10900k on launch, it was very close.","it was better than the ryzen 3000s at the time but not by much, and while the ryzen 5000s launched a couple of months later, it would have still been another 6-8 months to actually find them in stock.","when building my 4k lounge rig, the alder lake i5s were the best chips at the time for the cost, amd didn't have anything to compete in that price category, and before ryzen and after core 2s, amd were mostly junk.","currently i am sticking to ddr4 as i already have two very good 32gb micron kits for super cheap, and i read that amd's latest platforms are ddr5 only, so i'm still looking at chips i can use with ddr4, but based on 13th gen prices it looks like i'll be having keep my 12600k and most likely a 12100 for my second pc for a very long time now, and then only possibly a 13th gen upgrade after some heavy price cuts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"because for similar priced amd and intel cpus in us, the intel ones are always way cheaper in my country.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ä° prefer amd generally,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"while your experience is accurate, it's also very outdated.",i loved my 6700k back when amd was either making horrible cpu's or not making them at all.,"but ever since ryzen came out, it's been much closer.","and the last couple of generations have boiled down yes, intel's single thread still makes them the technical gaming king, but amd is only a few frames behind, and their multi core absolutely kills.","and the total system costs is lower, socket support is far superior... watch some videos on the new 7000 series cpu's vs intel's 13 gen.  you might find yourself wanting to switch",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"imma be lazy and instead of writing my own reply i'm just going to say ""this""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
indeed.,i switched to ryzen when it came out because my work benefited greatly from the multicore performance and was massively cheaper than the intel alternative.,if intel had something that was better i would have bought their product.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fair perspective.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
actually this is what has been causing amd instabilities in the systems.,it may last the same socket for generations but they cannot fix everything with just a bios update .,the cpu lanes are different with every new gen. it may have the same socket but it was not designed in the first place to work with this gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do they have employee discounts?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"same here, especially with amdâ€™s approach to laptop gpus",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"funny enough, i got that feeling after switching to ryzen.",imo that feeling is just what you get when making a big cpu upgrade regardless of the company,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is a very odd reason it's a cpu you through it in and i couldn't tell you if it's intel or amd without looking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why don't you like it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's fair, but i think the playing field has evened out in that regard.",there were some serious issues when alder lake launched.,"and now with am5 just launching, you can expect there will be similar teething issues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i have noticed that too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have to agree there.,i prefer the intel based motherboard 'look'.,that said i usually prefer the amd centric ddr sticks!,yes i know it's a poor way to choose but these days our battle stations are also showpieces.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why in your opinion the 11th gen was a huge failure?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why didn't you check the benches before you bought.,the performance wasn't a secret.,not sure why you day it happens on every amd cpu.,you will be sad to learn every cpu has dips in performance and current amd parts perform basically the same as current intel parts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how are you convinced that's normal behaviour.,random freezing and rebooting isn't normal lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's always like that with amd.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that's a very ignorant statement,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it sounds to me like a gimmick made by intel to increase benchmark scores to win reviews.,no real benefits to us costumers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"historically, there always was.",i used to work fixing computers while in college and the wisdom in the old tick tock days was to expect new platforms (plus new node) to always have teething issues both hardware and software.,doesn't matter amd or intel.,both have been making processors for a long time and both steal talent from each other (it was basically the same pool of engineers).,i would argue that intel got its reputation for reliability because it wasn't advancing architecture as fast as possible due to lack of competition.,they just kept on refining the same arch for more than 2 years.,"back when amd was competitive in the athlon 64 days, intel had loads of teething issues as compared to sandy days.",another factor was that amd was struggling to stay afloat and the companies resources shrunk and so they didn't have as great a ability to improve drivers and such.,this is not true nowadays.,the pace of development is astounding.,they've fixed so many longstanding weaknesses just in the past year.,there is recency bias at play as well.,"anyways, 12th gen had teething issues and so will zen 7000. in my estimation 13th gen will probably be more stable but that's only for the reasons i mentioned above.",meteor lake and zen 5 will have teething issues.,zen4x3d will probably have less.,rule of thumb is to wait a few months after new platform releases to see what boards/ram/other components stand out from the pack in reliability and performance and to see what issues the early adoptors are facing.,"same for amd and intel, i don't discriminate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because it was a step back from the 10th gen. still on 14nm while amd was on 7.  intel threw so much power at it trying to keep the top single core speed the chip was literally lava to cool.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because i did check benches from hardware unboxed which showed no such chronic dips.,only 6 months after i got my system did i watch framechasers video about the intel 10900k vs the 5950x on warzone in regards to unique dips on amd cpu's.,https://youtu.be/b1ocvyakdbe start at 12:49,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the first one was 4750g.,there must be some compatibility issue with b450 at first (asrock).,it regularly freezed on me once every 2-3 days.,i purchased it on ebay from some random chinese dude thus i couldn't return.,"i gave it another try after a new agesa version released, it then actually behaved much better.",only 1 freeze every 2 weeks lol.,"i gave it another try when 5700g came out, this time with a different mobo (b550 msi).","same fking thing, .",i literally gave up.,i ended up rebooting them once a week.,only then i found out both of these motherfker just randomly don't recognize my nvme at boot.,"my intel nas at the same time, was running stable 24/7, zero issue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it was an empirical finding to the lab i used to work from 2010 to 2019. there were a tiny to none amount of â€œno logicâ€ problems found when we used an amd cpu with its current gen mobo ,in contrast using older gen mobo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and with some research we had done it was the most possible case.,cpu lanes in mobos where designed completely different with each gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well he is correct but you could of looked that up easily enough.,does having hardware engineer tell you it is as stated help?,"(retired in 2019)

"i agree, the efficiency cores don't help with gaming, some even disable them to get better gaming performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> rule of thumb is to wait a few months after new platform releases to see what boards/ram/other components stand out from the pack in reliability and performance and to see what issues the early adoptors are facing.,"same for amd and intel, i don't discriminate.",i couldn't agree more.,this is the way.,well said.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm no expert but researching online it seems that the 11th gen doesn't have that big of a difference in watt and yet surpasses the 10th gen in both single and multicore benchmarks, let alone memory speed, memory bandwidth, pcie...etc, i don't see how it's a huge failure now tbh, seems like a great leap forward imo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if the benches show similar performance on other cpus then you know you will still have them when you swap lol.,inconsistent frame times are normal.,if you want gaming with extremely smooth frametimes all the way down to the 0.1% lows you really need very high performance and can often require significant effort into tuning ram to do that.,it's no all this brands cpus are bad.,tarkov for example sees the 5800x3d easily best the 12900k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the main things that soured 11th gen was how late it was, how many 10th gen boards were not actually compatible, andâ€¦ the 11900k.","that cpu was a complete non-starter, and could barely compete with the 10900k, never mind actually be faster, because of the drop from 10 to 8 cores necessitated by the backport of a 10nm core to 14nm.","otherwise, the rest of them really werenâ€™t that bad.",it was definitely faster single core.,"the 11700k was a decent boost over the 10700k, as were most of them over their predecessor, and they added pcie 4.0 support and dedicated lanes for an ssd.","but then it was only out for 8 months before being replaced by something much faster, had no future upgrade path, never had a model released on hedt, and was literally intelâ€™s only (very late) pcie 4.0 platformâ€¦ making it a rather odd curiosity in the footnotes of intelâ€™s cpu releases.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"honestly intel has made a 225w card with a 400mm gpu die - both specs which match the nvidia 3070, and they have the advantage of using the more advanced tsmc 6nm node, but they are comparing themselves against a 170w 3060 which uses a 300mm die on samsung 8nm.",as a consumer perhaps perf/$ is all one looks at.,but looking at this from an engineering perspective and the cost to make this... alchemist is significantly behind.,"it very much looks like intel was targeting the 3070 and fell short, forcing them to cut prices and target the 3060. versus amd, this looks competitive with navi 23 (radeon 6600): a 237mm die in 130w on tsmc 7nm.","look at the die size, look at the power consumption, that should tell you what the company's intended target was here.",the performance gap here in perf/watt and perf/transistor is shockingly bad.,perf/watt is critical for whether the architecture will succeed in the laptop market which is thermally constrained.,perf/transistor is critical to be financially viable in the market.,"two years after the nvidia 30 series launched, and using a much more advanced tsmc node, and this is what intel brings to market?",yeah this does not bode well.,this looks like a firesale at cost or maybe even a loss.,battlemage is going to need to deliver **significantly** more performance in 2023 if they hope to be competitive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">honestly intel has made a 225w card with a 400mm gpu die - both specs which match the nvidia 3070, and they have the advantage of using the more advanced tsmc 6nm node, but they are comparing themselves against a 170w 3060 which uses a 300mm die on samsung 8nm.",as a consumer perhaps perf/$ is all one looks at.,but looking at this from an engineering perspective and the cost to make this... alchemist is significantly behind.,"it very much looks like intel was targeting the 3070 and fell short, forcing them to cut prices and target the 3060. versus amd, this looks competitive with navi 23 (radeon 6600): a 237mm die in 130w on tsmc 7nm.","look at the die size, look at the power consumption, that should tell you what the company's intended target was here.",>the performance gap here in perf/watt and perf/transistor is shockingly bad.,perf/watt is critical for whether the architecture will succeed in the laptop market which is thermally constrained.,perf/transistor is critical to be financially viable in the market.,"performance in gaming and consequently perf/watt and perf/transistor heavily depends on drivers

actual ray tracing is amongst the absolute silliest replies i've seen trying to talk up one product against another.,"it's literally the same code, written and calculated the same.",the reality is those 'shaders' are simply capable of doing far more complex and wide ranging calculations and to a greater degree of accuracy while the 'real ray tracing' is just simplified smaller cores that are good for ray tracing and much worse for other things.,"you're implying amd can't do real ray tracing, real ray tracing was being done back in the 90s on a cpu, just really, really, insanely slowly.","performance is the only metric that matters and we've seen benchmarks and how the arc gpus really stack up, using a huge die and huge transistor count, power, on a better node all to match dramatically more efficient lower power gpus from nvidia and amd.","in terms of being caught up, this is even more laughable and amd has pretty much since dx9 been at the fore front of all new technologies, when they are sensible to do so.",ray tracing on a card that performs at this lower midrange level is pretty much worthless and dedicated hardware for it only wastes performance when you don't have rt enabled.,"that's a bad thing in this range, not a good thing.","amd don't have dedicated rt cores, because they are still very very wasteful.","also did you see the massive range of rt benchmarks intel pushed to show how much better it was than amd today, none, because showing 15fps ray traced instead of 60fps without isn't much of a win if your competition's card in the segment gets 12fps ray traced but 65fps without.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">actual ray tracing not done in shaders like amd

amd doesn't do ray tracing in shaders, they have dedicated rt units in the cu that accelerates the ray-box and ray-triangle calculations.","essentially a functional equivalent to nvidia's rt cores, except smaller and less powerful.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
comparing the hardware specs of a 2 year old architecture to a brand new architecture obviously should show growth.,"rdna3 has way better media encoders and decoders than rdna2, much better ray tracing, and uses chiplets.",intel is good to have these features but they also do it at a worse efficiency and die space than amd and nvidia do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in what world is nvidia so far ahead of amd to not even consider them as an option?,"while i appreciate nvidia's features with reflex, ray tracing, dlss 3, proper encoding, and tons of other stuff, as an ""average"" gpu user (gpu = gaming) these features still have nowhere enough persuasion power.",i look at raw raster perf and price.,there are thousands of games out there and only a fraction of them implement ray tracing and dlss (properly).,my most recent example is cyberpunk.,"i want a smoother, high refresh rate and can't get that with an rtx 3070, let alone with ray tracing.","in such situations, i'd much rather have an rx 6800 for those extra 20% fps or more in cyberpunk.","what's the point of going for ""modern"" rtx 3000 when it's not capable of proper ray tracing gameplay and it's going to be obsolete by the time 4000, 5000, and so on series release?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">  perhaps in the long run that arc gpu could compare against a 6700xt/3070

unlikely.",in vulkan and dx12 it's 3060-ish.,in dx9/10/11 its reported to be 3050-ish.,"since vulkan and dx12 aren't reliant on drivers since it's direct, low-level access to hardware, what you see is what you get.",optimizing that shim might get 1-2% finewine.,but with dx9/10/11 it might see uplift over time back to 3060 territory.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>perhaps in the long run that arc gpu could compare against a 6700xt/3070.,but you're taking a risk by betting on that happening.,agree with the rest of your post but this is too big a performance gap to bridge.,"compared at 1440p to rtx 3060, 3070 is a whopping 47% faster, 6700 xt is 35% faster, and 3060 ti is 32.5% faster.",there is a big gulf between 3060 and 3060 ti.,"https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gpu-hierarchy,4388.html

some things to note on this comparison.,one they're comparing only to the rtx 3060 and not amd's competition.,two they are taking the **average** price of a 3060 on newegg and comparing it to the **msrp** of the a750.,i am curious what the numbers would look like if they used the $300 after rebate 6650xt on newegg as the competition.,"as usual though, wait for independent benchmarks and not intel's misleading ones which compare price/perf instead of performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what are your voltages under load?,have you confirmed that the fans and pump are all running?,what were the temps before you repasted it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is that msi game boost?,"gives some mhz and lots extra voltage, try without and see what you get.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a couple of minutes?,my 9900k hits 100 within a few seconds.,never get above 80c in games.,it's odd how you guys worry about temperatures in benchmarks when the most demanding thing you'll do is play games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you peel the plastic cover off from the bottom of the heatsink?,edit.,nevermind.,msi auto oc seemed to be the problem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"voltage: 1.4133 v

pump and fans: all the fans are working and i can see the pump rpm at about 2700rpm in full load

temps before: the same although it reached 100 degrees faster with the pre aplied paste",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, it is",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which specific voltage?,if that's your actual vcore then that's pretty high.,you should be around 1.25-1.35 at stock settings depending on your motherboard.,"if you're using multicore enhancement, you should be able set the max auto voltage to something like 1.3 or 1.35 which should help.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whithout game boost it reaches about 77 degrees,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this is how core temp shows in full load

https://imgur.com/a/3mur5yt",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"vid isn't the actual voltage, but from that image it does look like your motherboard is set to go all out.","i'm not too familiar with msi's bios, but i would first try turning off game boost.",if that doesn't help see if you can locate the auto voltage setting and turn it down to something safer like 1.3v.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this is how it looks with game boost turned off

https://imgur.com/a/1yu2aov",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it looks like that's your issue then.,you've dropped your vid by .2v and your overall power by nearly 100w.,it's likely that your 240mm aio or your overall airflow setup just isn't adequate for the 11700k at full bore.,"if you can find a voltage limit setting you might still be able to use game boost, otherwise i might recommend looking into an 11th gen overclocking guide and just doing a reasonable manual overclock with a lower voltage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think i have good airflow since my case has some mesh in the front.,"this is my case [https://imgur.com/a/fn8e2ms](https://imgur.com/a/fn8e2ms) 

so maybe the cooler is the problem",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"considering your temps dropped to reasonable levels when you removed the auto oc, i'd say your cooler is working as expected.",but yeah 240mm rads aren't a ton of surface area for modern cpus.,11th gen in particular was infamous for being extremely hot and power hungry.,"definitely look into undervolting, or if you're feeling adventurous there is always delidding which helps intel chips a lot.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

for a nas where you probably won't hit the power limits very often there would be little difference.,"if concerned you could set the non-t to have the t power limits, but probably not helpful.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8500t should use less power during bursty workloads (like opening a web page).,"single core max clock is lower, which mean lower voltage and therefore less power.",the slightly longer operation time shouldn't outweigh the gains from voltage.,"but even the non-t doesn't seem to clock that high, so the difference should be fairly small.",(even less/ or even the other way round) if you underclock the non-t...),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for your comment!,how would i set the t power limit on the standard i5 8500?,do i need a specific motherboard or most of them support that option?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can set power limits in your bios or with intels xtu tool.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"theyâ€™re just slower, energy and size efficient processors.","what runs on them is dependant on what your system wants to run on them but, yes, generally speaking the idea is they can be used for background tasks while something more important  and demanding uses the p-cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ecores is just marketing name.,it's just slower cpu cores without hyper threading .,they are also smaller so intel can cheaply pack a lot of them.,usefully for productivity or some benchmarks.,they suck for games.,if you want more fps in games just disable e-cores in bios.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
math,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is a good explanation.,"i would also add for op that you shouldn't think of them as replacement cores, they're really more supplimental.",chips like the 12400 only have p cores and operate exactly the same as any cpu made in the last couple decades.,"now look at something like the 12600k, and it's doing the same thing, but it adds e cores which can offload some work from those p cores to save power.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"lol, what is this, the fourth posting here in 12 hours of a video that neither talks about nor demonstrates anything actually new?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this has nothing to do with thread director.,applications do not need to be updated for this behavior.,hell you donâ€™t even need windows 11 to achieve what was shown.,everything in the demo video was standard window 10 scheduling behavior.,same thing windows 10 did with arm big.little scheduling while on battery.,nothing new.,"notice when asked if this same behavior would occur on windows 10, intel doesnâ€™t directly answer.","they instead merely say they recommended windows 11.

none of this is impressive or innovative.",itâ€™s also not even the ideal outcome.,if you were merely browsing the web while waiting for your workloads in the backgroundâ€¦ have fun because they are restricted to e-cores despite the fact your 8 p-cores are mostly idle just running chrome.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that, and if you go emulate their workload on, say, a 5900x it'll run riftbreaker just as smooth on 24t.",nothing new under the sun here.,wide threading allows wide work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"actually, no.",if you browse the web you are likely to have free p cores for the other major workloads.,this demo showed rift breaker which can use all 8 p-cores and that's why the secondary tasks was scheduled on the e-cores.,"rules of thumb is use all p-cores, then e-cores, then hyperthreads.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wrong.,the minimized app is scheduled exclusively to e-cores as currently configured.,thatâ€™s why they show all the p-cores going idle before starting up a new foreground task.,the rule of thumb you are talking about applies to the foreground app scheduling behavior.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"only on balanced power plan, on high-performance plan it behaves as i described.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but then you've simply reconfigured the windows scheduling policies and now the scenario intel demoed won't work at all.,"the background processes won't be restricted to e-cores and will continue to impact the foreground on p-cores, thus defeating the entire purpose of what intel is advertising here.",the ideal is a system that has negligible impact to the foreground while still achieving maximum remaining performance out of the background workload.,the balanced profile nerfs background performance into the ground (only 1/4th to 1/3rd of silicon is available).,the high perf profile gets you the same experience as non hybrid impacting the foreground.,neither is what people want.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as i wrote before, background processes are scheduled on the e-cores in this demo because this game can use all 8 p cores.",this is exactly the ideal scenario.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"however, that behavior - minimize the program and all of its processes get dumped to e-cores - is already current behavior, and has nothing to do with that game specifically using 8 cores.","and if it does have something to do with that, then it's a poor demo, because what's shown is already what happens for everyone.","now, if the game really only wanted 6 threads and the scheduler left 2 p-cores churning away on those background tasks?",that would've been new...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i was about the game running focused on 8 p cores, while blender using the e cores.",not the minimization demo.,"my point is, if the game was using 6 cores max, the 2 other p cores would've been used for blender, hence giving foreground tasks the best process power it can.",(assuming power plan isn't set to save power),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is that different from how itâ€™s worked for the past year?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that requires ddr5 and will not work at all with ddr4.,i'd suggest getting a 6000+ mt/s kit though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have used 12600k + gigabyte z690 gaming x combo for almost a year now.,it\`s brilliant.,my 2x16gb cl16 3200 ram runs easily cl14 (3200mhz 14-14-14-32 1t gear1) as we are just so matured on ram support.,"while background processes running, i get in cinabench23 over 17k multithread score and over 1900 single thread score.",on win11.,"similar perf than new ryzen4 7600x, but hell a lot of cheaper.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't think it's much of a big difference between the two considering the potential of ddr5 is still early but pricey.,then again ddr-4 cl14 was the cream of the last 3 years and less pricey.,there are youtube reviews out there which put them neck to neck on specific titles or synthetic benchmarks.,happy research bro.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

dang thats rough my brothers 11400f does -100mv just fine but the bios would only allow -50mv on it so we had to use throttle stop,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

\- 0.2 v is - 200 mv which is not a low undervolt at all.,it's actually a significant undervolt which could likely cause instability.,"i don't know what kind of undervolts the other guy is applying, but for undervolting cpus start by applying a negative offset like - 0.050 v and move from there and check if the system is stable with tools like occt or prime95.","the other guy probably thought you applied 0.2 v as fixed voltage, which is way too low, but as a negative offset - 0.2v is too big to start off.","that being said, the real problem could be that you didn't mount your cpu cooler correctly / case has poor airflow / bad fans placement / bad fans orientation / cpu fan pwm header connected in the wrong place / room temperature too hot / low tier cpu cooler / bad bios settings / auto oc applied by some crappy mobo software, because the 12600k shouldn't be running that hot on stock settings after 3 minutes on r23.","anyway, undervolting does not reduce performance, it's used to get similar or better performance at a lower power consumption than stock (optimizing performance per watt).","lately there have been some problem with undervolting that may be due to various reasons (core integrity, bios update, intel microcode, undervolt protection which prevents undervolt in runtime with xtu), you might want to look into that, maybe after fixing the real problem, if it's fixable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i finally managed to do it by changing the vcore voltage mode and the internal cpu vcore to auto.,"i started with -80mv but the system did not boot so i tried -70mv, -60mv, and -50mv.",i couldn't boot with values higher than -50mv.,it seems to be working fine.,do you think i can improve it somehow?,"also, should i max all the cores under ""turbo per core limit control""?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

because intel finally made a huge step from 12600 to 12600kf?,more clock and 4 extra cores which to me sounds good for futureproof.,it used to be only locked and lower clock thats it which would've been fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12600k have e cores which non k variant doesn't have.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"stock for the 12600k is 125/150, but if your cooling is good enough most people with a k cpu and a good motherboard vrm would eliminate the limits and let the cpu draw what it wants.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ah makes sense,
i let cinebench r23 run today and it was at max 116w when i set 150w both and 4.51ghz all core i guess.",temp went max 63celcius on all auto.,vrm should be good its the msi pro b660a.,ty for the tipps!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have a feeling 13th gen raptor lake is going to rectify a lot of power consumption pain points of 12th gen alder lake has had on mobile thanks to their ""upgraded intel 7 process"", ""faster â€˜raptor coveâ€™ core"" and ""larger l2 cache"" (link: https://download.intel.com/newsroom/2022/2022innovation/13th-gen-intel-core-desktop-media-presentation.pdf).","we can already see later in this linked slide deck that 13th gen raptor lake's flagship, the core i9 13900k, has identical performance to the last generation at only 65w, or a mere quarter of the power draw.",that means the core i9 13900k is only 1000 points off in the benchmark cinebench r23 (27500 points versus 28500 points: https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/11_eco_cinebench_r23_nt.png?w=1200) from the ryzen 9 7950x at 65w power mode which translates to a huge efficiency improvement to where they were with alder lake.,so i would not be the least bit surprised that intel sees some significant improvement and at least closes the gap in multi-core performance in the mobile processor market with 13th gen raptor lake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can you check how much power is the system agent using while performing these benchmark at different power levels?,i've noticed on the h-class of my laptop that it never went much below 5w so it chocked the cpu cores out of power at low tdps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
comparing mobile cpus isn't saying much unless both laptops are the exact same models with the same cooling system.,otherwise it's useless.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what are the actual specs of the laptops you are using?,"unfortunately this test is meaningless if they are different chassis, with different cooling!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> we can already see later in this linked slide deck that 13th gen raptor lake's flagship, the core i9 13900k, has identical performance to the last generation at only 65w, 

it's worth noting that, adl is run waay beyond the reasonable efficiency window, and that rpl added a bunch of cores.",that helps a lot in getting that 25% power draw figure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
any news on dlvr?,or is that reserved for the raptor lake mobile launch?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">we can already see later in this linked slide deck that 13th gen raptor lake's flagship, the core i9 13900k, has identical performance to the last generation at only 65w, or a mere quarter of the power draw.",that's because it has 8 more small cores.,"so all cores are running at a lower frequency overall, which increases their efficiency.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to some degree, but it is also the process too.",the little cores accounted for less than a quarter of the power and the performance with 12th gen and the same general idea that the e cores have the minority of the power and performance holds true here.,the process improvements have upped efficiency.,"while the core count does admittedly help by allowing more cores to do the same at lower voltages, there are process improvements that are bringing increased efficiency for the p cores that draw far more power than the e cores despite them having fewer cores.",that is why even the core i7-13700k can operate at a higher frequencies (up to 5.4 ghz and 4.2 ghz for the p and e cores: https://download.intel.com/newsroom/2022/2022innovation/13th-gen-intel-core-desktop-media-presentation.pdf) across the board than the core i9-12900k (up to 5.1 ghz and 3.9 ghz for the p and e cores: https://download.intel.com/newsroom/2021/client-computing/12th-gen-processor-product-brief.pdf).,the core i7-13700k draws the same power (125w) as the core i9-12900k it shares the same core cluster configuration with.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this doesn't tell folks anything new.,it's already known applications brought to the forefront on the desktop gets put on the p-cores and applications running in the background get put on the e-cores.,the problem is that this is not what intel promised.,"say you're rendering, exporting video, or doing whatever project.",said project size will take 30 minutes to complete.,"in the meantime you want to open a web browser to watch some youtube, do some shopping, and browse reddit.",you open your project and wonder why it's been an hour and it hasn't completed.,"well, the scheduler moved your project to the e-cores and placed your web browsing on the p-cores since it is what was in the forefront.",that's a big problem.,"it was promised that the ai built in the windows 11 scheduler would intelligently divide workloads to proper cores seamlessly, and it doesn't.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tldr: itâ€™s updated.,how?,itâ€™s better.,how?,"letâ€™s show a demonstration of how things work already, and that should clear things up.",sigh.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
isn't this what people have been complaining about?,i've seen several threads of people saying their p-cores aren't being used when they minimize handbrake,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
man i remember i got shat on for simply suggesting w11 is better for alder lake on a thread asking which version should  they go for with their alder lake cpu.,"""w10 has the updated scheduler"" what they said.apparently not as updated as w11 it seems  if what this guy is saying is the truth.","still this video is still vague ""updated"" how updated?i don't get why w10 would be exampt from a scheduler tweak when w11 is basically a reskin.",(and there's already some scheduling changes made for alder lake+ on w10),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep.,"one way around this is to put handbrake on a second display, then it stays ""in focus"" and remains on p cores and you can then do something else on your main display like browse.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same socket -- same ihs -- they will fit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the better question is will 13th gen need one??,i'm sure gn will look at that as part of its review.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's the exact same socket, of course it will work.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s what i was worried about.,"like 10900k to 11900k, although they used the same socket, their ihs are slightly different from each other.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you re-use a z690 board for 13th gen you'll still benefit from the contact frame if it helped your 12th gen cpu.,"the contact frame corrects the socket mounting bracket and its pressure distribution, not the cpu itself.",it'll be interesting to see if the bracket and its pressure points have been fixed on the new z790 boards now that intel's been aware of it for a while and it's been proven that the contact frame does indeed help more often than not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think the only way we know for sure is to wait for the release of the 13th gen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if you have good enough ddr4 (i.e 3600cl16 and can push it to 4000), pick up a z690 pro-a ddr4 for $200.",z790 just adds more pcie lanes hanging off of the chipset.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"supposedly tons better memory support, expensive 4 dimm z790 supposedly do 7400 mhz easily, according to early testers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"z790â€™s only real advantage is having more pcie lanes, as well as some better high frequency memory support.","therefore, i would only get z790 if you have any kind of use for those extra lanes, or plan on getting insane speeds ddr5.","otherwise, get a fast kit of ddr4 and a z690.","one more scenario where a z790 would be good is if it and 13th gen fix 4-stick ddr5 problems, where you canâ€™t run them at their full frequency if all 4 dimm slots are occupied (this issue doesnâ€™t happen with ddr4).","edit: i saw youâ€™re also worrying about future-proofing for the next 5 years, ddr4 is nowhere close to being irrelevant and it will take ddr5 another year or 2 to surpass ddr4 in sales, if not more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think the z690 is more than good enough.,i canâ€™t think of the details off the top of my head but everything iâ€™ve read says the z790 upgrades donâ€™t amount to much.,someone correct me please if iâ€™m wrong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just get z690 or even a good b660 board, as they are very similar to 700 series but on sale now.","as for ddr4 vs ddr5, the gaming difference between the two is pretty low, and the quality ddr5 kits start around $200+ its not worth it for most people imo, but with you buying a $1600 4090 maybe a few percent more fps is worth that money to you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

just for future proof sake.,i bought some corsair vengeance 32gb 5600mhz ddr5 for $150.,wasn't that bad.,"i'm not going to touch this build for another 5 or 6 years, so i figure i might as well get the newest rev.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think what the person means is that the 12700k takes up the same die space as 9 p cores(golden cove) while 13600k takes up the same die space as 10 p cores(raptor cove),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hey, i did say it was rough!",looks like most estimates in this thread are from 4 ecores = 1.3-2.0 pcores.,that doesnâ€™t severely change the math.,"instead of 9 we go to 9.3-10.0, and from 8 to 8.6-10.0.

so itâ€™s either at a slight deficit or the same (plus raptor lakeâ€™s improvements).","so while it should match the 12700k or statistically beat it, is it really going to be at the same kind of significant margin as, say, the 13400 vs 12600, or the 13700k vs the 12900k?","anyhow, looking forward to some real benchmarks to sink my teeth into.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i suppose i should say i the sense of motherboard chipsets.,different motherboards interact differently even if just slightly.,not to mention if you are using different operating systems.,would that have anything to do for performance is what i mean.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

and i forgot it in another dream.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13600k will beat 12700k easily in multithreaded workloads.,13600k is almost on par 5950x in multithreaded workloads from what i've seen leaked benchmarks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ah i had the same feeling.,"i may just bite the bullet and go 12700k, then oc it to 5.1 if i feel inadequate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

neat.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think this stuff is cool but lmao didnâ€™t see anything new over the normal thread director found in alder lake.,maybe i missed a specific improvement somewhere but the guy even said yah 12th gen can do this in windows 11 too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i saw that review a few days ago, and that made me think about the arc disadvantages too.","if there is no success story for vr with any arc, i will not buy an arc.","as it's just one review right now, i hope some others popup with maybe better information.","and it's not just about getting things to work, it would be really important to have a benchmark for vr running on it to see if it has advantages or disadvantages, it's a bit of a different workload than normal games!",there were some discussions that the av1 encoding engine of the arc would be beneficial to e.g.,"airlink for the quest 2, but the quest 2 doesn't support av1.",so av1 encoding is a nice to have feature but only for the future.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"nope, don't.","if it was at least 6 cores + ht, then yes (i5).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
get an i5.,better than 9900k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the real question you should ask yourself is : is the 9900k slowing down your games or you just want to have the latest.,"unless your are playing very high fps games and you want that 400fps level of performance, iâ€™m not sure you need to upgrade yet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 9900k is a premium 8-core processor, thereâ€™s no way a budget 4-core chip is going to beat it, especially one only 3 generations newer (and the 13100 is only going to be maybe 5% faster).","iâ€™ll leave some r23 benchmarks here:
- 9900k - 1284 single / 12450 multi
- 12100 - 1648 single / 8443 multi
- 12400 - 1623 single / 12454 multi
- 12600k - 1918 single / 17660 multi",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i3s are quite slow in my experience.,i'd try to aim for i5 as minimum.,my i3 8100 didn't perform any faster than my coreâ„¢2 quad processor q9550.,"the i3 8100 used less energy, but i didn't notice the i3 8100 to be any faster.",9900k is a very good cpu by today's standards.,i own 9700k that i am very happy with.,i have no speed deficits or any lags while performing any of my usual tasks.,i will use my 9700k until my motherboard fails.,"it seems to me, 9th gen. is great gen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, even for gaming your 9900k should still be faster

edit: people downvoting are clueless, hereâ€™s a benchmark showing that the 9900k actually matches the 12400f, which is obviously faster than the 12100: https://youtu.be/iyqgc-aqybc",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel said that all skus will have p cores for 13th gen, so if a 12300 or 12400 have decent number of them, multithreaded might be close.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

- single thread score : 3600 vs 3100
- multi thread score: 15000 vs 21000",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to be more specific than get the 'i5', the i5-12600k, and i5-13400 will both beat the 9900k in multi by 40%+ the i5-12400 would only match it, though anything modern has significantly better st too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 12100 can and does beat anything derived from skylake in **some** games.,"your r23 benchmarks show the clearly worse single core perf on the 9900k, also...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 12100 is a very good cpu for what it costs.,very good.,just not better than a 9900k for their stated use cases overall.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it wonâ€™t be.,12100 is apparently a beast for gaming (considering the price).,9900k still easily beats it in multithreaded tasks tho.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"true, but the op does state that he already assumed that newer chips would beat it single core, and that wasnâ€™t all he was interested in.",i would still probably want to go for 6 cores for a gaming rig.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am not saying 12100 is a bad cpu.,i am saying it is slowish.,"on the other hand, it's as very good as what it costs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you clearly havent looked up a benchmark.,9900k is actually quite fast: https://youtu.be/iyqgc-aqybc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i suggested it wouldn't be a good idea to go with the 12100 just because they said gaming was only one of many use cases of theirs, the others being ones that would still benefit from additional cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's not really slowish, it's a 4-big-core / 8-thread alder lake chip with 4mb more l3 cache than any quad core i7 ever had.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
indeed you are right.,"they're at best tied in some games, but the 9900k performs better in most titles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"however, thatâ€™s the 12400f, which is faster than 12100 by quite a bit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wasnâ€™t talking about your link.,"i looked up the gn review for 12100f (on which my initial opinion was based on) and saw that they had the results for 9900k there, but i simply didnâ€™t look for them when i watched the video.","as iâ€™ve said, i was wrong, you were right.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'd hardly call 21 days a ""wait"".","from what it looks like with the pricing (canadian anyway) the cost for the current 12th gen and 13th gen pre-orders are almost the same, plus or minus $25-50 cad at each tier while improving at all tiers (13600 +/- = 12700, 13700 +/- = 12900 and 13900 dethroning 12900).",i too am upgrading from an 8700k (stock) and honestly really look forward to seeing how the (theoretical 60%+) performance increase affects the applications/games i frequent.,"if you're still on the fence about the upgrade, i'll be more than happy to update you on my thoughts once i've had a few days with it.",i am currently sitting on an asus tuf oc-ed 3080 and 32gb g.skill ram@ 3200mhz with cl16.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"other than the 13100, the rest of 13th gen is going to be a pretty massive upgrade model-for-model.","like, the 13400 is basically a 12600k.",the 13600k is nearly going to be a 12700k.,and the 13700k is basically a 12900k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i saw some predictions earlier, that promise about 10% increase in productivity for 13 gen. over 12 gen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"
it's only a few weeks now, and it's likely 13th gen will offer around a generic 10% to 15% improvement for the same price, a little higher possibly in multi-threaded.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i currently have a regular 8700 and am definitely waiting to see whether i get the i7 or i9 for both my gaming pc and a server i want to build.,i don't think its a very long wait so i am definitely going for the 13th gen instead.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm in the same boat, coming from an 8700k.","i play exclusively at 4k, so i'm really struggling to decide of 13th gen is worth the wait and price over 12th gen.

i have a microcenter close and the 12700k has frequently been $300, it was even down to $300 a few months after launch, so i'm hopeful that will be the case with 13th gen.

i reserved an open box 12700 for $270, and an open box z690 mobo for $95.",i'm having an extremely hard time not just buying them and maybe going 13th gen if the 13700k ever gets close to $300,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which one do u plan on upgrading to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i guess waiting is the move then.,do you know if the e cores make a difference in your activity?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if iâ€™m within the return window for the 12900ks while paying more than a 13900k, do you suggest i return it?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm hoping for 13400 to be the gaming king of value like 12400 is right now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea another few weeks isnâ€™t too bad it just feels long cause iâ€™ve been on the upgrade mindset since summer and seeing amd and intel announce seducing me hard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the temptation is wild rn fr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i pre-ordered the 13700kf ($550cad, so $615cad after tax) so relatively the same price i paid for the 8700k on release +/- $20-35.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a certain number of ecores are useful, but i donâ€™t think gamers really need more than 4. the 16 on the 13900k is only going to be useful for those with heavy multithreaded workloads.",even the 8 on the 13700k/12900k is excessive.,iâ€™m actually a bit iffy on the new 6+8 core norm that weâ€™ll be seeing from the 13500 through to the 13600k.,"while iâ€™m sure it will perform well overall, i can still see there being interest in an 8+4 core model like the 12700k, a combination thatâ€™s completely absent on raptor lake.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in your case i definitely return that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"we wonâ€™t know for sure until the benchmarks are out, but simply from the specifications i would honestly expect the 13700k to perform around the same if not slightly better than a 12900ks, while the 13900k will just be well above that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why would you get it in the first place â€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah bro i feel you, i was originally gonna go with amd, but decided to wait to see intel's offering because of ram speed being important and the motherboard cost.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m glad they didnâ€™t jam up prices like amd this time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

seems like october 20th?,kind of a long wait.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"from some research, this is basically an unexpected system shutdown to the point that the system doesnâ€™t really know what happened, usually related to something involving power causing the system to crash hard or the psu to actually trigger a shutdown.","it seems that with gigabyte boards in particular, processor c-states and llc settings can affect this.","this isnâ€™t something i have experience with, so i hope someone else can help you, but as a general precaution i would make sure you have the most recent bios for your board, and also do a cmos reset and then load optimized settings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

umâ€¦ i thought everyoneâ€™s complaint about the current version was that any non-foreground app was always pushed to e-cores whether it had to be or not.,how is what was demonstrated in this video any different?,"he shoved two rendering tasks onto ecores and then played a game, in the foreground, on the p-cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"we don't know, wait for 3rd party benchmarks.","if we assume that they're all going to be evolutionary improvements over 12th gen, then the 13600k or 13700k will likely be the sweet spot for high end gaming.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

last gen's boost clocks were only 0.2ghz difference between 12700k and 12900.  this gen is 0.4. so i figured i'd ask if that's a silly thing to worry about or if potential upgraders for gaming would be choosing the 13900k due to significantly better boost clocks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what if iâ€™m looking at a 3440 x 1440 monitor?,am i okay with 13600k or should i go for 13700k?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a 13700k is going to slap a 12900ks, let alone the higher binned 13900k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 13700k is basically a 12900ks with more cache, slightly slower p-cores, and faster e-cores.","i have no doubt that the 13700k will perform above a 12900k, and probably even above the 12900ks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13900k at 65w matches 12900k at 241w.,that gives 13900k a massive thermal headroom to improve performance when it is given more power.,12900ks doesnâ€™t have similar headroom.,"it will be easily bested by i7-13700k, let alone i9-13900k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
base clock does not mean anything.,139k would be able to do better on boost clock speeds.,"from some source i saw a week ago (which is deleted now, but google cache of a copy is still available), 13900k would be able to do boost to 55x for all p cores and 43x for all e cores, at 340+w (they probably did not undervolt the cpu, though).","the uncore frequency would also get a huge boost since it would no longer be capped at e core frequency, from the 3.6g of 129k to 4.6g when p core is loaded.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"we don't know, wait for 3rd party benchmarks.","that said, the reason nobody compares the 12900ks is because the ks is stupid.","it's meant to be a binned 12900k for overclocking, but in reality it performs almost identically unless you have ln2, and even then it's still a silicon lottery crapshoot.",specs on paper don't matter if you can't actually run them at that speed due to heat and power limits.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it has nothing to do with pcie power.,it is to support enhanced pd charging over the front panel usb-c port.,"without the 6-pin connected the board supports less power (27 watts for asus, not sure on the msi) and with it connected it will deliver 60 watts.",this is listed in msiâ€™s specification.,"> to achieve 60w pd fast charging for jusb6, the pd_pwr1 connector needs to be connected to the power supply unit.","i think a lot of this misinformation comes from asusâ€™s z690 manuals that incorrectly attribute this connector to supplying 27w/60w to the pcie slots, despite them calling the connector â€œpd_12v_pwrâ€  (pd?",power delivery?),and correctly attributing it to the usb ports at one place in the manual.,pcie slots deliver up to 75 watts.,"27 watts and 60 watts are, however, both standard pd power levels.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably supplemental power for multi-gpu support.,it's not listed with the rest of the power specs for the board (2x cpu\_pwr & 1x atx\_pwr) so i wouldn't say it's needed for a standard build.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is the correct answer.,i would guess lots of people would just say it's for pcie because of the good old days where high end crossfire and sli motherboards had supplemental pcie power.,"probably also a communication or translation issue,  being a 6pin pcie power socket too.",https://youtube.com/clip/ugkxe-bskhmrh1amnkkxizbmzgwickmlca62,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think asus is primarily responsible for this.,"their manuals incorrectly states, twice:

>the pd\_12v\_pwr connector provides additional power for your pcie x16 slots.","to support 60w, please install the power cable to the 6-pin pcie graphics card connector (pd\_12v\_pwr) else only 27w will be supported.","which is complete nonsense, and likely a translation issue with it being described as a ""pcie graphics card connector"" and the manual writer extrapolating from that.","and yet earlier in the manual, they do correctly state:

>support: up to 60w charging\*  
>  
>\* to support 60w, please install the power cable to 6-pin pcie graphics card connector or can only support 27w.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nothing is specifically stated.,although i imagine poor quality case cables/ports might not end up delivering full power.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"probably required for rtx 4090

other than that i don't think it's that needed",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
edit 2: after researching more.,"first, assuming even if the usb-c is taking 12v coming from the same rail supplied by the eatx 24-pins + this additional 6 pins pcie connector, but it also shares power rail with the pcie too so there is no difference of saying it is for pcie or for usb-c. pcie takes priority here hence the usb-c will have less power for not enough power supplied.","second, eatx 24 pins going to mainboard only has 2 wires for 12v.",it means ideally it can deliver 100 watts.,sure we can push it to 150 watts maybe.,and that is only enough for 2 gpus.,"so if we install 3 gpus it wonâ€™t be enough to provide standard 75 watts per gpu x 3 not to mention other things which may suck up power from the 12v rails too including the usb-c

besides pcie doesnâ€™t means only gpu it could be nvme drives, the usb-c could be derived from pci lane too.",so basically the extra power comes from this extra connector is to ensure all pcie devices will receive enough power needed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
im waiting which model should i buy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hmm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"even if it shares the exact same 12v power rail, iâ€™m sure pcie will always have the power it needs and the connector is specifically for enabling pd power delivery.","because, the whole discussion of â€œ27 wattsâ€ and â€œ60 wattsâ€ has zero relevance to pcie power limitations or needs, but 100% relevance to usb pd delivery standards.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why do you think the eatx 24 pins which we connect to the mainboard does not able to supply a mere 33 watts more for the usb-c but it can supply 75 watts x 3 pcie slots for gpus?,it is funny that you are worried about a mere 33 watts difference but neglecting the needs for much bigger 225 watts total for multi gpu support.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whoâ€™s running 3 x16 gpus on these boards?,itâ€™s not even possible since only one slot is wired electrically for x16.,"best case scenario on the z690 hero, for example, is 1 x16 and 1 x4, or 2 x8 and 1 x4.","pcie power limits:
- x16 = 75 watts
- x8/x4 = 25 watts
- x1 = 10 watts (or 25w if designed as high current)

so, itâ€™s either 100 watts max draw with 2 cards, or 75 watts with 3 cards.","plus, when you use the required external power connectors the card does not actually draw much at all through the slot.","75 or 100 watts maximum through all slots still leaves room for fans, usb and other 12v devices, and maybe 27w for power delivery.",but 60w on top of that would potentially overwhelm the 150w max capacity of the 24-pin connector.,"if you can find a motherboard that doesnâ€™t have high-power usb-c power delivery, but does have a supplemental 6-pin connector, please share?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
asus pro art has 3 slots and this connector.,"my x299 encore has similar extra connector too and this platform has like 48 pcie lanes, so it can make use of all pcie lanes.","the point still stands even for 1 gpu, the power rails are shared together not exclusively for usb-c as i said on my first comment above that the pcie takes priority hence the usb-c will be able to deliver less power heck i believe the usb-c is connecting thru pcie lanes too.",so asus is not mistaken saying that it is for pcie.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"like the hero, the z690 pro artâ€™s three slots are electrically x16/x8, x8, and x4.",it also supports 60w front usb-c power delivery.,"in the case of your motherboard, the 6-pin connector just seems to be lumped in with the cpu 8-pin eatx connectors (itâ€™s called eatx12v_3), and thereâ€™s a caution to not only use it or the motherboard may overheat.","anyhow, the connector on these z690/z790 boards is nevertheless optional and the board will work fine without it.",but you may not get full 60 watts usb power delivery.,"but honestly, most power supplies will have one spare, so why not just hook it up anyways, right?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes you may not get 60 watts on the usb, i do not argue about this since we all know the limitation of the eatx 24 pins.",but saying that asus manual is wrong is also incorrect since the power rail is shared so saying that it is to support pcie or to support usb-c is irrelevant while supporting pcie is a better terms to use since that usb with 60 watts power delivery surely is a usb 3.2 2x2 which eats up lots of bandwidth and i believe coming from pcie lanes too.,"in case we put it the other way around, you do not use any gpu and only use igpu then the usb-c shouldnâ€™t need this extra to provides 60 watts because it does not taken by the pcie.",and by the time you install a gpu then you will need this connector or the usb-c will output less power (because it has less priority) so from that perspective it could be said is used to support pcie power delivery.,again it is irrelevant due to sharing power rails as i mentioned on my first post and nothing wrong with asus manual.,and no on my x299 encore the extra pcie connector is support for cpu overclocking hence why it may cause power plane overheat if not connected.,what iâ€™m talking about is the extra 4-pins peripheral connector on the bottom of the boards.,in the manual page 1-29 it said to support multi gpu.,"but this i guess doesnâ€™t matter, i just wanted to say that in some cases it is possible to use more than 1 x16 pcie slots.",this has been done before.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's looking like release day, as far as anyone can tell.","so that puts us at 10/20 for being able to see 4xxx, ryzen 7xxx and raptor lake all in the mix.","the best is going to be in nov, when we get amd navi 3, and can get all four points combined reviewed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is something i'm interested in hearing about as well.,this question has been asked before - in the form of what benefits z790 will have - and increased memory speed was a commonly repeated one (since there isn't much else new about z790).,so... what role does the chipset actually have in memory speeds / stability?,"memory is directly connected to the cpu, it doesn't go through the chipset.",so is raptor lake's improved speed solely a function of the cpu and motherboard design?,"are z690 boards expected to support the same stock speeds without issue, and for boards with good memory designs (i'm not going to assume that is universal), can one expect the same or similar overclocks using 13th gen as on a z790 board?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think itâ€™s tied to the cpu.,"also, although there were rumours of rpl going near full wank with 2 dimms per channel, their slides showed it running much slower (5600 vs 4400mhz for 1 vs 2dpc) so sounds like that was wrong.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i am just coming from daniel owen's channel on gtx 1060 + xess on death stranding.,"pascal despite having support for dp4a doesn't show any noticeable performance improvements because the runtime overhead of xess is so big, it's negating any advantage of reduction of rendering times due to lowering the internal rendering resolution.","in other words, the total time spent to generate a frame gets bigger.",gtx 1060 shows regression in fps when ultra quality xess is used.,comments also tell that users are getting no improvements with gtx 1080 as well.,"so at least for pascal gpus, xess exists only on paper.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's a buggy mess right now, at least in sotr.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[neither dlss nor xess seemed to do anything.,"](https://imgur.com/a/wi7jmm9) i didn't venture very far, so maybe there were areas that were more affected by dlss/xess, but i didn't see any effects.","i ran again at 4k and the results weren't any different, the averages were just a bit lower.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cool,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"here are my numbers for the 6800xt and 2600x, hdr on and everything max at 4k except raytraced shadows off.","native: 90fps

performance: 94fps

ultra quality: 83fps

performance mode looks pretty bad, but ultra quality is solid.",there is noticeable flicker in a lot of places though.,i'm going to stick with native and cas for now.,it would be interesting to try fsr 2.1 at some point.,"i expect my 2600x is holding the 6800xt back a bit, so if someone has something more modern they'll probably see somewhat better numbers, but the trend should be the same.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"keep in mind that the quality will also inherently look somewhat worse on your 6700xt because xess is running on that alternate path, which also reduces the quality to compensate for the additional headroom required.",xess will look best running on intel arc discrete gpus with ml hardware.,i'd be curious to see a three-vendor comparison of xess!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what's the point if this decreases performance vs native?,looks like they were aiming for dlss level quality but ignored that it's too heavy of a load for gpus without tensor/matrix cores.,this dp4a support must have been an afterthought,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"should post this at r/amd as well

also, suggest putting it like this

|preset - 4k, high, etc|performance|

what did you have to do to turn on xess?,"i have a 6800xt and a 4k monitor and was curious to see what it looks like, but i'm not sure how to get it to work.",i've tried borderless windowed and exclusive fullscreen and the option still remains greyed out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you have death stranding, then that's just been updated for both xess and fsr 2.1 support, so give that a try!","i've only seen [a screenshot so far](https://imgsli.com/mti3ntc5), and from just that i think fsr 2.1 looks better in that game than xess.","both fsr 2.1 and xess are preferable to native rendering in my opinion though, because the native taa is just _awful_.",so many jaggies everywhere.,"this screenshot also shows nothing about motion performance, where xess has an opportunity to take the lead again as well.",(all of the screenshots here are cpu bound).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there is practically no way around that, as dp4a uses cores that couldâ€™ve been used for rendering.","by default, this means that on certain settings, it will perform worse than native.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"uh... checkbox ticked, i guess?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sometimes dlssâ€™s quality preset looks better than native, xessâ€™s ultra quality might be in a similar boat but instead come with lower performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you enable ray tracing in sottr ultra quality will still give higer fps than native.,all this technology was for ray tracing to begin with.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the point is that people bitched and moaned at nvidia for not allowing dlss on pascal cards, so intel probably sidestepped the whole argument by allowing it as a token to the whining masses as a show of good faith.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sure, and can do!","in the last few minutes though the fact that death stranding supports both fsr 2.0 and xess just showed up on my twitter feed, so that game would probably make more of an interesting comparison for r/amd",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you've got to run the game in dx12.,"if you are, you should see the option isn't greyed out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i do not, but i have been meaning to check it out, especially since fall is coming.","i'll see if there's a sale somewhere, thanks!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"strange, i am in dx12 mode.",raytracing works well which i don't think would be available if it was using the dx11 renderer.,maybe it's time to verify the game files.,"edit: figured it out, if you have cas on then xess is unavailable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yep.,at least budget boards also get the aesthetic treatment too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good to hear.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all because the only changes are the added focus on the gen4 for the expansion?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it literally says raptorlake-s 34 core in the wafer package so how is it not raptor lake?.,die size looks like ~400mm^2.,according to ian cuttress apparently intel's workstation team was last year moved under client computing group from the data center group.,so they would probably have separate designs for the new workstation lineup instead of using server cpus like previously.,none of this of course means this is sure to launch.,"intel has multiple designs on the fly, even at finished wafer stage, and not all of them end up launched.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the cooling requirements for that are probably going to be terrifying.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's not.,the wafer is clearly labeled raptor lake s 34 core.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so it could be raptor lake-x?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> it literally says raptorlake-s 34 core in the wafer package so how is it not raptor lake?.,die size looks like ~400mm2.,"since they were showing something they didn't realize was confidential, its possible someone simply mislabeled a spr wafer.",the booth guys in marketing may have literally no idea what intel will actually launch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nah 400mmâ² is not possible, golden cove server is too large.","even if we assume glc server is 10mmâ²(it's probably larger due to 2mb l2, amx, avx512), 34 cores take 340mmâ² of silicon.",there's also space for 4 memory controllers and other io.,just looking at the wafer it only has like 70 dies vs 100 something (130?),for a 400mmâ² spr tile.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe sapphire rapids uses raptor cove over golden cove?,i mean considering how far it has been pushed back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

for the information of reddit users, ian cuttress's video is at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjxegw55ho](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjxegw55ho)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cooling requirements are determined by the power limit you set.,you can make almost any cpu a 32w one and put a passive cooler on it if you want to.,cooling requirements for competitive overclocking on that chip would indeed be terrifying but workstation users are used to pretty clear defined power range and relatively small air coolers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not true at all.,"even at 400w, the size of the die makes cooling easy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i donâ€™t think the show people labeled it.,it had serial numbers and product numbers and some qr codes on it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are right.,600m^2 is better guess.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm not sure what raptor cove actually is.,golden cove originally had two configurations with the sapphire rapids server chips using 2mb l2 cache like raptor lake does and alder lake had 1.25mb.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

> 

he isn't suggesting that it's a regular rpl product, but that it was explicitly labeled as 'raptor lake-s 34 core'.","there were long rumors about a mcc sapphire rapids product coming to hedt, but was going to be called alder lake-x but my guess is since sapphire rapids is so delayed, they just renamed it to stay up to date with the current desktop generation.",they may have also moved it to the 'improved intel 7 node' that raptor lake is on as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"question, is your 12600k overclocked?",you do know this is a very simple task in nearly all bios.,my 12600k is overclocked to 5.2ghz all cores and 40 on the p-cores.,my geekbench score actually matches a stock 12900k.,i would do some research and do the deep dive.,"whatever you do, make sure you don't send your money off to die a slow painful death where dollars are wasted.","from what i am reading, i have doubts you are really going to gain much if anything other than, murdering your own dollars.","i would keep the 12600k, overclock it and save  your money for the intel meteor lake.",that cpu with it's new architecture will be a massive game changer as it's promising 20 - 30% performance increase over the 13900k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it would totally depend on how cpu-intensive your work is.,"if you find yourself constantly maxxing out all your cores to 100%, then obviously it will be a solid upgrade.","if not, then it probably won't be.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what do you use it for?,it's an odd upgrade considering it's only one gen for you.,"for gaming, you don't need to upgrade.",is there any other reason?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i wish more people preached this simple concept.,"if you have to ask whether you need to upgrade, you don't need to upgrade.",it becomes *clear* when you *need* to upgrade.,"i think a lot of people who ask questions like this just really want to upgrade for the sake of having ""the best"".","at the same time, they already realize they don't have really a legitimate reason to waste the money.",so they ask these questions to get other people to convince themselves they need it.,bored people with money to burn i suppose.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
better than a 3090 ti?,what is the better upgrade?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yes, 4090 is way better 3090ti.",it's insane.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no one knows how much better a 4090 is compared to 3090ti in rastorization alone.,the 4090 benchmarks are with ada optical flow engine running dlss3.0 which is 1.5 to 3x faster than the previous generation.,ops 3090ti will be fast for the next 3 to 5 years at 2k to 4k resolutions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

pretty sure the scheduler that decides which thread goes to the big cores and which go to the little cores are done at the os/kernel level.,"so as long as your software is written with multi core/thread capabilities, you shouldnâ€™t need to change/ port.",is it possible that you can optimize in the software code?,"maybe, i donâ€™t have enough knowledge to say you cannot.",but i doubt the difference would be significant as i donâ€™t see any software developers say â€˜this application is optimized for big littleâ€™,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks.,"that makes sense, in fact it sounds similar to the cpu and kernel ""speculative multithreaded"" (or a term that sounded like that i heard years ago) in which either the cpu or the os will try to guess (trial and error) which processes can be paralellized.","yet, i would expect the software developer can guide the kernel to make better choices.","after all, who knows better the nature and complementarities of a particular software thread than the developer.",no?,e.g.,"like those software pieces that do not paralellize well beyond 12, 16 or else thread (the overhead of handling the paralell structure outweighs the benefits) , i always wondered why the os does not stop the thread dilution of that application (that became somewhat popular with the kind of fiasco of the first wx theadripper skus where the memory transfer across cpus was killing performance).","on the ""ou shouldnâ€™t need to change/ port.""","i used to think like that, but every generation of m1, m2, or even intel families i hear the same youtube reviewer speech ""well software has not been optimized"" so i am slowly converging to think i am wrong and software needs to be rewritten/recompiled to some extent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for m1 and m2, it is more due to arm vs x86 more than big little.","as for intel, you have to look at number of cores/threads as well.","with big little, chip designers can now cram more cores into a chip as we see with 13th gen.  so software that can be broken down to more threads will be more â€˜optimizedâ€™.",which is why some software will see more gains vs other.,"again, that isnâ€™t just big little.",as for each application deciding which cores to use.,the problem is the application doesnâ€™t know which other applications are running.,"so while it can â€˜recommendâ€™ the core to use, the final decision is should be made by the os/kernel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"no, it just means youâ€™re overclocking.",which is fine.,"but if it follows the same limitations as alder lake, the official speed for the vast majority of motherboards will actually be 5200mhz, and 5600mhz is only for 2 slot boards.",but i havenâ€™t seen that data table yet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

itâ€™s the exact same as alder lake.,"16 x 5.0 and 4 x 4.0.

and yes, pcie 5.0 ssd support is also the exact same situation.",any 13th gen board supporting 5.0 ssds is doing it via the same methods that 12th gen boards employ.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wich i'm guessing is via chipset or split off the 16 lanes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
spit off the cpuâ€™s x16 lanes.,the chipset does not have 5.0 lanes.,"- there are only 16 5.0 pcie lanes to go around
- these lanes can be split into x8/x8
- when split, these lanes can go to a secondary 5.0 x8 pcie slot (for use with any add-in card), or to a dedicated 5.0 x4 m.2 slot for a ssd
- in both cases, using these split lanes for a ssd results in your gpu dropping to x8 lanes - no matter what speed it is (5.0, 4.0, 3.0).","- only one 5.0 x4 ssd can be supported by 12th or 13th gen, even when using an add-in card.","and yes, that means 4 of the 16 lanes become unusable.","this is due to the cpu only supporting x8/x8 bifurcation, and not x8/x4/x4.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ram timing is significantly more important than its speed.,set of 3600 running samsung bdie at cl 14 timings @ 7.8ns transfer will post significantly better performance in gaming than 4400 at 24 cl timings.,this has been and continues to be the case going into ddr5 as well.,i have a 12900k with a slight overclock running on team group 3600 b dies 2x16gb and this thing posts 29.5k cine bench scores.,m/ts is marketing fluff.,you will notice that some of the higher speed kits cost almost 50% less than the most sought-after pc 3600 kits in ddr4.,"these are the fastest ram available on the market, often binned as such.",prioritize cl timings.,"here is a geat way to shop the best b-die ram on the market

to me it's pretty obvious the volume of this card is pretty low.,neither of us have definitive total volume across all retailers but i do know that all 25 micro center locations received around 100 total cards in the past month.,it seems like they are just now getting a restock of around the same amount (4 cards per location).,for reference my single local micro center received around 200 3060 ti founders edition cards (plus many more aib versions) on launch day.,"i'm glad this gpu is selling out, but to use that as some metric of insane demand is a little bit of a reach without knowing the actual volume being moved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"nice try at moving the goal posts, and comparing performance versus other manufacturers current market share percent is a red herring.",mlid made the claim that arc was getting pulled less than a month after the first release of their first product of their whole line up.,i've been checking the newegg listing for the card religiously once a day.,the trend is obvious.,as soon as they get stock they sell it.,"no sane company is going to kill a product line two weeks after the release of the first product, especially when it is consistently selling out at the largest retailer for said product in north america.","mlid is a clown that made crap up, and it is easily proven by anybody that has actually has any real corporate business experience and/or education.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"youâ€™re making stuff up about who you think would buy it, just like mlid does.",a good example is that if one is building a system for general purposes like a small business or the parent that needs to build a system so their 10 year old kid can use it for school work.,"also more people use computers for things that arenâ€™t gaming, and for the price this card outshines all other general purpose video cards.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i never mentioned ""performance"" or ""market share,"" i'm just talking strictly *volume*, i haven't moved any goalposts.",to reiterate my point; nvidia and amd launch their gpus with much more *volume* than the a380 has launched with.,"so yes the a380 keeps selling out but all signs point to it currently being incredibly low *volume*, the fact that there's only one a380 aib in the us also points to this holding some truth.","i don't care about what mlid said, he's wrong most of the time (and deletes evidence of being wrong), i'm just trying to point out the obvious about the low launch window *volume* of the a380.",the way proportions work is you can use a smaller sample to make a fairly accurate representation of the whole.,"micro center shifts less overall *volume* than newegg, that is obvious.","if each micro center location receives 250-300 3060 tis and 150+ rx 6600 xts for their respective launch days but the a380 per-location *volume* is four per store for the launch month, we can consider that to be low volume.","this means, yes, newegg has many more a380s than the entire retail chain of micro center, but we're talking an exponentially smaller *volume* of this gpu compared to any other consumer gpu listed on newegg right now.",so simply highlighting a product's ability to sell out doesn't prove anything about said product shifting significant *volume.,"* 

i hope this makes sense; i don't care about what mlid says, i'm just saying it's painfully obvious the a380 is currently a low volume product for retailers (like micro center and newegg).",will this change soon?,hopefully!,does this mean arc is cancelled!?!?,"no, it doesn't.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah.,rx6700 tests show xess is too computationally intensive at quality and only has fps parity at around balanced and only a small uplift at performance.,"and that's at the compute levels of a 6700....

low end pascal stands no chance unless you're doing xess-performance up to 4k and only targeting 30fps.","might be cool on a 1080ti though, and if they can work out the visual glitches.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you're right.,i watched that but for some reason i forgot it was actually this game lol.,i was thinking of another video of theirs with spiderman iirc.,i remember now.,"some of those small artifact issues are noticeable if you're looking for them but in my case, the same applies for dlss.",i can see noticeable differences but in general is worth the trade off of a bit of img quality for performance when it comes to rt.,"sometimes the artifacts or quality difference is more pronounced so everyone (dlss, fsr, xess) and still improve a lot.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

-	hdmi 2.1* (if aib adds conversion chip)

if this is like a $110 gpu, it will sell well, because it will be the cheapest gpu you can get for av1 encoding, and has better h.264 and h.265 encoding than even a 3090 ti or 6950xt.","it also would be the cheapest modern 4 monitor gpu, and likely 1 slot with pcie power only making it ideal for htpc or plex servers, also hdmi 2.1 support.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not even amd included 5800x3d in their marketing slides.,it's just too good lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because they are.,same for amd.,looking at the gaming graphs it doesn't seem like the 13900k is that big of a jump.,at least in gaming.,its likely gonna compete with amd's zen 4 and 5800x3d quite closely.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's so good it hurts both intel and amd in the high end.,"pair it with cheap mobos, memory and cooling.",the 5800x3d is the best buy imo right now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"at least they did include it at all, lol.","but the fact that it exists just throws kinda a wrench in sales of high end gaming cpus right now, i feel like.","since everyone saw what a massive difference it had over the 5950, while basically being a prototype part with shit like lower clocks and locked voltage.","now we have the 13th gen and zen 4 launch, and everyone just knows that there is going to be something coming soon that's a 20% improvement over these, because there is no reason for there not to be.","so unless you're doing an in-platform upgrade from like a 12400 to 13600k or something, why not just wait and see what happens with the new 3d part?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"5800x3d is a troll cpu, embarrassing cpus of next generation....",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5800x3d is the new 1080ti,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
after watching zen 4 and raptor lake all i can say is that both presentations were low key an advertisement for people to go buy either a 5800x3d or 12700k.,this is really funny as a consumer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i bought a 5800x3d yesterday and nothing has made me feel as validated as intel's own marketing slides.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at least they acknowledge the existent of the 5800x3d.,for the amd marketing team the 5800x3d is a myth xd.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have been convinced... to wait for 3d zen 4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 5800x3d bar is very small and the topline percentage gains are over the 5950x.,why even include the 5800x3d at all if you're gonna market like this?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>what's up with intel's marketing?,"seems like they're almost hiding the 5800x3d

what do you mean?",that's how it always has been.,it's marketing!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the worst thing is really that the benchmarked the 5950x using painfully slow ram, whilst benchmarking their own chips with some premium level kits",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13900k is better which it obviously should be being the price difference but 5800x3d is an insane value if you're still on the amd platform.,granted their are multiple factors at play depending on ddr5 speeds and such.,"also props to intel for even including it, amd didn't so there's that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
comedy gold.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 5800x3d is so good intel has to hide it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is like begging amd for 3dvcache zen4 cpus xd,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to be fair, that was basically what amd did on the zen4 reveal as well.",:),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"when you lost the game, you try to hide it.",clear and simple.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wow a benchmark that actually includes bannerlord, one of the most thread count heavy games right now.",question is did they max out the battle size to 1000 because that is the true cpu test of bannerlord.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thats how marketing works.,"try and make your product look favorable....


the marketing isnt aimed at people who know what they're looking at.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they were tasked with showing how intel is superior to amd in single core, frequency and cache bound games.... while also showing the 5800x3d.... 

though spot tbh...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the entire rpl and zen 4 are a bad value compared to 5800x3d lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
letâ€™s not forget they arenâ€™t even running the amd chips with their best config.,they are using 3200mhz ddr4 and not the preferred 3600mhz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"
and these are hand-picked games.","it looks like the 13900k is only going to be slightly better than the 12900k, and trade blows with the 5800x3d?","the 7600x is close to the 12900k in games benchmarks, are we just going to have a tight cluster near the top and no clear winner?",if that's the case then the 5800x3d will take it as it will be the cheapest (chip + mb + ram),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think that is quite common way to chart/show outliers... so in fact i think that slide gives the x3d credit.,otherwise four bars might have been too crowded that no one would understand.,"yet, i would agree with you in terms that the % increase is done versus the 5950x.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 5800x3d would be such a good pick for me if it didnt shit the bed in rpcs3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is there a  reason why intel isn't doing an intel gaming cpu?ditch the e-cores and increase cache/core.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel and terrible charts, what else is new?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel need to decide who they're marketing this towards.,"they're using gaming, but it's a 16 core productivity cpu that happens to be good at gaming (like the 5950x).","in that case, why mention the 5800x3d?","if the focus is gaming, the obvious point is that the 8 core gaming cpu is obviously much cheaper, so why not use a comparable i7?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because it is a bad gaming cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they aren't really hiding anything.,r9 5950x and i9 1x900k have the same target audiance which may also be interested in multi core perf.,r7 5800x3d has different target audiance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i guess.l its clear but some could say that.,should include 7950x.,i would skip this gen if you have a last gen cpu (or get 3d),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"doesn't really look like raptor lake offers much for gaming compared to alder lake, just a small and incremental improvement.","after zen 4 so far turned out to be somewhat disappointing for gaming, i figured that raptor lake surely will do much better, given that it supposedly features ipc improvements and a massive clock boost.","but it doesn't, really.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if its not that significant of a jump from 12900k, at the very least i hope they tuned it better in terms of power and heat output.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the whole amd subreddit is waiting for 7000x3d.,hoping 30+% more gaming perf than 7950x.,this is not gonna happen.,the perf gains of 7000 are mainly from higher frequency and higher power=tsmc 5nm.,they can't run 3d version chips @ 5.4ghz & 90+c celsius.,it will be more like a 5950x3d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hmm, my initial impressions are that both ryzen 7000 and raptor lake aren't as exciting as i thought.",my i3 12100f lives on in budget glory.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol between this pathetic nonsense and them literally pre-announcing the i9-13900ks before regular 13th gen has even launched tells me that intel is obviously absolutely fucking terrified of 3d v cache!,(as they right well should be tbh.,the r7 5800x3d is making both vanilla zen 4 and raptor lake look fucking ridiculous for a pure gaming build).,"it's like the upcoming r7 7800x3d is constantly hovering over pat's back shoulder while regularly whispering in his ear ""6ghz or not you're still absolutely fucked in gaming performance this generation at the moment of lisa's choosing..."" ðÿ¤£",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it sort of makes sense because itâ€™s not really a competitor cpu to the 13900k outside of gaming.,the 13900k absolutely murders it for everything non-gaming and just has way more cores/threads.,but for gaming they kind of have to include it in order to claim top gaming performance so i guess they settled on this.,it does look funny but the full bars are what they feel are similar cpus while the 5800x3d is there to show that in gaming the 13900k can trade blows for the crown,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"they probably know if they market it solely as a productivity part, the 7950x will still trump it.",it probably has a slight edge over the 7950x in gaming so they have to market it as a good all-rounder.,â€œit might lose to the 7950x a bit in productivity but look at the gaming!â€,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"according to some reviews, 7000 series gaming performance isn't affected even with 65w eco-mode.",we don't know how the next v-cache iteration will handle the voltages zen 4 uses (voltage limitation was the reason 5800x3d was locked to lower frequencies).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"it is clocked lower than the 5800x, which already has 105w tdp/142w max draw, which is for heavy all-core loads.",70-80w for poorly threaded games is about right.,the batshit performance comes from the massive amount of l3 cache greatly reducing memory-related delays.,"cpus spend a lot of time doing nothing, apparently.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is a productivity cpu.,it's a carthorse.,it's a competent gaming cpu but for the money it's insane to use for that unless you also want to software encode simultaneously.,the 5950x is also a carthorse.,comparing them makes sense.,"i think throwing in a gaming cpu that's half the price just confuses things because it introduces arguments of ""look how expensive this intel part is for the performance"" when those arguments can also be made of the 5950x, and intel themselves have similarly performing (in gaming) cheaper cpus.",there's such a thing as including too much data and losing focus of what you're trying to say with it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't care.,this isn't the graph to convey that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

max turbo power: 253w.,from a cpu?,what.,the.,fuck?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m really waiting to see what the performance difference is from alder because on paper the 13900k is the same chip but with just more e-cores and iâ€™m trying to figure out how the re-shuffling of pci-e and usb i/o is beneficial for media and content creators when you only have 20 lanes maximum.,"i think amdâ€™s ability to have 24 and up to 28 with the 7950 will pay huge dividends when gen 5 cards start to scale next year-nvme, network, audio/dsp, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
performance-core max turbo frequency>thats the all core performance  when playing games/benchmarking right?,5.4/5.3 for 13900k/13700k.,just 1 ghz difference.personally its the only thing i care about since the cpu downclocks to it while gaming.,6mb reduction is cache  difference tho :/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so does 13900k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and e cores must be complete nonsense with that power draw.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this was the draw from amdâ€™s 7950 in 5 minutes of blender.,this is the new normal.,throw power at sustained upper limits and hold boost frequencies more consistently.,also thatâ€™s most likely an average from intelâ€™s testing.,which means you could tweak voltages and it will probably draw more.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea but if you feel that the price difference is justified then get the 13900k.,i would personally get the 13700k.,i hope the temperature issues aren't worse.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no it's not the same as the all core turbo frequency.,intel doesn't list the all core turbo speeds on ark.,also while the tendency is that they correlate it's not always the case that the max turbo frequency spec difference between cpus is the same as the actual all core turbo difference.,as in the max frequency difference might say be 200mhz between two cpus but the all core difference can be both smaller or larger.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's not a cache reduction per se.,at least it's not a shared cache reduction.,this belongs to the extra e cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, it's a shame that these desktop skus are juiced to the gills.",i believe it was igorslab that did an analysis on the e-cores and they actually are at their best at lower power levels and clockspeeds.,i think it was something like 3 ghz being the absolute highest that gracemont should be clocked to before its power consumption just spirals out of control.,shame that they are being clocked at 4 ghz+ out of the box.,"that tells you where 12th gen and, presumably, 13th gen are losing all their efficiency.",this approach of squeezing max performance out of the box from is not doing us any favors in the current economic climate.,sucks that all three companies are pursuing this for the ultimate dick measuring contest.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what happens when you push cores to the limit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
letâ€™s not forget intel design runs chips at that 235w for what 30 second bursts on workloads before it pulls back to a sustained 125watt tdp which in my mind is perfectly fine.,if your board is ignoring that and running out of spec well i wouldnâ€™t buy that board but you can go in and change it.,"correct me if iâ€™m wrong but amds new chips are designed to basically constantly run up to 95 c and at what power draw, iâ€™d be peeved at pulling the 170w tdp anytime i run a game just because it wanted to give max performance .",maybe apples jaded me but i prefer perf per watt these days even if it may not be the fastest end result and it looks like intel has taken that crown.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
watch the gn stuff about 7000 series.,perf per watt is kinda skewed.,the amd tdp of 170 literally means nothing because theyâ€™ve changed the formula they use to derive the number.,gn show actual sustained loads and wattage draw on the rails at the 12v connector.,for the 12900k it is over 200 watts in reality from their testing and i donâ€™t remember what intel said the tdp was at launchâ€¦.so this figure for the 13900k is actually probably true.,but thatâ€™s fine if itâ€™s effective and efficient above 200 watts regardless of the tempsâ€¦in other words how fast/how well does it render/compile/etc in that space??,these cpuâ€™s now are designed to manage these temps and load for longer which means peak clock speeds for longer.,the issue is how efficient is it when itâ€™s drawing that wattage and at that temp as i was alluding toâ€¦in gn testing their efficiency score shows the new amd cpuâ€™s to not be as efficient as the 5000 series but better than the 12900k.,meaning if you set a bar at a particular â€œscore levelâ€ what does it take to get there and how fast can the cpu do it?,ryzen 7000 is better than alder lake but a little hotter and little more load.,ryzen 5 was more efficient but slower.,the key is if raptor is faster and can reach that â€œscore/markâ€ at less load and i bet weâ€™ll see package tempâ€™s in the upper 80â€™s on raptor too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

guys don't order it.,i need to get my order in first :).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"great price, just keeping fingers crossed for performance",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
holy moly we have a date!,"&#x200b;

and a great price!",?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i want to do a pure intel build with this for fun,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, this is still a bit too much, with 6600 xts widely available at $300 now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
expensive.,they need to go below $300.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"decent, yet i'll wait for reviews and if it doesn't match 3060 ti on non-rt or has micro stutters it's a no.","unsure yet if it's worth waiting next gen amd, get 6700/6750 xts or wait for this arc with 100$ off.",european so nvidia prices are quite stable still highly over msrp for half a year now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"arc to nvidia,:our combat will be legendary",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's a great price.,hope they fix the drivers!!!,let's go team blue!,"wow kids can build a pc for under 1,000 possibly with ~3070 to 3060ti level of performance.... that's nice!",!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sold!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'll buy it day 1 if that's the 16gb a770 le for $329.,"if it's some crappier version and the le is more, no thanks, will wait and see what else comes out.",the only thing i really don't like is that these cards are limited to 4 displays.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is anyone looking into using the a770 as a dedicated video encoding/streaming gpu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for me the most interesting thing is pat quoted a 66% uplift in raytracing performance compared to the ""competition"", which in this case, i assume is the rtx 3060?","if that is true, i am very interested in these gpus as i am a sucker for raytracing haha.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is great.,"they got the price right for putting something new into the market - especially when their competitors are announcing cards at much higher prices (much better cards, yes, but my guess is that for people who don't pay too much attention, or take the ""i want 60fps in x, y, and z title and beyond that don't care much"" approach, this will be interesting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is a crazy low price.,respect !,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"considering thatâ€™s their highest end offering, itâ€™s a great price.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"will be about 450â‚¬ in that case, dont know maybe i am intrigued, maybe not... hmm the gpu is in a state of twilight zone so to speak, i dont know what to think about the pricing, will definitely depend on the perf.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'll buy 7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
make it available in mexico and i will buy it alongside a 13600k.,"i do not trust amd is gonna make thinks better with rdna 3.

the 6600(non xt) still costs equivalent of 329 usd in mexico.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"priced based on current graphic performance, not on the available compute power.","with more titles coming out with dx12/vulcan and intel drivers maturing over time, this card is going to age amazingly well.",two years from now itâ€™s going to top all the perf/$ charts easily.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great job pat!,keep making intel the best!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if they released this earlier they would have done way better.,they are launching this just before rtx 40 and radeon 7000 in an oversaturated gpu market with no demand from miners which is seriously going to undercut them.,and now since investors aren't incentivised to keep this product line going cancellation of arc is in talks already.,sooner or later we'll be back to the nvidia-amd duopoly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so, it's doa.",a 6650 xt is $300 and about 8% faster than a 3060 in rasterization.,same amount of ram.,better drivers.,"if you want a faster card, 6700 xt is $410 and beats the 3060 ti and has 12gb of ram.",in the middle there's the rx 6700 with 10gb of ram which is between both and at $369.,also note the a770 being 13% better than 3060 performance is with ray tracing.,intel has been heavily touting the ray tracing performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you mean 3299?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
too much money for a card that barely competes with a last gen rtx 3060. should be $249+ for 8gb version.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wow, the price is bad.","3060 performance, two years later, with buggy drivers at the same price of the 3060. this won't even force nvidia to launch the 4060, they can just lower the price of the 3060ti a little bit and make this gpu doa.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is discrete arc still effectively dead?,this seems like a pretty strong showing for a division that supposedly is on the verge if getting the axe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"guessing this will be around 6600xt performance, no way it touches the 3060 ti for that price.",though it might be competitive in rt (with xess) since thats what they keep boasting about.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is not a good price.,but deals will probably lower in less than a month.,which would actually give it chances to survive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
where's spr intel???,will arc of all products launch before spr does?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

jacket thug might say but but but moore's luaaaww,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if this is 350â‚¬ in europe it is 20â‚¬ cheaper than a 3060 (if they do not drop in price) and that is super competetive.,i hope intel will not abandon dgpus - otherwise amd will run away with igpu performance easily in the future,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i highly doubt if itâ€™s worth it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i want it simply because competition is good for everyone.,will it suck?,possibly.,"will i use it for anything important to me, only if i see it can handle it.","but make no bones about it, i'm definitely grabbing one as soon as it comes out.","gotta let grandpa jensen know there's a new player out there by hitting the old fool in the place he loves the most, his wallet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
will intel be making something stronger in the future than the a770?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

truly is.,"i don't get the people saying ""its overpriced"" ""the drivers are bad"" ""this is awful not buying it""

like this is amazing actually, intel joining the competition is nothing but perfect for us consumers.",we get better and cheaper gpus in the long run.,with the way nvidia is looking right now it's a good thing that eventually they will be forced to make things cheaper.,"only a matter of time before intel, amd, and nvidia are neck and neck

competition is good",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6650xt just dipped down to $299 this week.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean... you can already get an rx 6700 for $360 which competes with the 3060 ti.,and actually works well with opengl/dx11 and below.,and it also has known functional drivers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nice hype, but it performs close in raytracing system ðÿ˜‚",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
competitor?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"eh, with the rx 6600's msrp being 230$, you're only buying this for av1.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>  if this competes even closely to the 3060ti.,unless they somehow replaced the entire driver in the last few months?,"it could perform like a 3060 in some games, and like an ax200 wifi card in others.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it makes you feel like spiderman!,!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"6650xts are in stock right now for $299

i don't think you'll struggle to get your order in",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and stability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the price doesnâ€™t seem that great to me with the cratering prices of the 3060ti etc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>â€‹and a great price!?,"not realy, 13% faster then a 3060 with the same msrp does not work well with the drivers being at their current state and higher power draw then both amd 6600xt and nvidias offering the card is doa.",259-299$ would have been a maybe but at that price it's a flop.,maybe they can discount it then it has a chance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the price is not good for all the bugs and the let-down performance, but i expected something like that already.",it is after all a large chip with 21.7b xtor chip on 406 mm2 of tmsc n6.,which makes this even more terrible when it only slightly exceeeds the performance with their modern raytracing implementation of a 3060 that uses ga106 13.25 xtors on 276 mm2 on the old samsung 8nm.,apparently it even has worse efficiency.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm inclined to do a ""reverse"" build with amd cpu and intel gpu, but i have absolutely no need for the build and no one to pawn it off after i'm done (nor would i feel comfortable giving it to a relative when the driver situation is unclear).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ya, or people who really need the encoding or ray tracing support on a budget",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"considering a380 is not on geizhals, in my eu country a380 starts 200euros while msrp is 129 usd it doesn't sound good.",could be paper launch too as leak is that most gpus were sent to oems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they do.... that is merely the top end card, laughable how it is starting at $30 more than $300 and people are screaming doa.",this is an incredible 1440p value with 16gb vram,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
$100 off?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wait for it....legendary!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's around 10-12% faster than the 3060 in performance.,the 3060ti is usually 20-30 % faster than the 3060 depending on the resolution while the 3070 is even faster .,"if i had to guess , it would probably match the rx 6600xt in performance",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it says ""starting at 329"" which i think would indicate the 8gb model",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"reportedly all the arc cards have the same encoding capability so, grab an a380 for that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 6650 xt is more efficient and more stable and $329 for the 8gb model.,we shall see with independent benchmarks how arc performs but it doesn't matter about next gen being high end only if current gen is still better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thats quite an interesting take,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"is that with, or without, vat?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 40 series is a joke so far though, so i don't see why it's an issue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we saw the bottleneck happen.,we see the price increases for nvidia products today.,there is a huge window of opportunity.,"it happened before, it will happen again.",right now yeah you are correct.,the timing is bad.,there is a looming recession (scare) but jobs market is full.,people are employed.,people will spend because they are employed.,so recession scare is iffy.,then there was russian invasion of ukraine and subsequent sanctions.,now fed and other countries raising interest rates and whatnot.,no company can plan for this and foresee the future.,even intel with their ai cannot predict the futures.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you have to wait to next year before there are any 40 series cards under $900.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'd like to know if this 'cancellation of arc' is real thing or just a baseless rumor from mlid.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
100%.,if they launched it in q1 it would've sold out instantly.,launching now it will be a novelty purchase.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's definitely not some sort of contra-revenue price that out-amds amd, that's for sure.",i guess they are thinking that with it beating amd on ray tracing performance they can get away with only being better than nvidia pricing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm really looking forward for its av1 hardware encoding, although we need to see if their game driver is stable enough in the following year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
absolutely not doa.,xess allows the card to optimize taa calculations out entirely by replacing them with xess: ~40% frame rate gains for directx12 games.,"av1 encoding is the future, and is integrated directly on the card.",encoding and decoding are accelerated greatly.,this is a great value proposition at this price point for content creators.,"oneapi support allows developers to write code that targets one api but multiple hardware architectures: cpu, gpu, fpga, iot
this card can be used for data science applications to accelerate ai & ml workloads.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not doa.,this product has ai upscaling.,it has rt graphics.,the flaws are just new drivers.,but intel has had a history of supporting games with integrated graphics.,they have experience and the software engineers to do this.,this is intel.,they are extreme gaming orientated.,they have overclocking experience.,gaming leadership.,they have the foundries.,they have the design teams.,the only flaw is late to market (well they are entering a new market) and difficult legacy drivers to support.,but they have pros too.,"low cost of entry, ai upscaling (xess), and rt graphics.",thats a whole lotta pros.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bigger die than the 3060 ti as well with a much better process so more expensive to make.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you canâ€™t lower the price of something you donâ€™t own anymore: most of the issue is because of the third party and second hand market.,nvidia wonâ€™t be able to sell tons of 4000 series cards because most of the larger players are making their own accelerated chips.,why purchase rasterization silicon when youâ€™re just training a model?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, they announced the availability today..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the rumour was based on future arc with battlemage effectively just being one low end desktop die with everything else either being laptop or data centre,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's not for this release the claim is that nextgen is dead (for gaming, focus shifting to datacenter), this gen is already done and out the door.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
he (mlid) never said alchemist wasn't launching.,in fact he always reiterated that it was.,"he said arc is *effectively* dead with anything above the a770 followed by battlemage (which may just be laptop), and celestial being in limbo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mlid was just speculating/guessing.,he has to do this because his job is based upon speculation/rumors and causing drama.,he is a reviewer/leaker.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, it's more relevant to compare to amd rather than nvidia at this point.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"meh, rt with cards below rtx 3080 / rx 6800xt is pointless.","you are throwing away way too many frames, or resolution by upscaling.","rt makes somewhat on an impact at 4k, an none of those cards this is going against are 4k cards, except in esports games, such as counter-strike etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
doesn't the 4090 already have av1 encoding?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean silicon valley ceos arenâ€™t exactly known for their fashion sense.,it could always be worse.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not this gen, with battlemage next year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it will work with any platform.,"the 10th gen ""requirement"" is because you'll want resizable bar enabled for best performance.",technically you could run it on a fx-6300.,https://hothardware.com/news/intel-clarifies-amd-powered-pc-play-nice-arc-graphics-cards,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

at least we'll have battlemage next gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

surely no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"we dont like jensen around here this time of year, i'm afraid you'll have to be downvoted into oblivion",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
\^jensen's puppet account found.,rofl.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
competition is good.,"this is not competing in any metric against radeon or geforce, tho.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
of course competition is good.,"only a total dummy would say otherwise, but this thing is flawed in many ways and that's what people are pointing out here.",lack of proper dx11/10/9 support is a problem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the primary issue is that intel's performance and prices won't impact amd and nvidia pricing strategy.,if the 770 performs like a 3060 then there really isn't a need for nvidia to do anything on price.,"same with amd with the 6600, 6600 xt and 6650 xt.",it is great that intel is here but if you are expecting arc to bring down ampere and rdna 2 prices it isn't going to because they already have products that compete with the same if not slightly better performance at that price and they have more stable drivers and features.....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
was on sale for a bit with rebate for $270,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just picked up a rx6600 for $220.,"i'm excited to see intel enter the market, but goddang their timing sucks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and uses less power.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and new gpus from amd/nvidia are right around the corner.,60-class gpus need to return to 200ish dollars for me to budge.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i need something to hold me over for a few years until i can upgrade my whole computer and not too keen on buying used.,what do you think about ditching a gtx 970 for an rx 6700 for use with an i7 6700 at 1440p 60hz?,i know the 6700 is gonna be a bottleneck but iâ€™m not in a position to upgrade that yet.,edit: the main thing thatâ€™s been holding me back from amd is fear of driver issues.,i just want something thatâ€™s gonna work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes but this is intel announcing an msrp.,it can still street under msrp but if they announced any lower they wouldnâ€™t be able to have sales for it.,at $329 it probably gives them some room to discount for black friday or whatever,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or 6700 non xt for 300 or so.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and gud drivers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to be fair nvidia's 3060 ""msrp"" doesn't exist, the cheapest one thus far (excluding the very limited number of msrp models at launch) has been approximately $370 for a low tier msi model.",we'll have to see how intel arc pricing plays out in reality and whether we get a card at $329.,"i agree with the your amd point, their pricing is very good right now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also the 13% faster is likely the 16gb version which has a boost in memory bandwidth as well.,there's likely a bit less performance on the $329 one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with gpus having downward pressure too.... intel should have priced it to move.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it was a750 which was 13% faster than 3060

this should be slightly better than 3060ti",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"itâ€™s a launch msrp, iâ€™m pretty sure they wanted to leave room for sales/discounts for stuff like black friday once supply ramps up.",iâ€™m willing to give it a shot for my secondary media center system since it does support av1 encoding which might be nice to have for future-proofing.,"if the drivers are really super broken for old games iâ€™ll just stream them over moonlight from my nvidia system ðÿ˜‚

gonna probably wait for a sale though",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the rx 6000 xt has ray tracing support.,the only thing the a770 has an advantage on is the encoder performance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's 8gb for that price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a year ago intel was giving coupons for arc purchase.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"during one of their events they had trivia that gave away free a770, and $100 off coupons (like 1,000).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"theoretical performance based on stats, or real-world performance?",we know intel has a lot of catching up to do regarding drivers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a770 is 16gb only,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
prices in most mexican stores always have taxes/import included in the listed price unless specified.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

rt is a gimmick but don't kid yourself.,"an rx6600 or rtx 3060 can both do, for example, to anti-cherry pick the least optimized rt title out: cyberpunk at 60fps with upscaling tech active and reasonable med/high settings mix.",my rx6600 rig can run every rt title out right now at 2560x1080 with the proper optimizations and settings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

rt is necessary.,it isn't entirely a gimmick.,here is my supporting example of why i like rt graphics.,"[https://youtu.be/s\_eewr622ss?t=886](https://youtu.be/s_eewr622ss?t=886)

it is just too awesome to ignore.",and more affordable video cards with ai upscaling (to help with the poor framerates) is desperately necessary and needed.,before it was just one company bringing ai upscaling (nvidia).,amd's offering is good but it has it's own limitations.,we need the ai upscaling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
please don't spread misinformation and exaggerate.,"dlss has improved well past the 1.0 version which was not good when it first came out, and from digital foundry's comparison of xess against dlss in sotr, it's shaping up to be a real contender assuming it performs just as well in other games.",real-time rt isn't a gimmick just because you don't see the point of it or that rdna2 was relatively weak in this aspect.,real-time rt along with ai-based upscaling are major advancements in graphics rendering.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fsr is not ai upscaling.,it uses lower resolution textures in areas where you do not need high resolution.,it is different than xess and dlss.,i am not in that field so i cannot go any further explaining the differences.,more competition in this field will be good for everyone.,even amd fsr users.,better graphics.,lower prices.,this will help the entire industry and keep us away from mobile gaming garbage.,mobile gaming is a horrendous money grab.,we need pc gaming to thrive and console gaming to succeed and push boundaries.,and they can't do it without selling good tech and good eye candy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

kind of.",it still has lots of ghosting issues.,i say all of this as a 3080 owner who has used dlss and rt.,"in all circumstances, i've not found a visual gain to rt to be worth the impact to fps, and i've not found dlss to be useful except in engines where it replaces a worse taa renderer.",metro exodus enhanced is a nifty tech demo for rt and even then i find the raster version runs smoother and looks less noisy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

they won't fix what?,intel has officially declared they are providing full directx 9 support via [d3d9on12 ](https://github.com/microsoft/d3d9on12).,that means either intel will ship that d3d9on12 translation layer bridge within their graphics driver package or microsoft will update its os with it.,all dx9 games will be running fine.,"in fact, i am willing to bet the performance per watt and performance per flops could be better with the use of this translation bridge than if they used the native directx 9.x instead, simply because dx12 has low cpu overhead.",it's kind of similar how gta iv runs ridiculously fast (some 50%+ faster in some cases) when it's run via dxvk (directx 9/10/11 to vulkan translation layer) instead of bad old native directx 9.x driver.,most pc gamers are not dumb and are capable to easily learn stuff when it comes to trying to run games.,"there are other ways to run games as well, dxvk is available for all common platforms.",you seem like you have an agenda to spread misinformation.,"it's one thing speculating stuff, i do that all the time, and it's completely immoral of you to outright  provide declaration about the stuff that isn't even available to the public yet.",who do you work for?,nvidia focus group?,amd focus group?,can't be the amd one lmao because of *tsk tsk* their ~5% market share.,you gotta be working for nvidia's interest either officially or by the method of under the table.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i could be wrong.,"the wording was ""one (1) $100 usd coupon off a graphics card based on an intelâ® arcâ„¢ gpu"" which i took to mean partner cards.",i guess we'll see once they actually send out the coupons.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"somebody on discord looked up the terms and conditions, and i can confirm it's aib-only for the coupon:

fsr 1 is a spatial upscaler and does not use any sort of historical frame data.,that's why it was easier to implement but also why the quality was relatively poor compared to temporal techniques.,but you're otherwise right.,"their description sounds more like vrs, whereas these other technologies perform upscaling.","like you said, they don't target texture quality but rather resolution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

jensen is rightly disliked by the pc gaming community for a variety of valid reasons because of the arrogant personality he projects and his misguided policies and anti-consumer business decisions but we can't deny that a founder who has served as ceo since the beginning of nvidia and steered the company to grow to the giant that it is now is quite a rarity and feat considering that both amd and intel have had ups and downs which have resulted in leadership changes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

>most pc gamers are not dumb and are capable to easily learn stuff when it comes to trying to run games.","sure, but it's still example of intel not supporting things and leaving it to users to struggle with, which proves my point even further.",>who do you work for?,nvidia focus group?,amd focus group?,yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

intel arc supports decode and encode.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

wow.,this is how you take back market share.,just fantastic.,amd could do this to nvidia on the gpu side but they probably won't.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"good deal, but it depends how much the mobos will end up being?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 13th gen are priced the way they are because they don't beat the zen4 processors.,the 13900k at $589 isn't expected to beat the 7950x at $699.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ok, so i own a ryzen 7 5800x, and iâ€™ll admit i think you have a buyer here for the i7.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can't wait so see how power efficient these will be.,currently running a 5950x limited to 140 watts and i'd love to limit it more.,i'd love to have a cpu at 60-70 watts again.,maybe i'll jump ship in one of the next few generations :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looking forward to getting a 13600k to go with my 3080 and an msi z690.. just wondering if i should go ddr4 or ddr5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

america is back bby ðÿ‡ºðÿ‡²ðÿ’ª,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i like this new intel.,"there are good things about being as predictable as they are, and weâ€™re definitely seeing a lot of them now.","at these mostly unaltered prices, i think these are just a stone-cold zen 4 killer.","you can pair a 13600k with some b660 or cheap z690 board and whatever ddr4 or cheap ddr5 you can get your hands on, and the result will be better and cheaper than any 7700x build and even most 7600x builds across the board.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're joking right?,this has been their pricing structure for a decade.,they had a very small bump in price this gen because of the record high inflation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gn specifically made a point about the 7600x no longer having that value that the older amd 5 series had.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's an awesome deal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intels big little strategy really paying dividends.,best of both worlds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
who the hell ever said the x600x is a good value?,the 3600x was one of the worst value cpus in the entire 3000 lineup considering you get the same performance with the 3600 .,the problem with amd when it comes to value is they dropped their value oriented chips from launch lineup.,the non-x variants no longer launch with the rest.,and i hope it kicks amd in the ass.,"i was soo effing pissed at them when they made the move and i am quite glad, intel is competing in perf/$.",i doubt amd will change though because they got x3d they can lean on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"never argue with amd fans boys, they see no ""wrongs"".",its almost like a cult.,"i remember one time i was showing 10700k outperforming 5600x, but for some reason these amd fans boys would still say 5600x is faster then 10900k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if anyone said it's a good value, they were comparing it by itself to its predecessor (5600x) that was also $299.",that's where the value stops.,no reputable reviewers who have reviewed the 7600x have said it's a good deal all things considered.,literally not a single one from the many dozens.,the price of ddr5 and even entry level boards are way to high right now and reputable outlets are all in consensus with that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
comparing cores like that is slightly misleading,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no comparisons made against the 7600x yet wth are you even talking about.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
amd kinda want to use most of those expensive 5nm chips in $$$ server processors.,too bad for gamerz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they'll just release the 7600 and 7700 non x, just like they did with zen3.",a little sooner this time though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>zen4 is screwed if they dont change prices.,funny thing is they really can't.,those aib's want a return on their am5 motherboards with all the bells and whistles.,especially since amd pushed for pcie 5.0 to be standard.,"they could maybe drop pricing on some of the chips, but the motherboards, and ddr5 is outside of amd's control.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes with a bios update,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, the 13600k is gonna be king for gamers.",hopefully they improve arc as well for the gpu + igpu they were talking about in earlier months.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"still solid pricing, cheaper than zen 4 mostly.",13900k has some pre-order pages on newegg for well under $700.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i hope so, but i doubt it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are getting a better 12900k for 440$ - not sure if you mean this is bad pricing or good pricing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's really good pricing when compared to amd.,there was always going to be a price bump and intel has kept it relatively tame if we're being honest.,"they're also bringing e cores to the lower end locked i5's, so more power to intel for bringing the heat.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's the expected intel pricing +inflation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mobos are the same as 12th gen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
?,13th gen will sit in any 600 series board available today.,some are quite cheap.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"based on the recent leaked review, it kinda does, but probably with quite a bit more watts",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i fully expect 13th gen to match or only be a little bit slower than zen 4 at gaming.,"however with multithread workloads, 13th gen is definitely gonna win, there's just way too many cores for ryzen to keep up.",only the 7950x could still remain on top.,"though i'm very curious about zen 4x3d, that will be a real eye opener.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7600x and 7700x are doa though.,"actually, even the 7900x is looking to be beat, albeit for higher wattage based on 12900k results.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you donâ€™t need to upgrade really unless your use case has changed substantially.,12600k is great as it is for gaming,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for efficiency i'd still look at amd.,have you seen the 7950x numbers when limited to 65w?,"edit: https://twitter.com/9550pro/status/1574397013696778240?s=20&t=gztqcwvoax-vanu1asxvda

it beats the 12900k at 125w, pretty crazy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i5 13600k is in terms of performance a competitor to the ryzen 7700x which costs $400.,how is $320 not a good price for that.,plus it's on a cheaper platform as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ðÿ¤¡,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what does this have to do with america?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they only bumped the 600 price.,700 and 900 are the same they were last gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"gn is gonna recommend the 13600k in their review, rather, it pretty much any reviewer is gonna say that.","&#x200b;

i was considering a 5800x3d to upgrade my r5 2600 but the 13600k is gonna be better for my productivity as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got a 5600x 3 months ago at micro center for under $160 after a sale and coupon.,at that price itâ€™s the best cpu of the prior generation.,things will come down in price for 7000 series after raptor lake launch.,"the 7700x isnâ€™t performing well against a 12700k now and is on par and a little above and below the 12600k depending on task, benchmarks, and game.",so if a 13700 is going to undercut that in price and probably kill it and then knock on the door of the 7900x at $549 then amd will be forced to adjust everything.,better for everyone.,i bought a 7900x today because i could.,but at $449 or $400 itâ€™s way more attractive than the nearly $585 i paid after tax,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i don't complain about those cult, i bought the 10700k for 250 usd because the 5600x was the champions cpu at everything.",i'm still rocking my 10700k for my productivity work and 1440p games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think that he's suggesting since the 7600x cores are about as fast as the 12900k p cores, it's likely the 13600k is better value than the 7600x since it has the 6 p cores matching the 7600x's 6 cores, then an extra 8 e cores on top.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7600x stinks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thin and lights only got i7-1165g7â€™s which vs i7-1065g7 is indeed an upgrade but nothing to write home about as revolutionary vs both i7-1260p and even i7-1255u.,"i7-11370h in 14 inch laptops did come out later but weâ€™re talking about initial release cpus, not modified ones later.",iris xe is good but weâ€™re talking purely about raw cpu power for the most part here.,in proper gaming laptops the cpu line did increase pretty drastically.,edit: i've had both a yoga c940 14 with i7-1065g7 and spectre x360 14 with i7-1165g7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seeing pat do pushups legitimately made me laugh.,dude is hyped.,guess that 170m comp package is paying off ðÿ¤£,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
minutes spent on moore's law being alive...  shots fired at nvidia/jensen hah.,this is a weird keynote.,they're really going to make us sit through a hour of this stuff just to see the cpus huh?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel doing it live?,nice!,i am so sick of these prerecorded events.,live feels more genuine and less scripted and cold.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so, i9 13900k priced at $590  roughly, 13700k at $420, and 13600k at $330.",seems like 13700k is the sweet spot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this presentation feels like a bunch of training modules at a new job,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
vid quality is so much better than twitch and youtube wtf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they brought linus (linux linus) on stage for the event!,pat is truly a 'geek',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's all they're going to say about raptor lake?,just one minute on the i9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
jeez 5/10 minutes spent on each of their products.,nvidia/apple would have 2 hour presentations on each.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for what it's worth at least from what is shown intel seems committed to arc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
329usd for a770!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most impressive part is 13900k matching 12900k performance at just 65w.,that is the most important innovation.,this makes me think rpl-p/h/u etc will be very good as well.,its unfortunate we did not get any details on rpl mobile considering pat said they will launch q4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dayum these guys are so uncomfortable being on the stand.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wait, and that's it?",all we got was 30s holding up an i9?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
chipotle..i don't even know what to say anymore.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i definitely think intel is a better buy than the ryzen 7000 series.,"i've gone amd for my last 2 pcs, but this time i'm definitely going intel.","they're more power efficient, a little bit cheaper, and once tech reviewers benchmark it, will likely be faster",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is my first intel reveal are they always like this ?,?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
arc availability from oct 12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oct 12

that's $230 for an a770 with the coupon hopefully.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
take a shot every time he says technology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pat pretty much states that 13900k is the best desktop cpu ever.,shots fired i guess,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"okay, 6ghz but in limited volumes?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
having trouble staying awake for this one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
he hasn't provided any technical details of the gpu at all...not even what's the 65% better performance is against.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
here's hoping we get something new about arc.,not holding my breath though...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they're gonna drop a bombshell that the prices newegg listed earlier were wrong and it's actually even lower!!!,i'm just hoping...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gpu talk!,get in here!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh the a770 has some high claims

edit: oh that's relatively cheap.","hopefully it's actually decent ($330ish us), and it's competing against the 3060 (i think).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
technical difficulties,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"samsung + intel display with microsoft your phone...
hmmm..
slideable phone displays?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, you can't keep it!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did they announce pricing for rpl?,or even when it's going to get released?,did i miss it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is terribleâ€¦ lol.,come on guys.,lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4090 who!?!?!,?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
video starts playing before pat can complete his speech,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the prices are insanely good for both the gpu and cpus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is there a good stream of this anywhere?,the streams on youtube that i found are all terrible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for 225w, no thanks",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 170m compensation is false, thatâ€™s only based on if intel hit a certain dollar per share which didnâ€™t happen obviously",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"seriously, doing pushups and then saying developers, developers, developers; [gave me ballmer vibes xd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhh_gebpohs)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"only got about 3 minutes of cpu in the whole thing, lol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"shots (indirectly) also fired at ""intel arc is dead"" mlid.",:),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"still king of gpu

lol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"live events tend to be so unprofessional looking, and they want to show things, but it's usually in a very boring way.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
was that said during the presentation?,they spent like 4 seconds on it and couldnt tell,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i needed some zzzzs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
*angry stallman noises*,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
kind of funny given i think his last two systems have not been intel since he went threadripper for his last desktop and has a m2 macbook air running fedora that he uses now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thats tomorrows event,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>underwhelming af.,the camera work was so bad i couldn't read the technical details behind him.,all i saw was the 13th gen has ddr4 support.,tomorrow they're having an event for raptor lake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
underwhelming af.,the camera work was so bad i couldn't read the technical details behind him.,all i saw was the 13th gen has ddr4 support.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't know where i heard it but it seems like they understand that it will take a few generations but also saif that they're one of the few companies that can take hits like these to get a product that they believe in up and running.,so i'm excited for another competitor in the coming decade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"what specific model is the ""competition"" they compared it to?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's gonna be an interesting proposition, although it comes down to drivers.","there's 6650xts listed for $300 right now, which would be the main competition in this price point.","seems like intel may have better rt performance, but i'm not sure if they will match the general raster performance.",at that point it comes down to drivers and fsr vs xess support in games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 13900k gets a massive advantage by raw core count increase.,"in contrast, zen 4 gets its efficiency improvements without increasing core counts.","for highly multithreaded workloads, there's not a big difference, but when it comes to battery life and efficiency while doing lightly threading things it does.","i want to know how the 13700k compares to the 12900k - that would tell us more about how mobile will perform, given that it's not expected to increase core counts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cringy.,i had my face in both palms while listening to it ðÿ˜¬,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> they're more power efficient, a little bit cheaper, and once tech reviewers benchmark it, will likely be faster

that remains to be seen.",i doubt intel will be more power efficient yet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you do you, but there is no upgrade path from a raptor lake cpu and the efficiency will definitely not be in raptor lakes favor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea this is pretty difficult to watch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
assuming we get aib cards the same day.,remember: the coupon is for aib cards *only*.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we'll see.,"it's alleged by tech sites to be more or less neck and neck, it'll be interesting to see who comes in top.","either way, power consumption has gotten out of hand for both amd and intel.",gaa-fets can't come fast enough.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its most likely going to be the 13th gen version of the  i9 12900ks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, i'd imagine they're trying to collect enough golden dies to make an actual launch with right now, then release once they've got a more substantial volume",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13900k ti ;),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
people will buy it just for the bragging rights.,would be pretty cool to own a 6ghz out the box cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wonder what they'll charge for it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the entire presentation has been cringe so far.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm assuming it was a 3060,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes same.,hopefully they will be able to keep gpu prices at least somewhat in check.,last few years have been absolutely crazy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they can say a lot of stuff but if investors don't like it since it's not an immediate profit they'll be forced to downsize or just scrap consumer gpus all together.,just look at what happened to optane.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that's actually pretty good for those of us who game casually.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ahh, is that the new intel slogan?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, i'm waiting to see what the 3d v cache brings before i buy anything.","this is all rumors, but the 7xxxxx3d versions are suppose to bring +30% over the zen 4 non-3d.",even the 5800x3d now is trading blows with both zen 4 and raptor lake (at least from the slides intel published).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel's financials have been falling rapidly for the past year.,having the sapphire rapids delayed for a year doesn't help either.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sure.,seems they are competitively priced.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
