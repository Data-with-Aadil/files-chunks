you canâ€™t contact them.,do you really believe they are going to spend several thousands of dollars just for you?,probably tens of thousands of dollars.,if you canâ€™t afford a gaming labtop your gonna have to suck it up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

dual channel.,46/44/40 gb/s on ram for read/write/copy.,maybe i could have some issues just because one of modules is soldered on motherboard and it has only dual rank mode (my 2nd stick could work as dual rank or single rank).,ram config is 8+8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" you could try to contact mihoyo support to ask if they have anything in the works for it, since implementation depends on the game developer too.","it would likely be quicker and more reliable to just work and earn more money for a better computer though, given mihoyoâ€™s long update cycles and apparent focus on game content, rather than game engine changes and optimizations.","heck, the game is still 60fps capped.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"assuming the pads did not get torn off, a skilled person could solder that cap back on the board.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s a capacitor usually in the nf (nanofarad) for those frequencies and that shade of poo brown.,itâ€™s not that the pads arenâ€™t there itâ€™s the sides of the capacitor that are still soldered on.,you can replace it just need to know what capacity they are.,edit: or try soldering it back on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that ultra tiny bit of gold wont even make a significant enough sum to make the process of melting and - even more complex task - dividing the molten metals from each other.,"as usual always a question of value and costs (in terms of work/time) - i wouldnt take that much work upon me for 20 bucks (which is already a high assumption for a desktop cpu, where you could expect maybe 0.2g of gold.","but to get that, the gold must be pure - any bit of other metal into it will even lower the price - is that worth 10-20 bucks?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"rather than using only the e-cores (performance in certain things is going to be absolute trash with just e-cores), set a lower maximum clockspeed for the p-cores, maybe even undervolt as well, but setting a lower maximum clockspeed should help a lot more than undervolting while still providing a lot better performance than e-cores would.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you canâ€™t just â€œundervolt a lotâ€ and expect stability.,"you could limit power draw, however.","from what iâ€™ve read, p-cores are most efficient below 4ghz and e-cores below 3ghz.","for a range between 3 and 4 ghz, p-cores can be more efficient for work vs power than e-cores, and at a certain â€œtoo lowâ€ point they both stop being efficient and just take too long to finish a task.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the e-cores actually arenâ€™t more efficient than the p-cores are at the same clock.,"just let your cpuâ€™s built-in controls take care of it, they downclock the cpu whenever you arenâ€™t doing work for this very reason.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in windows 11 there is a setting, ""power mode"", anything below best performance will only use e-cores if you are not locally logged in.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you end up with less performance on same power draw.,this is a result of wanting to use just e-cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think your better off just undervolting.,hell iâ€™m only running 1.28v for a 5.1p 4.1e core overclock.,iâ€™d imagine if you want to do 1.2v you could retain most of the performance as stock but pull way less power.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel and saving energy.,buddy you made me laugh my ass off,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>you canâ€™t just â€œundervolt a lotâ€ and expect stability.,uhm.. yes you can.,"by default cpu's are configured to a lot more vcore than what would be necessary, just to guarantee absolute stability for the worst binned cpu's out there.",the chances of you having such an bad outlier cpu needing that much voltage are really really small.,"nearly all 12th gen cpu's can easilly get away with a 0.1v undervolt, and that is huge in terms of power consumption (because power consumption goes squared with the vcore).",it's absolutely worth doing.,"just set offset voltage to -0.1, run prime 95 for an hour, done.",now you save 30w.,thã¡t easy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they really should have called the e-cores something else.,they aren't really meant to be like the e cores in apple silcon those really are for going into low power mode.,the little cores in intel chips are to create a hybrid processor that shines at both single and multi-core workloads instead of being good at one or the other.,"having 16, 24 or 32 little is not an efficiency play it's a clever way to use cpu real-estate, and it causes confusion when compared with apple silicon's e-cores which are in small counts because they are for truly low power things.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the e-cores by default are clocked past their optimal point on the voltage curve.,some tweaking could make them highly efficient though.,">at stock speeds, gracemont cores are more efficient.","although slower, they draw so little power that they end up consuming less energy to finish the job.",golden cove can be efficient too â€“ just not at stock.,"between 3 and 4 ghz, these p-cores can give the e-cores a run for their money.","in an integer workload, golden cove consumes about the same amount of total energy while completing the task faster.","with a vectorized load, golden cove finishes the task so much faster that it ends up using less total energy than gracemont, even though gracemont draws less power.",that means running gracemont above 3.2 ghz is pointless if energy efficiency is your primary concern.,running the e-cores at 3.8 ghz basically makes them worse p-cores.,but thatâ€™s exactly what alder lake does by default.,">  
>below 3 ghz, gracemont shines.",itâ€™s able to maintain better performance at very low power targets (as we saw in the previous section) while consuming less energy.,"with an integer workload, itâ€™s especially efficient.",but nothing scales down forever.,going under 1 ghz decreases efficiency for both cores.,"at those speeds, they take so long to finish that static power consumption erases any potential efficiency gain from lower power draw.",[https://chipsandcheese.com/2022/01/28/alder-lakes-power-efficiency-a-complicated-picture/](https://chipsandcheese.com/2022/01/28/alder-lakes-power-efficiency-a-complicated-picture/),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
unfortunatily the e cores doesn't really have any real advantage over a p core for the consumers besides lower cost (due to needing less die space).,amd cpus are actually more energy efficient and they do not include small cores in their desktop cpus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i might try that if i upgrade to raptor lake, might save me from having to replace the psu (i should maybe still do it but whatever).",i was mostly interested in seeing how the e-cores would perform by themselves.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i mean, it *could* be an efficiency play if they improve the e-coresâ€™ efficiency, but the massively improved mt/area is the real plus here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
does intel use hd cells for the e cores?,"based on mobile 15w adl-u where e core clock under workload drops below 1ghz, the answer seems to be no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but e-cores share the same voltage as the p-cores so this only works if you basically don't use the p-cores at all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"amd cpus do include small cores, rather they are smaller cores.",part of the reason why zen 3 is more efficient than alder lake is because zen 3 cores are smaller than golden cove cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well i can tell you this.,the leaks are showing raptor lake to be more efficient and run cooler at the same clocks as alder lake.,hopefully theyâ€™re true but i canâ€™t help but believe them seeing how with the i9 being 8 more cores itâ€™ll need to be.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

overclocking a 12900k with a 240 is probably a bad idea.,"youâ€™re not going to see a useful improvement, as you canâ€™t keep it cool enough.",even stock settings are going to be a challenge to cool.,you would be better to look into undervolting instead of overclocking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
im using the ml240l from cooler master,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"cinebench score is perfectly fine btw, around 27500",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not too sure, i'm playing on 1440p with an rtx 2080 so most of the time my gpu usage is at 99% and cpu usage around 30-50%.",i don't pay close attention to my temps but the highest i have ever seen it reach is ~72c playing games like this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably expected.,how soon after the start of the test area you maxing out on temps?,"if the time is too short i'd reseat the cpu, otherwise, yeah it's intel at 5.1ghz on all cores.",are the radiator fans pushing enough air  through?,that would be next on my list.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
okay .ä°ts normal.ä°f you will do render etc.,i recommend you go with minimum 280mm cooler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as you can see on the graph basically as soon as i start the bench temps jump to 100c and the cpu drops to 5ghz.,"i have the radiator mounted at the top of my case and i can feel the fans pushing air through when it reaches 100c, and the radiator does feel warm when i touch it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i thought radiator size didn't really matter since it's all just water anyway.,but thanks for helping,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
shouldn't be within seconds.,the water in the system should be able to buffer a bit and you should be seeing some slope.,is the cpu seated properly?,do you have one of these cpus with a bent top maybe?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
im assuming the cpu is seated properly but it's my first time doing it.,don't know if my cpu has a bent top but when i'm gaming the temps range from 60 to 70c at around 20-30% usage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" i had an issue getting it to work on win11 too, apparently you need to disable security settings under device protection like virtual/sandboxed apps.",was that the fix recommended?,you could try disabling and see if that helps.,"maybe i got confused and itâ€™s not 12th gen but win 11. if youâ€™re using 10, try updating the latest chipset drivers from intel and use one of those â€œdriver updaterâ€ apps to see whatâ€™s missing then download manually.",one app found the gaussian neural accelerator driver wasnâ€™t updated by intels own update app.,itâ€™s a co processor for cortina or alexa.. plus photos context search.,thatâ€™s cool so itâ€™s always good to check youâ€™re not missing some obscure driver like intel management engine lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"might be fun for open-source people, but for gamers this card is utter trash, and will be until it beats the 1650 super.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if they manage to beat the 1650 super by improving the drivers, at 139$ this is a pretty good entry-level linux gaming card.","since the drivers are open source, the card should be pretty much plug and play on linux - as opposed to nvidia.",on windows i think they are beating the card by 10% so it should be possible to achieve it.,"even though the 1650 is a very old card, i'm happy to find any gpu in that price range.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

got an asrock a380 which i pre-ordered from newegg the day they listed it.,very good for video editing.,it yields better performance decoding hevc and rendering qsv than the uhd750 built into my 11900k system.,the other thing it does is hardware rendering of av1 and vp9.,only software i have that taps into that is a plugin from voukoder.,going to try vp9 hardware rendering for youtube and see how that goes.,"as i understand it, the driver is designed to bind multiple a380 boards into a team.",so i've ordered 2 more but they're on backorder.,who knows when i'll get them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

tom's hardware reviewed it [here](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/intel-arc-a380-review/5).,"keep in mind all arc gpus are using the same av1 encoder chip so the results will be the same regardless if it's an a770, a380, or whatever else you want to buy

long story short, the thing encodes at 150-200% the speed of svt-av1 on cpu (12900k, 24 threads) and yet still somehow manages **higher vmaf scores** in the results than svt-av1.",if you're looking at picking up one of the dirt cheap models solely for video encoding rather than gaming this thing is solid gold.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm wondering, but what would you use av1 encoding for nowadays?",i don't think twitch or youtube support it (on the uploader side).,i don't think plex supports streaming it either.,so basically for archiving?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

a 12400f + cheap mobo would probably cost you around the same (~300$) while performing better than both the 9900k and 11900k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 11900k was a bit of a disaster.,"reviewers panned it, and rightfully so, as there is no reason at all to buy it for its launch price of $600 or whatever.","that said, i bought one for $280 new on amazon to replace my 10400f.","because it was so unpopular, the price has plummeted to the point where it's actually a bargain now.","it's a very good gaming cpu, and the highest sku on the socket.",it just doesn't deserve to be called an i9.,it should have been called the i7-11770k or something.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€˜s the most high end cpu for itâ€˜s platform if i am not wrong.,those chips are always expensive and will stay kinda expensive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 9900k is in a very good position where it not only fits in two of intelâ€™s probably more popular chipsets, but itâ€™s a beast of a cpu thatâ€™s a drop in upgrade for a huge amount of people which is causing the price to become inflated beyond even superior parts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just upgraded my i5-8400 to a 8700k and it was a substantial increase in gaming performance and headroom for cpu intensive games.,the i5 was bottlenecking me badly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"9900k can be used in z170, z270, and z390, so it's a sought after chip, since it's the best chip that covers three generations of chipsets.","edit: i appreciate the downvotes from someone who is smart enough to google a chipset and compatible cpus, [but here's how it's done.",](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjqolvbnhmu),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
even the 12600k outperforms the 11900k.,"if you already have to get a motherboard, there is no reason to get something that is on an obsolete socket unless there is a meaningful price advantage.","if there is enough of a price difference in the cpu+motherboard cost, then the 11900k might be worth considering.","it is still powerful enough to run anything you want for years but its better to think of it as a generation old i7 than i9, it didn't perform at that level even when new.","there are many programs which run better on the 10900k than the 11.  if your primary use is gaming then the 5600x, 5800x, 12400(f), 12600(f/k/kf) all offer equivalent or better performance, likely at better prices.","if you need heavy multithreaded, the low core count options there can't deliver as much as the 11900k but the 5800x or 12600k will give you the same performance or slightly better at almost everything.",note that the amd parts are also effectively on an obsolete socket at this point although they may be worth considering on a price to performance basis.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
people will pay to replace a dead cpu in an old socket because they don't want to upgrade their motherboard (and ram in older systems).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
best cpu on the socket.,it was also a great chip.,look at 5930k.,not the strongest chip on the x99 socket but was a freaking amazing cpu.,i had that beast for years and i think if you look around the prices for those guys is insane too still.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"shortage of supply, rocketing the price.",the higher price doesn't reflect on higher performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at some point sellers just stop tracking and keeping their prices up-to-date because the demand is so low.,"i'd say after like a solid 6 months after any new generation for a component (ie processor, gpu, mobo), the last gen prices stop.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9900k has no production and it's stock is waaay low compared so demand and supply.,11th is absolute garbage from intel so people would rather get the 3000 or 5000 series from amd or go 10th or 12th gen intel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah 600.00 on a 9900k is just plain dumb.,you can get a mb and cpu combo that outperforms that for less money.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wait and get the 13700k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a) because the 11900k is still being made.,b) because the 11900k was the worst intel cpu in at least ten years.,"honestly, just get a 12400 or 12600k and be done with it, the first is basically a 9900k and the second is basically a 10900k (and for the record, the 10900k is *better* than the 11900k).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe it's people in europe not able to afford to run an 11900k due to electricity prices :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i still want to upgrade my old i7-4930k to a 2nd hand i7-4960x for only an extra \~10% performance.,"a stupid ""want"" i'm sure.",pcs are are literally disposable due to frequent industry improvements.,a five year old gaming pc running 5ghz does **not** beat or match a new gaming pc running at 4.5ghz.,"my 2014 cpu upgrade, the i7-4960x, sells 2nd hand with postage from china for \~$300 aud.","i can get a b550m mobo, r5 5500 cpu, 16gb 3200mhz ddr4 for less than $500 aud and it would run at half the tdp, doubling the cpu-mark performance.",i think i'll get two more years out of my old 4930k rig (giving 10 years!).,i just put the gear back in a smaller breathable case to hide behind my tv.,it will be my streaming and emulation box to the big screen for a couple years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if youâ€™re looking for 9900k performance just buy a 10700 or 12400,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this might be out of topic but the 12600kf is 220 rn on amazon and that's a pretty fast chip,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"op a 9900k is not the best cpu for the price, but if you consider the cost of a new board, the 9900k does have tpm 2.0 which would allow you to go to windows 11.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its normal with basically any hardware.,"if you wait a bit and rtx 3xxx stop being made , you will most likely will find them again  at the usual crypto price tag.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was in the same boat 9600k.,i determined its not worth for just gaming alone when was on sale.,if upgrade needed thinking 12400 with cheap z690 for $400 cdn ($300usd.),pretty close comparison benchmarking and newer components.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"lol, even q9650 is price more than a i5-2400",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'll have to check what my cpu is now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11900k cypress cove you must have processor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 12th and 13th gen i5 is just as fast as the i9â€™s in their respective generation and only $250-300.,if i was going to upgrade my motherboard and cpu it would be a i5-13600k for sure.,"by far the best price-to-performance, 14core/20thread and surpasses the 12900k in almost every benchmark",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
buy a good 360 aio and go full 5ghz with your 8600k.,you will get enough to play any game.,unless you want cpu power for something else really cpu angry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh so because it might be in demand from people who don't want to upgrade their motherboard, it's more expensive than if they paid for an 11900k + a new motherboard?",lol seems like a bad idea to me.,it's made me just wanna upgrade my motherboard instead of buying it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
honestly at this point we're so close to new cpus arriving again i may as well wait a couple months for some announcements for 13th gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i made that point when it launched.,it needed to be called an i7.,rocket lake is actually pretty good.,minus the power consumption part.,"it overclocks well, and has > zen 3 levels of single threaded performance.",but it launched over a year too late.,had the 11900k launched as the 10900k (instead of the badass 10 core skylake part we actually got) it would have been received ok. but going from 10 cores back to 8 just really hurt its credibility.,i actually like the architecture.,it handles voltage like a boss!,the cores are so big they can dissipate alot of heat.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
even the 11700k is more expensive than the 11900k currently.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"damn that price is excellent for an i9, especially if you have a high end z590 motherboard to use all it's features.","i'd get one if i didn't have an 11700k already, it's been an excellent, rock solid cpu compared to the 10900k and 5600x i previously tried (crashes/bsod on the 10900 and stutters/usb issues on 5600x).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yea i mean, if it was cheaper than the 11900k, i'd probably just upgrade to the 9900k.",but the situation just doesn't make it appealing to do so.,"plus i'd get some nice new features on newer motherboards i don't currently have, like pcie 4.0 (5.0 if i wait long enough).",likely not gonna get a ddr5 board though because i feel like it's a bit too early for that and the ram is a bit pricey to upgrade.,especially when i have a nice set of ram adding to 32gb ddr4 already.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"don't forget as well that it fits the z270 if you mod it just slightly, like i've done last month :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8700k is the best!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very informative!,thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea thinking of going with a 5800x3d or intel 13th gen cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
might even go for the 13600k.,i'm sure it'd still be worlds better than an 8600k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's disappointing in some contexts.,it's barely faster than the 10900k in some things and is slower than the 10900k in a few things as well -- not nice for what's supposed to be a newer generation chip.,it also uses quite a bit of power under full load.,"actual performance is still pretty competent though, usually in the same ballpark as zen 3 chips for games, and if you need avx-512, it fits that niche use.","it also supports pci-e 4.0, so it has that over 10th gen as well.","i don't think it's a chip one should feel bad about having, if they got it at a good enough price.",it is going for pretty cheap in a lot of places at the moment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
real and true,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you get down votes for saying something not far from the truth.,"if gas prices went up 300% in a month a **lot** of people would have to stop driving, just like many gamers are forced to buy lower tdp cards and cpus thanks to rising electricity costs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"unless you have an lga 1200 motherboard handy, even the lowly 12600k is way better so just don't do it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea you might be onto something.,"price isn't a huge worry anyway, it was mostly laziness on my part wanting to upgrade without swapping my mobo out.",but its from 2017 so i may as well refresh my mobo and my cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i can already go to windows 11.  my 2017 board is tmp 2.0.. i simply don't want to go to windows 11, lol.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm gonna wait and see what 13th gen intel has in store.,or perhaps ryzen 7000.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"honestly, i'm not one to do any manual overclocking.","and that's fine, to each their own.",i used to get absolutely obsessed over it.,i'd rather just install it and not worry about it.,"and i have the money to be able to upgrade, i just don't like upgrading super often because again, i don't wanna obsess over it.",i just feel it's about time to after having that cpu nearly 5 years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's dumb, but sadly that's how it works with old intel part.",the opposite is true with intel server platform though.,they have so much used xeon stock due to company upgrading their server and so few motherboard that the cpu is dirt cheap while old x motherboard still priced in the hundred.,there're also some chinese companies harvesting chipset from dead motherboard to make new one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
older cpus essentially become specialty parts due to low supply and a very niche market.,"the 4770k is currently ""still"" $200 on amazon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
welcome to pc users.,people who don't know much about hardware and coupled with a desire to reuse a component (motherboard) outweighs objectivity and critical thinking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i watched used i7 7700k go for about $330 on ebay back around in early 2020.

at that time, you could sell a 7700k + z270 and turn around to use the proceeds to buy a new motherboard and a ryzen 3700x/3900x or 9600k/9700k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
some peole don't want to build a new computer though.,like i'm pushing it off as i'm at a 97k.,i have a 3090 and 32 gigs of ddr4 ram right now.,got that z390 motherboard.,"i just don't want to take the computer apart, just not in the mood to do something like that at all.","i'd need a new cpu, motherboard, ddr5 ram, would prolly need something better than the evo 212 fan as well.",time and money.,not everyone wants to take apart their build every year when a new piece comes out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i believe they stated that 13th gen will use the same socket as 12th,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah it's the most clever thing to do.,"after all the 8700k is still a very good cpu, there's non need to rush.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that supports his point,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13th is going to be hella expensive.,something like $700 for the 13900k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yup, it compares it to the ryzen 7 5800x in my opinion, which is also $280.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"heck even in a choked prebuilt with an underclocked 11700f, a hump of aluminium can handle 75+ watts (maybe 85 degrees or so) while a gpu is emitting 140 watts of heat and at a room temp of ~30 as long as you crank up the only case fan it has... haha",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah especially right now itâ€™s not for everyone, i was lucky enough to get mine for for 260$ and sell my 8700k for 200$, so 60$ for 2 more cores and 4 more threads on the same mobo.",however for  350$+ it starts to just make sense to go for gen 4 speeds and newer architecture.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh, of courseâ€¦ but the problem is that everything in its general vicinity has always slaughtered it in price/perf, even the initially horrendously overpriced ryzen 7 5800x.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but.. for the price it doesn't seem so bad.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
right - it wasn't meant as a joke.,"if i was paying what some europeans were paying for electricity these days, and often on lower incomes than people in the us receive, it'd be a big deal to be burning up more than 2kwh per day to run a desktop pc.","even if i could afford it, the operating costs of an 11900k vs. something more efficient would make it worth looking at whether i could get something more efficient.",the 11900k is intel's equivalent of the prescott from the pentium 4 cycle - a last ditch effort to have headline leadership using the old architecture by pushing the power consumption and thermal envelope to the max until the new architecture and process is ready to take over.,"in the case of p4, the ""new architecture"" was the core line.","also, when you're a business multiplying the cost over hundreds of units, it adds up.",that's without even talking about potential rationing where you just can't run them at all if you exceed your quota.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
even aio won't do you any good if you don't delid.,the limiting factor on that gen is the thermal most of the time.,it can accept quite a lot of power without degradation and go up to 5ghz with relative ease.,just not possible to cool without delid.,if you had to buy new things you might as well just wait for 13th gen coming and upgrade.,9900k is entirely pointless.,"for the price of a used 9900k cpu alone, you can get a cheap 12600k and motherboard that will run a circle around a 9900k.",plus you still run into the problem of cooling it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

on the other hand iâ€™ll upgrade for 10% uplift so maybe iâ€™m the other end of the spectrum",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
still can perform far more task than console user who just plays game a day,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean.. my reasoning for wanting to keep my mobo is it still works fine and i still have options better than my 8600k.,also due to sheer laziness of not wanting to take my build apart.,but the 9900k being $400+ dollars just ain't it for me.,so i'm most likely gonna upgrade to a new mobo when i see what these newer cpus have to offer.,(13th gen intel or amd ryzen 7000),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's how i was feeling.. wanting to upgrade to a 9900k to keep my board was out of sheer laziness on my part haha.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well that's good.,means i can utilize a ddr4 board instead of going to ddr5 this early.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm on an 8600k.,6c/6t.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
who says i wanna get a 13900k?,"i'd probably get something like a 13600k and it would drastically outperform my 8600k, which honestly still works great for me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have pci-e 3.0 nvme ssds so its not like i'd notice an increase in speed going to a gen 4 mobo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"it's fine, i'm not gonna do any overclocking likely ever again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then you'll also be going to ddr5 if you wait for the next gen of cpus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yup.,"i considered it as well out of pure laziness but i decided that i will just wait it out,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well hopefully you can extrapolate from my comment that intel will be raising prices on the 13600 level too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™d call it more than â€œnot goodâ€ considering it was priced alongside the ryzen 9 5900x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nah.,13th gen intel works with 12th gen boards that have ddr4.,so it's not like i have to go ddr5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea i think that's the best idea.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea that's fine.,rather get a new 13600k than an old 9900k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

will rpl cpu support these speeds when installed into z690 board?,"hope so, it should be more of a cpu limit than mobo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

with how expensive ddr5 is currently and how there's little to no benefit in ddr5 over ddr4(for gaming atleast) i reckon intel will have an edge over amd with the next gen cpus considering the ryzen 7000 only supports ddr5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this was surpassesed a while ago, 7800c32 on unify itx with hynix a",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'd caution against people making generic broad statements from a rather limited test (i'm assuming most people are referencing the hub spider-man cpu test).,that data is specifically showing ddr5 6400 (not sure what latency they used) against ddr4 3200c14 on a 12900k.,simplifying that to just generically implying that all ddr5 will outperform all ddr4 to that degree on all cpus in spider-man is misleading.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

truly a shame,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's really separate from the issue i'm describing.,it's not whether or not spider-man with rt is a representative test.,"i would not be surprised that future games with rt show similar scaling specifically on the 12900k (or faster) with ddr5 6400 vs ddr4 3200.

my issue is simplifying that down to just referencing it as ddr5 will be faster than ddr4 to that degree on rt as i've been increasingly seeing since that test came out.",ddr5 4800 is ddr5 as well.,there is faster ddr4 than 3200. there's also slower cpus than the 12900k that support ddr5 and ddr4.,"even let's just say keep the same cpu, you can't just simply assume that the difference is that significant if you change the ddr5 and ddr4 comparison points.","we don't know at this point what the difference would be with say -

ddr5 4800 (or something like 5400) vs. ddr4 3600

or

ddr5 6800 vs ddr4 5333

or whatever other comparison.",for all we know something like ddr4 4000 vs ddr4 3200 (what they used) would in itself provide a 10% or higher speed up.,whereas if they dropped down to ddr5 5400 (or lower) against ddr5 6400 (which they used) that would also drop performance down significantly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this bodes well for vr as well.,i'm having a hell of a time keeping stable rates.,"that being said i am currently using a 9700k @5.0, 6900xt and 32gb ddr4 @ 3200.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's important to note that that trend, if you are referencing the hub video making the rounds, vanishes pretty much entirely at 4k, regardless of rt being on or off.","it's *slightly* better, but borderline margin of error difference.","however, at 1080p and 1440p, yeah you're right **holy hell** what gains.","i imagine it's probably because of pc lacking directstorage technology right now, which the ps5 can use for asset decompression/streaming.","the significantly higher bandwidth of ddr5 ram is what helps there a lot, if i'm understanding it right.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i agree.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my 32gb 3600 rated ram is maxed out at 3200 as i'm still on a z-270 board.,"i am also using vr, but mostly flying, and honestly gpu is still mostly the bottleneck despite having a 3080.

i will probably keep my 32gb ddr4 with hopefully higher speeds on a new board, and go for a 13600k, my hunch is that getting anything better will be firmly at diminishing returns and even top kits will be slow in 3-4 years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there seems to be some misunderstanding here.,i am not saying there is zero advantages or differences (outside of speed/latency) of ddr5 vs ddr4 even with slower cpus.,i'm not saying this is an edge case that won't translate to future games.,"i'm also not making some broad statement of how ddr5 on a whole stacks against ddr4, i'm actually specifically arguing people shouldn't do such a large generalization.",i'm only stating that the there are more variables in here that may change the numbers involved.,let's just throw out the cpu for a moment.,"this is still a test specifically with respect to ddr5 6400 vs ddr4 3200.

but if we just simplify it to ddr5 vs ddr4 it gives someone the impression that if they bought ddr5 4800 vs. say ddr4 4000 they would see the same level of increase (or at least roughly).",do we know that is the case with spider-man rt?,without more test data i wouldn't feel comfortable saying that.,do we even know much gains ddr4 4000 would get against 3200 in this specific test?,or how much perf you might lose dropping down to ddr5 4800 vs 6400?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"in windows environment variables, point tmp and temp to it.","you can also use mklink to redirect browser cache, steam cache, discord cache (etc.)",folders to it.,"that's what i've been using them for anyway, but i'm sure there are more creative uses than mine.","ditto for linux, using symbolic links.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">like i use mathworks matlab, this thing is like 10gb by itself and it has very very large number of small files.",that's a good use case.,another good use case would be to use it for window's paging file.,">i have a $10 orico nvme enclosure combined with this

"the problem with comparing a laptop cpu with a desktop cpu is that a laptop is always going to be thermally limited, the 11700h can boost up to 4.6ghz, however after i *think* about minute or so it drops (i think to base), so it'll heavily depend on what you're using it for.","single-thread performance seems to be pretty similar, 11800h should have a bit better multi-thread performance **while** it's boosting, but as soon as it hits the boost time limit it'll be significantly worse.","also, for the 5600x, you can increase clockspeed by +200mhz single-core and even more all-core (i think around +400mhz for when it uses all threads) thanks to pbo and increasing the power limits, my 5600x without pbo boosts to 4600-4650 for single-core, all-core i believe was around 4200mhz, with pbo and increased power limits it could boost up to 4850mhz single-core and i think 4650 or so all-core, but it'd use around 115w or so when maxing out all the cores, it'd also push to around 85c+ (although this is with a very quiet fan-curve), i didn't care for the small performance increase so i went back to *mostly* stock, i think i left the power limit increased.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

take the money you save by choosing a 12400f and buy a 3060 ti.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a) the 3050 and 3060 are still complete garbage at their significantly-above-msrp street pricing (and are bad even at msrp).,"get a 6600 xt, they can be had for $300 now and beat the 3060 across the board.","(for the same reason, the 6700 xt is a better buy than the 3060 ti.)","b) for gaming, get the 12400f, any cpu money above that is better spent on the gpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thereâ€™s a pretty big difference.,"one is 6 core, the other is 6+4 core with a 500mhz faster max turbo.","one is overclockable but needs a more expensive z690 board to get the most of it, and the otherâ€¦.",not.,also there is a 12600kf.,and a 12400. so iâ€™m not sure why you specifically mention one without an igpu and one with.,but which is best or at least â€œappropriateâ€ is totally dependant on your needs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"depends on your needs, if you have time (upgrade), i would suggest you to wait atleast for raptor lake (13th gen) as they will all have more cores especially i5 (6 to 10 and 10 to 14 due to hybrid cores), but if you need it now, well it depends if you want to overclock or not.","k cpu are unlocked and overclocking ready, while f are standard but with no igpu so cheaper you can even found kf version.","if for any reason youâ€™re going with amd then donâ€™t take 5000 series, wait for 7000 as itâ€™s launch is in a month from now and theyâ€™re taking lga way with new mobo but they still donâ€™t have hybrid cores (zen5)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"it depends on the game, there's plenty of games @ 1080p where the 3060 wins or is equal, and raytracing isn't ""a bit worse"", the 3060 is around 50% faster with rt, plus no dlss on the 6600.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"speaking from personal experience, and using it in a hot box with only 1 intake and 1 exhaust fan, it is enough for daily usage, unless you run apps that fully stress out the cores and threads like cinebench r23 multi threaded benchmark on 1 hour loops.",it climbed to the low 90s in that app (and went up to 85w package power) after an extended period of time but that was the worst case scenario.,for gaming and normal usage the stock cooler should be enough and only reached the mid to high 50s for me.,i still ended up swapping it with a cheap tower cooler since i use it for heavier all core workloads like rpcs3 and handbrake regularly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's okay for stock speed under typical conditions.,that's the entire purpose of a stock cooler.,if you want better temperatures for overclocking and/or lower noise then get an aftermarket cooler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you don't need to upgrade but i'd strongly recommend it.,here's coolers compatible with your case and lga 1700: https://pcpartpicker.com/products/cpu-cooler/?compatible_with=pdphp6#sort=price&c=40 and something like this has a 120mm fan and would be a decent upgrade: [thermalright assassin x 120 refined se](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/q6h7yj/thermalright-assassin-x-120-refined-se-6617-cfm-cpu-cooler-ax120-se-d3),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nope.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
40s max?,are you serious or is this simply because of less cpu intensive games?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my case can't support coolers with a height of above 150 cms.,"so i need low profile coolers, the cheapest being cm hyper h410r.",other low profile coolers are from noctua which are costly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
noise doesn't matter for me.,i have a noisy environment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"na, noise doesn't matter for me, as my environment itself is noisy and fans sounds are inaudible mostly.","i don't use cinebench, handbrake etc and obviously i can't overclock a locked processor.","maybe once in a while i may use da vinci resolve, and is gaming included in typical conditions?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
currently running halo infinite max settings at 55c max.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you can afford it, the hyper is a great cooler for the price.",but ofc only upgrade if you notice thermal throttling or just want cooler temps in general.,"i managed to get a ""b-stock"" 240mm aio from arctic for 50 bucks that comes with a 6 year warranty.",i think they're still for sale on ebay but a radiator may be tricky with a small case.,"however its an amazing cooler, and for 50 bucks with a warranty of 6 years is incredible imo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you'll be fine with the stock cooler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"then it looks like i will go for the hyper which is decent enough for an i3 or i5, hopefully..it costs only 1,800â‚¹ which is around 23 $.. some reviewer on the shop website(i will be buying from a shop which also delivers online across india) put it with the 12700k and says on stress test the cpu runs at 100â°c and while gaming it's between 70 to 90..50 $ is equal to 4,000â‚¹, which is a bit overkill and costly for a cooler for a locked i5 in india i feel..and anyway ebay in us and india are completely different.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thank you, going to go for the stock.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so the leaks say.,i hope it's not true because i was wishing for a raptor cove i5/i3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so 13100 ~ 12100 and 13400 ~ 12600k

the 13400 could be decent if priced well but the i3 is very scummy if they decide to basically rebrand the 12100.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13700f better be with it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel's doing the exact same they did with i3 and lower still being comet lake after 11th gen rocket lake became available, except they'll name the alder lake i3 refresh 13100 instead of the more technically correct 12105.

maybe intel expects raptor lake to be more limited in quantity them alder lake, which was the same situation as rocket lake?",or maybe intel plans to keeping making alder lake up to the introduction of 14th gen meteor lake?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
said the leaks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean thats the way it was with 6700k -> 7700k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13600k or higher are all rpl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
more like going from comet lake i3 10100 to 10105.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they were not literally the same chip.,"they did have fairly similar specs on the surface, but the 7700k was built on an updated 14nm process, had a new integrated gpu, and a couple small feature additions.","here, it's looking like the 13100 will literally be the *exact same* chip that intel was selling as the 12100, with no actual improvements.","perhaps a stepping change or something, but nothing notable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so wait anything under is just a rebrand or there is some slight improvements?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> it's looking like the 13100 will literally be the exact same chip

i'm sure it'll come with a mild clock speed increase but fair enough on the other points",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
leaked specs have +100mhz base freq at same tdp.,"locked i5s might be the ""same chips"", but with a shitload extra cores compared to 12th gen desktop.",6+8 at 65w base is pretty sick and the sort of tdp where the e-cores start to make sense.,"this is just the ""add more cores and some cache"" refresh, a new die for a single ~ $100 sku doesn't make much sense.",keeping the quad cores ridiculously cheap does make sense.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 7700k had the same gpu, it just updated the display output.",it was basically a new stepping for the 6700k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13200 to 13600 rebrands.,"i mean ipc has barely changed, it just an uplift in clocks so they wouldn't benefit much from it.",13100 maybe a new chip.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ah thatâ€™s a shame and unfortunate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes for ddr5 the speeds listed is for 2 slots.,4 slots speeds are lower especially for z690 boards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the official support for four dual-rank sticks is 3600. intel's memory controller in alderlake can't work with this much ddr5 memory at stock speeds.","if your thinkstation supports ram overclocking, you can try.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the memory controller has to work harder the more sticks of ram you have.,"it also depends on how they physically run the traces on the mobo since ram timings are very sensitive to that stuff 

this is why most extreme overclockers only run with 1 stick of ram.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
shitty imc?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™ve been mentioning this since like november last year, and motherboard makers arenâ€™t keeping it a secret either, but the official rated speeds for alder lake ddr5 are:

- 4800mhz - 2 dimms in a 2 slot motherboard (aka msi unify-x, asus z690 apex)
- 4400mhz - 2 1r or 2r dimms in a 4 slot motherboard
- 4000mhz - 4 1r dimms
- 3600mhz - 4 2r dimms

your 128gb is the last option.",more memory modules of higher density involves a more difficult topology to keep stable at high timings.,companies like dell even advertise that their 128gb ddr5 products are running at 3600mhz.,"and if you remember the very first alder lake benchmarks to come from intel last year, they specified 4400mhz ddr5 memory.",why?,because that was their own specification with the motherboards they had.,"and technically is also the spec for 95% of ddr5 motherboards out there, despite everyone thinking 4800mhz is the baseline.","also, just as a general rule, alder lake does not like running with 4 sticks of anything (well, at â€œmore than baseline speedsâ€).","if you require lots of memory, either accept that itâ€™s going to be slow, or try to stick with 2 dimms maximum (ie 2 x 32gb) as that will be easier to tweak.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"as i see that you own a thinkstation p360 ultra, may i ask you if it has a gpu whitelist on it?","i was interested on one of those but i own a gtx 1650 (75w) gpu already, and i would like to move it over to the new machine if possible",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah good luck with 4 dimms.,i run 6600 but itâ€™s two dimms on unify-x.,i hear 13900k can support up to around 7200mhz on two dimms.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is there really a point going ddr5 at this point in time?,seems like there isn't much improvement.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
computer programs can run very differently on different hardware.,depending on their implementation they maybe just not designed for ddr5 memory.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are using the 4 slots.,if you only use 2 it will be 4800mt.,also another thing is activate xmp.,good luck sr!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

as is with every new generation of memory.,ddr4 is very mature at this point.,"but back on release, getting memory up to 2800mhz was a chore and at cl timings that were awful.",2133 ddr3 cl9/10 was better until 3200cl14 became standard for higher end ddr4 memory.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"issue comes from atrocious secondary and tertiary timings, as xmp got crazy in terms of timings/frequency curve already at half life of ddr4.","regular joe needs to wait for new xmp implementation, the rest of us can simply fix what's broken in bios.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"for specific workloads the higher bandwidth will be a blessing but in most cases you're right, ddr5 doesn't bring much improvement at the moment",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mts (megatransfers) is more correct than mhz.,"since ram is ddr, the real physical frequency is actually half of the listed one.","""3200mhz"" ram actually runs at 1600mhz physical frequency, but it transfers data twice per clock cycle (ddr = double data rate), so it achieves 3200mts.","edit: to the person who said that mts is a *sucky* unit and it should be megabits instead, that would require multiplying the mts by the bus width, which differs between types of ddr, even in the same version (non-ecc and ecc typically have different bus widths).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looks like its a small form factor prebuilt.,nearly all sub-itx custom mobos and even some itx will use sodimms to save space.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"shit signal integrity due to the higher mhz, requiring the lowering of clock speeds to compensate.","is also problem on higher end motherboards, which cannot go above 6600mhz at some times because of said signal integrity",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
high frequency buses are always point to point.,"pcie, usb, sata, etc all hook one device to one port.",in the old days we had parallel pci and parallel sata where you could split and have more than one device per bus.,"they maxed out at ~100 mhz or less, not 5 ghz+.","it is hard to design a split in a high frequency line that will work correctly, and even harder to design it so that it will work correctly with and without something in the second socket.","tl;dr be amazed it works at all with two dimms per channel, ddr5 is probably the last memory type that will allow that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it could be to retain signaling integrity across larger capacity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's because memory controller can't handle too many memory ranks at high speed.,it is like asking one babysitter to take care of two vs four hyperactive kids.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so thankful for all the responses i dig some digging too and while technically slower by clock speed the added bandwidth is still faster than the ddr4 variation would have beenâ€¦for reference the specs of this machine now configured is:

pretty much.,you can lift 4 dimms to 5200-5600 mhz but have fun with that with no overclocking experience.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it would depend on the board.,"if you're sticking to an oem system, then you will be very disappointed.","however, if you're going with a custom system then xmp should be able to handle clocking them higher.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"you are right, but you did not include the technical reason that signal integrity is worsened by having a second dimm installed in a memory channel.","consumer-grade dimms are udimms, or unbuffered dimms.",that means that a cpuâ€™s integrated memory controller is directly connected to the memory on each udimm with no chips that can assist the memory controller in controlling the memory chips on the udimms.,"this results in the lowest possible latency, lowest possible cost, and high electrical loads on the memory controller which hurt signal integrity.","servers and workstations that are designed to hold large amounts of memory use registered dimms or rdimms, or load-reduced dimms or lrdimms.","rdimms are built with a register clock driver or rcd which intercepts the clock and command buses from the memory controller, amplifies them and cleans them up, and then drives the amplified signals to the memory chips at the cost of one clock cycle.","this immensely reduces the load on the clock and command buses, but do nothing to the data busesâ€™ loads and latency.","a lrdimm adds data buffers on the data buses which intercept the data on the data buses in both directions, amplify and clean up the data signal, and drive the amplified data signals in both directions at the cost of latency.",this intensely relieves the load on the data buses.,"to be clear, lrdimms include an rcd to buffer the clock and command buses like what an rdimm has.",both rdimms and lrdimms allow servers and workstations to support larger memory loads that consumer-grade systems cannot support at all or can support only at lower memory throughput.,"these types of dimms add latency, but this latency is nothing compared to being forced to use virtual memory on the ssd or hdd.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that depends on what motherboard and cpu that you have.,"if you have a consumer-grade cpu, you can't do squat about that unless you want to try to overclock the memory and memory controller.",consumer-grade cpus and/or firmware for them cannot use neither rdimms nor lrdimms and are stuck with udimms.,"intel users will have to buy a xeon cpu, the required memory type, and a motherboard that can host both.","some workstation motherboards can only take rdimms and cannot take lrdimms, for example.","you could go the hedt route if you have not bought anything yet since hedt processors have more memory channels, and then you can spread out the dimms among the additional memory channels so that you do not have too many dimms weighing down any one memory channel too much.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"to use mbps would require a complete change in the numbers that are used as primary specs, and they'd be even more meaningless to the end-user.",the numbers could differ vastly between similarly performing ram sticks based on how ecc is done and some other parameters.,this would only cause end-users to confuse the marketing number with real world performance (the bus mbps is very different from the usable mbps).,"imo the correct thing would be to just use the physical frequency, not the transfer rate (since there are two **transfers** for each single physical clock cycle).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

kidding man.,don't worry about the 'high' please.,your query seemed haphazard that is all.,'not experienced in computers' explains it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the ambient temp is 20c.,the idle temp is 45 to 55. if i start playing something  like league of legends it goes to the 73 but if i play something like start citizen  just for being in the menu it goes to 90 to 95 if i activate the full speed of the fans i have 5 fans attached to the aio and 1 in the back of the desktop without counting the ones that the gpu have that is a 3070,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

can i use only e cores on legion slim 7i for best battery life?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s not that simple.,the e-cores are more efficient at very low speed but not when under heavy load trying to run it fast.,so what you would ideally want is only e cores when the machine isnâ€™t actually doing anything important but p-cores running any software you are using.,best let the machine decide those.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

several thoughts looking at that screenshot.,"- i donâ€™t know how long of a time those min/max readings represent, but since i donâ€™t see any minimum clock speed below 5ghz iâ€™m going to assume youâ€™re running the high performance power plan, which is not the best move if you care about system temps.","- you only show 86% max cpu utilization, which means those max temps arenâ€™t very accurate.",maybe that core had a higher load than the others.,"- you appear to be overclocking, so what other settings have been changed?",- there will always be â€œcoolâ€ and â€œhotâ€ cores.,i have one core thatâ€™s significantly cooler than the rest.,"usually a large disparity (15+ degrees) with one or more hot cores could indicate a cooler mounting issue, but with no knowledge that all cores were stressed equally for those readings, itâ€™s hard to say.","- your average seems to be 83-87, making the 93 not seem that far off for a â€œhot coreâ€.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it is overclocked and this was me playing apex, but when running cinebench i encounter the same issue.",overclocked and stock.,the only setting that was touched is xmp and using the ai over clock but once again regardless of the overclock the issue persist,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just for the sake of seeing what the situation is like prior to tweaking, could you turn ai overclock off (set it to xmp mode), keep mce on, then run r23 for a minute or so and take a temp/power/voltage screenshot while itâ€™s running?","even if you really want to keep ai overclock enabled, at least update showing what a true 100% load looks like so we can see those temps.","also, hwinfo64 is generally better for monitoring.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"okay i will, i have hwinfo64.",iâ€™ll change all setting and get back to you.,how long would you like to me to run r23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just until temperatures stabilize.,"i get the feeling that your hot core may throttle, as r23 is probably going to push more the 205 watts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
okay iâ€™ll get back to you in a bit changing setting rn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"okay so here we go i added the [results](https://imgur.com/a/oypuoev) i returned everything to stock like you said and ran r23, i always found it interesting that my score was below the average that most people got stock with the 12900k 

my coolant temp settled to 37c and my ambient was 25c",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nah, that score is well within the margin of error for r23.",itâ€™s not the most consistent benchmark in terms of +/- 500 points.,"honestly, everything looks good there.","you didnâ€™t throttle, below 90 is good, 216 watts is actually a pretty low consumption for stock voltages in r23, and a 9 degree difference from hottest to coldest is pretty normal.","best i can suggest is adding some undervolting to your overclock, or skipping overclocking and concentrating solely on undervolting.",each 100mhz increase requires exponentially more power and heat on the 12900k.,intel set the stock speeds pretty damn high.,"you could also try remounting just to see if that improves anything, but it probably wonâ€™t.",whatâ€™s your sp rating?,"also, maybe look into tvb - thermal velocity boost - which can add a +2 multiplier when the cpu is under lower load.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"got it, well i didnâ€™t mind my temps before i just wanted to make sure that delta was normal",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think the delta gets exaggerated with overclocking on the â€œhotâ€ core.,"my 12900k also has a 9 degree delta between hottest and coolest cores on r23, but in my case most of mine are on the hotter side and iâ€™ve just got one core thatâ€™s extra cool.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

well to be honest than go with ryzen 5500u and b450 motherboard.,"i understand, i didnt have much money and still feel a bit stretched.",started on pentium g4560 and upraded to i5 9400f when i had more money.,9400f has similar performance as i3 10105f but right now i know that i realy miss hp.,if you insist on 10105f go for b560 motherboard where you can use 3200hmz ram kits and upgrade to up 10700f.,problem is that older intel cpu are always quite expensive so keep that in mind.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that was my plan yes, 2x8gb dual channel",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well aim for rtx 3060 but wait a bit.,also if you dont care abou ray tracing look rx 6600 or rx 6600 xt.,they migh be cheaper too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

wait for price drop.,it will be huge.,i remember rx 570 4gb for 100 eu after the first crash in 2019. rx 6600 migh cost 200-250 soon.,"hell, even gtx 1660 super used to cost around 250 before crypto madness.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s 73â‚¬ on bscom and 75â‚¬ on alza,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thatâ€™s also current pricing after theyâ€™ve been out for 6 months.,when they released the msrp was a good bit more.,"smaller retailers typically offer less of a discount, doesnâ€™t seem like a great reason to disregard their price leak as being terribly inaccurate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
720 for 12900k is already overpriced considering the msrp is 589 and you can find it for that price on newegg etc.,intel hasn't raised prices for their cpu's beyond accounting for inflation in a very long time.,there is no reason so far to think they'll break the trend this time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think i could beleive this pricing.,it would put the cpu pricing between zen4 and alder lake as being kinda comparable up the stack.,"which, yeah .",.,.,"would make amd's am5 platform more expensive overall with mandatory ddr5 and probably no b650 board for a couple months

(i don't know what the current rumors are for amd 600 series motherboard availability is going to be, just guessing it'll be like 500 series)

to me, it seems like amd is targeting the higher end / early adopter part of market that might not be as price sensitive, and there might be some price cuts scheduled as zen4 production ramps, but that's my guess of what's going on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel is going to have to do the same, people with alder lake is probably not upgrading",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
may be amd will price it higher too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if raptor lake is like 5% faster, they could easily be real.",13600k will probably compete with the 7700x for the earlier claimed $299.,"and alder lake can be paired with cheaper ram, and older motherboards.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you say that but isnâ€™t this the same retailer that leaked zen 4 pricing and the 7950x was more expensive?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13700kf should basically be like a 12900ks but with lower power draw and price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i still can't justify replacing my 9700k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we still have a 3770k and a 7700k in use.,what's wrong with your 8700k?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7950x wonâ€™t cost 800$ and 13900k wonâ€™t cost 739$,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its gonna be a while before prices are anywhere near the alderlake era.,maybe never!,"but despite intel's high prices, it's hard to make a switch to amd cz.",i never used an amd chip before.,"the first-time switch is the hardest, maybe the next generation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

$720 canadian (this thread is about a canadian retailer).,thatâ€™s $555 usd.,newegg.ca wants $755.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the reason people think theyâ€™ll raise prices is because [intel announced to their partners that theyâ€™re going to raise prices](https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-plans-price-hikes-broad-range-chip-products-nikkei-2022-07-14/).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"even then, they are undercutting the early adopters.","like the point of early adoption is to pay a higher price/performance for early exposure to the best performance, but it not only might not beat the 13900k, but there are multiple rumors suggesting 6 months later amd is going to release a 7950x 3d.",like whoâ€™s the target early adopter audience here if theyâ€™re not even buying the fastest chip within 6 months?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh yes i am, resale value on that 12900k only going lower and hopefully the upgrade can be done for less than 150 out of pocket.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel might have people like me that are on older zen products that're getting fed up with amd increasing prices every generation coming back, i'm interested in either the 13700k or 13900k depending on pricing, if intel is very competitive i'll put up with the extra power usage.",just has to decimate 5800x3d while costing the same.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

they probably beat regular zen 4 but v-cache ones will be a problem.,i imagine they just wait it out until meteor lake to have an answer to those.,so it will be like 8 months of getting beat by some expensive zen4 3d.,some price adjustments then should be enough.,"so yeah, don't buy early.",adl prices dropped quite a bit around april to now for example.,general availability of locked skus also helps  at lowering prices.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">the price increases could come into effect in autumn and the percentage increases are likely to range from a minimal single-digit increase to more than 10% and 20% in some cases

which is exactly the price range increase that every single gen goes through.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
one large caveat with that is i believe the context of that statement was intel communicating with their oem partners.,intel's volume pricing especially with their larger partners on per unit level is lower than even the official 1000 unit tray prices they advertise for rcp.,per unit margins for retail have always been the highest.,as such it's not immediately clear still how this would affect retail.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if the pricing is right the only thing amd can say is that they'll support their boards for a couple more generations but looking at past issues they've had it might be better getting a newer board later on anyway.,5800x wasn't enough over the 3700x for me to upgrade (cost too much with the price increase) and the 5800x3d was too close to 13th gen intel and zen 4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
longevity is a myth.,you can always sell your cpu and motherboard together and get a newer generation one + it will fetch a better price and will be easier to sell that together.,"if you sell cpu alone, the buyer has to have an older generation cpu and wanting to upgrade the processor + should be able to sell his older generation cpu to someone else or just discard it.","for example if you want to sell your zen 2 cpu and buy a zen 3, then someone with a zen 1 has to be there wanting to upgrade to a zen 2. then he will have to discard his zen 1 cpu.",i've tried to sell cpu alone and together with motherboard as combo.,for me it was much easier to sell that together and fetched me a better price.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
am4 is now 6 years old.,there is no reason to suggest am5 will age any differently.,how long will lga 1700 last?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3d cache versions of amd's cpus are very much news, perhaps just not the sort of news you were wanting to hear.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

90c with an aio is abnormal when under medium-low load.,it's possible there isn't proper contact between the cpu's ihs & the cold plate of your water block.,"if you think it is worth the effort and you're confident in your ability to do so, i would reapply thermal paste and reinstall the waterblock.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"once you have to add voltage, generally stability goes downhill pretty fast.","also, just because you managed to only have to raise that much doesnt mean everyone can.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sure it isn't, not encouraging anyone, just added my two cents here.",i think it was well over a year ago when i've got issues and 0.01v increase solved them.,"btw i've read opinions that voltage in general works more against stability and longevity than heat, and with heat it is rather about the cycles that matter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it is temperature, amperage (which is affected by voltage) and a few smaller factors that play the biggest role in degradation.","heat cycles shouldnt matter that much, since the only effect it has is physical expanding and contracting, which could cause cracks in the die.","if that is the issue, you will get a big loss of stability all at one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i keep repeating myself on this, but the intel base frequency is an **absolutely meaningless number**.",the cpu does not have a base frequency that it sits at.,"it has a range that it operates between - for your 12700f itâ€™s from 400mhz up to 4.9ghz, depending on the workload.","you will not ever see it actually sitting at 2.1ghz, however thatâ€™s what windows gives as a â€œcpu speedâ€ because thatâ€™s what intel chooses to tell the os is the nominal rating.",iâ€™ll try to describe what â€œbase frequency isâ€ as simply as possible.,cpus have a power budget (known currently as pl1/pl2).,"for the 12700, itâ€™s 180 watts short term, and 65 watts long term.","where the 2.1ghz comes from, is intel has calculated that at full load when drawing a maximum of 65 watts, the cpu should be able to maintain an average frequency of 2.1ghz.","when you compare this 2.1ghz with the 12600â€™s base frequency of 3.3ghz, you might go wtf, why is the 12700 so much slower.",itâ€™s not.,"but they both have the same 65 watt long term power limit, and on the 12600 that has to feed 6 p-cores and 0 e-cores, while on the 12700 it has to feed 8 p-cores and 4 e-coresâ€¦ so that same 65 watts doesnâ€™t go as far.","but the thing is, **these power limits are default â€œsuggestionsâ€**.","any non-crap motherboard will let you customize or remove them, allowing any cpu to use as much power as it wants - and so long as your cooling can keep up, maintain its maximum frequencies indefinitely.","for the 12700, the maximum sustained frequency on all cores with no power budget or thermal throttling is 8x4.5ghz and 4x3.4ghz.","for the 12600, itâ€™s 6x4.4ghz.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the base frequency of 2.1 is the the performance cores.,the efficiency cores go down to 1.6 ghz.,might be a rounding error or some average?,afaik win10 doesnt know the the difference between e and p cores.,which os are you on and where sid you get the 2ghz number?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wouldnâ€™t worry about it as long as itâ€™s boosting in games.,itâ€™s just downclocking to save electricity when youâ€™re doing light stuff like web browsing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i suspect either of these 2 things could be happening here: 

1. your cooler isnt mounted quite right and youre thermal throttling.",12th gen is quite tricky to install cooling on.,2. your power plan in windows is set to favour power savings over performance.,this makes it that your cpu only boosts to as much ghz as it needs to for what its doing.,"easiest way to test is to open task manager, go to â€œperformanceâ€ tab, click on the cpu graph on the left, and remember the ghz.",then start a demanding task for the cpu like a benchmark.,look at the ghz again.,"if the ghz is now well into the 4,x ghz or even higher, youre fine.",another thing to note: intel 12th gen does not work properly on windows 10. reason is that win10 confuses the different kinds of cores of 12th gen. this results in weird clock speeds and low cpu performance.,easiest solution is to change to windows 11. another option is to turn the e-cores off.,(also known as efficiency cores),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1. the i7-12700f has both performance (p) cores and efficiency (e) cores, the p cores have a base clock of 2.1 ghz, the e cores have a base clock of 1.6 ghz.","it's most likely using the e cores for the most part since they're made for light loads, the task scheduler for windows 11 was made for this cpu design, and is supposed to prioritize those efficient cores for loads that don't need a lot of power to perform.","2. the cpu will boost as necessary, lighter loads won't push it as much.","3. task manager reports discrete clocks iirc, which are not the true frequency that the cores are running at.","effective clocks are more accurate to the operating frequency in real-time, discrete clocks just report back the cpu ratio.","ratio could be set to 50x (5 ghz) for example, but the actual frequency usage could be far less.",idle is usually well below 1 ghz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"two things:
- clock speed isnâ€™t the only thing that matters about a cpu.","in your case, the 12700f has both a substantial core-count increase (8 big + 4 little vs. 8 big) and a substantial ipc increase (a single 12th-gen core is ~19% faster than a single 11th-gen core if both are at the same clock speed), which adds up to it being something like 43% faster than the i7-11700k in workloads that use all of its cores.","- the intel â€œbase clockâ€ has only one meaning: if you limit the chip to its base 65w power limit, all cores are guaranteed to at least hit the base clock.","it will never actually sit at that clock, for two reasons:
- if youâ€™re doing heavy work, the chip can boost much higher than that, and not doing so would leave massive amounts of performance on the table.","- if youâ€™re just idling, energy efficiency is key, so sitting at anything above about 1 ghz would be a complete waste.","basically, base clock doesnâ€™t matter.","what does matter is the *all-core turbo*, which for intel is generally about 300-400 mhz lower than the rated single-core boost frequency.","assuming youâ€™re not artificially throttling it (which you might be if you have a pre-built pc with a chip this power-hungry), it will sit at that all-core boost *all day* if you need it to.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you a lot and sorry for the trouble of making you explain it.,i really appreciate it.,i'll keep that on mind.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this comment should be a pinned post on this sub,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is likely the correct answer.,"if op is looking at the clock speed as reported in task manager, that value is the average across the cores, meaning the e-core speed makes it appear like it is running too slow.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also greatly helps in cpu cooling.,"a ""throttled down"" cpu cools faster & makes less heat, which in turn helps everything else cool down & run cooler.",speedstep was a great thing to implement in my opinion.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
task manager isn't accurate with cpu speed at all.,i use hwinfo to monitor my pc as it's recommended by pretty much everyone.,"while task manager's readings fluctuates with cpu speed, hwinfo's readings stay at 5.2ghz.",as that's what i overclocked my 12600k to.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if you have thermal throttling just by playing games then you have serious cooling issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
make sure your cooler makes good contact with the cpu.,"if your problem is that it reaches 100â°c without thermal throttling, then i have that exact problem.","i have my 12600k currently overclocked to 5.1ghz and when i run cinebench r23, p-core 3 often gets up to 100â°c.","although hwinfo says it's thermal throttling, it does not go down in clock speed at all.",i almost got a multi-core score of 20k with that.,"i can even go up to 5.3ghz if i want to, but it's instable as hell.",my pc crashes when i open something simple as opera gx.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i had a 12900kf and the kraken x73 on a asus z690 hero.,my temps were pretty much perfect.,iâ€™d say high 80s to low 90s during cinebench r23.,you definitely have a mount issue and possibly need a contact frame.,"when i switched to a custom loop, i want paying attention and my heat sink was sitting on a cap.","half of the cpu was making contact, it gamed fine, but throttled during cinebench.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thank you for answering, but how can i be sure that the processor is in good contact with the heatsink?",do i have to remove and re-install the cooler?,do you have any suggestions?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sounds about right for the 12900k's.,"on mine, with a noctua dh-d15 air cooler, i'm able to run cinebench without throttling with the following:

\-cpus 1-4 at 52 turbo ratio

\-cpus 5-8 at 51 turbo ratio

\-efficiency cores at 41x turbo ratio

\-cpu core undervolted by -90.8 mv

which means that technically i'm not even overclocking, since the factory turbo boost is 5.2ghz.","i'm actually undervolting and underclocking in order to be able to use this thing (at full, intensive synthetic benchmarking apps).","now i actually turn off the bios settings for under/overclocking unless i'm doing something that requires intense cpu processing, because if i'm just browsing around or playing games, it's not enough to throttle my cpu, so i can leave it set to higher values and enjoy it without worrying about what a benchmark test will do",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, remove the cooler and look at the pattern of the thermal paste, if it's even, it makes good contact, if not, then you want make sure the cooler is mounted correctly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"got it thank you, so how do i undervolting in the asus z690 bios?",can you suggest an updated forum page or channel about it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think you already figured it out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"your cpu has 20 lanes,  16 for the gpu and 4 for the primary ssd.",so you should use those first before anything else.,all other things are connected via the chipset.,"the chipset has lots of slots (2x pcie x4, 2x nvme x4, etc) but ultimately all of this is bottlenecked by the dmix8 (8 lanes) link (but you really are not going to notice this in real life)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's unlikely to have an impact on reliability and failure rates but it definitely impacts performance.,"you get a significant drop in average temperatures, that impacts how hard the processor boosts under load.","base clocks are not a problem, and if you look at intel's statements they confirm the processors run within spec, which is true even at lower boost clocks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6000mhz should work safe even with something like cl32.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in my opinion yes.,iâ€™d say theres prob a 5-10 fps difference.,i would get the 4800mhz kit ( i did) and overclock to 5200mhz.,thatâ€™s middle ground and from then on itâ€™s max a 5fps difference,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it should be a kit out there with cl32 if not u can also use cl40 and i would u suggest to see the video from buildzoid to boost your xmp,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what do you mean,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

from 4800 to 5200,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thats not a problem, ddr5 scales with the timings that buildzoid talk about u should see a difference in latency.",he tests a cl32 manually vs cl40 with the better timings for xmp and the results are much better then the cl32 kit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes i know about ddr5 and ddr4 being not interchangeable.,"the best value is definitely the 3200 cl16, because it's half the price of ddr5 and i can save the money and invest it into buying another cpu, mobo and ddr5 ram after my warranties expire, instead of getting low end ddr5 now.",what 2x16gb 3200 cl16 kit do you recommend ?,"i can buy g.skill ripjaws v, g.skill trident z, kingston fury beast, corsair lpx to name a few, all cost the same +/- 2$.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as long as their spec says 3200cl16 they're all the same and it makes no difference.,"on the other hand, samsung is very reputed for memory, so i guess prefer the one that uses samsung chips.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
memory kits themselves are really ymmv these days.,the actual chip you are getting especially for the common speeds (such as 3200c16) is just random.,as such it pretty just comes down to brand preference (or confidence) and the aesthetics (if that matters to you) and pricing/availability.,what you can maybe look for if there isn't much of a price difference is go for 3200/3600 with 16-18-18/18-20-20 timings instead of 16-20-20/18-22-22 timings.,even those both those timing sets will be listed as c16/18.,the only way to guarantee samsung b-die chips (that you may have heard people refer to) are in highly binned kits these days that tend to be much more expensive.,as an aside i think techtubers/discussions kind of do new builders a disservice by still defaulting to those as the price delta is not the same (much higher now) as it was say back in 2018 between them and more common kits.,by the way i should mention i'm assuming 3600c16 and ddr5 prices based on pcpartpicker us values.,if you are using different price deltas you may have a different value conclusion.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

first check your water pump.,also make sure it's running at desired speed.,(i would always run the pump at 100% speed).,are your radiators warm?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i see no issues here if you want lower temps uv/uc your cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sorry, i am like not knowledgable at all regarding water pumps... could you maybe tell me how i check this and what i check?",or maybe sources where i can read into that?,"and if i am being honest, the radiators are not very warm at all.",or at least not as warm as i would expect from 80â°c+ temperatures.,"the heat coming out of the back of the pc, where the fan is that just circulates the air, is much warmer.",the air coming out of the radiator is almost cold in comparison.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which aio or water cooling system do you have?,the radiator liquid should be quite low temperature if everything is working correctly.,so that is normal.,the temperature of the cpu then just depends on the contact and water circulation speed.,it is possible that the cpu cooling block is not correctly seated.,"i did not notice the pump speed on the images the first time, so at least the pump is reporting something to the motherboard.",you should be able to feel the water flowing in the pipes.,"you could try setting the pump to 100% speed if you have a control software for it, or just go to fan control and set dc 100% on it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have an alphacool eisbã¤r 240.

i don't feel much of anything when touching the pipes.",i feel like there is a little vibration but i have only felt that on one of the pipes and that might as well just be from the fans or anything.,the cooling block has a little window and there as well i cannot tell if anythings moving.,i see no bubbles or ripples of any kind.,the seating of the block seems good to me.,it sits sturdy and centered above the cpu.,all the screws are properly in place.,"edit:

what does indicate it working is that one pipe is warm/hot, while the other one, coming from the radiator back to the pump, is cold.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a 240mm cooler is pretty anemic.,but regardless what you posted about temps spiking indicates either your pump isnâ€™t operation correctly or the thermal contact between your cpu and cooler isnâ€™t good (you should reseat and see if you used enough thermal paste),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i will certainly do that and i will also change/refill the cooling liquid to see if that helps,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok so i have reapplied the thermal pase.,but it has not gotten better at all... it seems to conduct the heat well since the  tube from cooler to radiator is really warm.,problem is that the cpu now reaches almost 100â°c under any stress at all.,idle is good with around 40â°c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"is your pump running at 100%, if the tubes are warm and the radiator is not then the water isnâ€™t really moving around",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"they cause issues for some of my work as well, the assumption that each thread will be approximately equal in performance means there are a fair number of programs that get limited to the slowest thread's performance (times the number of threads).","this happens because there's a control thread waiting for data from each worker thread to synchronize the next wave of work using different data, working on the next data too soon thrashes the cache, so synchronization keeps the cache relevant.",i have an enormous amount of code that works this way.,"sad, because i have plenty of tasks i can offload to lower performance cores, particularly vms, i/o, network, and the like.","zen 5 is rumored to bring 24 cores, all big, but 16 with reduced cache on a single chiplet or some other design, they will have 90%+ the performance of the primary chiplet.","intel isn't staying put with e-core performance, either, but it will take a larger swarm of them to make up for the performance... a swarm they will probably deliver.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you'll likely see something like that in 14th gen if intel continues with this strategy of ramping up the big.little architecture.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this would be great for an hedt even with more cores if they wanted.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which games?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i havenâ€™t seen those rumors on zen 5 yet.,"if that ends up being the case, it will be sad as well since my workloads rely on keeping all the data in l3, but if the reduced l3 is the same size or larger than what is available on a ccd today, then i will be golden.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
high performance computing.,different core sizes ruin the parallelism.,the e-cores also arenâ€™t as good at avx2 as the p-cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they are suppose to be transitioning from monolithic to chiplet in 14 and 15th i thought.,i could also have easily mis remembered it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i can see them sticking with 8p cores for consumers for a while just like they did with quad cores.,"i'll bet probably until the 16th gen.   

they might however throw a set of 8 midtier cores in there at some point.",like 8p+8m+32e for 64 threads.,where the 8 midtier cores are just handicapped/lower bin versions of regular p cores.,this would fit well with their plans to go chiplet.,"if anyone were to actually take my bet, i'd of course need to elaborate a bit more as the above it pretty generalized.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pretty much the majority of them.there's barely any games that take  advantage of the e-cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"supposedly the 16-core chiplets are vcache capable, but that just brings the l3 per core back to normal unless it's 2-hi (double stacked), which we know is possible... but probably only to be used on tr pro and epyc due to the expense.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if and when they transition to chiplets they might stick with big.little architecture.,each chiplet could have something like 8p+8ecores since it will likely be on an advanced process node.,even two of those together on one package could get you a whopping 16p+16e = 48 thread cpu and try to maintain an edge over amd in thread count.,of course this is all speculation but that would be my guess of what we'd see out of 14th and 15th gen over the next few years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most games dont even fully use the 8 p-cores neither so i dont understand how the games are perform worse if the e-cores are active?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i look forward to it.,"more big cores, more fun.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
leaks say intel is headed for 8+32 config on client.,"they don't think you need more than 8 p-cores, and if you do, buy the endlessly delayed xeons",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"it is difficult to do so,  and when you do so,  it is difficult to do so with low latencies and even if you do that,  it is difficult to manage heat.","in the chip world,  difficult means expensive,  so making it less difficult means that it becomes more worth it.",tldr; we have not made it easy enough to commercialize it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"cooling, cost, and just the technical challenge of stacking things aligned within nanometers.","current bump pitches are around 35-55nm, which isn't exactly easy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the reason you stack chips is that it allows you to make interconnects orders of magnitude faster, so not really a problem!",">for smds

surface mount devices (smds) refers to the type of packaging used for devices on a printed circuit board.",so for example the transistors on your vrms are smds because they are surface mounted on your motherboard.,the actual layers on a cpu or dies in a stack are not smds.,>amd has figured this out through the io die next to the zen chiplets all under the ihs.,intel has stuck to monolithic dies (for too long) which means they don't have a lot of room to work with unless they can shrink their nodes and increase their yields.,putting two dies on the same package is not the same as stacking or making 3d transistors.,it is still 2d.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yes, people are reporting 5.5 ghz in cinebench r23 with ease, 6.0 ghz workable for light benchmarks as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the rumors are the process is also slightly improved so raptor lake is a little less power hungry at the same clock as alder lake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cache and logic are both made of similar transistors (essentially cache is a special type of logic cell).,it isn't that tsmc isn't ready but rather it doesn't make a lot of engineering sense due to power/thermal constraints limiting how much performance you can extract from such a configuration.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the way i tend to tell people to look at these questions is this -

given that you are presumably reusing ddr4 the only change since nov 2021 in terms of the buy in for a 12700k was the introduction of b660 and h610 motherboards earlier this year.",otherwise buy in cost has not changed significantly for basically 9+ (launch) and 6+ (b660/h610) months respectively.,so if you did not buy back then what has changed so much that you want to buy in now and cannot wait another month for more information on 13th gen (and also zen 4)?,this could be case such as perhaps a spot sale in your locale happening making the 12700k buy in very appealing right now.,or maybe are you predicting 12700k buy in to go up in price in say 1 month?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i went from 8700k + 1080 to 12700k + 3080 and have zero regrets.,legit perfect for gaming on my 1440p / 165hz monitor.,and i've undervolted both while still having them mildly oc'd so the computer isn't a space heater either.,waiting likely won't improve your experience much at that resolution and refresh so i'd say just do it and reuse the ddr4 for now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it depends on what kind of performance gains you want.,i don't think 8700k is giving low performance in new titles.,you already have top end gpu.,maybe wait couple of months.,intel and amd are going to launch new cpus i think.,if you can't wait.,-  then 12700k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

60fps is barely enough to provide precise input.,"you want at least 90, but 120-144-165 is the real objective.",240 is bragging rights,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the thermal frames will significantly improve cooling, whether it's needed depends on your use case.",are you running stuff similar to cinebench for extended periods of time?,then you might want to consider it.,are you just gaming?,it won't make a lick of difference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

different size and shape of pads across the package creates this effect,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can you be more specific?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the larger socket now accommodates as many as 500 more pins than the lga 1200 socket.,"the additional pins are needed to support newer interfaces, like pcie 5.0, ddr5, and thread director-win 11 and more.",simple explanation is first come needs got first available pins assigned while keeping within its architecture.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

they must be confusing the bandwidth required on display cables to transmit data.,"4k/120, 12 bit color depth, hdr, requires 48 gbps.",this is the specification of ultra high speed hdmi 2.1 cables.,"the device in question also needs to support that bandwidth (not all hdmi 2.1 ports can do 48 gbps, many just do 40 gbps).",4k/120 can be done on 40gbps at lower color depth or chroma subsampling.,https://www.avforums.com/attachments/1581008668293-png.1254816/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

they might have got a good deal from tsmc for the soc die since most of their biggest customers are moving to 5nm and the customers using bigger nodes are not very interested to move to smaller ones.,or they might want to use their intel7 capacity to catch up to their backlog in server products.,or iâ€™m full of shit and they have some specific reason they want tsmc for this specific die.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

stop this i just bought my 12th gen laptop cmon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would hope they would up the for count to 8p cores by then.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i will look to upgrade from alderlake to arrowlake.,should be the next big jump.,wondering if the new designs are going to be dramatically more expensive.,intel cpus dropping ring boss after a million years and doing something a lot more complicated gonna hurt somewhere.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ik its future but do you think there will be big jump 13 vs 14 gen like was 11 to 12 or smaller?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the igp & imcs might be there, so that might be it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am so confused by all these contradicting rumors.,"initially, meteor lake was rumored to be intel 4 for every tile except the gpu right?","(which was going to be tsmc n3)

now rumors are saying that the soc and gpu are going to be n7 and n5?",why the backport?,was there something about n3 that intel didn't like?,is there a lack of intel 4 manufacturing capacity too?,"correction: according to the source's annotated image, the io tile and soc tile are made on n6, not n7.",gpu is indeed n5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
youâ€™ll be fine with that for several years.,12th gen is a good product lineup that will serve you well for years to come.,thereâ€™s always â€œnext genâ€ on the horizon.,you have to buy at some point,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mtl redwood cove is just golden cove+++.,it isn't an exciting thing.,don't worry about it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is 2 years away,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well this is meteor lake-p, not h.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it is a mobile cpu, if they needed a core bump, an extra 4 e-cores makes more sense than 2p cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's sounding more and more like mtl is genuinely a mobile architecture.,and perhaps even simply a singular mobile product.,we've yet to see any indication of any different configuration for mtl.,it might well just be this one package.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they aren't dropping ring bus anytime soon.,"arrow lake will have 8+32 cores, which is 16 ring stops?",i think broadwell had 17 stops.,"after that i don't know what they'll do, i guess they think that's enough for the next decade.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i donâ€™t think n3 was actually ever announced for meteor lake.,there was some rumors but those might refer to next gen graphics.,"on the other hand, n3 was delayed around half a year so it might be that changed their plans.",apple also dropped n3 from the new iphone due to the delay.,n6 is basically n7++.,itâ€™s a smaller update that should be design compatible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel 4 is [5nm class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_nm_process).,tsmc n6 is [7nm class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_nm_process).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah true.,on my desktop i waited too many years to upgrade because i wanted to have almost day one cpu/gpu but i could not because they were hard to find so i just waited... but you gotta be happy at some point haha,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there's also 2+8 mtl that's featured on all press photos of meteor lake,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there's 2 mtl dies: 2+8 and 6+8.,"there will be a desktop sku too, but it won't be a flagship release.","for all intents and purposes, mtl is mostly a mobile focused generation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you know what's crazy?,core counts have been steadily rising since ryzen launch.,but i don't think the software has caught up yet.,can't wait until all the e cores are used by windows itself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"true, it is all rumor and speculation after all.",who is to know whether n3 was ever planned for meteor lake haha.,it was simply parroted early on ever since news of meteor lake first broke out.,"indeed, there could be issues surrounding tsmc's n3 node as it is surprising for both apple and intel to, allegedly, step away from a cutting-edge node in favor of an older one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the monitor you have would be a relevant piece of information.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"usually 6 bit color depth is automatically chosen, if the bandwidth required by the chosen refresh rate and resolution is not possible with 8 bit over the connection.",intel's drivers do this automatically and do not even have a setting for it.,but they can and should only do this for monitors attached to the igpu.,"if you also have a dgpu, first get clear on which one you are actually using for that monitor, because it seems likely that you are not connecting the monitor to the 1050 ti, if the intel driver is affecting it.",then you need to detail everything about the connection to the monitor and the monitor.,"(exact cable, adapters, monitor model, what windows is showing in advanced display options for the active signal mode and bit depth.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

unless you are space restricted a 120mm aio is never recommended.,the 12700f is not a very hot chip but if you are getting a better cooler atleast go for a 240mm aio or a decent air cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
120mm really is not a very good cooler.,"if your case canâ€™t support any larger, just get a good air cooler",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

id cooling has a couple 240mm aio that are very good quality and have lighting.,54-70 us dollars.,"ive used their auraflow evo 240, frostflow x280 and  zoomflow 240x argb.",all are still in service in the original pc's they were built with.,solid budget option if available to you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"this is a pre-production sample, which is why op is asking about it and why it says ""intel confidential"" and not 3570k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s an f stage engineering sample.,theyâ€™re as close to release versions are youâ€™re going to get without going to qualifying samples.,"considering it was in the final stage, it likely doesnâ€™t have the same limits a regular one has but might be significantly more unstable.",f stage es chips are desirable for overclockers since theyâ€™re usually easier to overclock since that would be the point where intel would be testing just how far the silicon can be pushed and where the boost/base clock is set.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

at least during your contest you were dealing directly with intel.,the issue today in my opinion is that intel is no longer running contests directly and seems to be subcontracting or farming it out to a marketing partner.,the incentives and interests of the marketing partner in holding high standards for communication and fulfilling obligations of intel's promotions might not align with what intel advertised.,prize winners might not receive what was promised on completion of contests as a result of poor communication or terms not being fulfilled.,this becomes even more problematic when contest prizes are not awarded immediately within 60-90 days upon completion of a contest.,"a good example is intel's arc xe hpg scavenger hunt contest that ended on jan 31, 2022.  prizes still have not been awarded seven months later.",a single confirmation email requiring a response was sent months ago and landed in spam folders for some resulting in them losing their prize.,communication has been poor unless you are on intel's discord channel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel rep has already responded to me via dm, will see how it goes down before taking any further steps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if intel have told you that already then you are stuck.,"you could try complaining loudly on the intel social media sites, might at least get some attention.",have you asked hibbert why there is a delay?,it's not like they are offering something hard to come by.,"goodluck, hope it turns up soon!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there was a confirmation email???,"i won one of those coupons too, but all i had ever heard was that they'd become available around the time arc gpus became available for purchase...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sure no problem.,let me look with hibbert and eric to see what's going on.,i know eric is  already looking into so keep and eye out for this dms or email.,"still if you don't here from us in a day feel free to hit us again here :)

looks like my 12700k box.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
could be an oem unit or refurbished.,should get it replaced just in case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what exactly did you order?,the boxed version or a different one?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not enough details to provide useful advice here, do you have photos of the packaging in question and some more details about where you purchased the cpu?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no leave it in the box and install it that way in the socket,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for sharing your experience.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for sharing the link of that post.,"i panicked because i couldnt find any unboxing video which had the cpu ""sunken"" like this.",i also looked up the serial number on the intel site and it should be okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
100% tray model and legit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i looked up the warranty on the intel site and it stated this : boxed intelâ® coreâ„¢ i5-12600k processor (20m cache, up to 4.90 ghz) fc-lga16a .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
only come one way these days.,just the cpu no cooler.,many real photographic proof online to support it as well as people who own them like myself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i bought it from a major retailer in my country (romania) , and here are some photos : [https://imgur.com/a/ql8hzho](https://imgur.com/a/ql8hzho) .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's not what i mean.,"you can get them boxed, oem,...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you don't understand the terminology sir.,"and no, there are no functional differences between these two types of processors if they have the same processor number.",the main difference is the warranty and a lack of extra packaging since tray are sold in mass not typically individually as they get sold to places like acer or hp etc.. doesn't mean they cant be resold in fact newegg and a host of others sell these daily to consumers.,intel decided not to package any new cpu's with coolers and extra boxing materials.,they may return to that at some point for now they do not with newer products.,really just that simple.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> i won't be missing out on anything right except the igpu

yeah, f version is the same except for the igpu disabled.","even if you don't need it as a video output, it can come in handy for encoding, or can be nice for if something were to happen to your gpu/pcie slot, but if it's a $100 difference it probably isn't worth spending the extra money.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if the non-f i5 costs 100 more than no point in getting that, that's for when they just cost around 10 more because they're only good as a back-up/diagnostic tool when your gpu fails.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12400f is a solid choice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm still absolutely floored by the amount of people that *didn't* expect drivers to be the biggest pain point here.,graphics drivers for a proper discrete gpu are some of the most complex bits of software on an average pc.,"they have to perform in a silly amount of situations, variations and one off weird edge cases.",there was pretty much no way they would have nailed these for their first gen launch.,this was always going to be rough.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most shocking is intel apparently did not have any of the 43 issues already logged....meaning 0 qc testing is going on,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s like a bunch of interns designed the software.,â€œletâ€™s add a bunch of buggy broken features but use a slick web ui front endâ€.,"honestly, make a stable fucking driver lmao.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wonder if they outsourced part of the driver development to some 3rd party.,it is kind of hard to believe that their own in-house dev teams would make such simple mistakes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wonder how did they manage to spend so much money with such poor release both in terms of qc and availability.,"edit: i see you are trying to justify it below but you do realize if intel's axg couldn't deliver in q3 2022, there is a very high possibility it will be thrown into the trash, right?",intel gpus are literally on clock.,"it is not only me, they cannot even satisfy pat and shareholders with the outcome they produce.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[removed],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> graphics drivers for a proper discrete gpu are some of the most complex bits of software on an average pc.,there is extremely little difference graphics drivers wise between a 'proper discrete gpu' and an igpu.,while i and many people fully expected driver issues it's got nothing to do with it being discrete.,intel has had horrible gpu drivers for 15+ years.,they've had multiple periods where they said they were going to push to fix them and nothing changed.,they had several attempts at discrete gpus pushing these attempts to make drivers better and they all failed.,"it was 2017 they announced xe, a push to make drivers great and they are still where they are.","their first this gen dgpus were supposed to launch in 2020, they should have been working on drivers for then.","not only should their drivers be on the 30th iteration since the hardware design was finalised, which happens long before silicon comes back, they should be built up top of their drivers they should have been improving for a decade.","this isn't their first gen gpu, it's not even first release of a new architecture, the a380 has been 'out' for a while.","the drivers should have gone through huge advances since then, since 2020, since 2010 and yet here we are.","there is zero excuse for their drivers to be like this, but based on the past 15 years of intel drivers there is zero reason to believe the drivers would be anything but shit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel knowing existence of issues doesnt necessarily mean """"""""0 qc testing is going on""""""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is frightening and not completely surprising.,frightening as it means they are doing no real work end to end testing.,not surprising as no company i have ever worked at fully did this well.,"they usually just have a checklist of ""do a, do b"" and if that passes its considered good.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
theyre not realeased though.,"like steeve said its very similar to the amd gpus, it will and is getting better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
building up a software team is hard.,"very easy to allocate a lot of money, not be able to hire half the people you need and then half the people you do get are wrong for the project.",you see this a lot when a big company suddenly tries to rush to market by throwing money at a new thing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"maybe building drivers and gaming gpu is hard and needs a lot of effort, time and money?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

have you seen the gn video?,some of the things were blatantly obvious,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in this case, it would not even ""do a""....",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think they just got caught with their pants down.,the a380 was just quietly launched in china and they probably didn't expect the us press to get their hands on it and rip it apart but that's exactly what happened so they had to rush and make sure the thing actually works now it's not just budget buyers in china using this gpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">""theyre not realeased though""

this is an issue in itself though.",the gpu's really really should have been on the market by now.,every week that passes is just more money thats being thrown into a project without a return.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
their review was on a released card (limited to china but still released),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
basically this tbh.,"an igpu carries a completely different set of expectations, and complexity vs a dgpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes but the majority of the issues he showed weren't reported by *any other reviewer*.,"i don't know what gn did to trigger these issues while most other reviewers didn't, but working bugs out of software is much more than if one person has a problem, then everyone must have had that problem.",it's great that gn *did* find these problems and push them up to intel to fix.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why is this an issue?,it comes out when it comes out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they could have out them in market 1 year ago, but would people *actually* buy alchemist 1 year ago when the state of drivers was even worse than today?","just putting the gpus on market wont magically make software better and consequently wouldnt solve intel's biggest challenge and alchemist's biggest weakness vs amd/nvidia gpus

money is being burned either way

intel is *probably* in for the long term rather than the immediate profits it gives",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if they release now they have shitty drivers and shitty cards and they get really bad press and the whole thing will tank or they wait until they have the drivers ready and they get good press from a good and affordable card and intel gives them the go ahead for next gen
edit: spelling",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel knows igpu well.,but discrete gpu like arc?,well...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hardware unboxed said they had almost all the same issues so just referenced gn and decided not to publish theirs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"most reviewers don't publish the major problems they have, any of the smaller ones basically act as pr outlets for companies and talking badly about anything risks them being cut out of future samples for review.","they won't always over talk up a bad product, but they will rarely massively criticise something about the product.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">i don't know what gn did to trigger these issues while most other reviewers didn't

they installed it.",and tried to use it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to you.,i doubt the board and shareholders share your opinion when they see a project sucking up billions and not making any back.,i  really really hope intel sticks with it for at least 2-3 generations but the fact that so much money was already spent and this is the result is worrying.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
except 1 year ago people wouldnâ€™t care as much about driver optimization if they were going to use us as beta tester anywaysâ€¦ should have done it a year a ago.,people would have just snatched these up to mine crypto,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i was unaware, thanks",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
obviously there is more to it than thatâ€¦ what os did they use?,what version of that os?,did they have any other video drivers installed?,did they install the video drivers before or after things like the chipset drivers?,*thatâ€™s* my point.,there are tons of things that can be different between reviewers that can cause issues for one person and not others.,do you really think other reviewers *didnâ€™t* â€œinstall it and tried to use itâ€?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, they're projecting battlemage to take the fight to the flagships...  i wanna see that shit.",alchemist 770 isn't even out.,i wanna see that too.,"i've been impressed by intels igpu performance since the xe days, and arc is a step forward.",... allegedly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you had actually watched their video then you wouldn't be asking these questions.,and other reviewers had problems too.,"also, are you seriously going to question's gn's testing methodology with these childish questions?",you really think they didn't bother checking their os version or the chipset driver?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i get the awfully strong impression that you donâ€™t understand the point i was making.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
he gets the point; he disagrees with the implication.,do you really think the one build of a pc that gn ran it on caused 43 new defects to be found that could not be found on any other build or configuration of a pc?,not even one of those 43 could have been reproduced on any other build?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm obviously not talking about *all* 43 new defects.,the point is the major install failure issue and other crippling issues.,"the one that were ""blatantly obvious"" in other words.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
imho a 12700f would be better.,doesn't cost much more than the 12600k and it isn't too far from the 12700k in therms of performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for this configuration a 12600k(f) makes sense.,at higher resolutions a cpu is less important as well.,if you do plan on upgrading your gpu or you just want a fast cpu a 12700k(f) is a very solid choice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"12600k should be your way to go, since 1440p gaming and 3d rendering is more gpu bound than cpu.",so going for a 12700k won't make much difference and it will save you a bit of money if you just go for the 12600k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you are one of those that holds the cpu for long term, just go for the i7.","i5 may could be good enough now, but i doubt it will be the same in a few years.",by then you should be fine swaping your gpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think a 12600k would be enough.,"but i think you should ask yourself, if the extra money  for something like the 13700, is it worth to you or not.",which means that we can't help you decide.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

12600k imho is plenty for any game currently out though i have zero regrets nor complaints on my 12700k purchase.memory is another thing to consider as tarkov and a few other games can actually use 20-24gb for maps so if these interest you consider getting 32gb.,then there is the gpu and having owned a evga 3060ti you will not be disappointed coming from a 1060. its light years ahead.,for aio's id cooling aurflow or frostflow 240mm( 54-65 bucks ) are more than enough to keep your cpu cool and its half the price or less of the corsair and uses the same design and pumps pretty much.,"never used any aerocool products so can't speak to the psu though the kcas plus 1000gm, lux rgb 1000m, lux 1000m are reportedly 80plus gold standard.",a decent lian li mesh or 011 air min or similar variant for case and samsung has super reliable ssd's might look at their refurb products direct for cheaper with same/similar warranties.,"&#x200b;

good luck and hope you get what you need.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel is making a bit of a mess of their igpu names with different generations and performance grades being not clearly distinguishable.,"the uhd / iris xe in this respect is more of a marketing label, because the g4 gpu is significantly cut down in terms of performance (half the processing units of the top-of-the-line igpu).",but the underlying architecture should still be identical and still includes the same hw decoding functionality.,"although if your video player adds post processing on top of the most expensive decoding (like 8k av1 60fps), it will have a lot less headroom for other gpu calculations during playback.",but this is highly software and settings dependent.,"since desktop cpus have even less eus but still have fluent playback of 8k av1, this should not be a problem though.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i always knew binning existed, and i have seen data with higher end cpus are hitting higher clocks even though they have the same architecture and similar power profiles.",what so interesting here is the extra power usage at idle and lower consumption levels.,for example in doing every day tasks the total draw in the 1260p laptop is around 11 watts.,if you bump that to 13.5 watts for the 1240p laptop we are talking about a 13% reduction in battery life.,if we just use idle wattages of the 1260p where the total draw is around 6 watts then we are talking about 16 or 17 percent reduction batter life compared to the idle wattage of the 1240p.,seems like these numbers are pretty significant for everyday usage and  i haven't really seen data like this posted before.,not sure it can be caulked up to binning but i would like to see a few other data sets demonstrating the same in the 1240p/1260p cpus.,.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"supposedly, raptor lake is going to come with a price bump, and it seems like zen4 and am5 is going to be somewhat expensive compared to am4.",i would probably just go with a 12400f since it seems to be a very good bang for your buck.,"i think the ballpark numbers for gaming are something like, a 12700k costs roughly twice as much as a 12400f and is roughly 10% faster.","also, there seems to be 2 ddr4 b660 boards that will let overclock the locked intel chips, the msi b660 mortar max (the max is the important part), and the asrock b660 pg riptide, but i can't find them for sale in the us, so who knows if that's going to happen in a month or two or never.","but if i had to pick from those 2 options that you were considering, i'd probably just get a 12700k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"my advice is, if you want to buy a cpu, buy after the first month, but before the forth month.",this applies to both sides.,because cpu is released about 1 to 1.5 years.,"for amd, new socket is probably 1.5 years to 2 years.","then if you're the type that always upgrade, buy every 2 gen.

so since you're not in the first month not before the forth month, i'll advice you to wait.","the reason for my timeline is within the first month, you'll see review from the likes of gamer's nexus and hardware unboxed to decide which cpu is good, complaints etc.",you'll also hopefully past the first few updates that fix the bugs.,"buy before the forth month, that way you get to enjoy at least 9 month before a new cpu release and you're ""last gen"", and if you buy every 2 gen, you'll use your cpu almost 2 years.",which to me is long enough for people who loves upgrades.,"i myself though, will use the cpu for as long as i can before it cant keep new games to my desired framerate, or it affects my workflow of my work/hobby (no this is not games).",same can be said for gpu.,other parts can always be reused/added in.,but plan thoroughly.,at least that's what i do and i'd do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

wait and save money until you will be able to buy ddr5-6000.,i do not recommend to upgrade on legacy ram.,"as for cpu, i7-12700k is good for now.",but i5-13600k also is very interesting with its 6p+8e configuration.,as for i7-13700k it's just a re-labeled 12900k.,so my main recommendation is to save budget for ddr5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thanks.,iâ€™ll probably do that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why is ddr5-6000 important?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what i want is 3440x1440 at 100fps.,iâ€™m getting around 60-70fps at 1080p.,i have 32gb of ram.,i asked on the beam ng sub and they said the game is cpu intensive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the requirements are very outdated, as the game is getting better and better every couple of months.",his cpu clearly is a huge bottleneck for the amount of dynamic simulation going on in the game.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that may be true but real world performance difference between a 12700k vs 13600k example would not change that and the small difference in overall performance wouldnâ€™t make more than a couple fps difference on an avg budget system.,"motherboard, ram, ssd, gpu, background software, ambient temp etc play into actual fps experienced.","while reviewer benchmarks may show say a 5-10% difference between the two cpus when using high end components in a clean system benchmark environment, day to day user experience on budget to mid range between a 12700k and expected 13600k will be close, but cost will be higher with 13th gen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"unless you do a lot of super multithreaded stuff, the efficiency cores won't matter that much.",the 12500 is a good chip for sure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12500 is still a great chip if you got it for a good price.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

note: price bump only expected on the top-tier enthusiast and business cpus.,i am in a similar situation and i am planning to pick up a 13600k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is decent ram in terms of performance and specs.,moreover a lot of 6000+ kits has hynix chips inside them (goog overclock potential).,ddr5 4800...5200 is entry-level ddr5 and it sucks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i mean, you're likely right about the relative value proposition, especially if the rumors of relative price increases for next gen are true (and we know last gen will see discounts soon after that).","that said, i don't know that the price difference will account for the performance difference (at least between same tier), there may be as much as 60% for tasks that depend heavily on both single and multithreaded performance.","beamng has a thread for each car, and the more performance those threads get, the better the simulation can run - the p-cores in raptor lake are where the biggest improvements are.","if op likes this kind of game, and if he will likely take as long to upgrade this system to the next one, this is a generational increase i wouldn't pass up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah 50-55 idle and 90 gaming is definitely not normal with the 12400. check your mounting.,is your gpu overheating also?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
check mounting.,thatâ€™s about 15-20 deg too hot for both idle and load,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you're likely mounting it incorrectly, or you have fans pointing the wrong direction.","aside from that, you screwed up something in bios.",if you're in a really hot environment then i suggest you undervolt it (-100ish) and limit the temps with xtu.,you'll have to use an older version of it because the new one has the settings you need greyed out.,you can also spend $40 for a great air cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"its either stock cooler is not enough, or is not seated well (so temps from cpu are and transitioned to cooler correctly), or less likely faulty cpu.",depending on your willingness to correct it i would start with new thermal paste or rather new cooler.,every 15 - 20 usd cooler will do better job than the stock one.,"if it does not help, i would continue with new cpu bracket (aliexpress ones will do the trick safely) as the built in bracket in some mobos slightly bends the cpu to the middle creating â€œholeâ€ under the cooler.",you may also try undervolting but i would suggest that only if you know what are you doing and if everything else fails.,my 12600k never goes over 65c in gaming and stays around 70c when benchmarked.,just to be sure - test if air is really getting sucked in by front fans and sucked out by back fan.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's going to be a jack of all trades pc tbh.,ofc mainly for heavy gaming and youtube etc but i'll be helping edit and render videos every now and again also.,i know being at 1440p it's more gpu based but i currently have my 9700k and it's a bit long in the tooth for me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i gotcha.,if you plan on overclocking then i'd say 12600k will be plenty for many years to come.,in cinebench mine beats out a threadripper 1950x in multicore work and beats everything in single core.,"also if it ever isn't enough, by that point im sure you could sell the 12600k and upgrade either within the 12th gen family or later gens that support lga 1700 without spending a whole lot more.","i play games, watch youtube, do some light editing, and general computer work and the 12600k is the best cpu i have had (came from ryzen 9 5900x) and i have never came close to utilizing all it has to offer",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"more cores is not future-proofing, never has been, and never will be.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the i9 12900k is meant to be for like the xtreme overclocker or the guy who wants the best silicon possible.,that is what i9 stood for.,"lowest voltage, highest clocks, fastest chip possible for the extreme overclocker/enthusiasts***.",the enthusiasts is key.,so what does that leave the remaining i7 and i5 line for?,well i7 is supposed to be intel's premium chip.,"i7 used to be the top tier chip, but then i9 was introduced.",so i7 is meant to be the premium chip.,"fast single core, and high core count for high multiple thread workloads.",think cad machine or editing workstation.,i5 is meant to be mainstream.,high volume seller.,fast single core and good enough multi thread workload.,these chips would do great in a project manager's computer or for general purpose use even coding.,it is also definitely good enough for gaming.,remaining i3 is meant for everyone else.,general purpose computing.,think assistant or call center computer.,good for email and word processing and light work use case.,students would do fine here too.,i5 is excellent cost/performance.,if you pick the i7 it is more premium and you could expect more overclocking from this chip.,i9 has the ultimate performance and overclocking potential.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it depends what youâ€™re doing, if youâ€™re just playing video games, then with a 3070, no itâ€™s not worth it.",if you do cpu tasks often enough you may absolutely find it worth it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not fully sure.,what i would do is check out various reviews and see which appeals you more for the money in the areas you want to use it for.,most people will be better off with i5 / ryzen 5 and just upgrade a bit sooner rather than i7 / ryzen 7 and upgrade less often.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
editing now and then doesn't really sound like it necessitates the 12700k.,you'll probably be fine with the 12600k.,"but as you wrote if you're going to keep it for a long time the 12700k may just feel better having, knowing that it's in use for a long time.",now is the 100â£ difference worth that?,that's for you to decide.,but from a purely performance level for your use case you don't really need it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i see what you mean.,aye i'm basically making this pc setup last for years to come post upgrade as my 3070 is fantastic i just need a cpu to back that up you know.,it's definitely something to consider.,last thing i'd want to do is buyer's remorse lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i guess it's more to do if future games will then require the extra cores the 12700k has.,yeah it's a difference of 125 pounds on the overall budget.,i could do it it's just i don't want to spend unnecessarily you know.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 12600k will run future aaa games of  a few years with no problem to be honest.,i'd get the 12600k and save the 125â£.,in a few years when you upgrade those 125â£ will likely get you a much better performance upgrade than the 12700k would be right now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes but the 5800hs can at least keep full speed continuously without being throttled.,at least in my machine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this laptop can sustain 35-40w with the laptop fans turned off all the way with a trick i know with whisper mode combined with throttlestop overriding the plâ€™s.,was very impressed when i first saw this.,obviously the chassis was warm since no heat was exiting the laptop but yeah just a neat proof of concept to show this laptop is definitely built for 45w rating on normal usage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

balanced myasus profile for me caps performance at 35w and i also saw a reviewer that got the exact 35w i mentioned.,youâ€™ve honestly gotten pretty weird results all around lol.,but iâ€™m glad it got fixed for you.,i get stronger fans on performance vs balanced on myasus btw,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

make sure your gpu fits the bill more on the cad side but on the cpu side the 12600k especially with a per core overclock, so pushing one core to 5ghz will be better and on the gaming front it is great any way...

my guess is that they are embedded and not in any way intended for user replacement.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most consumer grade machines have all their chips soldered to the motherboard.,"if you want any upgradability i would look at some business grade machines, however newer gen business grades tend to be very pricey",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you could leave it at 4.7ghz.,the only reason why i overclock is that at 5.1ghz the cpu can come closer to 10900k speeds and even 11600k speeds.,overclocking is just a way for you to get more value out of your cpu.,it's advertised speeds are 4.7ghz and most users are good at that speed.,even me.,i just like to overclock to get more value from the chip.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"all i can really say is, you will get better performance just by having dual channel memory.","you can get the latest graphics drivers from intel's website directly, if the oem ones don't work properly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is a good question.,i can only guess as to the answer.,"unless intelâ€™s documentation has a typo, it says such processors will show iris xe even when in single channel memory mode, however, that the driver will also cut down the number of eus in line with uhd specifications.",and that simply being in dual channel memory mode â€œshouldâ€ enable full xe capabilities.,"i donâ€™t know if thatâ€™s a load of hogwash, and if the gpu works â€œas good as it canâ€ whether in single or dual channel mode, and the whole dual channel/xe thing is just a way to encourage oems to configure dual channel systems (a good goal since oems are so recklessly lazy in this department).",or if it really does dynamically configure itself in the driver.,"regardless itâ€™s the same igpu in the same cpu, and iâ€™m pretty sure all lenovo would do is pop in another stick of memory, so unless theyâ€™ve set up some mystery bios setting i think itâ€™s worth trying to add another stick.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is there some kind of diagnostic software i can use to confirm the number of active eus before and after the upgrade?,"i guess i could just run a graphics benchmark and look at the results, but i won't really know whether the difference is the result of uhd->iris or just dual channel improvements.",i wonder if cpu-z would identify the difference or not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just a follow-up in case you were curious.,"i did the upgrade, added an 8gb stick of memory.",ran some benchmarks and took some notes before and after.,hwmonitor before the upgrade identified it as uhd graphice - after benchmark it automatically identified as iris xe.,"so yes, the driver automatically ""upgraded"" without any additional configuration.",the benchmarks are crazy.,valley benchmark score and my own fps in a personal game literally doubled.,cinemark showed a multi-core cpu increase of 73% and single-core increase of 23%.,the performance increase with dual channel is no joke.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think hwinfo64, under the summary section, will show how many eus are enabled.","for example, it shows my 12900k having 32 eus.",i donâ€™t see anything in cpu-z about that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
eu count will always stay the same.,the difference in memory bandwidth (doubling) will make for a big boost in performance.,intel just disallows that laptops get iris xe branding for single channel configs since the performance takes a big hit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks for the follow up, and thatâ€™s great to hear!",iâ€™m suspicious that a good chunk of that improvement is through the â€œreleaseâ€ of additional igpu execution units.,"if the driver does what intel claims, which is limit single channel implements to â€œuhdâ€ branding, then there would only be 64 execution units enabled vs the cpuâ€™s full complement of 96 in xe mode.",definitely seems like a worthwhile and easy upgrade!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gpu-z will also show active eu count.,"i'd definitely add an 8 gb (or 16/32gb, in flex mode) stick with that laptop, though, as the benefit extends past better igpu performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yup, op had the xe graphics deep inside all along.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i understand the general performance boost with dual channel, but are you sure about it not throttling certain features/components?","at the very least, there are iris-specific configuration options that get locked out in single channel mode, per the [igcc faq](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000089626/graphics.html), the graphics card is identified differently (uhd) and certain options are disabled in the driver software.",that faq does seem to indicate that aftermarket ram upgrades should unlock it though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

my f****** computer.",i don't need microsoft's permission to log into it.,f*** microsoft.,"i'm forced to stay on windows 10 home, because i refuse to give up my local account.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
neither.,you should give linux a try!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
windows 10 is much better optimised.,"if you can, i would suggest running a dual boot system with 10 and 11. personally, i triple boot with those + ubuntu.","use windows 10 as your main one, though.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"almost 900 people here are trying to sell you snake oil, watch out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
windows 10 is just better.,"if you are comfortable, linux is even better but do not switch to it if you do not understand how to use it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
linux,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
windows 10. i tried windows 11 and i couldnâ€™t do it.,iâ€™m gonna wait until people build tools to make it sucks less and let you guys do the beta testing for me lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
win 10 as there are no e cores on the cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
linux :d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"linux, i can no longer recommend windows, since microsoft disbanded the qa team it turned into a mess, a perma-beta that breaks something with every update, if you have to choose between windows 10 and 11 it would be better to either give up on computers or use linux.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just installed a a 2tb wd sn850 and put 11pro on it.,i now have a dual boot system and can easily choose 10or11.,10 is on a 1 tb sn850.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i'm rocking windows 11 with my new build, it's fine.",i5 12500 in the asrock b660 itx board with a 3080 12gb.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you're doing anything past 11th gen, u gotta do win11.","the hybrid architecture doesn't do as well on 10. win10 struggles to assign the cores correctly, and the hybrids were optimized for 11.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
get windows 10 and upgrade to 11 and you can choose whatever you want between the two.,don't buy windows 11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the good thing about the 12400f is that there are no e-cores that make windows 11 mandatory so you can use whichever one you like.,i can't stand windows 11 so i just use windows 10 and it works fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what's windows 11?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you don't need to there's no need to use win11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
windows 11 has annoyances that are fixed by windows 10. i consider windows 10 an upgrade from 11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
windows 10.,11 is a free upgrade but few to no developers have implemented any of the benefits of win11 like directstorage etc.,win11 is also a new launch and buggy.,win10 is stable and free to upgrade later when itâ€™s gotten more support.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
windows 10 uses a lot less resources for me.,uses less of the ram.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"be a man

choose linux",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
arch linux,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just use linux(arch linux btw),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i had to reinstall the windows couple months ago, so i decided to give w11 a try.",so far no issues whatsoever.,i'm rocking 5900x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m not sure if you can say 10 is better.,"the backend is updated to support newer technology, sure you might prefer 10 but that doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s strictly better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"windows 11 schedules the e-cores better, and still not great.","12400f doesn't have e-cores, so no point.","windows 10, and if you're a real chad, windows 7",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
real men use dos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you should upgrade to 13th gen intel or the 7000 series ryzen cpus, your cpu is still good but its probably bottlenecking that gpu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"now that you talk about it, i can see the ''tablet'' feel to it's ui lol.","regardless i find it so similar to win 10 that i don't understand why so many people trip about this os, it's just a faster win 10 with a skin imo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"don't say things like that, it's offensive for tablet users.",windows 11 was made to be used with a controller.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have 2 touch screen devices and i much prefer the one with windows 10.,"11 should have a separate touch mode like 10. my main pc is on 11 though, wsl upgrades are worth it for me",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whwn i realised i couldn't roll back i just uninstalled windows and reinstalled it.,windows just gave me my old library folders back but honestly win10>>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
remember windows 8?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"12400f is p core only, so windows 11 td is unnecessary",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea but win 11 is more resource demanding and it doesnt benefit you in almost any way.,go with win 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that arguement only applies to the k series 12th gen though.,non-k chips will run just as good on both os.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 12400f doesn't have e-cores so it shouldn't matter(?),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm with you on this one, plan to run 10 up until end of service, and keep running it on this pc for older game support then move onto steam os and proton.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
win 10 gang,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
im not going to run an updated os until i have to.,ive been running windows since 3.1.,95 was a game changer though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s funny that i thought iâ€™d have a clear answer with this post but itâ€™s the absolute opposite!,at the moment iâ€™m definitely leaning towards windows 11. iâ€™ve used windows 10 quite a lot but not in over a year and a half and not enough to be annoyed by small changes.,i also while donâ€™t fully love the full â€œdumbed downâ€ aspects of apple os ive been using a macbook air for a while and have really liked it for what it is so i donâ€™t think iâ€™ll have a problem with the â€œtabletâ€ appearance a lot of people have mentioned with windows 11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"https://www.groovypost.com/howto/install-windows-11-without-an-internet-connection/

no need for a microsoft account",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i didn't have to do anything at all, the option to use a local account was there when i setup windows 11. i even installed it on my 6700k which is ""unsupported"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
windows 11 is factually more optimized.,lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what do you think makes windows 10 better?,windows 11 has an improved settings ui and the options are almost all in one place.,i wasnt forced to use a microsoft account and dont even have bing search in my start menu.,cortana is also uninstalled and not connected to search.,my start menu is really clean and fits a ton of programs just a click away.,there's no flashy tiles distracting me or suggestions to install crap.,i even have the regular style right click menu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah linux is something iâ€™ve never used in my life,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's good to know.,i've installed it on my laptop and it runs ok. just getting used to the minor differences is a bit annoying,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"lmao lucky you, iâ€™ve worked with windows 11 on three different computers now, two intel one amd, and justâ€¦ so many new issuesâ€¦ 

the rest is pretty nice i guess, mostly just *different* but a little better so i do hope itâ€™s the default and these questions arenâ€™t needed in the near future, but for now, i just canâ€™t personally recommend it.","i know iâ€™m probably just extremely unlucky, and i donâ€™t even know if all of these are for sure because of windows 11, but iâ€™d give it another year lol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> windows 7

good luck with that.","it's unpatched these days and various ad servers regularly serve up exploits, cryptojackers, and ransomware targeting windows 7 users just browsing random websites.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just upgraded from windows 7 to windows 11. could not stomach the disgusting abomination of what windows 8-10 were.,windows 11 has friendly ui akin to xp.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is my part list.",replace the i9-12900k with a i9-13900k and thatâ€™s going to be my future build.,also planning on replacing my old monitor with an oled screen.,probably the c2 42â€.,i have all my parts except for the cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"remember everyone, gpu bottlenecks are actually desirable in some circumstances, but cpu bottlenecks can be disastrous.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it literally uses more resources.,"you can't even argue that his processor would benefit, the 12400f has no efficiency cores.",the minimum requirements is double the ram as well.,not sure how you deduced it was faster.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"uses more resources, has an awful looking ui (personal taste, this is mine), has a lot less options to personalize it (i'm not even sure you can move the windows bar on other sides besides the bottom), the settings are a lot harder to navigate and they straight up removed some (or at least i can't find them).","overall, fells like what win8 was to win7",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"true, windows 11 still has some bugs here and there, but its pretty much more feature rich compared to its predecessor, windows 10",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"true, that was too far but win 11 just fealt like a reskin of win 10",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, for lower end 12th gen where there are no e cores, the difference is negligible",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then honestly you'll feel right at home with 11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
factually.,not in practice.,ask anybody who has run a computer program that requires over like 70% cpu usage.,probably less,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's never been easier.,install debian and put a kde gui on it and it'll be a similar experience to windows.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
honestly it just sounds like youâ€™ve been unlucky.,w11 works pretty well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
disk operating system,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"dude, once you go oled, you never go back.",it's ruined all other displays for me.,you must be so excited for your future build!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nice list, but ditch the razer headphones and get some decent ones.",you went high end in everything else.,razer does not make good headphones.,also 7.1 headphones are bs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12th gen to 13th gen?,not sure if its worth it.,"yea, 13th gen is newer, but save costs and stick with the 12th gen for another few years is my suggestion (until like 15th gen).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"

>the minimum requirements is double the ram as well.",not sure how you deduced it was faster.,what.,"i mean, what?",microsoft minimum requirements exist *solely* to dictate the lowest possible specification an oem or system integrator can get an official windows license for.,"microsoft wouldn't sell dell a license for anything below minspec, for example.","it does **not** mean that ram usage is different in any way, and indeed, it uses the same amount on boot, and swaps out to the same ~1.5gigs under extreme load on my machine, just like w10.",the new winui3 elements feel faster than uwp based apps before as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's literally just an upgraded windows 10. the build number would say windows 10 for the longest time.,i experienced no difference in ram usage after upgrading.,using 9.6 gb out of 48 gb with multiple programs and edge windows open rn.,"edit: and to add, its generally faster for gaming.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sorry i should've been more specific when i said faster, it's faster for current gen intel that uses e cores and it should be even faster with the optimization of said e cores in upcoming intel chips.","i currently have a 12700 and i noticed quite a significant bump in day to day tasks performance when i migrated to win 11, it just feels a snappier, but like i said in my previously comment it is still basically windows 10.. for the average user at least.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
first two points i don't disagree with.,the settings in windows 10 are next level hard for me to navigate so i defaulted to the control panel every time.,"windows settings everything is so much easy to find, i haven't had to open the control panel for a long while.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what features?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i want you to watch enderman's vid on win11, do it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's not the first time.,historically more updates were rather incremental rather than ground breaking.,just take a look at how little changes did windows 7 have when compared to vista.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whatâ€¦?,iâ€™m not sure what your point is.,windows 11 has the updated scheduler that improves performance for e core cpus and has direct storage capabilities for the future.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mint is what you would want for a windows-like experience.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"lol yeah i realize that, but if everyone that has issues says they're just unlucky and stays quiet about the issues they've encountered, it makes it sound like there aren't any issues at all.","i'm sure it works wonderfully for 99% of people, but the 1% that has issues is just as important to mention.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the parts are sitting in my room and iâ€™m so tempted to install the fans into the case.,iâ€™m so incredibly excited and canâ€™t wait to share it on reddit when iâ€™m done.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the only display my alienware oled hasnâ€™t ruined for me is my 19â€ viewsonic crt, still no other monitor iâ€™d rather play through doom on at 320x200",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™ve had those headphones for 4 years now and i plan on getting better ones this winter.,the headband is so uncomfortable because the foam is starting to collapse down.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no i have an 8th gen that iâ€™m getting rid of and iâ€™m upgrading to 13th gen. the motherboard i bought will work with 13th gen intel processors.,iâ€™m sorry if i didnâ€™t make that clear enough,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"he said that windows 11 is faster than windows 10, which is nonsense - especially with the improved security features.",not sure you explained how windows 11 was faster either; being roughly the same is presumable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this.,"4gb has been plenty for all of our office pcs that near-exclusively use outlook and excel ever since vista was released, same on 7, 8, 10 and 11.

nowadays we use 8gb for new builds but they always sit near 60% ram utilization even with chrome open, av, teamviewer, syncthing and spotify.","i'm sure they'd run just as well with 4gb as vista and 7 did but eh, 8gb kits are cheap nowadays.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"shit ton, including;

xbox tech to improve gaming

enhanced touchscreen, voice and pen support

better virtual desktop support

android app integration

design and interface

and so on",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'd like to know this too.,i think bro maybe high on the bigger number.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"its probably too old 

since windows 11 has come a long way, and added even more quality-of-life updates",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can upgrade any time you want.,"some features have unintended side affects, known as bugs.",they cause that arenâ€™t usually supposed to be there.,developers can â€œpatchâ€ these bugs through system upgrades called â€œupdatesâ€,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
awesome!.,"just if you don't know, they are stereo headphones with simulated surround.",any headphone can do that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also improve windows snapping features for multi windows organization,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™ve been trying to do some research on good headphones to replace them.,so far iâ€™m thinking of the hyperx cloud alpha wireless.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
forgot about those lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not too familiar with wireless options but r/headphones and/or r/budgetaudiophile have helped me in the past.,i use ath-m50xs for my dailys with the fulla schiit amp/dac.,there are so many options.,i also have a pair of senheisser hd660s but they are open back and the wife can hear everything.,edit: typos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for your recommendations.,might post there later.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on the game and memory setup.,"with modern games, and quad channel ddr4, the lga2011-3 cpus will likely be faster.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
get the 1660 v3.,they oc great and once they are performs better then 3rd gen ryzen sometimes even beats 5000 series.,if you have an x99 mobo it's no brainer.,quad channel ddr4 is better than dual 3600 so no need to worry about ram,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, probably gonna be using quad channel, is there a significant difference between 2133 vs 2400mhz ram in quad channel since the v4 supports it but v3 doesn't, and which would be the better option 1650v4 or v3, also btw these cpu are from prebuilts so they are locked down.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a haswell architecture cpu is beating zen 3 sometimes?,are you trolling?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i am getting these cpus in prebuilt workstations since they are cheap and i think they are pretty locked down so you can't oc, also x99 motherboards are really expensive here",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the v3 are the only ones which can be overclocked as far as i know.,"higher frequency memory is very impactful on lga2011-3 processors, preferably 2800 or 3000",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not sometimes, in pretty much every instance.",in fact my ivy bridge 1680 v2 gets better fps than my friends r5 3600. i don't even use an expensive air cooler to overclock either.,"the 1660 v3 is a better bin version of the 5960x and costs less too

https://youtu.be/gnirepet80u",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i meant i am gonna be getting a prebuilt workstation with these cpus which are completely locked down, memory frequency is also locked down",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no.,cpu/mobo will yield a bigger uplift than faster ram in your case.,ram could be a 5-10% boost whereas cpu/mobo could be like 30%.,(i made all numbers up).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

is your system using a aio (liquid cooler)?,or is it using an air cooler?,either way the fans on both types of coolers have to be spinning.,"for now, what's most important is to know that all the fans in your pc is working.","and if you have a liquid cooler, the pump in the liquid cooler is working.","since you've had your system for 3 years without issues until now, you could leave the fans where they are currently plugged in.",edit: a 4 pin header can take both 3 pin or 4 pin fan connectors.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm not saying that you lied, i'm saying that what happened to you is very.. strange.","a cpu that idles at 100â°c has literally zero headroom to do anything and will throttle to ridiculously low frequencies, or even go into thermal shutdown.",i know that from experience.,did you do something like a bios update or an os reinstall?,"i'm thinking that maybe that fan plug was configured in the bios or os to actually output something, but that setting was somehow llost.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so after all, you just advertise your product??",cool-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what did you change?,did you just swap the fan connector to another header?,"if that's what you did, it doesn't really have anything to do with it being a prebuilt, seems like the header just died or there was a loose connection.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it definitely does sound like they got swapped.,the wire coming out from the housing at the cpu should be connected to the pump/aio header.,the fan(s) that's on the radiator should be connected to the cpu fan headers.,edit: it would be easier if you are able to upload a photo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the pump runs around 1k regardless of the fan header.,what do you have connected to cpu fan header?,4k rpm sounds like a jet probably and is running at unnecessary fast speed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
apologies- i do believe i've fixed it.,fan 1 wire was wired behind the motherboard and came out next to fan 5 & pump fan.,"the pump fan was twist tied so it couldn't reach anything but fan 1, hence the confusion.",here's a pic of it fixed!,https://imgur.com/a/b0zzz5y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

sure but the alder lake is still pretty new so that's why i asked.,the 8700k is five years old so i'm not really surprised by that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ignore the rated power limits.,"you can and will want to eliminate them on all alder lake cpus, so you will not be running the 12900f at 65 watts.",it will likely end up taking the same or more power than the 12700k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"okay, but a k series cpu requires a z690 board to make use of k specific features, while a non-k cpu does not require such a board.","as z690 boards are far more expensive than, say, h610 or b660 boards, i was wondering if thatâ€™s why the 12700k was more than the 12900f, which otherwise makes no sense if itâ€™s the same board.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
vrm - voltage regulation module.,basically they supply smooth clean power to the cpu at the exact voltage desired.,most modern boards have lots of powerful vrms especially at the higher and expensive end.,higher performance chips require more power and you are looking at the mid to high end of cpus (more cores need more power to run and higher frequencies too).,"in reality it's only budget boards that might be an issue, you don't need the best motherboard just don't get the cheapest.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thank you, now i just need to save up lol.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah only logical explanation is that maybe the 12900f is the default in the system so changing it would require them to extract and put it all together again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
alright thank you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"50c at idle is not normal, especially not for water cooling.","if the aio is good, i would take the cooler off the cpu, clean both surfaces with isopropyl alcohol and cotton swabs, then reapply thermal paste.","could be crappy thermal paste, could be seated badly, could be an incorrect application of thermal paste.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a dying aio is always a possible reason,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
im sure it's related to seating the cooler correctly pressure incorrectly spreading...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you hooked up the retrofit kit?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just did this how long do i have to wait before seeing results,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i thought that too but itâ€™s less than a month old and the pumps are working and so are the fans after testing could it be seated wrong!,?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah after removing the cooler and reseating it with new thermal paste temps have dropped almost 20 degrees,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
reapplied the thermal paste?,"results are immediate, there is no latency on that.","if the temperatures are still abnormal then either you have applied the paste incorrectly (too little, too much or you have excessively moved the cooler upon pressing it down on the cpu, creating air bubbles) or the aio's pump is dying.",in extreme cases it could be overvoltage for one reason or another (perhaps you are trying to overclock manually) but i doubt this is the reason here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"how is the radiator mounted, you could have air in the pump.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i applied the paste and temps are 5-10 degrees cooler.,i applied the paste as supposed to.,"it was a prebuilt from micro center and they completely applied the paste wrong (i could read the letters in the cpu) 
i read on google that it may take time to dry for the full affect so iâ€™m waiting on that thank you for your advice appreciate it!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mounted like a typical aio on the top of the case and the pumps down i applied new thermal paste and seems to have worked running 12 degrees cooler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've never heard of thermal paste needing time.,every pc i've built so far i've turned on within 30 minutes of putting on the cooler on the cpu and it was immediately clear whether the idle temperatures were good or not (and thus whether the paste had been applied correctly).,"if you're still having temperature issues, i would say the pump on the aio is struggling and dying or the water had trickled out somehow.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
after applying the paste and letting my pc idle for a few ours idle temps have gone from 58 to 42 so seems to have worked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42 is still awfully high at idle for a water cooler.,i'm cooling a 12900k with a noctua dh-15 air cooler and it idles at 30c (if it's hot in the room).,you should be idling at that or below with water.,i'm thinking your aio is on the way out.,do you have any spare coolers you could swap out and try?,could be good before you spend money on a new cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42 is still a tad to high.,i run an overclocked 12700k with a 360 aio and i am at 25 to 27 degrees c on idle.... i live in the uk so ambient is pretty much always cool.,"now either you live in a hot country or the aio is no contacting properly, or not working (check the speed of the pump in hardwareinfo).",or it could be some setting in bios by the builder to boost speeds.,"make sure you reset the bios to stock settings, set xmp to the ram's rated speed and reboot.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my 12900k is on a new 360ml aio from cooler master and its running 40-45 ish idle.. guess i should contact customer support for a replacement?,edit: i also have the cpu socket mod to prevent bending of the cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe you're not living at similar locations?,"of he's in a building without ac and 26-28 oc, it would be tough/impossible to get 30oc idle",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"itâ€™s still going down as the thermal paste sets temps are now in the 30â€™s
edit i did check bios and everythingâ€™s normal and my temps also seem to be cooler in bios but i believe thatâ€™s due to windows not being booted yet not sure",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that looks a lot better at 30 degrees...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the thermal paste does not really need any ""setting time"" to work, but if your cpu temps are now in a reasonable range, that's great!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

so heads up if anyone reading this and just for future reference.,it seems all dell 'gaming' lineup have this issue.,i have checked several youtube videos who reviewed this model and previous dell g15 models in-depth and i am getting almost exact same benchmark results as their review.,"it is a poorly cooled laptop with gimped cpu performance as a result, by design.","my multi-core cinebench r23 score is 16,055 points, the asus tuf gaming f15 with 12700h gets 18,170 which is a %12 difference.",my cinebench score is really close to other dell g15s variants with 12700h as per several reviews.,i am really disappointed and will avoid all dell products in the future.,i am keeping the laptop because of current events in my third world country and i will look into getting cpu/gpu repasted or replacing it with liquid metal by a professional in the future.,from what i have read it should make slight improvements in temperatures and performance.,also fuck dell.,"i had to buy this laptop in a hurry because prices were sky rocketing, if i had done my research thoroughly, i would not have bought your garbage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the other option was asus tuf f15.,maybe i should have went with it.,i need the laptop for my work and i am trying to avoid a hassle with warranty.,"afaik it is not thermal or power throttling from what intel xtu tells me, it is just switching utilized cores rapidly and the frequency is heavily fluctuating.","edit: looks like it is indeed thermal throttling, as soon a core is utilized, it is temperature spikes from 50 to 95 degrees and then it gets throttled, i do not know if all their line up is like this or just my laptop.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 13500 being 6+8 is going to be insane if they keep pricing the same (like $20 more than xx400),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
shame i3 doesnt have e cores.,i guess they can't make them too good.,"the fact that you will be able to get ""workstation"" caliber mt performance of 2-3 years ago for $200-300 is really impressive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

good for folks who invested in alderlake.,but dead end socket after this generation.,this is what is keeping me from going intel for my upcoming build.,"not just looking at performance now, but also 3 years from now.",amd will have a drop in replacement.,"intel will require a mb and cpu, meaning a complete teardown and rebuild.",also them power figures floating around... god damn.,meteor lake hopefully fixes this problem.,"still, great time to be a hardware enthusiast, looking forward to the reviews and comparisons.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

really wish i3s had e cores though for real.,having something like 3-4 p-cores and 2-3 e-cores would make so much more sense especially since when at this point the background tasks might actually start to eat into your foreground tasks' core usage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

good thing they left some wiggle room between the i3-13100 and i5-13400 ;),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
much prefer it being a 4p core 8t setup than 4p+2e to be honest.,"12100 is already pretty fantastic in the same configuration, and not really a fan of jumping to w11 needed for the thread optimisation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

they need to reclaim market share from amd more than anything else so if temporarily sacrificing margins is needed they have to do that.,back in the day they were always their only real competition since every generation had to be that much more impressive to get anybody to upgrade.,hopefully theyâ€™ll be innovative like that again.,that said they did say they were hiking pricing up to 25% so my guess is while itâ€™s a 13500 itâ€™ll be priced differently than the 12th gen equivalent and still be profitable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

been using windows 11 since launch and as of now it has been great.,you are running a 12th gen 12700 k with ecores so go with windows 11... i have pretty much the same setup with a 12700k though a 3080 and win 11 has been more than fine.,ps go with a 3080 12gb especially as prices are dropping to below msrp and on ebay even cheaper.,it will make a huge difference especially at 1440p high refresh and more importantly we see you through a fair few years especially if 1440p is where you play.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there are boards with 2x pcie 5 slot like msi carbon.,"you can put a nvme 5.0 drive in the second slot, your gpu will drop to 8x which on a gen5 card it won't be an issue at all.",rpl has same number of lanes so it's going to have the same limitations.,if there is m2 gen5 they have to borrow lanes from the gpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

well since it isn't intensive games i guess first your storage and ram i would recommend 512ssd and at least 8gb of ram but 16gb (8ã—2) is always recommended i would say next will be the graphics card i'm not good with old models of graphics card but if your budget is limited a 1650 is good enough.,for  processor is really depending on your budget and workload but if you want something new and on budget either a ryzen 5600x or intel i5 12400f is pretty good and pretty bang for the buck (note that if you go intel 12th gen you have to consider a new motherboard which the socket code will be lga1700) mobo names will be h610/b660/z690 also do check for the correct motherboard since there's the newer ddr5 boards with intel 12th gen supports.,well for ryzen do check the correct board also.,"i forgot the socket code but ryzen 5000 series used motherboards which is b550 and x570 ( i forgot the lowest end mobo name)

you probably have a 265w psu so you're most likely going to be limited to pcie powered cards like the 1050ti/1650/rx6400 unless you have a 6 pin pcie connector on there which would let you use up to a 1650 super.,your case might only support half-height cards so that might limit your options further.,"gpu bottleneck won't matter, the cpu you pick is going to struggle with anything faster.",you might not even be able to upgrade the psu as it could be proprietary but i'm not sure if dell did that sort of thing back then.,"cpu wise, some people have successfully booted with sandybridge xeons like the e3 1270 in a dell which can be bought for dirt cheap on ebay/aliexpress so at least you have that going for you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

as for having fixed clocks.what i do is look at the core boost of the cpu when playing games/benchmarks and in my case my 9900k can boost to 5ghz in single core process but for anything heavy it goes 4.7ghz on all cores (gaming,benchmarks)

so what i did in the bios is i synched all cores to 47 (4.7ghz) and to make sure power is delivered without issues i also disabled c-states/speestep so now my 9900k constantly runs at 4.7ghz fixed all cores.helps with preventing any ingame flactuation.",i also planned to update to a 12900k but i kept hearing the scheduler for w11 is still not there yet with games and i've seen multiple reports and videos of ppl claiming games are smoother (better frametime) with e-cores off.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you're very welcome :).,thanks for sharing some more of your insights into this.,was there a particular title people were having issues with?,"it's possible the stuttering you describe is some kind of a quirk to do with the caches, i honestly don't know enough to say either way on that one and having not experienced it makes it all the more difficult, all i can really do is share what i know of the cache :).","the l3 cache is the only one that's shared between the p and e cores, p cores have dedicated l2 and l1 cache per core, e cores have dedicated l1 cache and each grouping of 4 e cores shares a l2 cache.",i'm not really sure how the whole cache sharing side of things operates.,"it would be nice to have 16 p cores i agree, but where the e cores really shine is they can fit about 4 e cores in the space of a single p core, so in the same die space as the 12900k we'd likely end up with a 10x p core configuration trading a whole 8 e cores for the additional two p cores.",in most mt situations i honestly don't think the trade would be worth (there of course are likely the odd exception to this).,i think you're correct thermal/power is likely a factor of why they haven't released a 16p core chip but also die space likely contributes as it would substantially increase cost of manufacture if it was possible.,"i agree intel really did get away with stagnating due to lack of competition, we saw very little in the way of improvement for years, however i'm not sure they'll be able to do the same given how close intel and amd are at the moment.","i can't agree that it's the same logic with regard to their previous stagnation, i think this really is a big step forward and that there's a lot of potential for hybrid architecture, i was highly sceptical when i saw that they were going for a hybrid architecture and thought it'd be a challenge to make it work well, and that it'd likely be a waste of die space.",after release i was so impressed with the benchmarks that i upgraded from a 10700 to the 12700k and honestly the performance increase is absolutely massive especially when it comes to mt workloads.,"i can imagine, and at the time the 4790k was absolutely no slouch.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the rtx 2050 consumes less power and gives better performance.,i think that this is a positive thing actually.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can you elaborate?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol no.,higher wattage especially for gpu is a must for gaming.,nothing to do with efficiency.,check a 3070 laptop with gpu limited to 90w and a 3070 with a 120watt limit.,night and day difference in gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so does that mean aspire 5 is better?,aspire 5 has metal outer finish whereas aspire 7 is plastic body.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what's your source of 2050 giving better performance?,i found two benchmarks already that show it's worse.,https://www.videocardbenchmark.net/compare/geforce-rtx-2050-vs-geforce-gtx-1650-(mobile)/4501vs4090,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
go for the 5 then.,the 7 doesn't seem to have any advantages in this case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you have multi core enhancement on your motherboard enabled?,pretty sure mine was doing something similar when i first set it all up.,it was dumping insane amounts of voltage to hit the 4.7 all core.,ended up doing a manual overclock and it runs a lot cooler at 5ghz.,"the 4.7ghz is the all core boost as rated by intel iirc, that's why i ask.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if the problem isn't mounting pressure and it's annoying you, you could always undervolt it.",i have my 10700k (pretty much the same chip) at 1.2v at 4.7ghz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
got my i9 9900k about a year ago and its running fine even with the relatively high temps.,im hitting around 50-60 in normal desktop tasks and about 70-80 in games while the load is mostly under 40 percent.,ive hit 90 degrees a couple of times when my load peaks but it quickly goes down after the fans adjust their speed and the load becomes normal again.,is this normal or can i change some things since im opening up my pc for upgrades anyway in the near future.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you feel like it - you can undervolt a bit - ca use the feature from the mobo uefi - got a bit cooler results myself - but you should be fine overall,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
open task manager and confirm that you are actually at idle and that there isn't some bloatware causing issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you temps got to hot, it would probably start thermal throttling at that point but it i don't think it's throttling, it's obviously not thermal throttling (look at the clock speed) so it should probably be fine :).",i may be incorrect in some of the words i wrote i'm not the most knowledgeable on that gen of i9s.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thats normal for i9 9th,  i9 12th gen can reach up to 100c in noctua nh d15 if not undervolt.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have an msi motherboard so i disabled enchanced turbo which ist basically the equivalent to multi core enhancement.,default setting was on auto.,it is a few degrees cooler now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4.7ghz is almost full load for the 9900k.,i wouldn't be surprised with these temps,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"overall usage is at 8 percent but frequency jumps between 3,3 up to 4,2 ghz.",speed shift is on and my power setting is on balanced,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
enabled c1e as it was disabled by default and ist seems to make it run even cooler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so these temperatures are fine or at least normal for this cpu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
totally normal.,it would be crashing by now if there was an issue.,you can always go liquid cooled if you're overly concerned but those are fine temps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ghz doesnâ€™t mean full load, just the number of cores activeâ€¦ for example if there are 2 cores doing work than it will work at 5ghz, but all 8 will be 4.7.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just noticed that it doesnt go under 4700 mhz or if it does only for short bursts.,i'll try fixing that and look again,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thing i noticed tho is that my cores keep peaking up to pretty exactly 4700mhz and then down again.,"task manager shows a fluctuation between 3ghz and 3,8 ghz all this while speed shift is enabled and im running a balanced power plan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i assume that's a two barrel shotgun at that close a range....yeah they ain't winning that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rpl isn't competing with n3 chips though?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if it hits 100c that fast it looks like you're getting inadequate heat transfer from the ihs to the cooler.,maybe check your thermal paste application or try better thermal paste?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if your asus motherboard supports ai oc features, try setting your 'svid behavior' to 'trained'.",it uses the onboard ai to tune a lot of power settings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

terrible take by bernie here.,"1) while intel will probably benefit from the chips act, intel has not received any chips act money thus far, and will not at any point in 2022. one thing has absolutely nothing to do with the other.","2) intel has announced plans for very significant capital spending for several years, with the intention to be slightly ($1-2b) cash flow negative in 2022. because intel's profit in 2022 looks like it will be $4b lower than originally thought, intel announced plans to reduce capital spending by a corresponding amount to keep cash flow in the same range.","long term, i expect intel to spend the same amount, but it doesn't make a ton of sense to go significantly cash flow negative in 2022 if it can be deferred a bit.","3) intel's dividend rate has not increased in 2022: https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/intc/dividend-history

4) intel needs to pay a decent dividend to retain long term investors, because the stock price is extremely depressed right now.","intel's assets are arguably worth more than the current market cap, making it very attractive to acquisition, including by private equity, which would almost certainly fuck intel's current strategy.",the stock price would be even more depressed if intel didn't pay a dividend.,thus the dividend is a small price to pay to maintain independence so intel can execute on its strategy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the k variant has higher boost speeds.,so even if youâ€™re not overclocking the cpu will still be faster.,the k variant will allow for better memory/xmp compatibility when not using ddr5.,intel locked the fivr on non-k chips meaning you canâ€™t increase the vccsa voltage which is necessary for good gear 1/xmp memory speeds when using ddr4.,this isnâ€™t an issue if going ddr5 right now because .95v~ vccsa is generally enough for speeds up to 6000-7000mhz.,with ddr4 setup youâ€™ll be limited to around 3200-3600mhz with the higher end if youâ€™re lucky and using single ranked memory.,the k chip will let you increase vccsa and therefore you can run higher gear 1 speeds up to and above 4000mhz gear 1 depending on the imc quality.,something to consider.,i would go k chip since theyâ€™re so small diff in price and benefits of memory tuning and higher clock speeds.,"not to
mention better resale value.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> my thinking was to want to enjoy the faster base clock speed?,what were you planning on using it for?,"if it's for gaming, you'll see almost no improvement since clock speeds will be boosting higher since gaming isn't a very stressful load, if it's for something that can use all the p-cores, like rendering, there will be a difference.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can you overclock a non-k on z690?,"no, not in the way that you could overclock a k. you can bclk overclock both, but thatâ€™s a bit more of a specialty style of overclocking.","z690 has more pcie lanes, generally a higher feature level, supports nvme raid, and of course could let you upgrade to and overclock a k cpu.","z690 boards are typically specâ€™d to a higher quality level and have better power delivery, even on the budget side.","but they do cost more even when outfitted lower than some premium b660 boards, as the chipset is significantly more expensive.",the faster base clock of the 12700k isnâ€™t particularly meaningful.,"according to cpu monkey itâ€™s about 6% higher multi core and 4% single core than the 12700, which is going to be tough to notice during typical operation.",but it also costs 20% more.,"however, donâ€™t think that the 12700 is more adept to running on b660 boards than the 12700k.","in order to get the performance out of the 12700 you have to remove its stringent power limits, which means it needs almost as much power as a 12700k stock, which means most b660 boards (other than several top models) wonâ€™t be able to adequately power it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if you dont plan on ocing ram or cpu the get the 12700 and save ur money  the 12700k at stock barely preforms better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"12700k has a slightly higher pl iirc and is more capable for oc memory (as vccsa is unlocked) even if not ocing core clocks, so if you're wanting ddr4 > 3200mt/s it's usually a good idea to go ""k"" even on b660 as otherwise you're less likely to be able to run your ram in gear one and unless you're pushing quite high frequencies it won't be worth going to gear 2 over ddr4 3200 in many instances.",the 12700k also has slightly higher e core maximum boost clocks.,"i don't know how much base clocks impact performance as i've honestly not really looked into it on modern cpu's, they always seem to be in turbo anyway so they don't really seem likely to be that relevant compared to maximum all core turbo frequency and maximum turbo boost frequency.",i tend to barely even look at those numbers beyond to get a very rough guide as often benchmarks ideally comparable to your common workloads will give a better guide overall of how a cpu will perform and which is better value.,"the big ones are b660 supports half the pcie lanes, half the dmi lanes, no oc (except memory on k cpu's), less usb ports, less sata ports than z690.",of course motherboards may not always support the maximum numbers of each these ports.,if you want specific numbers for [z690](https://www.intel.com.au/content/www/au/en/products/sku/218833/intel-z690-chipset/specifications.html) or [b660](https://www.intel.com.au/content/www/au/en/products/sku/218832/intel-b660-chipset/specifications.html) click their corresponding link.,"unless you need the extra io, or are planning on ocing it often won't really matter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

with mentioning also ram cant be overclocked on non k 12th gen cpus because now vccsa voltage is locked unless you buy a k possessor which is probably why it is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its is but not with multiplier you have to use the blck clock which overclocks your ram aswell so if it was non k inly up to a point as the ram frequency would increase and that requires more vccsa voltage.,but idk if their are certain presets as well tue 5800hd qas locked but saw gamer nexus using an msi z690 board abd to my knowledge only msi has or was the only one i saw that had or has hese presets that worked around the locked multiplier but other board vendors could have done this as well after or it  just was only or first noticed on the msi board,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,"i understand that helps a ton even with a dedicated video card, especially for video editing.",so i will not be getting an f variant.,thanks!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which motherboards?,"if you're going with something like the asus b660-g/f board, i would say ddr5 since you can bclk those boards.","either way, if you decide to go ddr5 route, make sure you pick memory sticks that use sk hynix chips.","these overclock better than samsung this round, and far better than crap micron chips.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

or dont and get 13th gen...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with the right mb some are shit with it for it but you could say that about just ocing in general  yeah i have nothing against it some boards not only blck well the features like on the mb with out having to go back to bios increase decrease and force back in bios if unstable or frozen so nice etc  nice to have .to have etc what board you using?,"also idk if u have m,2 for instance but set blck stock so 100 run user benchmark use blck and drives score go though the roof",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also some kits wont work on non k cpus vcssa is locked so blck oc can make ram unstable pretty quickly.,and xmp  may not wont work even even,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i believe those dimms are reported to be sk hynix.,you should have no issues running 6000mhz easily.,probably can go beyond that.,unfortunately no bclk oc available on that board but not a big deal most people donâ€™t bother oc.,i donâ€™t think gigabyte is very good this round.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

certainly :).,the kit is a corsair vengeance pro 32gb (2x16gb kit) the model number is cmw32gx4m2d3600c18 [here](https://www.corsair.com/ww/en/categories/products/memory/vengeance-pro-rgb-black/p/cmw32gx4m2d3600c18) is a link to the product page.,i believe some versions of that model are on the qvl (3.34 is on there but my version 3.44 has been fine).,i've had zero issues with memory at all at 3600mt/s  + xmp haven't bothered to run memtest but i run a reasonable amount of random workloads and benchmarks + a good variety of games so it's likely i'd have noticed a problem if there was one a few months on :).,the only instability i've had is that which i've caused when tweaking things things (ie undevolting too much) but once dialed in it's been solid and stayed that way :).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the igpu can save you in case your gpu dies.,itâ€˜s handy for trouble shooting in general.,"and if you can make use of it, quicksync.",some applications love it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
basically the same thing.,the k has integrated graphics so you can use it without a gpu.,the 10900kf doesnt have those integrated graphics so you have to buy a discrete gpu.,"also, i would just buy a 12700k which is much better value, unless you got some special deal going on with a 10900k/kf",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the main difference is, i9-10900k has an integrated gpu.","[https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/compare.html?productids=199332,199331](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/compare.html?productids=199332,199331)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"\-f = no integrated gpu  
if you plan on video editing, go for non-f since intel's quicksync helps  


or better yet just buy a 12600k or 12700",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
neither.,either wait for the 13th gen or get a i7-12700k or i9-12900k and that's coming from someone who has a i9-10850k.,"the performance difference between 10th gen and 12th gen is already big and it's going to get much bigger with the 13th gen. 

all of that being said, there's no real differences between the two besides the fact that the kf doesn't have integrated graphics meaning you need a gpu with it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the igpu that comes with the k version gives you quicker rendering times for adobe premiere,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the i is just practical if you ever want to use a computer if you graphic card is defective.,thatâ€™s why i prefer non kf variants.,it really depends on the price difference but sometimes they are really close,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"one has onboard graphics, the other doesn't.","k=overclockable f=no onboard graphics, gpu required.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no integrated graphics on the kf.,"cheaper to buy kf but loses more resale value, unless the kf is considerably cheaper i'd take the k.

i have a 10900kf myself but i got a really nice deal on it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the literal only difference is that the k has integrated graphics and the kf does not.,"if money isnâ€™t important, go with the k and not the kf

the k sign in intel cpus mean overclocking capabilities + no bundled cooler

f means no integrated graphics

h usually mean laptop

t mean all-in-one",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i9-10900k - as if your gpu burns out and you dont have a backup you wont have video with the kf.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"kinda irrelevant, but wouldn't the f version overclock marginally better, for example another 100mhz or so, since the igpu is fused off?","it needs marginally less power than the k variant and has more ""dead"" area on the die to spread the excessive heat.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"f = without igpu, nothing more
btw i reccomend you to get a 12600k, it is much faster, newer and cheaper.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the only difference,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you tried changing the cable?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"is there a setting in the bios for prioritizing usbc video over usb speed (something like ""enable high resolution mode"").","i have an hp laptop that had a setting for that, but that slowed the ethernet on the dock slightly to allow more/higher resolution monitors on the dock",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"maybe try on linux to see if it's windows related; try different type of cable, usbc to dp, hdmi, dvi; try to connect to a different monitor; there are also external graphic cards though i'm not sure of how they connect.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
existing stuff is on discounts so you can take advantage of that.,"and if they cut more, especially things like 5800x3d you may even easily skip ddr5 for a generation or two.","so if you need pc now then buy now-ish, if you can wait 2-4 months then wait but you never know what price and what features will you have at that point.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with how fragile supply lines are these days my conclusion is get what you can while you can.,you never know when a new war will start up or another pandemic.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
everything is expensive and in a year will be obsolete,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that piece doesnâ€™t really tell you much.,iâ€™m waiting to build my new pc.,there are huge changes in the pipeline with motherboard power supply and distribution that will dictate a complete new platform.,if 12 to 5 volt conditioning moves from power supply to motherboard expect big expense and big changes.,im looking forward to it.,california law will stop the march towards high energy consumption components and it canâ€™t happen too soon.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so do you just go to every single subreddit to advertise your website?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think budget determines if anyone should build a pc right now\*.,"infinite cash - wait  
limited funds - absolutely build now.",it's not like the current tech is in any way slow or bad.,\*and this is on the basis that the customer needs a pc desperately now too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its a never ending story.,"new hardware being released every 6 months - 1 year, your pc gets outdated faster than you deliver it from shop.",got money - buy it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
absolutely agree and to be honest the performance of the amd 5000 and intel 12th gen is immense any way.,very hard to buy a bad cpu these days.,ddr4 is still great and really cost effective at the moment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why do you want av1 encoding so badly?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
100% agree.,"looks to me like what theyre doing is releasing the card that people will buy and wont really expect any crazy good game preformance out of it and using that to get user feedback on drivers, probably so that when they release flagship there are less driver problems and have a comparatively smoother launch.","&#x200b;

everyone needs to remember that intel getting into the gpu space is a good thing!","more options and more competition driving prices down, and who knows maybe one day you can buy and intel gpu made in america.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pretty expensive for a last gen card that sucks up a bunch of power and has tons of bugs.,"but to be fair, that's their entire lineup.",they need 3060 (msrp $329) performance for $189 - but apparently thats their a770 model (with bugs and more power).,"maybe we can sell the cards in 20 years to retro gaming enthusiasts, kinda like voodoo cards.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why are people simping for av1 encode/decode?,literally nothing uses it yet.,"youtube, twitch, etc.",are all still h264 and will be for the next few years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
anyone got any idea when the higher end alchemist gpus launch?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
really crappy price for a crap product.,by using it as a secondary gpu you're capping main gpu to x8 and introduce potential issues from running mixed gpus.,don't buy unless it's for a multimedia box.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so to sum things up.,there is a chipshortage.,a chip nobody needs (yet) will be shipped.,/s,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
$99 should be pricing for 6gb version and $119 for 12gb.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this fits into systems with a pcie slot, so anyone that has wanted to use av1 in some capacity now reasonably can.","i  don't think plex supports av1 yet, but jellyfin does, and it would help a lot of people format shift their stuff into a more space and bandwidth-saving container while things are being better prepared on the client side.","av1 aside, some people might also want to make use of quick sync on a desktop that doesn't support it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it can take the load off of other components when encoding streams for example,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"so, in other words they want people to pay to be beta testers for their drivers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"most people aren't going to buy the 4090, or even the 4080, it's the lower end cards that have much more mass market appeal.",nvidia probably wont have a reasonable 3060 replacement for almost a year so if intel can launch a 3060 competitor at a reasonable price they should be able to sell them.,just got to get those drivers down.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"obs can use av1 for recording, that's a big deal for creators.",encoding matters for recording far more than it does for streaming.,"with youtube allowing bitrates up to 51k, the current encoders are sufficient for streaming 4k 60fps.","so it's not a feature that's really needed for streaming, av1 however is very useful for recording stuff at higher quality while taking up less storage space.","this can speed up rending times, upload times, etc.","for creators, time savings = money savings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no one knows, but we can hope it's soon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there are no cards on the market that can saturate x8 bandwidth on pci-e gen 4 or newer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is no 8 gb version.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"only i740 8mb was under $100 and it was best gpu for 640x480 for people who couldn't afford much more expensive 3dfx and nvidia cards, but majority here doesn't know because they were non existent or playing with toys.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> so anyone that has wanted to use av1 in some capacity now reasonably can.,"right, but what capacity?","for storage you're better off with x265 (or software av1) and for streaming you can't use av1 yet, so i'm not sure how anyone would use it right now",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"already been done for years, no one is ever forced either.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what's the alternative?,at this point people know what they are getting themselves into buying one.,"if you don't want to pay to be a beta tester that's totally fine but at least they are persuing this route so that people who are ok with it can use them, help them iron out the bugs and so you, the customer that is waiting, might have to wait less time for a better product.","&#x200b;

intel is getting an insane amount of shit for these issues theyre having and people need to understand that this will likely be 1st gen bugs (probably rolling over to later generations but not as bad) and that creating a product like this from the ground up is insanely hard.","&#x200b;

while i respect your outlook on the situation, you kinda gotta look at the bigger picture.",all this negativity generated around these cards isnt exactly going to encourage intel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i didn't mention anything about enthusiast.,"intel is trying to compete with last-gen low to mid range graphics cards, while using more power with way worse drivers and frame pacing.",let's say they release a 3060 competitor right now.,who cares?,i can just go buy a 6600xt or 3060 which is more power efficient and has way less bugs.,"also, next  gen midrange graphics cards are coming out january, with announcements around november/december.","totally want another competitor, but they fumbled really hard here.",the only thing they can possibly compete on is \*very aggressive\* pricing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ok, but you still have to convert it to h264 to upload it or stream itâ€¦",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm right there with you being unsure of any actual use case, but some people might want to do... something with it.",not sure what that is but it'll be there soon enough.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't think x265 is an option in obs.,obs does support av1 though.,"epos vox had a video a couple of weeks ago showing that the av1 encoder on the a380 (his was the gunnir photon version), is better than any of the other options.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can record with it though.,av1 can deliver a higher quality at a lower bitrate.,"this can result in significant savings in storage, reduce rendering times etc.","if you're a creator, saving storage space and time is worth spending extra money for.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is encoding not decoding.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the alternative is the same as it's always been; don't ship it until the drivers are stable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

now that's just comparing decoding, but encoding should also be more efficient, when hardware encoding is a thing, that's why intel arc is such a big deal, because it's here.",av1 is a big deal.,nothing else out there really compares.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"software av1 should be better, but no evidence that intel hardware av1 is better",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that article compares software av1, that indubitably is better than everything else, but av1 in intel gpu's is hardware accelerated and those are always worse than software",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nope, only 264",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's a bit of a 'chicken and egg' situation.,do sites work to support av1 before there are any av1 encoders or do hw manufacturers support av1 encode even if there aren't any sites that support it (for streaming at least).,intel has effectively broken that 'chicken and egg' situation and now it's on sites to support it.,"twitch doesn't support it currently, but they have [talked about that they are working on it](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/rtx-30-series-av1-decoding/), and there is even a [test vod](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/637388605) on twitch that uses av1 and demonstrates 1440p 120hz streaming.",it's only a matter of time before twitch supports it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that certainly is a lot of projection.,"the card will have uses other than just gpu and isn't even aimed at any segment nvidia nor amd are worried about, related like its encoding, rt cores and base 96bit interface makes it viable for a lot of older system integration for low cost.","while  no one thinks this is where they wanted to be this isn't the worst place just their starting point, which again is a good thing overall for consumers which keeps getting lost  in translation.",cheers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the svt av1 and aom av1 encoders are pretty good and worth using they have come a long way from when they used to be unusably slow, but  a hardware encoder should be much faster, but that's going to need testing.",hardware av1 encoding has so much potential and is undoubtedly the future.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"personally, i agree with the choice part, and i'm disappointed that certain manufacturers make it so hard to make changes that are built into the cpu & gpu (not to mention windows allowing oems who install windows to arbitrarily lock up performance/power saving settings).","that said, one of the biggest selling points for ultrabooks is battery life, and they don't usually have a lot of thermal tolerance (though 15w-35w isn't the end of the world) before they start getting loud and burning laps - 2 features that average ultrabook owners would be very displeased by, were they the default.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

everything has to be contextualized.,"i won't disagree that what you said happens \*a lot\*, i remember a certain macbook pro that came with an i9 that was permanently thermal throttling and thus consistently underperformed its i7 cousin - and that is not an isolated case.","however, in order to believe this is in the same boat, i would need to know whether the 12900u in this form factor + battery life config is beat by a 12th gen u-series i-5 in the same form factor with the same or similar battery optimizations.","in the case of performance benchmarks for laptop chips, a lot of times what you are comparing to is people running a somewhat ""no holds barred"" benchmark run before they put their settings back to a more comfortable configuration for noise/heat/battery life.","i will say, it is likely due to the combination of semi-mutually-exclusive traits of ultrabooks and high performance cpus, you will end up losing out on some of the potential benefits of one or the other.","given a better power delivery and cooling solution, this same chip could scream further than your improved results, but it would have to come at least a bit thicker and heavier, possibly louder.","conversely, people buy ultrabooks for long term portable use because they offer decent performance and resolutions with workday+ battery, comfortable temps and noise, and a slim and light form factor.","so yes, asus \*is\* sort of offering a 'bragging rights' configuration level here without thought of actually optimizing all component choices so there is no need to bios-throttle a chip that cannot be used fully without losing ultrabook appeal.","i am not sure where you sit in terms of knowing components, packages, and the sometimes shady practices of oems, but i think it's fair for you to be surprised at this.","i would suggest, outside of benchmarking (which is fun) that you tune the settings to their most comfortable across all use factors based on your expected workload.","while asus' original config may be slightly conservative, you hopefully haven't felt constrained by sluggish response times or slow performance.","indeed, if you are doing a lot of high performance tasks, you may even want to save your high performance config so you can switch to it while running/building/training/editing or gaming (while plugged in).","tl;dr:   one of apple's best justifications for their large premium is that they do use best-in-class thermal solutions, and since everything from the os to the position and design of the cpu, gpu, power delivery, etc is done in house, they can ensure the system can snappily change its paradigm from quiet and power sipping, to benchmark ripping, and back, all with little to no config required from users (god help you if it doesn't 'just work' though).","pcs are never quite that tightly integrated, and oem laptop manufacturers really stretch things, despite having a better than average opportunity to make a highly-integrated pc.","i hope you learn to enjoy the fun that this tweaking can provide, and when you don't need it, i hope you come to accept that benchmarks are completely synthetic - make your laptop the best it can be for *your* *use case.",*,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hmm i thing it ok if you have low budget.,cpus have very low failure rate overal.,failure will come primary from other components in the system.,"maybe also look for amd laptops, that have better price/performance.",i would more focus on ability to upgrade ram because low cost laptops are equipped with 4-8 gb ram and this could be a bigger problem.,if you afraid of failure rate try to buy laptop with 2 years of warranty.,"also for me display quality is important more than cpu power, if you want to edit photos this is important.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

was sorting through some old photos and videos from 2010 and found this - thought it might be of interest to a few.,an attempt to reach 7ghz with the 'clarkdale' core i5-670 using liquid nitrogen and liquid helium - we were ultimately unsuccessful (hence this never ended up published) but did make over 6.7ghz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you feel like trying it again try to find a cheap asus p7p55d with a moddable bios and an i5-650.,the 650 isnâ€™t meant to be overclocked but a couple of my friends from highschool and i used a pressurized liquid nitrogen cooler to get it to 7.3ghz stable.,the vrms need additional cooling tho since theyâ€™ll hit 90â°c pretty quick.,the only real issue we ran into was that you had to drop the rams clock speed otherwise the power delivery system would shutdown.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks!,it's probably fair to say we were a little over our heads - had the equipment but a bit of a shortfall in both time and knowledge.,i'd only ever run phase-change cooling and the others had run ln2 but the lga1156 platform was quite new at the time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i lacked equipment and knowledge but had time so trial and error was our way of doing it.,total project time was 52 hours but we wrote everything down in an excel document,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
best way of doing it - we had half a day or so to get all our testing done so unfortunately had to rely on best guesses and pushing things faster than we perhaps should have.,"in the end they stuck too much voltage through the chip in a last ditch effort to get more speed from it before we had to finish, and after that it was trash.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the safe voltage for i5-650s is capped at around 1.43v after that you tend to run into instability but we didnâ€™t fry the chip until about 2.31v.,theyâ€™re incredibly resistant but we were stable at 2.28v.,theyâ€™re super cheap making it easy to find one that can handle that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes it will work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there are other cpus supported that have the same 35w base power (pl1), but those have also maximum turbo power pl2 74w.",for example i5-12500t being one of them.,using your cpu on a board that doesn't officially support your cpu could be asking for trouble.,"the only way to be somewhat sure is to contact the manufacturer and ask if the cpu will work, and is it even safe to try.",most likely they will say no.,":(

i'm curious, why did you choose te over ""more common"" t?","just that you know, i'm sporting i5-12600 and that seems to be pretty rare already, but te?",you are the only person i know who has it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how can i be sure it supports?,i gusse like if cpu mbo output more power that is needed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i found guy who sould this cpu for 100$ and its very good deal but when i pick up he said its 12500te so i just searched on net and on power tech said they benchmark with h610 board so i go with that i didnt ask manufacturer if is good idea put that cpu in b660 and in hwmonitor shows me 12500t so do we say its 12500t cpu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"interesting that over [here](https://www.techpowerup.com/cpu-specs/core-i5-12500te.c2555) it says at the end in the notes ""max turbo power 74w"", but on intel site [here](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/compare.html?productids=96140,96142) there's no mention of max turbo at all.",weird.,the t and te cpus seem to have other small differences too.,"for 100 bucks that was a really good deal, if you get it to work.",good luck!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">intel turbo boost

yes, ofc intel says it can max turbo boost to 4.9ghz.","[https://www.intel.com.au/content/www/au/en/products/sku/186604/intel-core-i79700k-processor-12m-cache-up-to-4-90-ghz/specifications.html](https://www.intel.com.au/content/www/au/en/products/sku/186604/intel-core-i79700k-processor-12m-cache-up-to-4-90-ghz/specifications.html)

but i'm afraid that is **not all-core 4.9ghz**.",it may be just 1\~2 cores at 4.9ghz with the other 6\~7 cores at lower speeds.,it cannot automatically turbo boost to all-core 4.9ghz anyway if you do not manually overclock it.,"so, at its max turbo boost speed, **the average speed for all 8 cores is lower than 4.9ghz**.","moreover, **4.9ghz is only momentary**, but it cannot automatically hold at such a high speed for a long period.",so you simply cannot often see 9700k staying at 4.9ghz.,you can **manually overclock 9700k to all-core 5.0ghz**.,why bother wondering about the turbo boost to 4.9ghz though?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is incorrect.,both high performance and balanced should allow for max boost.,you may need to change settings in your bios if you aren't seeing the appropriate boost speeds under load.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is only applicable to laptops if you want to save power.,"for desktops, it does not matter which one you choose.",just do not use power saver though on desktop.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is not the case.,"it is possible that at max performance your cpu was throttling due to thermals, and reducing the temperature may be allowing it to boost higher.",this could be more of a cooling issue than anything else.,"in a *normal* situation, setting the computer to *max performance* is what would yield ... maximum performance (not balanced).","ideally, you'd want to take care of these things in bios anyway, not by playing with windows power plans (let alone doing it in ways that would ordinarily harm performance).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"choose power plant on windows settings to "" performance mode "" to archive your processor maximum performance.",intel turbo boost app had no longer used.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, as others have mentioned that is not nor should normally be the case, but the advice to use balanced versus performance is still relevant, especially for laptop/sff pc users.","but, even on desktop itâ€™s the difference between a cpu idling at 10 versus 30+ watts, and the now-antiquated performance mode (maybe it was useful years ago) does not actually result in any meaningful performance increase.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is not accurate for most users.,power plans control only two relevant settings.,minimum processor state and maximum processor state.,"the plans have the following settings on w11 by default:

high performance - these are both set to 100%.","balanced - min is 5%, max is 100%

some manufacturers change the plans/settings by default particularly on laptops they may have a rather aggressive power saving mode in which switching to balanced may help, they may also modify existing profiles so they're less meaningful, this might help others with the same device with a similarly customised install (assuming that's why this worked for you) but it probably would harm performance or have no positive impact for the majority of users.",in your instance it probably worked as maximum state was set below 100% or you've lifted up minimum state compared to your original power plan.,i hope this clarifies a little :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your cpu is getting too hot.,you need to get a better cooler if you want to run higher clocks/boosts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the reply.,"i tried to find this option in my motherboard's version of bios (not the original blue screen), looked under every setting, and it wasn't there.","however, changing the power mode fixed my problem instantly.","&#x200b;

"that's fine, glad it worked for you, but that's not how things normally work.","some oem pcs won't have any sort of bios settings like that, so windows power is what you're stuck with.","high performance should be the one that holds boost longest, but it's possible you had custom settings put in that made balanced better.",realistically the difference between balanced and max is going to be minimal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah then you're probably missing the full nvidia driver with the control panel and stuff.,"so go to [here](https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) and download the appropiate driver (make sure it's the ""notebook"" version of the driver since you have a laptop).","once it's installed, restart your pc and you should have the nvidia control pannel.","from there, you can go to the 3d settings, then to program settings, then add the .exe for aot2 there, and change the preferred gpu to be the nvidia one (probably called ""high performance nvidia gpu"" or something along these lines).",the reason why you're having this issue is that laptops with a dedicated gpu actually have two gpus: the dedicated one (which uses a lot of power) and the integrated one (extremely energy efficient).,"in order to save power, the dedicated gpu is only supposed to activate itself for games, while the integrated gpu handles everything else (rendering the windows ui, rendering websites, decoding video, etc).","however, nvidia fails to add some niche titles to their game database apparently, which seems to be the case for aot2, which means the dedicated gpu won't get activated for these titles.",so you need to force it through the nvidia control panel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

wished it was vulkan but this is a pretty interesting workaround.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my guess is that they cannot handle the assembly language shaders.,can't think of anything else in d3d9 that is not in following versions.,the old fixed pipeline is trivial to translate into a shader.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is debatably the future of graphics architecture.,"expose your gpu raw to new protocols (dx12, vulkan) and leave it to shims (dxvk, d9vk, whatever) to translate older protocols.","drivers get to stay light (a pure vulkan driver is basically a gpu shim), performance stays high (see steam deck), etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is what i've been saying amd should be doing for their gpus for years.,they also have abysmal dx9 implementations and translation layers to newer apis is the least fragmented solution to provide consistent results.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
technically this is the right move.,but in the marketplace they just ended the platform.,adding translation bloat to an already hobbled architecture it's a solution.,they will not be able to compete.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that's not how dxvk works.,dxvk is not an end user api that programmers can use to write games for.,it's a translation layer.,"dxvk that is installed on your os translates directx 9/10/11 runtime code into equivalent vulkan runtime code, and then this vulkan code is read by the vulkan driver installed on your os that your gpu is using.","you can not just directly make your gpu compatible for dxvk without using dx9/10/11, that's nonsense.",dxvk is a middle level layer.,you will have to firstly make your gpu compatible for dx9/10/11 by providing dx9/10/11 support from your graphics driver's side.,when any application that has been written to use dx9/10/11 is executed read-the-previous-paragraph.,"intel had two options: 
1) go write millions of lines for that outdated dx9 api for their new arc gpu's driver in these modern time when nobody even writes their games for native dx9.","or

2) look for if there is any support for dx9 in terms of backward compatibility in these current generation graphics api.","aha...we have this dx9 backward compatibility support (in this context, it's emulation) from the latest dx12 api itself.","i am not 100% sure at this point, but i think you shouldn't worry because if you want to play your dx9 games on arc on linux, it should be going to be as easy as using -dx12 commandline on steam that will effectively starts the execution of your dx9 game under the vkd3d translation layer (another translation layer that translates dx12 code to vulkan code) and the rest is taken care by the intel's mesa driver that the arc gpu is going to use.",of course it will take some time for vkd3d devs to write code for that specific api subset of the whole dx12 api that does the dx9 emulation under dx12.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"> you shouldn't worry because if you want to play your dx9 games on arc on linux, it is going to be as easy as using -dx12 commandline on steam that will effectively starts the execution of your dx9 game under the vkd3d translation layer (another translation layer that translates dx12 code to vulkan code)

why go through two emulation layers (d3d9 > dx12 > vulkan) when you could cut out the middle man and just go directly d3d9 > vulkan with dxvk?",you say d3d9on12 and dxvk are fundamentally different but i'm failing to see how.,"ultimately, they both translate d3d9 calls to the equivalents for either d3d12 or vulkan.","you say right here:

> dx9 backward compatibility support (in this context, it's emulation)

d3d9on12 is emulation (really, translation), not native implementation of d3d9 calls in d3d12, just like dxvk.","> you can not just directly make your gpu compatible for dxvk without using dx9/10/11, that's nonsense.",dxvk is a middle level layer.,you will have to firstly make your gpu compatible for dx9/10/11 by providing dx9/10/11 support from your graphics driver's side.,d3d9on12 requires d3d12.,dxvk requires vulkan.,"any gpu that supports d3d12 can use the former, and any gpu that supports vulkan can use the latter.",the d3d9 calls are intercepted and translated by either before the driver ever sees them.,native implementation of d3d9 in the driver is (or should be) irrelevant to either.,this is backed simply by the fact that dxvk works on linux despite linux drivers not having support for directx at all for obvious reasons.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">i'm talking wattage and clocks needed to achieve parity with the competition and things like idle power draw, not performance per watt in terms of intel 4 vs it's predecessor.","wattage/clocks or performance-per-watt is literally how efficiency is defined

>12900k competes with 5950x because the e cores are space efficient, not power efficient.","it needs 100 watts more than the 5950x to do this, while the 5950x doesnâ€™t use much more power than the 5900x despite having 4 more cores.",5950x was $800 when it launched.,"its not true competitor to 12900k

ultimately, 10900k, 11900k would probably need more than 200w more power to match 5950x and 12900k would still be more efficient than them still more efficient because it needs """"only"""" 100w more power to match 5950x.","a more than 100w reduction in power to match 5950x

you should actually read the comment chain before replying.,"op said it should reduce power consumption by a big leap on mtl, and i said that it wouldnâ€™t be that much through a die shrink alone and that people say this every die shrink or cpu release in general, not that node shrinks donâ€™t increase efficiency.",or i guess we will just ignore the fact that historically intel needs to consume more power and clock higher to outperform / match amd or as since this is an intel sub.,"that isnâ€™t going to change just by going from intel 7 to intel 4, it hasnâ€™t changed the last 4 generations or more but people pretend it will every time rumors about the next release come up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

pretty much anything will be better than what you have now.,something like a 12400 + b660 or even an h610 motherboard will be fine.,no need to go with ddr5 unless you are willing to spend the extra money.,"as for gpu, depends on your budget.","while prices have come down recently, they are still pretty expensive.","depending on whether you are using a 1080 or 1440 monitor (and assuming you aren't using a 4k monitor), something like a radeon rx 6600 or a gtx 1060 would work fine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would wait a little and get 13600k in a couple months.,right now 12700f is a very good value.,on lower budget 12400 is also great but i think 12700f is going to last you a lot longer.,worth the extra.,honestly you can expect either to be a giant upgrade.,even windows and web browsing will feel more responsive.,i think it's worth paying $20 extra to get igpu though.,it has video codes and quicksync which can be useful and you can connect extra monitors if you need it.,having the pc work without a graphic card is good thing to have and i am overall not a fan of f cpus but it's there if you want to save a buck.,igpu is well worth $20.,so consider 12700 as well and compare prices before buying.,"i still use an ivy bridge pc here and there and the experience is so much worse compared with 12700k in anything really, it's an eye opener.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i upgraded from that exact cpu to an i3 10100. and 8 threads minimum is absolutely necessary for newer cpu intensive games.,an i3 12100 is enough and good for avoiding high heat output but if your room is cool enough then an i5 12400 is a golden choice for best performance to cost ratio.,the 12 high performance threads will last a long time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

> having a brand new pc upgrade within 2-3 years from now will be a sweet experience.,2-3 years?,i thought you meant that you were going to be buying a new cpu in like the next weeks or months at most.,an i5 4430 is very slow and the freezing it does on programs that use more than 4 threads would be something i wouldn't wait 2-3 years for.,but yeah all-threads performance is very indicative of long term performance and that's why i recommend an i5 12400 minimum if your room is cool enough.,it has the lowest cost to threads ratio.,if you get an i3 you would be paying more in the long run's total cost because you would need an upgrade much earlier.,but anything more than an i5 12400/12500 you're getting not much more for what you're paying.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it will be fine as long as you run the cpu at stock settings.,"however, if you donâ€™t already have the board iâ€™d recommend going for b560/h570 instead since b460 does not allow you to run the ram at above 2933mhz.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

iâ€™m getting the aio from a friend cuz he is going to upgrade his aio to 360mm.,also the price of 12400f + nzxt x53 is less than the price of 12600kf in my country,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"according to [igor's lab](https://www.igorslab.de/en/cpu-temperatures-in-the-frame-thermal-grizzly-thermal-right-jeyi-and-feng-zao-lga1700-frames-in-comparison-tests/2/), thermal grizzly is not even the most optimal frame due to requiring fine-tuning screw torque.",meanwhile thermalright is more or less foolproof.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have no idea why so many people have thermal issues with alder lake and others, like me, are totally fine, if it was a contact frame issue shouldn't that affect all alder lake users the same ?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"will this still be a problem on 13th gen. iâ€™m assuming theyâ€™ll still use the same ihs since z690 boards are compatible with 13th gen. 

iâ€™m asking because i plan on upgrading my motherboard and several parts this fall.","only thing iâ€™m
waiting on is the new cpus and iâ€™m wondering if i should jump on this now rather than wait.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i did a [graphical analysis](http://www.benchmark-bowling.com/pc-builds/contact%20frame.jpg) of the contact frame and coldplate installation.,it raises some questions in my mind regarding the amount of torque applied by the contact frame and coldplate to create a reliable electrical connection in the socket.,a job formerly handled by the ilm.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
right now i even think the bending issue is the cause of my ram instability.,i can't get my c16 4000mhz ram stable at idle.,even with manual c16 3200mhz i have stability issues.,"tried 3400, 3600, 3800,... different timing and quite a few settings around the ram topic in the bios.",i just have to find the time to finally install the contact frame to see if that is the real cause.,"temp wise i have the common bending problem of a few cores running way hotter than the others, so it's also possible that the contact to the pins is worse than intended.",that can cause ram instability.,"i tried different bios versions, many many ram settings and so on.",nothing helps except running the ram on really low clocks and with that i mean 2133mhz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
using the thermaltake contact frame was incredibly useful for me.,"my cpu is now extremely chilly even when pulling 400w (in cinebench lmao)

highly recommended for overclockers as even novice modders can install it correctly",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have installed the thermalrite one too.,it didn't make too much of a difference on 12700k but i imagine 12900k has more of an issue for cooling.,i am using noctua cooler so i guess the pressure from screwing down the big heatsink already counteracted the bend anyway but for water block it might not be same.,we will see soon if they changed it for 700 series board but likely they wont.,rpl has a bigger die so maybe cooling of it is easier actually and this wont be an issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my 12900kf would hit thermal throttle in prime95 small-fft (to be fair, all i and d resides in l1, so it's kinda brutal) within a couple of seconds.","after changing to the thermalright frame, it takes several minutes for just one core to hit tjmax, and even then, it usually stays below.",full-core video rendering now doesn't go above 71c at full bore.,cinebench barely breaks a sweat thermally.,"*edit: holy smokes, cinebench r23 is down over 10-12 degrees!","* i'm using a corsair icue h150i, which seems now to be much better matched to the chip.",amazing what a difference such a frame can make.,one question for those of you with the thermalright: the reviews from gn and many of the photos i've seen show the frame being perfectly rectangular at the ihs contact point.,"mine, however, is slightly different.","i bought it from amazon, and the authenticity sticker checks out.","the rectangular contact point with the ihs has three little ""bumps"" cut out.","i'm assuming it's just a design variation, and/or that thermalright updated the design.",does anyone else's look that way?,"i mean, it works wonderfully, so i have no complaints, but i figured i'd ask.","you can see the variation in the following image: [https://m.media-amazon.com/images/i/61q834qee2l.\_sl1500\_.jpg](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/i/61q834qee2l._sl1500_.jpg)

lastly - i did get the ""new cpu installed"" message on my asus z690 maximus formula board only once after doing the swap.",no stability or poweron/poweroff issues ever.,just curious if anyone else got the same message post-install.,"but in short, yeah, it's been a fantastic upgrade.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what kind of temps are we talking here?,"for instance, my 12900kf peaks at 76c gaming with a d15 at stock.",would i really see an improvement?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have seen a good 10c or so temperature drop using the thermalright with a noctua d15.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same.,bought the thermal right one.,i previously had the washer trick.,dropped about 10c at peak.,idle about 5c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
both the thermalright and feng zao frames are the ones to get if you want peak performance and practically fool proof installation.,"the thermal grizzly/der8auer frame is way too expensive compared to these other frames, doesn't even perform the best and requires torque settings to pretty much be perfect.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s only really an issue if youâ€™re overclocking,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
take a look at specific cores.,the overall temp could be ok while a few cores are close to thermal throttling.,core 0 and core 5 are even thermal throttling under full load while the others run in the 80s c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not entirely as there are a bunch of variables for the end result.,"flat vs convex cold plate is one of them, an while coolers have had that difference for years it was never made so apparent until this mechanism bent the ihs so much.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you don't really know you're fine till you try it though.,but there are some coolers which are able to make good contact and don't benefit from the frame.,some of the most popular coolers do have this issue and the contact frame is a no-brainer for them.,"just don't get the overpriced tg one, literally no difference compared to the generic ones.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are likely making the assumption your thermals are normal for your setup.,"unless you can do a/b testing, you can't make that assumption.","take a look at the contact pattern of your thermal compound, see if there are abnormalities.","also don't compare some one else's numbers with yours and say, yea this is fine, it's all relative.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is very dependent on your cooler.,"noctua coolers for example are convex, so they mate extremely well with the ihs.","some water blocks are completely flat, which then leaves a gap.","flat coolers haven't been recommended for a long time because neither intel or amd have actually flat ihs', hence why people were told to lap their ihs in the past.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same mechanism so problem will still be there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but doesn't this happen with the ilm too?,or does the ilm push the cpu so much that it no longer can be pushed by the coldplate?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"altogether possible bad mounting contact is creating instability with your memory controller but itâ€™s got to be supremely off for 3200 c16 to be throwing errors provided youâ€™re using a nicely binned kit (unless gigabyte board)

whatâ€™s your setup looking like?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mine came in a box with a hologram and qr code on it to check for authenticity.,i imagine there are clones of it out there so they put it there.,i dont remember how it looked and its under the heatsink now to check but see the package see if it was same or not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm not going to say ""no"" again, a/b testing is the only real way to know.",however if you are getting 99c in prime95 with the high power/temp torture tests... i would say go for it.,also if you temps spike a lot to 70+ and then dive back down a lot... i'd go for it.,also check the contact pattern of the paste.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"even then it seems that the problem mostly affects overclocked k cpus, it's not an alder lake problem.","i have a flat deepcool as500 paired with a 12700 and it's the colder cpu i ever owned, by far.","maxed out on cinebench r23(170w tdp) i get 68-70 degrees tops, with 29 degrees ambient temperature...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
op clearly specifies his temperature drop is under load.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the primary function of the ilm is to drive the pcb to full seating depth to provide electrical contact between the socket leaf springs and the contacts on the cpu pcb.,"there is no problem with this on the 12th gen ilm, which also functions as a cpu retention bracket and prevent the cpu from being pulled from the socket when the coldplate is removed.","the issue is that the contact frames, by design, do not provide enough socket compression to drive the cpu to full seating depth.",the job of driving the cpu to full seating depth is effectively transferred to the coldplate clamp.,the mounting bolts of the coldplate must be evenly tensioned in order to avoid tilting the ihs in the socket.,1 degree of tilt is sufficient to affect ihs/coldplate contact and possibly cause electrical boot issues.,this is why it is important to use a coldplate mounting clamp that can be tensioned with a calibrated torque driver.,"ek velocity2, and ek magnitude waterblocks for example.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thermalrite came out before thermal grizzly one.,it's not a clone.,give credit where its due.,they are different products implementing same abstract and unoriginal idea.,the main point is how much cheaper it is.,doing same task better for less is like ko but then again thermal grizzly is a small business while thermal rite has been in cooling business for 20 years.,geographic location has little to do with it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not really perfection in this case, its overpriced to fuck and is not even the best solution, they are currently selling it for 39â‚¬ lmao.",people can get relatively decent air cooler for that price and they are selling 10x7cm metal bracket for that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
both the chinese frames perform better than the german frame too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have a theory that the ilm actually serves as a thermal expansion compensation - it acts as a spring and holds the cpu very firmly, so any change in the volume of the metal being thermaly stressed is compensated.","this wouldn't be the case with the contact frames as there are only 4 screws holding it, applying no additional pressure.",some of the frames have washers that can squezze over time and the screws might get loose.,"i already ordered thermalright frame for my new pc build with 12700k (i660, no plan to oc) and ls520 aio, but now
i am tempted to just install it with the ilm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there might have been revisions.,there is one issue with these brackets.,the thermal paste will go into the gap and the bracket will effectively stick to the cpu.,you must be careful when removing the bracket.,maybe they added those cuts to alleviate it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

wuttt my 12700k runs 5.2ghz p cores 4.1 ecores and iâ€™ve seen it hit 300w during cinebench and didnâ€™t hit thermal throttle with stock ilm.,i have the aftermarket ilm for my new build for the 13900k i plan to do but if you are thermal throttling with a i7 with a 280aio you may have a serious issue,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
makes sense!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm also wondering if they retooled it for raptor lake - i wonder if the cpu has some bumps in it.,"i noticed the box says ""lga1700 18xx ilm"", so perhaps it has been updated for newer cpus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"in my experience with about a dozen older nucs of a couple models, they suck.","they thermal throttle easily, some randomly die and wonâ€™t power on.",theyâ€™re extremely picky about ram and will suddenly throw tons of errors with ram on some boots and silently corrupt data and destabilize the system.,the same ram will work fine in another nuc with no errors.,total headache.,i have about a 50% failure rate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as an owner of 2 nucs that i'm tired of constantly doing troubleshooting on...i can confidently say i'm never buying a nuc again.,so many better and much cheaper options out there.,never again do i want to be reliant on intel making a half decent driver for a piece of hardware.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> i've built sffpcs in the past, but really liked the concept of a mostly completed and well supported with drivers bundle where you only have to stick in some ram, a nvme, and a gpu.","unfortunately, we aren't there yet.","that was part of the sell when they revealed the first version of this concept but really, the only steps you save are the cpu and cpu cooler installation.","for that, you are forever stuck with laptop parts and premium laptop pricing.",it ends up not much cheaper or smaller than a sffpc build using a boutique brand chassis.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

> the screws are all laptop quality.",easy to strip and incredibly small and thin.,"this is mostly a problem of low quality, poorly machined bits or choosing the wrong bit size.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you had any previous experience with nucs?,it sounds like you expected a sffpc prebuilt.,my experience with nucs has taught me to treat them as higher power limit laptops without a screen or battery.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was contemplating the dragon canyon as a replacement to my hades canyon which i really love.,it has been my portable workhorse for years now.,iâ€™ve never had any problems with it except when i was trying to overclock it as it does heat up a bit.,"reading your review, i doubt iâ€™ll pull the trigger now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are exactly right.,"at the end of the day, buying a motherboard/cpu/cooler/sff case is a few more hours worth of work, but worth it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's 8 liters but it's not competing against the nr200 but cases like sliger sm550 which is a little larger but similar form factor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"well, this is advertised and targeted as a sffpc prebuilt for gaming.","but yeah, i agree that's what it actually is.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i ended up sending it back unfortunately.,wanted to love it -- honestly probably would have kept it if the xmp ram worked.,oh well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they did move from bga to actual socket this time but it's still a locked cpu under a laptop blower cooling solution with laptop class memory.,it's a big compromise.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™m pretty sure this happens on a lot of system regardless of cpu or os, because there is lots code to load at startup, itâ€™s common to have cpu usage spike.",one way to reduce cpu usage at start is limit what programs can run at startup,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
check your startup in task manager.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
windows update and windows defender absolutely hammer my system every time it boots up because the geniuses at ms assume that if you turned on a computer you are obviously not interested in using it.,it should eventually stop once everything is scanned and updated.,if it doesn't you may have a bigger problem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its normal at startup although you can go into your start up settings by doing alt control delete and open the tast manager and from the task manager you can stop any programs from running at start up therfore limiting what your cpu needs to.process overall and it should also help speed up the start up process keep in mind the less program you have at start up the less your cpu will struggle at start up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, even after startup, there are still tasks that need to be completed.",if the cpu usage leaves after a bit i wouldn't worry about it.,"if it annoys you are need your pc to be usable straight away you could just put it to sleep (or hibernate if you don't want to leave it plugged in overnight), then that shouldn't be a problem.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you have an amd gpu turn off something along the lines of amd user experience program, thatâ€™s something that makes wmi provider host do a lot more than it should.",its probably not the whole problem but might be some of it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
go to msconfig enable muliple core on startup.,try that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the windows update and defender are definitely part of the boot up utilization.,like when you take over a camp your first tasks are team protection so you scout out the location for bad actors.,compared to startup in the â€œold daysâ€ these boxes are incredible.,we would start the box and head to the break room for coffee and maybe when we got back we had a usable desktop.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i ordered an a380 today in newegg i should get it next week sometime where i'll do some test streams - i'll let y'all know my findings

edit: update i got my card in, and it works... *well sort of.","*

* i can't get it to show the av1 encoder in obs at the moment, it does however work with intel quicksync (which is fine for what i need but i was excited for av1)
* one of the biggest problems i am finding is configuration, i'll explain.","my main gaming gpu is in slot 1 running at pcie 4x16 which is great, until i install the a380.",when the a380 is installed it will only let me run the card in 4x8 for my 3080 and the a380.,"* i thus went into my bios and swapped them 3080 at pcie 4 and a380 at pcie 3. well it seems to not have taken as when i boot up gpuz shows me running them both still at pcie 4x8 (splits the 4x16 lane into two 4x8 lanes)
* onto my next step try my third slot.",this is what seems to work the best so far.,still no av1 as i can't get it to work in obs however my gpu is running in all pcie 4x16 and the a380 runs in pcie 3x18.,* this worked it allowed me to stream and i didn't see any issues with frames drops or overloaded encoder at a resolution of 1440x810 at 60 fps.,"i have not reviewed the stream vod yet to see if it looks ok but i assume it does (intel quicksync is a very good encoder even if its not the av1 encoder)
* i will keep testing when i have time but i wanted to give y'all and update

**tldr**: the a380 works as a streaming encoder fine, it wont run av1 for me in obs at the moment so i have to default to intel quicksync.",i had to use the 3rd pcie slot on my motherboard for the a380 so that my main gaming gpu could still use all 16 of my pcie 4 lanes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the airbus a380 ftw :d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as long as you have the pcie slot.,i think it should perform ok for this even if it is connected to chipset.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"from the tests i have seen svt, the software encoder does a better job at av1 encoding and it's free.",downside is not real time.,but there is probably no current use case for av1 real time encoding at this point.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what are the chances they'll be released before nvidia and amd release their next lot which presumably will have similar av1 hardware encoding?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
anthony from a linus tech tips video mentioned someone might do this.,i think the video is from this weekend.,i would imagine this encoder would show up in intel's igpu at some point.,what if this also worked in reverse though.,get an old cheap nvidia gpu that has been optimized for games and then play those games on intel's gpu hardware.,i have no idea what i'm writing about.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think you may run into conflicts with drivers trying to use an intel and nvidia gpu in the same system.,"i could not even get an older nvidia gpu (760gt or something) to work with my 3070 because the driver versions are different, but i could be wrong.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you wonâ€™t be able to run it while running another gpu in your system.,you canâ€™t do it with nvidia or amd cards.,but if you have a second system just for encoding it would work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[removed],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it might impact your pcie bus width on your main gpu if you put it in the wrong slot.,"i think it can take it down to x8 speeds if you're using lanes that  go towards your cpu, instead of your chipset.",but a lot of motherboards don't have that 3rd x16 slot.,someone correct me if i'm wrong.,at worst you'll loose 1% performance on your main gpu if you're using a pcie4 motherboard/cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i would imagine that if you can run intel igpu drivers at the same time as nvidia dgpu it should be feasable, although as others have mentioned, there may be bus/buffer problems with the pcie.","i think this is a very worthy question, and if someone can test this, i would be very interested to see the result!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"like based on what i read, it could greatly increase the quality and/or reduce the file size, if you do lots of video editing and recording, smaller file size = less time to render.",that time savings could be significant and worth the price of the card.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you are on the cusp of new releases (amd next month and intel some time after)

12th gen to 13rd gen will not be game changing upgrade.,i definitely see getting 12th gen now as a good option for you based on what you are saying.,if later you want to upgrade you can just do in-slot upgrade from 12600k to 13900k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

12600k + a-pro is a great combo.,the board is a bit finicky with super high frequency memory but it holds its own for a cheap board and has pretty decent voltage regulation relatively speaking.,iâ€™d say it really depends on what you like to play in regards to 12th gen vs 13th gen. the added cache def will help the raptor lake chips pull ahead a bit and they clock higher than alder lake.,if you like playing comp games make sure you grab some solid ddr4 (2x16 3200c14 prob best bang for buck) and tune it for optimal results.,either one would be a massive upgrade compared to what youâ€™ve got now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have a cpu cooler that is half as good as this one and i get 72 degrees at 100% cpu.,the noctua is actually overkill for a 12600k if you donâ€™t overlock it.,"i think  you reinstalled the fan incorrectly, the front fans have to push air in and the back fan has to push air out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this may sounds stupid but it's happen to allot of people ...did you peal the sticker off the cooler before putting the thermal paste?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've had a similar issue happening to mine but it was because i only had one fan in the back sucking the heat out and 2 fans in the front covered by a panel so heat was builting inside with barely any way out so eventually fried my mobo i switch cases for a cooler master td 500 mesh and i now have 3 fans in the front 3 pushing cool air trough the mesh and 3 fans on top pulling heat out and i have a cheap ass cpu cooler with 2 fans (push pull conf)  that's way smaller than what you have and my cpu temp don't exceed 60c during heavy load my cpu is an i9 9900k paired with a 1080 ti i game in 2k so my gpu is always at 100% usage blowing allot of heat but the case with the extra fans made the difference,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it can twist pretty easy, especially when the cpu has been hot so the thermal paste is more liquid state (?).","the cooler shouldn't be a problem and perhaps the best solution is to simply take it off and make sure it's sitting on correctly, you might want to repaste if you do take it off.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i agree with nru3â€™s assessment.,"i think you need to re-seat the cpu cooler (uninstall, reapply thermal paste, and reinstall it).","if the ram or side panel pushed the cooler out of position creating an air gap i would expect 100â°c, but otherwise donâ€™t see how the d15 could be performing this badly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah maybe stock who buys unlocked processor and doesn't  oc it  especially intel bc high clock speeds capability also he should of he hasn't get the contact frame for 12rh gen   thermal grizzly charges $60 what thermalright charges $13 for and without that setting it in socket then  boot up and its knowing some one of hand 20-30 c higher than it shoulda and was using a 420 rad liquid cooled or it would shut down..air cooling pff any way reset it and it dropped to low 20s and just git the thermalright socket which from the temp decrease is like a delid...easily hitting 5.4 ht on and ecores oced high aswell 5.5 ecores   disabled do that with air cooling.,regardless of what cooler you choose   id make the contact frame a priority will help your temps a lot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thank you for educating me.,i've never owned a noctua cooler but i know most air coolers do come with a protective sticker at least it seams noctua found a way around so that people don't commit that mistake by not having to remove any stickers at all i think that's cool in my opinion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what thermal paste are you using?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you donâ€™t run anything, and let it cool down, whatâ€™s the idle temperature?","does it take seconds to hit 100â°, or does the heat soak take minutes?",if your cpu is hot at idle and shoots to throttle temps quickly then that indicates bad thermal transfer into your cooler and has nothing to do with any fans.,if it takes 10min before reaching 100â°c then there might not be enough airflow.,iâ€™m a bit stumped that remounting your cooler didnâ€™t help tbh.,just mounting one fan backwards should not cause a d15 to throttle on your cpu without some overclocking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nice.. so one in the middle and one in the rear..

-	remount cooler (you did this already)
-	remove any sticker from the cold plate (ditto)
-	is your cooler mounting pressure good - watch a video showing the cooler install
-	check your voltages and make sure they are stock
-	does it still throttle with the side panel open?",-	are the cooler fins actually getting warm?,hopefully you uncover something!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"> it seems like the 13th gen is adding e-cores

because 13th gen is little more than 12th gen refresh.",adding more e-cores to try to stay on top of amd in multicore benchmarks.,it's easy changes.,maybe more cache?,basically to hold off amd until 14th gen (and the new node) is ready.,"> why wouldn't intel just hyper-thread the e-cores through software 

hyperthreading isn't software.",it's a hardware feature to enable the core to basically multitask.,it costs more transistors and complexity to add to the chip.,"but most importantly, smt/hyperthreading is used on ""big"" processors to make better use of their beefy pipeline which might otherwise not be fully saturated by a single thread.",a small efficient core in comparison should not have opportunity for such improvements.,"basically, if the core was actually improved by smt, i'd argue it wasn't really little/efficient to begin with.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'd love if they deleted the stupid e cores and bring back regular ones again.,"8 e cores that don't outperform 3 p cores and also end up taking more total power, ridiculous... not to mention compatibility issues with some software, that predecessed the mobile-turned-desktop menace, which is big.little.",cinebench and rendering gets way too much focus in architecture planning.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why not do both?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you mean for gaming?i keep seeing instances of ppl turning e-cores off for gaming because they either can cause stutters(lower 1%) or give worst performance.,"like i get that e-cores was how intel beat amd in multithreaded performance and the only reason they went with such a gimmicky feature (imo)

what i don't get is how they couldn't have added more p-cores to achieve the same thing instead of going the e-core route...

as someone looking to make a high end gaming pc and looking at these e-cores it makes me hesitate going intel (yes i know you can disable them)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

internet is free.",use it.,anandtech did many tests from particle simulation to web to software crysis rendering to handbrake to winrar/7-zip.,everything except rendering would show you e-core is about more than half of p-core performance.,e.g.,handbrake 8p8e is only just over 2x 8e.,cinebench on the other hand 8p8e  is about 4x 8e.,same with v-ray.,>cinebench and rendering gets way too much focus in architecture planning.,but of course you could only see cinebench.,"and funnily enough, if you had bothered to look at the results, you'd know it's not true.",cinebench and renderers actually puts e-core at 1/3 of p-core like you claimed.,nothing else.,"**you** are basing your options on cinebench, not everyone else.",dumbass.,"if intel based their decision on cinebench, they'd ditch e-core like amd.","but for productivity, e-core is actually very good.",consuming less than 1/3 the power while having 1/2 the performance.,"next time, grow a brain and use it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
almost 1 year after release we still have people like you spouting utter crap about e cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ipc isn't so important, but the lower clockspeed is.","a processor running at lower frequency has a relatively lower memory latency and branch mispredict penalty, so there are a lot fewer waiting cycles that ht can exploit to do useful work from another thread.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it will be very toasty and it would increase power consumption a lot , it could be done but this way they can ask the small cores that are slower to do background process without consuming a lot of power but once they need the big cores, they are capable but power hunger however it is not that big of an issue because the e core next to the p core are not that much increasing those power and thermal limits which allow those p core to focus on the big tasks while the smaller are busy in processes that we donâ€™t see",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why not just add p cores?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cost.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and you mfker might corelate scores with power draw budget and turbo boosting related to it.,"look at purepc testing that was free from fking up, e cores provide so little it's not even funny.","intels solution should have been providing more regular cores and artificially locking some of them to a lower frequency, they're great at stupidly restricting their products for end customer in the end.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
imaging looking objectively on a handicapped solution to a problem born from years of intels minimal effort in cpu design.,e cores bloody sucks at least for the moment and they're not even that efficient to begin with.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
honestly you're right.,at the moment 8 e cores doesn't really make much sense when you could have 10 p cores instead.,maybe in the future they go that route?,"i don't know, but so far all we know is that raptor lake is doubling the e cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks.,i didn't realize hyper-threading was so power intensive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"e-cores are still fairly power hungry, the main way they are efficient is die area.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel is not your average person.,they see that amd has 16 cores and aim to compete with that level of performance.,just because you think that 16 cores is threadripper levels of performance and unnecessary.,that doesn't mean intel sees higher core counts as unnecessary.,same way numbskulls were claiming core counts didn't matter when the ryzen 5 1600 was battering the i5 7600k.,i don't even know what to say.,even $300 consoles come with 8c 16t zen 2 chips now.,"the glory days of the pentium g3258, athlon x2's, and core2duo's are long behind us now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is a fair analysis.,but you also have to understand this is a long term decision.,was windows 11 a buggy mess?,yes.,did alder lake having it's teething issues?,also yes.,but once the software properly addresses the hybrid architectures; it's in for good.,this was going to be introduced at one point or another anyways.,since arm has been utilizing big.little designs for over a decade at this point.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it increases utilization of the hardware.,"if it enables you to increase utilization by 20%, then you will use 20% more power per core (and be 20% faster).","in that sense it is quite efficient, since usually power consumption goes up faster than performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"guess what, 1600 still gets hammered by 7700k in most cases, besides rednering.","zen cores are full cores, not handicapped crap, that e cores currently are and probably will remain.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're really optimistic if you think majority of main software players will actually do stuff to aid e cores operation.,"the only positive you're going to see, is e cores ipc improvement and nothing else.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they're not bad cores for the tasks they were meant to tackle.,"yeah the i7 7700k holds its own, but it's starting to hit 100% utilization in the latest games.",because believe it or not but windows itself is a resource hog.,"if i remember correctly when hardware unboxed benchmarked those lowly alder lake e-cores, they actually outperformed the 6700k in rainbow six seige.",but usually they performed around an i7 3770k in gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they may not even utilize them, but windows will, and they'll eventually get the scheduling down.","so even if your programs don't utilize them, at least they can still take a load off your p cores, and run the background os tasks instead.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and this is the basic misunderstanding related to e cores - people see cinebench scores and start fapping to e cores idea and glorifying ""oh, e cores are amazing, the future, the oh ah, please kill me so i can have more e cores"".","and they forget that cinebench and similar simply hammer the living sheit out of the cpu to a point, you get benefit from having more cores and not strictly by having e cores, which is also tangled around power limits of the cpu (see [purepc testing](https://www.purepc.pl/test-wydajnosci-rdzeni-p-core-i-e-core-w-procesorze-intel-core-i9-12900k-z-pamieciami-ddr5-patriot-venom?page=0,3)).","e cores bloody suck hard and they will continue to suck for a regular desktop pc, unless it's a prebuild with atrocious vrm on the motherboard, which e cores will sadly push trend towards.",launch a load that doesn't come close to raping a cpu and suddenly e cores have trouble keeping up with 4 cores from 5 generations ago (!!!,"), all while not even taking that much less power.",they're just bad.,here's to hoping amd will push through with muuuch better e cores and will make intel improve their sad seed of the technology.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the fact the e cores will enable the os to free up processes on the p cores seems to be the primary point all the fuds seem to either be missing or intentionally overlooking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hm wondering if i. can upgrade a laptop cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you use custom watercooling with multiple 360 rads?,if no then yes these temps are normal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nope, those temps are terrible for 200w.",even with my u12a i get better temps at 30c with 200w load.,contact frame might fix the issue,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i mean, this pry isnâ€™t going to be helpful, but as youâ€™ve mentioned youâ€™re running a dual 360mm radiator setup.","the only issue i can think of is a bad cooler mount, the pump failing, or an insane overclock",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no pressure between coldplate and ihs.,"if renounting won't help, invest in contact frame.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"minimum package power 34 watts, is that with all cores at 400 mhz?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s the contact pressure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is a custom loop.,two 360 rads (sr2).,"the liquid temps are great, even the rtx 3090 with a water block never goes above 60 deg c.  itâ€™s odd only some cores are that hot.","the average temps are fine, and thatâ€™s with the monitor recording when under stress and not idle.",i wonder if the temps are spiking for fractions of seconds and hence the reading?,does anyone have a 12900ks for comparison by chance?,"moreover, anyone know how to record how long certain temps are sustained for?",cheers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the reference.,iâ€™m going to have to check the mounting [pressure] again.,maybe itâ€™s time to upgrade to that new custom waterblock from ek.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"200 w, truly an insane overclock :d",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"no, itâ€™s not.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
interesting.,are you using one of these socket stabilisers?,the bending of the normal socket retention can screw up heat transfer from the heatspreader to the pump block.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have my 12900ks running 1.37v (1.305v under load die sense voltage) 5.5 ghz all core/4.4 ghz e cores and hottest core hits 82c.,if i leave it stock it gets mid to upper 80s on a few cores.,your temps seem high.,but it depends on how good your loop can transfer heat from the cpu to the block and then carried away by the water.,the fact your cpu isn't pulling more than 208w at absolute max means it's likely throttling.,i would manually dial in your clocks and voltages.,these cpus can pull a shit ton of power.,mine pulls close to 400w at my daily settings indicated above.,mine pulls around 440w running same temps as your cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends a lot on what you were running to hit those temps.,"something multithreaded like cinebench, yes normal.",gaming not so much.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

good gawd man!!!,toooo much... tooo much!!,also it's blue... at least you are using a contact frame... although i don't think its going to be as effective as you think with all that gooo..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

verge ass thermal paste application ðÿ’€,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thermal paste is suppose to be thin.,it is only meant to fill in the micro abrasions in the two plates so that it has a smooth surface.,the thicker it is between the ihs and heat sink the less it conducts the heat.,if it is too thick it will actually work as an insulator.,the easiest way to know if you have good coverage is to do your install then look at your individual core temps.,if there are one or more that are more than 2-4c higher than the rest it means that they are not covered properly with paste.,normally all cores at idle will be within 2-4c of each other with random cores jumping in temp as the system runs microcode but those are transients not regular higher temps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's a bit much but other then that good equal spread,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol you made me actually spit out my drink.,luckily that paste is thin.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
kinda frustrating when i asked about thermal paste spread and everyone comments about the amount that was used ðÿ™‚ like it really matters.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"cleanup is a pain, and depending on the paste over time (or from the  get go) it can be electrically conductive and if it gets to the right spot it can cause a short.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mainly just the expense,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is â€œover-tightenâ€ is there a specific torque value?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what's a bad spread?,don't think there's such a thing unless too little is used which doesn't cover the entire area.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you canâ€™t use too much paste unless it is physically spilling over the socket, only too little.",his coverage is good so the paste is doing its job and the temps will be fine.,"unless you are a system builder, paste is so cheap and you arenâ€™t going to use a full tube anyway with it being like $10, so who cares about the cost?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you want a little pumping out the sides.,the paste will pump out through regular use from the heat/cold cycling.,having paste already off to the side will help keep more paste inbetween the ihs and cold plate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i agree maybe slightly too much but who cares rectangle cpus can be difficult to paste and his looks great imo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there are a couple of spots where it looks like your ihs and heat sink are not properly aligned.,it is the section of the photo that shows smooth paste on the ihs and a mirror image on the heat sink.,ideally when you pull of the heat sink what you want to see is a bunch of spider veins.,no solid sections of paste.,if you see a solid section of paste it means that the two were not making ideal contact in that atea,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are over thinking it.,just look at it.,it's fully covered and will perform as expected.,"and yeah, you did use way too much paste which if anything is wasteful and messy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if i had to guess you're wondering about the pattern of the spread where it looks to be slightly more heavy in the middle?,my thoughts are that it's more of the dynamics of the paste material on a physical level rather than implying your cpu is concave.,"i'm thinking about how you pull apart melty cheese, thermal paste doesn't have that same stretch, but it is still a sticky paste and i could see it pooling in the center of mass as the heat sink is coming off before the two completely separate.","i could be completely wrong though, this is just what comes to mind seeing the pic.",the spread looks good to me though imo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"essentially this is a contact frame, instead of using the stock cpu holder thing, that actually can cause the cpu to become concaved and lead to uneven touching between my water block and the cpu.",so this contact frame allows the cpu to sit perfectly as is and make the most contact as possible with the block.,"i refuse to compromise when iâ€™m paying 600 bucks for a cpu i want all the performance and the best temps, but regardless of whatever little mod i do to this cpu it will always run hot..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
reminds me of gn's use of thermal grizzly in their sponsor spots haha,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"reddit sometimes makes me want to pull my hair out 98% of comments are about the amount of paste 
1% are ppl trolling and the other 1% are people who actually are answering my question.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"that's for older intel cpus, these new ones have more surface area.",they need a bit more than that.,too much is better than too little as nothing bad can really happen other than a mess to clean,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i watched the gamer nexus video, followed everything to their exact specifications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s what i was trying to figure out but everyone is clearly obsessed with the amount of thermal paste i usedâ€¦.,they should come over to my house and apply it for me because clearly i have no idea what iâ€™m doing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because itâ€™s dependent on the purpose and application.,and idc what anybody says iâ€™m not putting a pea size amount on a cpu that pulls 250+ watts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah and now my cpu wonâ€™t boot because i used way to much thermal paste ðÿ™‚.,i forgot to read the manual that came with my paste that told me about how much i should use.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you used too little, it won't spread enough to cover sufficient area.",so the amount really does matter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i get you, its like all of them still stuck in boomer era of computer.","""only pea size of thermal paste is enough"" which is only true for small ass ihs.",you can never know what is the exact amount you're going to need for this huge ihs.,"if they're really fussy about it, they can always experiment with it themself to find out how much is enough for 12th gen. which is going to involve a lot of try and error.",i rather have a little bit spilled on the side than non cause then i'll know for sure it covers every single part of the ihs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the spread is kind of lacking in the middle, which is the most important place to have good coverage.","the cpu die is mostly where there's a decent layer of thermal paste left on the ihs, and slightly lower.","paste coverage on the edges doesn't really make much much difference in terms of temperatures, the most important place to get good contact is the shortest route from the cpu die.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your spread doesn't matter if you use so much paste.,the thickness of the layer will impede the flow of heat.,"having said that, since it's all just oozed out of the sides and that ooze isn't touching any components, you're good.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"itâ€™s very controversial, some will say you didnâ€™t use enough, some will say too much.",its a topic that shouldnâ€™t be controversial but it is.,to me it looks average and it looks pretty good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean the issue is just the cost even though its cheap its still an uneccesary expense if you use alot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why would you get a conductive thermal paste in the first place?,"if that is the problem, maybe you should educate yourself on the ingredient of the thermal paste you are buying",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bruh it's cheap af.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how expensive can it be?,can i get an extra single stick of ram out of it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, i don't know the value, but you can put too much pressure on the componets if you over do the tightening.",you can actually damage the mb or cpu pins this way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
make sure you use the right plastic spacers/barrels through the screws.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if your cpu isnâ€™t failing to boot or you arenâ€™t having crazy memory issues like not hitting the ram spec (within reason) like 3600mhz then you are fine.,if you buy 4dimms rated at say 4800mhz ddr4 donâ€™t expect to hit those speeds lol not without a lot of voltage tweaking know how.,but a good indicator is when you have ram issues at normal speeds,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"plenty of attributes constitute as a ""bad spread"".","* not enough thermal compound so it's just spread way too thin or not enough so it doesn't cover the ihs
* not applied even pressure via: the heatsink (especially with an aio) and the thermal compound has not spread evenly, and it's lumped in one half of the cpu, one corner etc

and so on, the list goes on really.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i bought 2 huge tubes of mx-4 years ago and was super stingy about using it, never using enough.","years later, those tubes of paste were expired and performing horribly on repastes so i ended up throwing away about 66% of it.",won't make that mistake again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"don't waste the paste, man, you don't want a taste of the difficulties faced when you need more paste with haste.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if that was my cpu i would sand that flat after a year of use.",i say a year because id wait for any warranty issue to show up or intel to issue an erratum report/recall(which hasnt been done since what 94?,with the fpu),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as much as i love the comments about the amount of thermal paste application, thatâ€™s not what i made this post about i wanted to know if it looked like the cpu and cpu water block was making proper contact based off of the spread of the thermal paste.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s been proven that the â€œxâ€ method is by far the best.,it has the best spread and creates the least amount of air bubbles.,"the spread method has the same spread coverage, but it has a lot more air bubbles.","so just do the â€œxâ€ method, itâ€™s way easier and better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
still like double what you needed lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
im not telling you to do the following im just explaining the whole solution and why it works.,"the only thing left to do thatll help with the high temperatures is sanding the ihs as your central portion is the lowest part of the ihs which means a thicker layer of thermal paste is what's transferring heat there and thermal paste transfers heat like crap compared to bare metal were talking 12w/mk for good stuff 15 for the new alaphcool stuff and 78w/mk for liquid metal but do you wanna know what bare copper is?\*

its like 400w/mk so the closer you can get the metals to touch and the less paste to need between them will net you the most performance.",[one guy took this to the extreme and actually rung his ryzen and waterblock.,"](https://youtu.be/sqw20rhvprw)

\* (oh and most of those companies lie about the w/mk and are really only comparable within their own paste line as its really determined by their testing equipment as its apples to apples on the same gear oh and by their equipment of course im talking about the chemical company that mixed up the compound for these companies selling it with a brand on it)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"also, you can use a swiss army knife that hopefully has a screwdriver to scrape off the exceeding paste and lick it off the knife!",yum yum!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dude get over it already.,"just look at the spread, itâ€™s ok. 

itâ€™s also a bit too much of paste.","and yes, the quantity of paste matters because if you put too little it wonâ€™t cover the heat sink fully.",iâ€™m saying this because i read you were saying quantity doesnâ€™t matter.,it does if you put too little.,it also does if you put way too much.,"and it definitely definitely does if you use liquid metal, which thankfully here you are not.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">boomer

what's a boomer?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it looks like that is the area with the highest contact pressure so the paste is naturally going to move out of that area.,and it is hard to know what's going on before you take the block off.,the twisting action when you remove the block can wipe paste to the sides.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it will not impede heat transfer at least with the amount that iâ€™ve used,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its not controversial at all.,you just need as thin a layer covering the entire contact area as possible.,too much will have a lot of paste oozing out the sides.,too little will have uncovered spots.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the cost?,do you know how cheap is thermal paste compared to the other component?,even the most expensive thermal paste wont make a dent to your bank account if you can afford a computer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"liquid metal is very good at conducting heat, but itâ€™s also very good at conducting electricity.",but the type of person to use liquid metal probably knows what theyâ€™re doing.,however thereâ€™s multiple pastes that become conductive with age and many people donâ€™t pay attention to that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
may be cheap for you but not for everyone if you use half a tube you're basically pissing away money even though it's cheap it's still an unneeded expense spend 10 dollars on a tube and use half of it on 1 cpu that says 4 dollars gone if you can paste 10 cpu's out of 1 tube.,use your head just because it's cheap doesn't mean it doesn't add up do that on 5 computers thats 20 dollars gone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you really don't know how to use your brain dude think about it say someone uses half a tube of thermal compound on 1 cpu that's 4-5 dollars right there.,when the true expense could be 1 dollar if you use the pea size or grain of rice basing this on a small tube of arctic silver where you can get about 10 cpu repastes out of a tube.,so say you spend 10 dollars on a small tube of paste if you use more even though it's 10 dollars for a tube you won't have to buy another tube when you go to repaste saving you that expense.,and not everyone gets free shipping on those tubes.,meaning the expense goes up even though it's a small expense it's still an expense.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this comment is the way.,honestly.,i sometimes even go as far as to just untigjten everything and just check that the thermal paste has coated and spread evenly on the block and the heat spreader of the processor and just put it back on.,i do this if it's my first time working with a new cooling solution.,the arctic freezer ii is nice because it has standoffs and a nut to tighten over the top of the clamps.,and once you start feeling resistance you just stop tightening.,love my setup and that aio.,10900k is a hard bugger to cool in some cases.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

your spread is fine its just that your cpus ihs is quite even save for the concave center and the aid of the bracket keeping it flat that its splurging out try spreading it thinner.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tbh iâ€™d remove all the paste and retry it with a single line down the center and using less lol i donâ€™t get how the cpu has excess in the center and cooler doesnâ€™t have paste in the middle with how much you applied even with light pressure the stuff is sticky.,youâ€™re gonna want to make sure you clean up all the extra thermal paste on the board itâ€™s gonna like bad and gets everywhere,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

good temps!,i was having 100c with a aorus waterforce x 360!,"returned the aio and ordered a deepcool ls720, it should arrive by monday, letâ€™s see how it behaves!",i had also ordered the bcf from aliexpress.,i believe my ihs surface maybe already bent :/.,"our pcs are similar, except my gpu is a 3090ti, but i donâ€™t believe it should matter on i9 temps.",on stock clock i couldnâ€™t keep it below 100c on xtu stress test.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

?,wtf are you saying.,"i said he used too much and try using a line of paste and less than what he used which will still get him enough coverage for the entire ihs since it spreads when the cooler is mounted

4.7ghz is all core boost if you want more overclock it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you bought a z690 and a 12700kf why not just go oc it manually to 4.9 or 5 all core?,should be easy enough.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

im confused on why it would randomly just start only going to 4.7 under load and be 4.8-9 when basically idle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what does yours run at when youâ€™re doing light tasks?,mine is always on 4.9. i think my cpu came over clocked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
says enough about him when he's using user benchmark which is basically showing him his 1 core boost in the old screenshot and then the all core boost in the new screenshot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's how cpu boosting works read a little.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so then why 17 days ago the cpu had an average speed of 4.95 but now its 4.7. back then i had nothing changed in my bios and same applies now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bottom line: stock all core boost for the 12700k is 4.7ghz.,4.9ghz will be seen on light low-threaded workloads.,5.0ghz may be seen only on specific favoured cores in single threaded workloads.,"anything else will require overclocking, despite what that old screenshot shows.",one feature that may exist on your board is tvb or â€œthermal velocity boostâ€ overclocking which can add 0.1 or 0.2ghz to all maximum boost speeds but only when the cpu is below a certain temperature (65 degrees i think).,"also, userbenchmark sucks and is probably just being unreliable in the old screenshot.",run cinebench r23 and see if you score is in line with expectations.,"and, if it isnâ€™t, run hwinfo64 during that test and keep an eye on temperatures, throttling status, cpu power consumption and so forth, so you can get an idea of where the issue lies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12 gen intel boosts at different speeds depending on how many processors are in use.,my guess is that you have more processes using resources and causing more cores to be active.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is expected - all the first time builders that built right before covid (those that bought the budget amd 3000 series) and during covid (those that bought/upgraded to the overpriced 5000 series) finally realized you don't need to upgrade your cpu every single generation lol.,"(take note, if you own a 5600x, you don't need to move onto a 7600x just yet!)","keep supply high/demand low and we won't have a repeat with so-called supply issues, scalpers, and the likes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is something your wallet and bank account decides,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

depends on what games you play and what video card you have.,"for a lot of games, you will likely be gpu bound unless you have a 3090 or similar card.","in which case, it won't make much of a difference if you get 12th gen or 13th gen cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if you are happy with what you use now for the next 3 months and are happy to spend a little bit more then wait.,i am waiting only because i can.,"13gen will be quicker, if you want ddr5 it supports faster before overclocking, it will be the latest and greatest for a year (important to some people), should last slightly longer before feeling old and slow, z790 could support pcie5 ssds, (although really who needs that), next gen gpus will hopefully have landed by then as well.","also makes some great number combinations:

"it actually just needs to adjust the lower end cpus, since the 12900k and 5950x multi core performance is already about the same, so they donâ€™t have to catch up nothing except single core and mid-lower end cpus, and considering the new architecture will be renewed from the ground up, i expect a very big improvement.","also, another important thing is the efficiency, something that amd still is on top in the x86 market.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most multi core benchmarks don't last long enough to fully heat up a cpu on air let alone water.,"for true multi core performance, no one is going to know until we see zen 4 in the wild and subjected to sustained abuse.",zen 4 may end up winning in multi core for content creation in real world applications if amd is telling the truth about pet efficiency.,"if amd is embellishing then no, they can't compete against even a down clocked 13th gen part after it's heat soaked.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

do you have the proper drivers installed?,"i have an asus laptop, also iris xe graphics but g1, and windows just keeps on resintalling my drivers.","luckily they don't cause any major issues for me (besides the control panel not working), may not be the same for you though.",try going to the manufacturers website for your model and download the graphics drivers.,might fix it for a week or two before windows reinstalls them again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you sure that cooler mounted correctly?,or is there even adequate thermal paste to begin with,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"also, a -0.175 undervolt is massive and likely to cause severe system instability when under any high load.","surfing and games may not trigger that, but if you crash or bluescreen or get weirdness, just know thatâ€™s the cause.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well the first thing you should have done is remount the cooler with new paste.,it's obviously not making proper contact.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
while youâ€™re removing the cooler to add better thermal paste itâ€™s probably worth trying a contact frame.,seems like socket 1700 can be hit and miss for surface contact and if youâ€™re one of the unlucky ones with unexplained high temps the contact frame might help.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's crazy.,my 11700k doesn't hit that at idle...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your cooler is not working.,just do yourself a favour and get a [proper cooler](https://noctua.at/en/nh-u14s) so you never have to hear your computer fan.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
get the noctua nh-u12a with 2 fans.,then you can disable stuff in bios like bluetooth and sata drives you dont use and wifi if you use lan cable.,"the more you disable in bios the lower temps., but you can try google ur board and how to lower bios temps",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea double checked the mounting and all the pins clicked in place.,the cooler came with thermal paste already on and it looked like a good amount.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i just set my offset undervolt for my 12700k to -0.140 and left the core voltage on auto on my msi z690 tomahawk mobo, iâ€™ve run a heaps of r23 tests back to back and also a 10 minute one and all seems fine with a score of 1927 singlecore and 22701 multicore and had a max power draw of 123w and my temps went down from 85c to 65c, would you say this undervolt would be fine?",havenâ€™t encountered anything bad yet lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pins clicked?,you running an intel stock cooler?,thereâ€™s an issue with intels socket bending which could add problems but if you actually double checked the mounting by removing it adding new thermal paste and remounting it might really just come down to the cooler not adding adequate pressure on top of being most stock coolers being junk plus a flexing intel ihs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea im running intel stock cooler.,ill look into getting a better cooler or it may be my case as it doesn't have the best airflow.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"bending intel cpu, bad cooler, no airflow could all add to one problem.",its not absolutely necessary but it would likely add to whatever cooling (like 5c+ cooler) you'd get you could spend $10 for a thermal right cpu contact frame off ebay.,its not hard to swap it out but it could be easy to make a mistake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

for sure!,"i have an i7 3770 currently in my rig and its ok at games, but really struggles with editing, thats one of the main reasons i bought it.",its a budget beast,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"don't sell this short, the i5-12400 is a mid-range cpu that intel priced accordingly - unlike amd severely overcharging for their chips in the same range.",in my humble opinion a 'budget beast' would be more like the i3-12100 and its variations.,"the 12th gen i3 is tiered low coming in at like $100 bucks and able to move an rtx 3090 without issue, basically performing like its a $250 dollar chip.",i like to call it the hobbit among cpus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you're missing the editing portion.,imho the i3 is out of the question for that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would consider the b660 plus if i had the case for it.,"my current case is matx so it wont fit, with this upgrade im going to change out my motherboard, i already have the case and the gpu for it, but since i have an older generation motherboard, i cant reuse ram, since its ddr3 making this upgrade much harder.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh for sure, i wouldn't even consider anything outside an i5 12400 for cpu intensive tasks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well if you manage getting a new case go with the plus otherwise you're still not bad to go.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i really doubt i will get a new case, since this upgrade is really skimming my budget (ill have to sell my current cpu on second hand just to get enough money for the ram/motherboard, so ill be left without a computer until the parts arrive).","also i preffer having a tiny bit of a smaller computer and i doubt ill really need the features that the board comes with since all i do is basically watch youtube videos, play some games and video edit, but thank you for the suggestion!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"then you've already drawn yourself a route, if it's so the b660 you chose isn't much better than a h610.",try a h610 it's cheaper.,you're not using an i7 anyways i5 is fine with mobos.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

>displayport over thunderbolt 4 supports up to 40 gbit/s of display bandwidth.,thunderbolt 4 has barley anything to do with it.,these are all displayport features.,what you need is an output with hbr3 displayport speeds.,but most manufacturers do not make this explicit (you may need to check the max resolution against what is possible with which speed.,"if it is possible with the old hbr2 speeds, like 4k60, you can bet the port is of the slower / older hbr2 variant).","intels igpus from 11th gen onward support hbr3, but the mainboard/notebook still has to support it.",the other required feature dsc is also supported by 11th gen onwards.,"but since its more of a software / internal feature, board manufacturers cannot screw it up, so it should always be available, even when the manufacturer does not state it explicitly.","the only thing that a tb4 certification does, is guarantee that hbr3 is supported, other than that it has nothing to do with it.","&#x200b;

also you cannot utilize the whole 40g bandwidth for one displayport connection.",that will still be limited to the standard hbr3 limit of \~25.9gbit/s.,"and using 2 dp connections in concert is an entirely different can of worms...

should just work under the same conditions (hbr3 + dsc in most cases).",it may cost you one additional display pipeline though.,"so that this counts as 2 displays towards the igpus total limit of concurrently supported screens  (3 for rocket lake, 4 for tiger lake, alder lake).","although, together with video or hdr processing, the igpu may come to its processing limits at those speeds, which could lead to stuttering, depending on what you do.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

> you cannot utilize the whole 40g bandwidth for one displayport connection.,"that will still be limited to the standard hbr3 limit of ~25.9gbit/s

thanks for the clarification.",i did not fully realize that the full 40 gbit/s of the thunderbolt 4 link could not be used for display (or at least not a single display).,"i think what confused me was [this video](https://youtu.be/qb9u4f0p6oy?t=1501) i watched which has a chart showing 4k120 *without* dsc for usb4/tb4, but looking back now i think he might just be referring to the *potential* of the bandwidth provided by a usb4/tb4 link (as opposed to it being usable today).","okay, so basically 4k120 over thunderbolt 4 means dp hbr3 + dsc, which i was not aware of.","and in fact i was just able to confirm right now using cable matter's firmware tool (which can also be used to get detailed information about the signal): yep, sure enough, it's hbr3+dsc.","it's a bit of a shame to be forced to use dsc on a cable that has the capacity to do away with it, but it doesn't really seem noticeable (definitely fooled me during my tests!)",so fair enough i guess.,another thing that confused me a bit: i keep reading that hbr3 can do 4k120 8bpc without dsc.,and [calculators claim](https://linustechtips.com/main/topic/729232-guide-to-display-cables-adapters-v2/?section=calc&h=3440&v=1440&f=120&calculations=show&formulas=show) that 4k120 8bpc is 25.82 gbit/s which is just within the hbr3 data rate limits.,"but clearly that's not happening here, so what's going on?","well here's the thing: at 4k120 8bpc, the firmware tool says i'm pushing 1188 mpixels/sec through the link.",but the calculators assume 1075 mpixels/sec for that mode.,"as it turns out, it's down to the timing format: the calculators assume cvt-rb2 which presumably makes sense for dp, but hdmi devices would use cta-861.","and sure enough, if i select cta-861 in the calculator, the data rate requirement jumps to 28.51 gbit/s which is clearly above hbr3 capacity.","okay so that makes sense, although it seems very silly that hbr3 can't do 4k120 when connected to a cta-861 device just for that reason.",but then that means that when connected to a cvt-rb2 device (i.e.,"a pc monitor), hbr3 can, in fact, do 4k120 without dsc, right?","jeez this stuff is subtle :( 

now i'm wondering if the reason why the lenovo and sabrent adapters are having issues is because maybe they don't support dsc.","i don't think that fully explains it though, because with intel gpu driver 30.0.101.1692 i could definitely get a picture at 4k120 rgb 4:4:4 and *even at 10-bit* - that's a whooping 35.64 gbit/s.","granted it was not completely stable, but if it was using hbr3 without dsc it seems like it would have been completely unable to switch into this mode in the first place, right?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so i decided that ultimately i want to power this optiplex ultra via usb-c pd... so i ordered a cable matters displayport to hdmi adapter and put that in play instead.,120hz is still working - so evidently as suspected dell's documentation is wrong and the displayport on the 3090 ultra does support hbr3 (which makes sense since it's dp 1.4)?,running happily at 120hz with dp-->hdmi and usb-c pd.,a little annoying to lose my sole usb-c port just for power but i suppose no way around that other than using a dock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> in fact, do 4k120 without dsc, right?",yep.,and you were far quicker than anybody else in picking up the relevance of video timings.,"just fyi, very similar problem with 2xhbr3 and 4k60 (with cea its above the available bandwidth of most usb-c hubs that only use half of a hbr3 connection).","so active dp to hdmi 2.0 adapters can change the video-timings on the fly so you can make do without dsc, but still have cea timings on the other side.","but the bandwidth that is saved, is there to support the various surround sound formats of hdmi, so that makes it very unreliable in which combinations you can still use uncompressed surround with those active dp to hdmi 2.0 adapters.","&#x200b;

>lenovo and sabrent adapters are having issues is because maybe they don't support dsc

at least the lenovo dock actively mentions dsc support and so far all adapters i have seen use that to achieve 8k60 etc.","i think this is just down to first generation, buggy chipsets, same with the avrs with hdmi 2.1 etc.","&#x200b;

maybe they will also get firmware fixes...

&#x200b;

>it's a bit of a shame to be forced to use dsc on a cable that has the capacity to do away with it

thunderbolt / usb4 is basically transparent to gpus and monitors.",it just acts like a displayport cable.,"(which gets really fun, when you go over the combinations of the 2 dp connections you can have).","so right now, on either end of the connection you have an actual, physical displayport signal that therefore would still be bandwidth limited, even if tb could maybe surpass those limits with just a firmware update.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that sounds pretty bad if itâ€™s literally instant.,"but then again, 250w is 250wâ€¦ also, if you messed up something like thermal paste application, thereâ€™s no way youâ€™d drop it down to below 100c even with undervolting.","edit: just read your other reply that it only got up to 80w before throttling, tell us these things!",they are important details!,"this changes things, as it indicates more towards you doing something wrong, an obvious bet would be thermal paste or mounting.",you should probably check that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"in many , or well most - cases, the additional fans - usually pull - as you want push first for efficiency - do not add that mach - or , in the worst case, make it worse due to creation of more turbulence and thereby worsening the airflow.","most important still for watercooling is the radiator itself (beside the pump ofc) - the surface area size (more surface where the heat can radiate away (convection), the material and a well designed layout of the radiator.",in my case for example (using high performance fans).,"you can also experience that with high rpm fans sometimes - after a certain rpm value the cooling doesnt increase any further, it just creates more noise - because you can only transport heat away that is erradiated from the radiator - and there's quite a delay from the cpu to the fan - as the heat has to switch between different media multiple times : from cpu via thermal compund to another plate into the water and then through the radiator into the air.","and of course, the water needs to get pumped first into the radiator.","if you have a proper airflow that transports the erradiated heat away from the rad efficiently, which, especially in such a case where the distance between intake and exhaust fan(s) is quite short, is usually achieved, then an additional layer on the other side wont bring any real benefit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

who was it again who made up the stuff about tsmc 3nm in meteor lake?,intel hasnâ€™t announced anything like that as far as i know.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mtl was never going to use n3.,always n5.,n3 was for arrow lake.,the igpu is a xe lpg based on alchemist with 128eu(8 xe cores) and fabbed on n5(or variant).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"it's interesting to see how this has warped when it was originally based on digitimes ""rumors"", which just may as well be lies at this point considering multiple earthshattering flipflops within weeks of each other.",first it was n3 having yield issues requiring waiting for n3e with loosened density but better yield.,then it was intel 4 being broken and not ready until 2024 with intel begging tsmc to delay orders.,then apparently both intel 4 and n3 were right on schedule.,"now we're back to n3 being severely delayed and intel having validation problems, which also sounds like a lie considering intel's client team has gone as far as backporting an entire architecture last minute and still managed to ship on schedule, compared to their server team that can't ship anything on time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and since refuted by both tsmc and intel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm sure some other fiction writers will chime in soon, they typically do once a topic get going.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"intel's own slides mentioned ""n3 external"" as the the node used for mtl tgpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm pretty skeptical just because meteor lake is only a little over a year out.,seems pretty late to redesign unless they're going to push back the launch of the gpu tile parts (which to be fair might launch after the desktop series anyway).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you were planning on buying a new laptop because the igpu was going from garbage to just bad?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,they did mention n3 external because they were referring to mtl and arl.,unless you believe mtl is also fabbed on 20a.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the tiled layout would give exactly this sort of flexibility, but i don't see how tsmc would have given intel the flexibility to delay production after they've dumped a lot of capital into a dedicated fab.",makes it seem like a tsmc problem with hitting timelines.,"also, this puts the big-tgpu version originally leaked as arl halo, then leaked as an mtl release, back to arl.",quite curious.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'm citing the previous rumor as the op planned to buy a laptop with it before the new rumor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"node alone doesnâ€™t give performance improvement, they can choose to use the higher density to save on die area if they want to, and use the improved power/transistor to lower the peak power draw, that doesnâ€™t say anything on its own.","architecture is up for anyone to speculate, but remember that massive hype for amdâ€™s rdna2 igpu?",ended up 680m being 70-80% ahead of vega 8 at same power.,"thatâ€™s an amazing gain, not even enough to catch a 35w 1650 max q from 2019 though.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i often am plugged and on battery when im on the go.,is there a difference?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah is the 10600kf i left a letter out.,ok so you are saying that the tdp matters.,ill check that out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, by default it's probably not set to high performance mode.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
on a lot of laptops performance is reduced when on battery.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"by default, laptops switch to a battery effciency mode while on battery on the operating system.","beside that, usually also every throttable hardware will throttle to maximize the timespan you can run on battery.","if you want the maximum performance your system can offer, plug it in.","you can of course also disable the battery efficiency mode on the operating system,  but still, most notebooks have some sort of an internal mechanism too, activating power limit while running on battery.","depends on the system, if you can disable this - for sure i know from my gaming notebook, that i cannot use its full gpu power on battery - also not maximum cpu power - it requires 2 x power connections to run at full power - even when i disable all power saving mechanisms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you really donâ€™t want so-called high performance mode on a laptop.,thatâ€™s going to cause bad battery life and unnecessary heat generation when doing nothing.,however if the laptopâ€™s running windows 11 you can customize how the hybrid cores are prioritized.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
first off uninstall xtu and reset your bios settings.,"then, on gigabyte boards you start off with auto llc & fixed voltage mode at 1.2v, and keep stepping that down to the lowest stable point of voltage + 1 step up for safety",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"use throttlestop, b560 have really stupid voltage control restrictions and xtu is garbage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had the exact combination.,i undervolted in bios because xtu was giving me problems.,"take a look at the images shared below : 

https://imgur.com/a/tkypmfb",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i tried to undervolt on the msi b560m pro-e, but you can't make a voltage offset greater than 50 mv for some reason",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you manage to undervolt?,i have the same combination and none of the undervolts i apply are stable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"throttlestop makes my system freeze for some reason, i cant even keep 10mv negative offset",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
xtu doesn't work,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">as giving me proble

is it stable across all workloads?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i tried these settings but can't go past 50mv

bad silicone lottery i suppose?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to go below the -50mv use  llc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you apply like 25mv it will undervolt, but sadly i can't go any higher than 25mv for some reason.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it probably applies from base voltage, not vid.",you need to fiddle a bit and find to see what voltage it uses.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's what i was saying.,xtu is dumb sometimes.,better to uninstall xtu and throttlestop.,go to bios and set a negative vcore offset value.,the images i shared above are the ones from my bios.,edit : from the images you can see that i set an offset of 120 which corresponds to -120mv undervolt.,i suggest you start from 25mv and slowly work your way up.,at each step run prime 95 and any other benchmark to check stability.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i did not use xtu.,"i uninstalled it, then set the undervolt in bios using vcore offset.","i tested in prime95, aida64 fpu stress and cinebench r20 for stability.",aida64 fpu and p95 ran for over an hour without pc crashing.,and the programs and games i play were stable as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, i think that is the limit of your cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what's voltage llc?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
got it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i did try 25mv and my cinnebench score dropped by 1000 points in multi core,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
turns out none of my undervolts are stable?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
v core llc or just plain llc.,depending on your motherboard the langue may change.,but it's basically the voltage curve that your motherboard uses for your cpu.,once you set-50mv as max for alot of boards on the 11400f you can slowly tweak down and test stability with llc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'd advise to tick unlock adjustable voltage and on adaptive voltage set an offset ot +0.3 v (300 mv), apply and check voltage in hwinfo after hitting pc with cinebench (r15 as a light load, just to move cpu from energy saving).","you will not burn or kill the cpu, it might get kinda warm if it'd apply from vid.",afterwards simply keep the slider going until you find a working offset.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you have any power limits set ?,try changing the long term power limit to 154w or higher.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i see, will check what it's called on the b560m aorus pro.","unfortunately, undervolting via the dynamic vcore makes me bsod, so i've cleared the undervolt :/",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hmm setting -50mv on a offset voltage setting causes a bsod?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hmm it may be possible 50mv was to much did you ever attempt 25mv?,it could just be your chip doesn't do well with lower then stock voltage.,but it could also be something else.,you can see if you find llc and play with that but it may be a similar result,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"same, i tried 20 mv as well.",thanks though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not overclocked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
check your mount and thermal paste application then i guess,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you might have mce on by default on the mobo which will auto overclock the cpu very badly and cause such high temps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok i try now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeh try removing the block and looking to see if it looks like good contact was made.,you can kinda tell by areas with more paste than others indicates not  great even contact.,try tighten the block a bit more if so and do in a figure 8 style install.,"as in screw all 4 gradually rather than tightening up one corner and moving round, thatâ€™ll create uneven pressure",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i notice that the 4 big screw of the block are ok but the 4 smaller screw are slitly moved and the screw have to be screwed not straight, can this be the problem?",also when i removed the block the thermal paste was not equal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
erm thatâ€™s not ideal.,i havenâ€™t used the ek monoblock so iâ€™m not too sure.,the main screws around the cpu should be the ones to worry about though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
disable intel rst in bios.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tbh when that happens it usually because of something broke during creating install media.,"when i have that issue, i recreate the installation media using the same drive or a different one.","maybe check the iso hash and redownload it just to see if it match

that driver issue is really weird.","even if i point it to the right inf residing in windows own image, it simply ignore it.",afaik it's been a long time the installer had that issue.,it's just the workaround is to create the installation media again.,"at least with iso + rufus it seldom happens, and the overall process is way faster than media creation tool",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how old is the installation media?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what the heck is â€œthe typical driver errorâ€?,driver for what?,what are you trying to do and what exactly does it say?,if it is indeed talking about â€œvmdâ€ then may i ask why you have that enabled?,you donâ€™t say anything about what kind of system this is.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"considering the trouble with the software gamers nexus pointed out and:

3060 was overpriced from the start and it's end of gen

if they ever get their drivers sorted these would make pretty good cards.,i gotta give props to intel on a solid first attempt at a modern graphics card.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there are *no* rumors that intel is ""attempting to sell the gpu division"".",there are some analysts that are suggesting that that might be a good idea (although that is *far* from a prevailing idea by analysts.,">and possibly cancel the release altogether

nobody is suggesting that *alchemist* will be canceled.",there is one rumor that intel was *contemplating* if they should shelve the gaming dgpu development due to the costs.,alchemist is more or less already paid for.,the chips are designed and built.,all they are hung up on is software and driver development.,it would make absolutely zero sense to cancel the release of alchemist.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

\-how much 3060/6600xt class cards will still be on the market

\-if intel figures out their drivers ([gn video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjyset-t5uk)) 

\-how much faster 70 class cards would be, if 7700/4070 would be around 3090 at 450-500$ not many people would be tempted by a750 (3060 performance) at 300$.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"intel will improve dx11 performance, but when???",it took amd 15years to finally fully dx11 performance (which happened now).,even if intel magically could be able to fully fix it in 5years... - 2027 - at that time arc a750 will already be a fossil compared to 2027 gpu generations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for sure they good have commanded a better price last year.,but i think amd and nvidia just will restrict supply of the lower end cards to keep the prices up.,they canâ€™t sell these low cards at the margins they need.. so i bet we see a new card wall for say the 6600 at 250-270 and thatâ€™s where the 750 will settle as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wait and see what, i just told you, you're talking up their ability to deliver when talking about a product that has seen massive delays already.","if someone delivers a chip well over a year late you can't use it as proof of their ability to get things shipped, it's evidence of the opposite.","the only question, as with almost everything intel since broadwell and their first 14nm chips... which were delayed, is how late it will be.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it absolutely matters.,a set launch date says here is the performance you can get at this date for this price.,it makes it an actual launch.,this is just numbers that intel chose in a chart that really raises more questions than it answers.,why are they deliberately hiding non dx12 games?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that's working correctly.,there's no reason for cores which have no assigned task to be running at the maximum boost frequency.,"same with games, if there's not enough work to do the cpu will step down the frequencies to power save at no cost to you.",i'm betting on your computer with the 12900k has more background bloatware running that prevent the computer from idling often at all.,(do you see the frequency drop to its lowest speed often on that one?,should be 400mhz or 800mhz) that or you have a better graphics card which keeps the 12900k busier.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
asus b560 strix a. vrm is at 64c when running the tests.,thank you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what youâ€™re seeing on your 12900k is not what i see on mine.,your 11900kâ€™s behavior is more normal.,cores typically only boost when needed.,"one core doing something, only one core clocks up.","8 cores working, 8 cores clock as necessary.","and they will always vary according to actual momentary need, even in a game.",what are your power plan settings?,p.s.,â€œbase clockâ€ is not actually a thing.,"the cpu does not sit at the base clock and, when idle, should downclock much further (like as low as 400mhz for the 12900k).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
both computers typically have about 138 processes running.,the 12900k system has a 3080ti 64gb of ram.,this 11900k has 16gb and a 3070.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
power draw seems a tad low.,check bios settings for cpu performance mode.,what cooler are you running?,get hwinfo64 i donâ€™t know how accurate cpuid is.,thermals seem low but if you are on a 360 aio plausible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"power plan is balanced, the screenshot where all cores are above 4.7ghz is with performance power plan.",when the system is idle under balanced it goes down to 798mhz.,with performance it never idles.,in any case the cinebench scores i am getting seem to be normal.,as previously noted it just seemed weird since it not normally what i see.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have it undervolted -.100v.,vcore maxes at 1.378v.,it will draw 205w in the all core test.,cpu cooler is the thermalright peerless assassin se120.,peak temp at full tilt-1hour cinebench all core is 80c.,iâ€™m actually quite impressed with the cooler but iâ€™m going off on a tangent.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sorry, was more asking about the 12900k system.",i think your 11900k is normal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
try looking at the behavior without the undervolt.,sounds like a good tower cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™ll have to check, here is a small 17sec video of the cpu getting as low a 3.5ghz momentarily.",https://youtu.be/r_bfdsddlww,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™ll check it out thank you for your help.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, but the utilization there is only 13-30%.",thatâ€™s how speed scaling works on modern cpus: itâ€™s smart enough to clocks itself based on the actual workload needs many times a second.,"you can force it to run at maximum clocks at all times by setting the windows power plan to high performance, but all that does is use more power and produce more heat with no actual tangible performance benefit (despite the plan name).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are quite welcome.,good luck,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yes, evo does guarantee a 9 hour battery life minimum, with 4 hours of battery life charged in just 30 min.","thatâ€™s also a really good laptop, if itâ€™s the same with ddr5 ram.",evo also has some other bonuses too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if it's the zenbook flip with the 12700h and a 96wh battery, then it should do 7-10 hours.",around 10 watts in casual web browsing sounds about right even for the (relatively) high idle power draw of the cpu.,just make sure the graphics card isn't turned on while you browse.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably use dx12 in everything you can.,that means fortnite.,battery stuff was broken on intel's gpus when ltt tested them.,"i think stuff might be working properly now, but not sure.",they said an august update was supposed to fix a lot of stuff.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
okay.,"let me tell you, recently got a vivobook with the 12500h.","the evo certification has truly disappointed me because not only was there a ton of bloatware causing constant background cpu usage completely preventing the cpu cores from every reaching idle frequencies, the default max boost power was set to 80 frrigggin watts.",oh and thats not all.,the boost period was set to 28 seconds so thats 28 seconds long the cpu can use 80 watts for.,now that i think about it i wonder if benchmarks take 28 seconds to complete.,all the above?,thats completely fine for a techie like me.,but not for regular consumers who won't tweak their computer.,"so stock, windows was estimating 5 hours from a full charge which quickly dropped to 3 hours.",definitely doesnt sound like evo standards to me.,here's what i did.,uninstalled all the asus software and mcafee.,disabled some additional background asus things that werent listed in apps and features by using autoruns.,disabled any other things like some of those intel and realtek services.,then i went to the power plan to try and limit the processor maximum state.,what happened?,it only affected the frequency of the e-cores.,that wouldn't do.,this is when i installed xtu and learned the max boost power was set to 80 friggin watts for 28 seconds.,since it's not an unlocked processor i could only adjust the tdp.,"so i lowered the base tdp to 30 watts (i think it was 45 or maybe 40), and lowered the boost tdp to 35 watts.",i was satisfied with the benchmark at that power limit and the estimated battery time shot up to 9 hours on a full charge.,with this power limit the cpu was still able to hit the max boost speed of 4.4 ghz on at least one core.,it was doing about 3 ghz all performance core and 2 ghz all e core.,that still earned it a 50% better single thread bench than my 6700k and a 60% better multi thread.,it's way over powered for the everyday browsing and office work that laptop's being used for.,i'm convinced i can further power limit it to extend the battery life even more.,if i recall off the top of my head it's scoring 672 for single thread and 4000 for multi thread in cpuz.,note: that vivobook has a 73wh battery.,"as a closing statement, i highly recommend buying a laptop with alder lake but be prepared to use intel xtu to set reasonable power limits.",your battery and fan will thank you.,also be prepared to drop all the bloatware.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well iâ€™d put it that way, the previous model with nvidia 3050/ti was faster.","battery life is also decidedly better on the ryzen model, even if last gen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah and for gaming i settled with cloud streaming as gfn works great for me and i can play most of the games i need to play.,havenâ€™t done any sort of heavy duty stuff but i donâ€™t foresee it being an issue.,"this laptop has kinda made me want to look into digital art, which is kind of what itâ€™s designed for so i think itâ€™s a win/win",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"idk, i think i just have this sort of regret after i buy anything bc iâ€™m not sure if i got exactly what i needed/wanted",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you ever personally gotten an evo laptop that delivered that battery life?,if so which one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is the bloatware an intel or an oem issue though?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

overall, this made a small, but noticeable improvement in temps under extended load conditions.","no changes in bios settings, i'll probably do that when i have some more time over the weekend",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
before this helpful tests i bought the worst one jeyi.,it works but will replace it.,which one should i pick?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"of all the replacement ilms tested, that one was the best performer.",only negative seems to be outside of china you'd have to a shopping provider.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the ilm (integrated loading system) that locks the cpu in place on the 12th (and likely 13th) gen intel motherboards donâ€™t do a great job of evenly spreading the mounting pressure on the cpu.,"the pressure is so great that it can warp the cpu, including the ihs.",this can create poor contact with the cpu heat sink and cause poor temps.,"these mounting brackets replace the ilm and provide more even and consistent mounting pressure, which eliminates the warping issue and as a result can provide lower temperatures",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you don't seem to get it.,i prefer us/eu made products.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"jesus, that doesn't sound good.",thanks for the info.,so are these really worth looking into for 13th gen?,are many issues in 12th gen due to this warping?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ok, but the majority of electronic products are made in china anyways (including the thermalright one) and if the feng zao/maple made frame performs better, costs less and has fewer issues with memory training or stability, it's clearly the better frame.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
likely if you are using a 12th gen board (which will be compatible with the 13th gen via bios update) and there isnâ€™t any indication that the z790 boards will use any different ilm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
keep in mind that the effect is small.,it's not like the ilm is drastically bending the cpu.,"really, the \~5c temp drop won't make a difference unless you are really pushing the system, or running a 12900k.","cooling a 12700k or lower cpu, especially at stock speeds, is pretty easy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also gamersnexus pointed out the ram controller is on the side getting less pressure so it could effect xmp/ram oc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"but none of that is actually engineered there, merely slapped together by the slave labor working 16 hours a day in the foxconn sweat shops that have safety nets outside their factory buildings, so if anyone tries to jump out to end their miserable life, they get caught in the net and catapulted back to their assembly line.",you think i'm joking?,"i wish i did, google ""foxconn safety nets"".",i'm going out of my way to ensure none of the stuff i buy was made in china.,this frame you're peddling here is a cheap thermal grizzly knock off.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s certainly only helpful when we pushing well beyond stock clocks and voltages.,even mildly overclocked system shouldnâ€™t need to have this mod.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the extent to which warping is taking place is also dependent on the actual cooler, as some models (typically big air towers with thick, spring loaded bolts as fixation mechanisms) put much more pressure on the cpu than push pins of stock coolers or small screws of aio pumps, making the problem notably less pronounced.","still, for peace of mind, i ordered a thermalright frame in advance for an upcoming 13700k system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

12100 idle is somewhere around 3-5w and maximum power consumption is around 60w.,however you should take into account that other parts on the motherboard will use 20-30w or so combined.,you can probably expect total idle power of around 40w if you don't have discrete graphics card.,desktops are not laptops and don't aim at similar level of power control.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

so that my laptop can run more smoothly and i can play game normally now due to my laptop being an old.,"game's that i used to run like cs:go , used to run around 30-40 fps all low with minimal adjustments to the cfg files on 4:3 1024x768

but now it runs at 4:3 800x600 around 15-20 fps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
problem with this is that i'm scared that i might fuck up and do something wrong and my laptop wont work properly again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's more likely you have thermal throttling due to the thermal compound on your cooler degrading or dust build up inside.,that or also over time games like cs:go have increased their resource demand.,have you used [hwmonitor](https://www.cpuid.com/softwares/hwmonitor.html) to check your temperatures?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have not but since i have an app called quick cpu pre-installed my laptop because of ghost spectre toolbox, i can check my laptop's temperature (in fahrenheit)

i get lows of 100\* an average of 114\* and an high of 127\*",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thats fine as long as its lower than 175. probably they just updated the game and made it more demanding.,"also check your background cpu usage, is it 1 % or 0 on average when you open task manager and nothing else is running?",(though check and subtract how much task manager itself is using),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's a multi-socket system.,geekbench says 4 sockets but 2 sockets seems more likely.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol they're comparing it to a 5800x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably compares to the cpus you have?,many leaks i have seen compare to this cpu.,both enterprise and consumer cpu bench leaka,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think you should wait until the rtx 4000 series and intel 13th gen/ryzen 7000 series comes out.,the parts will be cheaper and more abundant since thereâ€™s always a group of people who want the latest and greatest thing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"gpu are at an all time cheap price right now, and it's a drop-in replacement.",cpu you'll need new mobo + cpu + ram.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had 4790k and 1070 and went to 12500 and 3070. massive difference.,i havenâ€™t got around to benchmarking but basically all around itâ€™s 2x the performance.,if i had to iâ€™d keep the 1070 and go cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the gpu will be the most noticeable upgrade.,having a 12th gen with a gtx 1070 would be wasted.,most games are more gpu limited than cpu limited,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for gaming in my opinion the gpu should always be prioritized though ideally you would just upgrade both,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"upgrading both would be good but you should  really upgrade the cpu as 12th gen is a big jump in performance, and without the cpu upgrade your gpu would be lacking cpu power",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had the same combo and first i changed the gpu to a 3080. massive improvement... after a few months i changed to a 12700 and ... i also got a massive improvement.,"i would go for gpu over cpu if you want to improve your gaming experience, otherwise go for a new cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cpu is fine upgrade the gpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ryzen 5600, b550 from aorus and a gpu.",best way of upgrade for you atm.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have an evga 1070 and i7-6700 from 2016-2021. and i upgraded to 12700k and 3090. its amazing!,definitely upgrade both.,"i had 3090 on with 6700, and the bottleneck was noticeable lol.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so rather cpu than gpu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it depends on what you use your pc for (like what resolution you play on).,"also new gpus and cpu are coming out in a few weeks/months, you could also wait a bit and see how the used market moves.","if you ask me i would probably go middle ground, like b660m mortar ddr4 + i5 12400 (this motherboard is pretty good, so you can upgrade to a i7 13700 if you want later on) with a rtx 3060 ti/3070 or rx 6700 xt.",that's is what i would go for if i had to upgrade right now with your setup.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"delete xtu, read a thing or two about overclocking, use bios.",problem solved.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is this avx 512 test?,512 gets extra voltage.,do you get the voltage down by applying minus offset?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just went through something similar.,"- turn off enhanced core management in bios, there is no option for that in xtu so you have to do it there.","try loading optimized defaults first, then turn on xmp - if your ram supports it - and disable the enhanced core management.","you can also put a negative value in core voltage offset, not too much, try for .025 then work your way to .050 / .1 if it's stable.","new motherboards seem to just feed the cpu crazy voltage, especially on the k / kf chips.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
try throttlestop?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it would be a decent upgrade but i would look into a used cpu mobo combo.,lots of people are always trying to sell their old hardware and there's some pretty good deals on local marketplaces.,especially if you aren't aiming for current gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"its is definitely a good upgrade, but for 2022 standards, it won't help if you wish to play recent games.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
better than nothing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
near pointless upgrade.,"save your money and get a 12100f+h610, should be around $160 + ddr4.","as that will be a massive upgrade and include hardware fixes for vulnerabilities and get you windows 11 (and beyond support) as well as new platform features like usb-c, m.2 nvme, usb 3 gen 2, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what's your goal and hopes for this upgrade?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it also depends on the gpu...i recently mounted a gtx 980ti on a i7-3770k configuration and it's not bad at all for 60fps at 1080p, it performs well even with recent games (with medium / high settings of course)...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how expensive is the 3770?,"itâ€™s such a small upgrade, and the 3770 itself struggles now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you really cant save for a newer gen cpu, mb and ram then go for it.","i have an i7 3770 myself and its an ok processor for gaming, dont expect much out of it though, upgrade to a newer gen when you can, newer games require more cpu power and for tasks like editing videos its pretty bad (i personally use vegas 17 and im upgrading to a 12th gen i5 when i get enough money)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just understand that youâ€™re using something outdated but youâ€™re replacing with something slightly less outdated - both fit in within the outdated realm.,"if all you do is browsing, youtube and the occasional 2d/low effort game, just keep what youâ€™ve got - unless the upgrade costs like $30.",more than $50 and iâ€™d say just start saving up for when you can get welcome in the 2020s rather than stuck in the 2010s.,"this is not a dis btw, but you knowâ€¦ itâ€™s like asking whether a cd player is better than a casette player when weâ€™re in the blueray+ phase.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can buy a xeon cpu from aliexpress,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
even if it was a 50% upgrade over the 2500...it's not worth it because games today require a 200% upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this is the route i took, but only cause the ram died on my z68 + 2600k build.","i was able to get a r5 2600 + b450 tomahawk + 32gb 2666mhz combo for around $240ish some time during 2020. i sold the old mobo and cpu for around $150, which ended up making the cost just a little bit more than what i would've spent on new ddr3 modules.","but op currently still has a complete, working build so it could possibly sell for around the same or more (depending on how the used market is where they live) and likewise find a good intel or ryzen combo from people who have moved on to current gen as you mentioned.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"also it is becoming unsupported more and more, like win 11 etc.",i'd go a few generations past third if possible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it sounds like you've done reasonable troubleshooting and it's still not working.,"that's a 15 dollar part, i would cut your losses and buy a newer one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

after that if you are using msi motherboard make sure you switch to boxed cooler (241w) instead of tower cooler (288w) or water cooler (4096w).,this can be found in bios settings -> overclock.,this greatly reduces the temperature of the i9-12900k.,i am using that processor with noctua nh-u12a chroma black and in cinebench it hardly hits 92 degrees when set to boxed cooler.,however when i set it to water cooler it hits 100 degrees on second multi-thread run.,"on tower cooler it reaches 95-96 degrees on cinebench, however i prefer it to work on lower temps so boxed cooler works best for me.","also i have made a custom pwn fan curve for the cpu - 35 degrees 40%, 50 degrees - 50%, 70 degrees - 65% and 85 degrees 100%.","and i have 3 140mm noctua intake fans from front, 2 120mm intakes from bottom of the case and 4 exaust 120mm - 1 from top and 3 from back of the case.",all are with custom fan curves.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"base is a minimum clockspeed you should be able to hit with the stock intel cooling, or something equivalent to it.",think of it as the worst case scenario for a budget system with poor cooling.,"unless your pc is badly made, you should be able to run faster.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not all processors are perfectly identical due to small manufacturing errors here and there.,base speed is the minimum guaranteed speed the processor will run at or else intel will replace it under your warranty.,most processors will always be able to hit their maximum turbo speed instead.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"this is perfectly accurate, but i'd like to add that the turbo / boost clock that's often advertised for both intel and amd is typically for ""single core"" only, and the peak clock speed for all cores is often slightly less, i.e.","your cpu can hit 4.1ghz on one of its six cores, but when under full load should be around 3.9ghz across all cores.",this is mainly due to the boost behavior and how cpus are designed to operate within the confines of a certain power limit.,"k-series cpus from intel allow for overclocking, which can bypass power limits altogether and allow the user to specify a max clock speed across all cores, as long as the cooler can handle the heat and prevent it from thermal throttling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what transpired here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
like putting it in the center is totally gonna stop people from stealing the itemâ€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you implying that if the cpu was deeper inside the box it would prevent someone from tearing the box open in 15 seconds and stealing it?,amd does the same thing btw.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's illegal to break the law.,so of course nobody is gonna open it and take it.,doy.,intel knows all and we know nothing /s,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you seen the 12900k package?,it is even more worthless and needless with the wafer container.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tamper evident packaging should be a must for any item costing more than $100 on amazon so that any returns that have any evidence of tampering will not be placed back in the inventory stream.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"bezos the lizard face is dumb and all his workers are thieves, not intel fault really.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
amd does the exact same thing with their box.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sorry, but no amount of smart packaging is going to prevent a determined thief from stealing your dear cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mine came in a giant gold waferâ€¦.,lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
u should have spent 600 like me on an i9.,"i got a nice cool designed, easy to open box.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what the heck is happened with the package ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
damn i feel bad for you.,did you or at least in process of getting your money back?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™ve had major issues with amazon recently.,"ordered $140 case fans and i received a used a hair tieâ€¦ ordered another set and there was only 2/3 fans and they were dusty and used, ordered a asus gte11000 and the wrong router was in the box, iâ€™ve received multiple duplicate orders i did not pay for, iâ€™ve had packages get indefinitely delayed in shipping.","these orders were shipped via amazon purchased directly from business stores i.e intel, asus, corsair.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'd say it worked well enough, the thief still had to destroy the box in an obvious way to get it out",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can't see intel's fault here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the packaging is fine.,what?,you think having it inside the box completely would have stopped this?,i'll try and forget the hordes of people who received empty gpu boxes over the last two years.,people steal.,it sucks.,get a refund and move on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"theft issue aside, arenâ€™t the boxes supposed to protect the contents from damage?",why is it right up on the side of the box like that anyway?,?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
doesn't amd do the same with their boxes too?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am thinking about making a peasant class joke about how the i9 was packaged in a gold plastic tin... up vote for yes down vote if you are poor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
amazon needs a signature verification for every employee touchin an item over $200 in value iâ€™ve had similar issues myselfâ€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in tact with what?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

oh you havenâ€™t seen anything.,i once received a dcdc converter from abb critical power in a 5x1.5x1.5 foot package with filled high end cut styrofoam.,no wonder that company canâ€™t get a solid footing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what a load of shite.,sometimes i wish amazon were a guy so i could punch him really fuckin' hard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
amazon doesn't segregate their inventory from third-party sellers so it's no real guarantee of anything.,best to just avoid them entirely.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to be fair this seems like a more complicated path to the same end point.,they could of just opened the box take out the cpu and send you the empty box and the end result would have been functionally identical to them carefully removing it from the window.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had basically the same thing happen with an i5-12600.,i ordered it with a motherboard from amazon two weeks ago.,"they arrive at my house and i'm thinking ""great, i finally have something to do.""",i open the motherboard's shipping box and everything is good.,"i open the cpu's shipping box and i don't see the processor, but the box has some weight to it.","i open the box and it has an obviously used stock cooler with thermal paste all over it in the box, but no cpu.","i returned it to amazon for a refund and went to best buy and picked up a 12600k like i should have in the beginning anyway instead of the 12600 non-k.  oh, it was sold by and shipped from amazon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they're designed to look nice on a shelf.,and that's pretty much the extent of the thought process there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why is this post upvoted?,"if a delivery person is going to steal, they are going to steal.",'hiding' the cpu in the box isn't going to make a difference.,adidas has to put security tape and generic boxes because delivery people were stealing shoes.,"report the theft to amazon, they will see if there are other reports of this delivery person stealing and then fire them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i donâ€™t think bezos could tell a computer chip from a potato chip.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i opened up the box from amazon and this is how i found it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
some chump in an amazon warehouse or delivery truck got a new cpu it would seem.,fucking bezos and his damn sweat shop army.,definitely would dispute the transaction or just go straight to your bank / financial institution and do a charge back.,while this type of thing happens every so often (especially with shippers like ups) it's not cool or *legal* to steal someone else's stuff.,"hope things turn out for the best, op",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,if the cpu was deeper internally and could only be accessed by actually cutting the factory seals (kind of like how nvmeâ€™s are packaged) then i think it would reduce the ease at which someone could steal it.,"sure, anyone can tear open a box, but one way is very obvious and another way (this way) is far too easy, tempting, and can be done so quickly/discretely as to potentially not be caught on camera at the amazon warehouse.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
idk i quite liked the wafer container.,i bought a premium cpu so for the first time in my life it was nice to open something and have it feel like i was opening a premium product with premium packaging.,felt like a king when i opened that thing up.,plus itâ€™s kinda harder to take the cpu out since youâ€™d actually have to remove the wafer and open it up to actually steal the cpu.,"not at all impossible, but more difficult.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, although i remember back when i9â€™s used to come in like massive terrarium enclosures.",i canâ€™t tell which is worse.,i hear 13th gen are just gonna ship in unsealed ziplock bags.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol at least wrap the box in plastic wrap or put the cpu in the middle of the box inside the case.,with this packaging intel might as well have just taped it to the outside of the box.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i opened the amazon box and this is what i found.,the cpu was ripped out of the box.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, amazon is letting me return for a refund, no hassle.",even gave me a $10 credit as an apology.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™m sure someone, somewhere at intel convinced others that consumers have to see the chip or they wonâ€™t believe itâ€™s actually inside, possibly because itâ€™s so lightweight.",nvme drives typically have great packaging (albeit maybe a little wasteful) and i donâ€™t understand why cpus arenâ€™t packaged similarly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™m not sure, iâ€™ve never bought an amd chip before.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"while nice in theory, i canâ€™t imagine how much that would slow their process down.",they probably sell an insane amount of goods that exceed $200.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its an rma return thief that sent back an empty box and amazon didn't check.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes they do, however every employee can easily have a id card that touches product to verify they touched it, a simple scan of the id or simple code at there station",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very strategic.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wouldnâ€™t if i lived near a micro center!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"at least i still had the stock cooler in the box, whew!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"because they've always been of the opinion that either you were running a work system, in which case the stock cooler was sufficient, or you were a builder who would replace it anyway with an aftermarket.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all stock coolers are bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh really?,so even if it says both bought and sold by amazon that inventory would be in the same pool as the same chip being sold by a 3rd-party and shipped by amazon?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hello, it looks like you've made a mistake.","it's supposed to be could've, should've, would've (short for could have, would have, should have), never could of, would of, should of.","or you misspelled something, i ain't checking everything.","beep boop -â yes,â iâ amâ aâ bot, don't botcriminate me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mark zuckerberg just got really offended and doesn't know why,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
better then getting a 2 core bga laptop cpu from 2009 instead of was you ordered,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then the problem isnâ€™t intel; itâ€™s amazon.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i haven't had this exact scenario happen, but unless the op has a pattern of fraudulent returns with amazon, complaining to amazon is likely to be plenty to get their choice of a new cpu shipped or refund with minimal hassle.","if amazon won't make good then you can think about asking someone else to claw your money back but i'm yet to have amazon give me pushback making good on any problem with an order, even the one time i ordered to an old address by mistake after moving.",that wasn't amazon's mistake or responsibility at all but they still resent my order to my current address.,the last time i ordered a new cpu on amazon i was shipped an open box(box seals broken and cpu in the plastic holder backwards) and had zero friction getting one cross shipped to replace it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks!,"i contacted amazon immediately and fortunately theyâ€™re letting me send it back for a refund, no problem, and even gave me a $10 account balance in return.",i still went directly to best buy though and bought a new cpu in person to be safe (but had to get a slightly different one because of what was in inventory).,i wasnâ€™t going to bother risking it again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
imagine his anger when he realizes it's not a k chip.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had this happen with a 12900k from newegg where it had been returned and perfectly resealed but with a 9700 in place of the 12900k.,and you couldnâ€™t even tell from the outside because at the time the 12900k had the fancy packaging with no window to see the actual cpu.,"newegg made it right, but obviously it sucks to have to deal with that scenario.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"bezos who doesnâ€™t run amazon anymore, it is his fault this cpu got stolen!!",i work inside a brand new amazon doesnâ€™t look like a sweet shop too me!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
unless your entire box is a factory seal there is no way to make it impossible to remove the cpu without breaking the seal.,you can always just cut a hole in the side of the box and leave the seal intact.,factory seals aren't magic.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but then you can't check that the cpu is the correct one without opening the whole thing up so you're even more vulnerable to rma-scams.,have you thought about this for two seconds before ranting?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thieves don't care about that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"me neither, but i think i remember seeing when i was at microcenter",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
too be fair if they are shipping someone elseâ€™s product regardless a vendor or buyer it should be handled with utmost care and urgency regardless.,this is why i use usps,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that would make sense, but the way the box was open is ridiculous.",if thatâ€™s the case they need to fix that side of verification on returns,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that made no sense.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what did you get?,if you don't mind me asking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how am i ranting?,iâ€™m responding to a question.,"also, why would it be the wrong cpu inside a sealed box?","do you open a lot of sealed computer parts and pull out the wrong gpu, the wrong ram, the wrong nvme drive?",it could be inside a sealed but clear plastic container so you can easily see through it without having to fully open it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
youâ€™re probably right.,regardless of packaging theyâ€™d figure out a way if theyâ€™re determined enough.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for real, at least in all this is i can thank amazonâ€™s return policy and customer service.","wish it didnâ€™t happen in the first place, but it is what it is.",i went to my local best buy and grabbed a new cpu.,they didnâ€™t have the exact same one but at least i was able to get it in person and not have to take this risk again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if so, they should change it then.","two wrongs donâ€™t make a right, ya know?",i also am not too sure why they care to show the cpu through these little windows.,"sure, on the one hand i guess itâ€™s so a consumer can verify thereâ€™s actually something inside an otherwise lightweight box, but itâ€™s not like these cpus are particularly interesting to look at.",theyâ€™re just grey squares.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"never mind, i thought your original question was being sarcastic because i misspelled â€œintactâ€ as â€œin tactâ€.","anywho, the factory tape was still sealed thatâ€™s supposed to indicate the box hadnâ€™t been tampered with, but that doesnâ€™t matter when you can just rip the cpu out the window.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh wow, thatâ€™s good to know.",i still try to make sure amazon is the shipper/seller to make any potential returns easier.,"man, i wish there was a micro center close to where i live.",buying pc parts online feels like such a crap shoot these days.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they didn't even push you for a replacement, just let you refund and send back?","that seems crazy to me... at least if they still made you buy a replacement it's less likely that someone would order this, rip out the cpu and say it ""came that way"" and get a refund and a new cpu.",not saying you did that!,"let me be clear, but just saying that a full refund and not a replacement makes it easier for someone with no morals to do that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
â€¦and likely theyâ€™ll just put it back on the shelf and send it back out to another customer in the same way.,iâ€™ve heard of that happening all too often.,like with gamers nexus and their newegg scandal receiving a defective motherboard instead of new/open box.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the only chip available at my local best buy was a 12700k.,"i had $5 off at best buy and 1% cash back, and i got a $10 credit from amazon for what happened, so i kind of only spent $10 extra to get it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nobody checks factory sealed stickers.,"if someone had to break one of those to get the cpu, they'd just break the sticker.",why you think that breaking a sticker is more of a barrier than breaking the box itself is confusing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if someone is going to tear a large hole in a box like you showed in your picture, they're not going to care about keeping factory seals in place.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they offered a replacement but the equivalent cpu wouldnâ€™t be available for like a week or more, so the other option was to return and buy a different cpu altogether, which is what i ended up doing (but from best buy so i could at least grab it in person!).",i will say they didnâ€™t push hard for a replacement.,"they offered, i said no because of timing, and so they just offered a return instead and issued me a $10 account balance credit too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there's a ton of factors involved in whether or not amazon is going to pursue.,there's a whole list of diffferent possible outcomes.,they might have you just send it back and send a new one no questions asked or refund.,"they might just take your word for it and send you a new one and say ""don't worry about sending that one back"".",they might have you send it back and once they get it back they'll send you a new one.,they might have you send it back and refund you.,they might tell you that there's nothing they can do and you're sol.,"if you're a consistent customer who infrequently has issues with your orders and the item is below some unknown value, this'll probably happen to you.","my dad has complained that a $500 accessory for his camper never showed up despite being ""arrived"" and they sent a new one.",2 days later he had both of them in his mail.,"amazon said ""don't worry about it, just keep them both"".","sometimes it's just not worth the hassle for amazon to pay for you to ship the item back, then deal with the re-inventorying process and potentially relisting it as used or it not even being able to be listed anymore.",some times they just write that shit off.,"now if you do this all the time, are a new customer or on a super expensive product you might have other outcomes than this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"amazon pushes the entire cost of refunds onto their supplier, so they're very happy to return or refund for any or no reason.",the costs incurred to the supplier is often greater than they made from the initial sale.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for all i know thats what happened hereâ€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i mean, my account history with amazon speaks for itself and i just spent a boat load of money with them overall on all my other pc build parts without issue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
amazon support is quite easy on things.,years ago i bought a book.,my order arrived with one corner of the book slightly dented.,i made a suggestion for a better packing without claiming anything.,they sent me a new shipment with improved packing without needing me to return the original.,i was very surprised.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i guess my thinking is itâ€™s a better security measure than just having the cpu on the outside of the box through a little window that can be ripped with no tools or anything, but youâ€™re probably right.","if someoneâ€™s gonna steal it, theyâ€™re gonna steal it regardless.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it depends though.,"one can be done easily in a few seconds, the other might require a tool like a knife and scissors, then opening the box and pulling out packaging to get inside, then putting it all back together.","if someone, say, iâ€™m an amazon warehouse is doing this as they walk down the isle, then extra steps or seals are going to make it much more difficult to pull off discretely and quickly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"depends on the book, some books are insanely expensive!",statistically the book isn't one of those.,"i remember hearing about ferrari by taschen which costs between $6,000 - 30,000 when it was released!",or seventy one times more expensive than the cpu!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we've seen the pictures and videos of the 13900k showing actual scores.,where is the 7950x showing it's scores?,"until then, this is rumor or fake.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
trash website.,just ignore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but both 13900k and 12900k beat the 7950x in single core cb r23.,itâ€™s possible at some point in the future i could have a game that isnâ€™t gpu bound where this single core advantage will finally make a difference for me :-),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
honestly at this point gpu improvements are much more important for things like gaming.,the top 8 or 10 gaming cpus perform with such marginal differences due to gpu bottlenecks that if you're just gaming you may as well just get the cheapest one and put that toward a higher end gpu or more storage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
any news from these upcoming chips not yet released in the market are just hype.,i will just just wait for reviews on release.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as i said.,zen 4 micro architect will make intel loss multi billions and market share.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it looks fake.,the 7950x won't be 25% faster than the 5950x in st performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"probably fake, but it's going to be the 3d vcache 7xxx that's going to bring the 13900k to it's knees.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it might, allegedly, supposedly, possibly, perhaps, maybe.",i'll wait for the actual releases.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah the 7600x might even beat the 12900k by 10%,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looks like intel and amd trying hard to beat apple m1 chip,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think what you're referring to are overclocked benchmarking.,"if you look closely at the cb result we saw on this sub the other day, you'd see it was permanently running at it's max boost clock during the entire benchmarking run, and without power limits.",so exotic cooling is guaranteed.,"but we will start seeing more scores from now on, they started shipping motherboards and cpus to reviewers last week, so this could be the first of a long line of leaks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"zen4 3d will still lose to intel in most games, just like the 5800x3d loses to the 12900ks.",the x3d is nothing special and its zen4 variant will still rely on specific games benefiting from the bigger l3 cache or not.,there's enough evidence of this online.,"what amd needs is a faster core along with with more cache to win across the board, not just one or the other.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"> amd said there would be a 15% st uplift between zen3 and zen4

that's not what they said.",they said at least 15%.,"that presentation was given way too early for them to start releasing info that might make people stop buying zen 3 and wait for zen 4. so they had to low-ball it and say >15%, so they can still sell am4 products.","the presentation was given in may, they'd be bombing their sales of products for 4 months if they started too much hype for zen 4 that early.","and sales for cpus were already down at that time, for both intel and amd.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the difference between samsung and intel is that the latter competes in more markets than the former.,this is why intel has to spin the fabs off.,companies will not deal with intel foundry if they are not neutral.,companies would not want their tech copied by a competitor via the foundry.,apple doesn't fab with samsung anymore because that happened.,qualcomm does fab but samsung uses those chips for their own products anyways.,nvidia uses samsung foundries but they are not in the same market.,amd can use samsung if needed as well because their markets don't overlap.,will companies be willing to fab with intel knowing that they are also competitors in the same market segments?,maybe for products in markets where intel doesn't have a presence they would be fine but those products don't use the bleeding edge nodes.,maybe a company that's desperate with getting another source for chips will deal with intel foundry.,nvidia is in the news with negotiating with intel for foundry since they won't get good deals with tsmc compared to amd.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

youre obviously capable with hardware so at this stage you might just be better off getting a cheap second hand motherboard and an even cheaper standard atx case and transplanting the dell pc (without motherboard) into the new case.,that way you can get something like an evo 212 or scythe mugen which will do the job.,honestly that will serve you much better over the long run.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this looks to be a genuine ax210 m.2 1216 module that has been soldered onto a third party half mini pcie pcb.,"the soldered 1216 formfactor has been increasing in popularity unfortunately with the likes of lg using them in the gram series, however this also means enterprising third parties can used them to make products intel will not like this one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel has never made a mini pcie version of ax201, but that doesn't necessarily mean this card is fake, from a silicon point of view.",from the pictures and the descriptions i guess they recycled ax201 chips and soldered them on these mini pcie boards.,"i think you will have to take the risk of getting an non functional card or less-stable signal, but if it works, this is a great product for older laptops.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"half mini is a pcb shape for a pcie device, so any pcie device can be made in half mini, at least if it is physically able to fit in that size.",since m.2.,"is smaller, it should always be possible to take an m.2.",pcie device and make it larger to fit into mini pcie.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
update: card has arrived and installed into my laptop.,speeds are massively improved from ~200 mbps to 600-700 mbps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's interesting.,i thought half mini has died past intel 7260 wlan module.,there's demand for newer wlan chips for half mini pcie (i.e upgrading wlan card that uses half mini pcie) so i guess it makes sense for side business.,plus the carrier board for half mini pcie -> pcie x1 is really cheap,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes there is plenty of demand for newer wlan chips in older form factors but not enough for intel to manufacture them.,"this kind of reminds me of when intel moved from slot 1 to socket 370 pga for cpus, then third parties came up with the s370 pga to slot 1 adapter.",showing my age now.,if there is a niche like this someone will usually fill the gap in the market like they have done so now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
chipset drivers are not actual drivers that do anything.,"they are just inf drivers to describe the device with the proper name which means, they will never be updated.","when intel releases new chipset drivers, it is only for identifying new products in the device manager.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"> asus scar 17 and i9-12900h

yeah that'll do it lol.",unfortunately there's not much you can do in that situation.,tjmax for that chip is 100c so at 95 you could actually be doing worse.,"modern cpus, especially laptops are pretty good at managing clock speeds to adjust for things like thermals and power budget.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you really want to you could lower the turbo boost with intel extreme tuning utility as that helps my 11800h but could reduce your performance significantly if you lower it too much.,it also take a long time to calibrate to the point where it doesnâ€™t impact your performance as much and lowers the temps,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you dont wanna put too much weight?,are you afraid of using your 3070up?,"the reason people say to wait, is almost all modern games will saturate your gpu before the cpu at 1440p+ resolutions.",and the games that are cpu bound are probably still giving you 100+fps anyway.,so do not worry about your gpu getting worn out.,"if you think your cpu is holding you back, turn up the settings on the gpu.",1440p gaming should push a 3070 pretty good.,"yes a cpu upgrade will improve your max fps in some games, where it holds it back.",(when i still had my 4790k fh5 could not break 60fps and my gpu at the time was only at 60-70% utilized. ),but 8600k is still decent.,what you will see a big improvement is in your 1% lows.,worth it.....possibly.,will you see a huge bump?,depends on the game :).,"just keep in mind, going from 1080p to 1440p probably takes a load off your cpu, not making it to be more of a bottleneck./",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thank you ðÿ˜š,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the reason was because i got already a z490 motherboard and i found this i7 at 270â‚¬ wich is a good price for the upgrade that i was intent to do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe the op started with a 10500k.,he wouldn't need to swap out his motherboard to move up a generation.,i know folks love to hate on 11th gen cpu's but the ipc is better with rocket lake than comet lake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it depends on what you need to do.,iâ€™m an nsfw 3d artist on blender and i need this instead of a core i5 11600k because it has better viewport performance.,"if the only thing you need to do is just gaming at fhd 144hz youâ€™re good for now, especially if you have a decent graphics card",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wouldn't 10900k be better for that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

could very well be the case.,"i'm from the uk but looking at newegg prices currently, he could have got a very decent z690 motherboard (msi edge) ddr4 + 12600k for about $40 more?","and with raptor lake just around the corner, it wasn't the best move, but i will say, not everyone is like me and not everyone wants the latest and greatest, so it comes down to the buyer's needs,  just giving my two cents on what i would do personally.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is the performance better though?,i just remember reading that it was a regression vs the 10700k.,which i currently at rockin.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hard pass.,"also, that pricing has to be used or you're using some kind of a discount code or rebates because (as i said, i'm not from the us) and looking at newegg the 11700k is $319.99 all by itself.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that video was the first thing that came to mind for me initially lol, but its performance doesn't suck.","it just never had a real reason to exist, along with most of rocket lake.","the 11th gen i5s were good value for money though, at least before alder lake.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's a fair point.,"the 11900k had pre-determined expectations as the successor to the 10900k that intel was simply not able to meet due to the trouble they had during the manufacturing process for rocket lake, which caused them to abort the 10nm node and backport the entire architecture to a 14nm design.","that's one of the main reasons why they were ""only"" able to fit 8 cores total onto the die size they were going for.","but mind you, the ""line up"" outside of the i9s only consisted of a few i5 and i7 skus--which i agree were the better valued offerings overall, if you didn't already have a 10600k or better.","particularly the i5-11400f + 11600k were the best ""bang for the buck"", and provided decent uplift for people who were using lower end 10th gen. and the i7s weren't bad either, but like you said the marketing was focused on the ""flagship"", so unfortunately they just weren't very well received (even though the 11700k can match the 11900k for less money).","all in all, rocket lake just wasn't what i'd call a ""full fledged"" generation, since it didn't offer *any* i3s (except some ""refreshed"" skus still based on comet lake that were mainly intended for office/light productivity pre-builts anyway).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

we use autodesk civil 3d which is single-core only and they recommend a cpu with a base of 3+ ghz.,it tends to have performance issues with large files with cpus that are under 3ghz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the base clock itself doesn't actually mean anything.,what they're really telling you to do is buy a workstation class laptop that won't overheat under sustained load.,talk to your sales rep or look at product testing and reviews.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
go with a newer alder lake cpu then.,highest end one is the i9-12950hx.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no new generation cpus these days actually get to such low clocks even if that's what the base clocks are technically rated as.,they'll always boost way higher if the current application demands so.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as others have pointed out, base clock is not typically a meaningful measurement.","itâ€™s not a measurement of the cpuâ€™s â€œnormalâ€ speed that youâ€™ll be seeing, or of its actual power.","what it is, is an estimation from intel that says â€œat its rated power budget (tdp or pl1), it should be able to average this frequencyâ€.",an example of how this works is with the 12600 and 12700. the 12600 has a base p-core speed of 3.3ghz.,but the 12700 has a base p-core speed of a measly 2.1ghz.,"like, wtf, right?",but then you notice that both cpus have the same 65 watt pl1 power budget.,"so the 12600 is splitting that 65w between 6 p-cores, while the 12700 is splitting it between 8 p-cores and 4 e-cores.","but given enough power and thermal capacity, with those limits removed the cpu will maintain its maximum turbo clock indefinitely.","so the 12700 will actually maintain 8 x 4.5ghz, while the 12600 does only 6 x 4.4ghz.","now, the thing is, on a laptop the base clock is somewhat more meaningful than on a desktop, because laptops are typically extremely thermally limited, and will often be designed to handle a specific tdp, so even if you can remove the limits, doing so may not do you any good when the cpu ends up throttling.","but more important than the cpuâ€™s tdp or base clock is the laptopâ€™s actual cooling capability, which you might be able to determine based on what cpus are offered.","but if you just want to pick a cpu based on raw capability, look more to the core count and turbo speeds rather than the base clock.","also, you canâ€™t compare a cpuâ€™s performance based merely on frequency between different generations.","like, a 3ghz 5th gen core cpu is not going to have anywhere near the performance of a 3ghz 12th gen cpu.","never mind, say, a 3.73ghz single-core pentium 4 which technically meets those autocad qualifications!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"any top end cpu will do, they mostly have more than 3.3ghz anyways and the ipc for 12th gen for example is much higher than 11th gen, so that 3.3ghz performance you get with your current xeon, it will be doable at say 2.5ghz with the 12th gen, so just gen something with 12th gen. xeon only gives you ecc and some enterprise stuff.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

intel fired their server verification team so a lot of work had to be done post-tapeout to fix the  problems that werent caught in pre-silicon validation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
op - you asked a good question but are killing yourself with the meme responses.,"i'd guess the answers are that the really bad bugs aren't in the core architecture but rather everything else that goes into sapphire rapids - the additional interconnects related to being a chiplet design, unique memory controllers, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it depends where the bugs are.,sapphire rapids is a chiplet design.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"unless we have some project to benchmark against, we cannot simply use this number.",all projects have 100s of bugs.,many never get fixed and head to errata.,how many important/blocker bugs are there?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we don't know what the bugs are.,"with that said, with sapphire rapids intel attempts to make a chiplet cpu work transparently as a monolithic.",each die has five high density emib connections to adjacent dies.,incredibly high precision is required just for packaging such a thing!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

complete waste of time(this post and op's commentary),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's intel's first attempt at a ""chiplet-like"" design.","my understanding is they didn't just copy what amd did, they made their own tile system using an active interposer.",apparently the active interposer is a complete mess.,"as it has it's own logic built-in, it's a huge piece and any issue will ruin the whole soup.","amd (like tsmc with their foundry work) took a conservative approach when using and introducing chiplets, zen 1 epyc was essentially a bunch of ryzen cpus that communicated with one another (badly), hence the huge degradation between numa and uma.","zen 2 epyc (and so on) are a bunch of chiplets that connect with an i/o die through a ""dumb"" interposer.","with zen3d, amd was able to 3d-stack memory on top of a chiplet.","&#x200b;

intel was trying to 3d-stack the cpu, memory, etc.","ontop of a giant active interposer, with all of chiplets communicating directly to and through it.","foveros/sapphire rapids was basically intel trying to do all of the things amd has managed to do, but even more complicated, and they were trying to do it all for the first time.",they were definitely going to mess it up.,the parallels to intel's 10nm are all there.,"1. the lofty, completely unrealistic goal
2. absolute failure
3. delay

so at what point does sandra rivera get fired for this debacle?,"seriously, sapphire rapids is now so late, it's going to arrive after amd's 12 chiplet, 96 core / 192 thread epyc genoa!",it's depressing to watch intel flounder on so many fronts - brian sure did a number on the company during his time at the top.,pat gelsinger has his work cutout for him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

firing the server validation team is completely untrue.,"however, krzanich making terrible choices is indeed true:

* closed one of the main sites where server validation was done.","not everyone moved to the new location, so a lot of experience was lost.",* part of act was to incentivize experienced talent to take a big package and leave.,"one of the most short-sighted moves ever, and this was done company wide.",the non-rehire clause was only done for the 'low performers' that were let go as another part of act.,current leadership has wisely rescinded that clause.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

we also donâ€™t know how many bugs are present for complex server cpus.,they are never bug-free.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they don't use 'a giant active interposer' in sr, it would be too big to be manufactured (its size would be much greater than the reticle limit).",they use something called emib - [10 of them to be precise](https://www.cnews.cz/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/rozebran%c3%bd-procesor-sapphire-rapids-s-%c4%8diplety-01.jpg).,they can thought of as micro interposers.,and there's no logic in them.,they come with their own set of challenges - namely packaging costs and yields.,so it resembles the first gen epyc but with a much more complicated faster and low latency interconnect between dies making the chiplet cpu work like a monolithic one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel had chiplet before amd.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks you for best comparable design between 2 company.,just hope pat gelsinger put it on intel 4 node to archive better chip potential.,for spr itself now.,it look like the 3rd gen itanium last development era on the pass.,then intel finally send it back to intel graveyards like tehjar and more failure architectures.,on my opinion.,intel had very big trouble on its flagship product like spr.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

for this reason i'll probably end up switching to ryzen for my next upgrade unless windows 10 starts working with e cores and p cores correctly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,the problem is only that the os doesn't distinguish between the types of core and thus can't assign core/task affinity.,"for most multi core applications the e-cores will improve performance, but applications where any individual thread can be critical (such as games) it can lead to stuttering performance.",windows 11 supports heterogeneous systems but it's not all that great and the apps themselves have to be able to designate which cores to prefer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

windows 10 has been known to not always distribute tasks to the right cores.,"there's been instances where heavy tasks such as workload programs or games, windows 10 puts those heavy taks on the e cores resulting in extreme losses of performance.",does it happen often?,"probably not, but even happening once is one more time than any previous generations where e cores and p cores were not present.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">â€i would have liked to see this chip run at 7ghzâ€¦â€

my understanding is that the project was canceled largely because they werenâ€™t even going to get close to 7ghz, and their performance would have been awful given the ipc penalties of the extremely long pipeline combined with the clock speeds they were actually able to sustain.","combine that with other internal projects, like dothan showing huge promise around that time, and itâ€™s unsurprising that intel canceled this.","for reference, at 2 ghz & 7.5w tdp, dothan was about on par performance-wise with a prescott based 3.2 ghz 103w tdp pentium 4 ht.","given that both products were on the market simultaneously, itâ€™s not at all surprising that intel basically canceled their planned desktop products and relatively hastily pivoted to using their upcoming mobile-targeted architectures for desktop/workstation/server products as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the quote from paul ottelini in this video about how pushing 150w through a cpu is crazy.... if he could only see today's cpus hahaha,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm not sad about it really.,i think multicore at lower clock speeds was clearly the right choice.,"even if you could get 7ghz the ipc penalty would have negated it, and it's nice when one core is completely bogged down the system is still responsive enough to fix it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"when the project started off, fabs were getting huge performance and clockspeed gains every generation.","by the time they had to ship, fabs were getting severe power leak at the node sizes they were dealing with and pushing high frequencies just made things worse even after fattening up the pipeline.","basically they assumed they would be getting ""free"" clockspeed improvements every gen, so why not shoot for 10ghz?",turns out physics is a real bastard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not really.,no cpu today is using 150w on a single core.,we have effectively 16 of these using 150w combined which is incredible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it was an interesting time for sure.,there was another quote from intel around that time that prescott could have hit 5 ghz but it would have required 200w.,i think 150w was underselling the power needs of tejas..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hereâ€™s the b660-i strix on some builds with aios if it makes any help",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have an asus rog strix b660i board with an ek 240 basic aio.,it fits with the tubes coming out at the bottom of the cpu.,i tried (briefly) the other sides but the heatsinks and ram get in the way.,this is in the dan a4-h2o case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
deepcool's ls aios should fit with no problems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"asus b660i is pretty much none issue with any aios, itâ€™s the z690i have headaches.","i used mine w/ asus lc 240, evga 280, deepcool 280. all are great w/o problems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looks like the cooler masters and corsairs seem to fit without forcing you to remove anything.,i see an ek but i presume the rgb models are the same dimensions as the basic?,i don't see any fractals.,shame as i like the lumen.,looks like the strix might actually be a good choice now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what are the dimensions of the cpu socket space on the strix?,i mean the space between all four mounting holes on the board?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh really?,that's reassuring.,i may get myself the strix at some point.,it's a pain it requires ddr5 but there's two sticks of kingston fury that cost about as much as the corsair vengeance that i got for my current build all those years ago.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you can think of this way:

current kingston fury might be a little expensive, but it can overclock to 6800@cl36 easily.",it's almost like a b-die as to ddr4.,"myself running a pair of those 32g for $180 now running 6000@cl32 without touching voltage, and i think the price keep falling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 2x8gb sticks in question cost about â£80-ish on my end.,i recall the corsair ones being around that price when i brought them.,i don't think ddr5 is that expensive going by that if you don't go crazy with the fancy stuff.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"2 sticks are easier to keep stable on oc settings, even xmp.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"usually 2x16 is more stable than 4x8, unless you know you need 4x8 for some specific reason.","if you're trying to overclock ram (above what xmp does), 2x16 is pretty necessary in most common cases for stability.","but, higher clock doesn't always mean better performance when comparing to say, 4x8 dual rank (2 ranks per stick, 4 ranks per channel, 8 ranks total).","either way, for some ram like corsair vengeance rgb pro, you can buy ""dummy"" sticks that are fakes just to have the rgb/looks.","that's what i wish i did, i run 4x8 right now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if youre getting watchdog errors or weird behavior and youre confident its the ram, you may have to increase vccsa/vccio by a few increments.",marginally increasing these values should help your imc to run the ram at their rated speeds.,"but as mentioned, depending on your motherboard trace layout, as well as cpu imc, you might be better off running 2 sticks.",good luck!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
doesn't matter on 11th gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

do you ever use more than 16 gigs?,"you might be better off using 2x8 if you never go near the 16gb mark anyway, and usually it's said that using 4 sticks can sometimes lead to stability issues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

noted thank you !,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it does.,as far as i know motherboard trace layout is more important on stability with 4 sticks vs 2. of course it puts more stress on the imc and if you are overclocking that could mean instability.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you don't have to use more than 16 gigs to benefit from dual rank and you benefit from it 24/7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, it doesn't.","11th gen caps solely at imc frequency, not ram speed, no amount of ranks or sticks matter at 11th gen. almost never can you push it past 1850 mhz, regardless of voltage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's why i suggested 2x8gb, so he still gets dual channel support but doesn't get the instability issues you sometimes get with 4 sticks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m running mine at 1933 (3866) no problem.,"plus, thres gear 2.",11th gen has a lot of memory potential.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
literally doesn't matter with 11th gen how many dimms or ranks you have.,"it makes no difference stability wise, imc is limited by its frequency only, it doesn't even gets limited by amount of ranks it can handle on any given frequency.",and all 8 gb kits are single rank too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"gear 2 is only usable for benchmarking, 4800 mhz b-die kit would be great for extremely tight lower frequency settings, but if it was hynix - they fked up hard.",kits like that are meant for benchmarking anyway.,"but in all honesty, 3600 cl14 kit will give exactly same overclock on usable frequency range, as the extremely high frequency kits, so they fked up regardless.",or they buy these to show off.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ugh?,nobody is arguing about the increase rates stated in percent points.,nope.,"""amd has risen by 9999% since bulldozer"" - that's not the point of the debate.",the point is amd used to eat 1% from the server sales.,3 years after that they took 10% of those.,now 2 years after that they do 26%.,in the next 2 years the number might rise to 40% or so.,the existing install base has to be replaced.,that generates new sales.,those sales do not go as 99% to intel as they used to.,"hell, those are like 70% going to intel.",this means your upper 90s might erode pretty fast at some point.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no confusion here.,the rename was done to prevent analysts and politicians from claiming that intel is 3 generations behind foundry.,"the article is literally claiming that intel 10nm is equivalent to tsmc/samsung 10nm, by saying ""renaming it to 7 won't fool anyone"".",sure the rename won't help them with intel 4 r&d.,"but it sure did help them to avoid claims like ""intel is expecting its first 7nm chips in late 2023, technology that tsmc and apple had in 2018"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"you did ring a bellâ€¦ i have an old first-generation sony sz1 laptop with a t2400 that i am also certain is 32-bit only, as i had to get a 32-bit copy of windows 7 to upgrade its stock xp to (man that was a brute to get working).","i dug a little deeper and it seems the initial â€œcoreâ€ line of single and dual-core processors â€” only released for mobile devices in 2006 â€” is 32-bit only, but the subsequent core 2 line is all 64-bit on mobile and desktop.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
must be the time intel decided to go for 64 bit  after amd had the athlon 64 for a few years.,i had a pentium 4 desktop from 2001 till 2006 with windows xp.,i remember the day gta 3 launched and my geforce 3 200 (i think that was it) was stuttering and i tried like mad to get a geforce 4 mx something.,"funny thing is the machine works to this day and i even got spares as a friend sold me his machine, which was the exact same as mine but with a better gpu.",he sold it for 50 bucks because he bought a new one instead of a power supply.,he thought it was toast and i fixed it buying a new psu for 30 bucks.,both machines i still have arctic mx 2 thermal paste for when i swapped the coolers and installed my first â€žrgbâ€œ fan.,i planned to use them for retro games back 15 years ago.,the cases got some good yellowing from being exposed to sunlight - itâ€™s nasty.,i forgot my vaio was a vista.,what a pain it was.,"i did install windows 7 asap 

down memory lane",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
technically all intelâ€™s desktop chips since the pentium 4 in 2004 have been 64-bitâ€¦ guess they just simplified the very first version of core and assumed 32-bit would be good enough for laptops.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think it is hard to compare because ifs (intel foundary services).,has only started.,"since intel foundry was just mainly making products for intel, almost all of it was near bleeding edge(cpus mainly).","so basically once a node hit â€˜legacy statusâ€™, intel would simply sell the equipment to other chip makers and upgrade the fab to newer nodes.","which is why you donâ€™t see many intel fabs for 45nm, 22nm (which are building now due to ifs).","so in terms of wafer capacity, they are well behind samsung, tsmc, micron, sk hynix.","but in terms of â€˜bleeding edgeâ€™ (letâ€™s say 14nm and lower), their volume is still quite significant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you mean ifs, it's split out as a separate division and does not have significant revenue yet, only offering 16nm and packaging.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it would be pretty sizable if it was intel paying a spun off intel foundry.,"i'm making a big assumption here, but amd was about 1/4 the size of intel last year in revenue and amd was about 10% of tsmc's revenue last year.",i could imagine that an independent ifs might be 40% of the revenue of tsmc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think intel is f#@*ed and they probably know it by now.,talent is leaving in droves.,pat should just break up the company and sell off the pieces.,it would be better for the shareholders and for the country.,1) pat can keep the intel brand name for a lean mean focused design company like amd or nvidia.,2) all the foundry stuff would compete with tsmc and gf.,"3) and then finally, i'm sure there's at least another three or four other spin-offs in there that worth tens of billions each like the pc/server business and cloud; the 5g/iot business; the ai business, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's all so confusing when you try to figure that out.,you almost need a phd in finance to answer that question.,"ifs is both a chip design service and a chipmakers service, so it's still not a good apples-to-apples comparison.","what i'm trying to figure out is, if you were to split off all the the little pieces in order to create another pure-play globalfoundries or tsmc foundry, how big would that business be in compared to those.","my guess is that it would smaller, perhaps not even in the top ten.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
more like they couldn't.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
right now the foundry business is essentially zero since they're still in the process of creating it and don't have customers yet.,you're going to have to wait a few years to see if it becomes a viable business or is folded up like their previous foundry service.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

so can i passthrough my igpu to my virt-manager vms (instead of using qxl for vms) without causing any trouble for the host machine that is using my nvidia card?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yes, but intel gpus have a special virtualization technology called gvt that allows you to create extra virtual gpus that you can passthrough.",its probably better than actual passthrough.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

page 14 of the motherboard manual says that it supports it in cnvi mode.,m.2 key e cards.,is the motherboard bios updated to the latest version?,is the card detected in device manager?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that was how i tried to install them initially before giving up and using intel's driver finder app.,that told me it needed to install a driver for my wifi adapter but then when it actually attempted i got no further than i did on my own.,it says it installs them yet the device never binds to the driver.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">bear in mind that this is not dependent on the processor but on the motherboard site, i recommend you to check with the place of purchase or laptop manufacturer (these laptop kits are built by a manufacturer like hp, dell, or asus but using most of the components from intel) for integration instructions and details.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the card shows up but it won't install the drivers properly (they install but they never bind to the device).,also the bluetooth portion is reporting some sort of power error now.,"the bios is not updated because...i can't, for some reason.","i can't find a matching bios file to this motherboard (the board reports as a ""pro-h510m-c2"" in the ezflash utility in the bios, i ended up calling asus about it) and won't use the pro-h510m-c or pro-h510m-ct (which is what i thought this board was when i bought it) bios files.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is the model for the motherboard in cpu-z or hwinfo?,cpu-z or hwinfo are utilities that can be downloaded from the internet.,i only see pro-h410m-c2 online.,are you sure it's 510 and not 410?,i would remove the card because you may have a defective card or the motherboard doesn't actually support cnvi cards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hwinfo also says it's a pro-h510m-c2 (it's definitely not the h410m because my board only has one pci slot).,"i'm using it with a core i5 11600k, which the h410m doesn't support.","the sticker on the board says it's a pro-h510m-ct, which is what it was sold as (i bought it used).","i ended up buying two more wifi cards (an ax210 and an ac 9560, which is my last resort since i never enjoy building a system with dying standards if i can help it).",i'll return whatever doesn't work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i believe you.,the pro-h510m-c doesn't have the cnvi slot.,also rule out this motherboard.,it's possible to use the pro-h510m-ct bios file safely.,the flash utility double checks that the correct bios file is being flashed to the correct motherboard.,impossible to mess up a motherboard.,i'm using ax210 on a nuc hackintosh and works very well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm sure i could use that bios safely but i don't know how to force-feed the board the bios file when it keeps rejecting it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, using ami's own tools, i was able to reflash the bios to the correct one for this motherboard (pro-h510m-ct/csm).","so that hurdle's cleared (although for some reason i lost the ability to get spd info from my ram, which is weird).","no improvement on the wifi front, though, so i'll have to use those alternate cards and hope one of those works.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this should be the most competitive cpu releases from both companies ever but i feel intel is going to have large value and price advantage over amd.,existing 600 series boards that have fallen in price plus ddr4 support will make the entry much cheaper than zen 4. i expect 2x pch x670 motherboards to be more expensive than z690 boards were a year ago and even still you are not guaranteed to get a pcie5 x16 on every board which is really dumb.,"while ddr5 pricing is better than last year, it's still bad.",the good kits are still $250+.,"going into next year, if amd still has no lower end cpu releases like zen 3 launch then they will be completely bodied by locked intel cpus in \~$200 market which has been amd's bread and butter forever now.",so i think overall performance differences will be a wash but value difference seems to be big.,am5 will get going from their 2nd generation where they likely increase core count and with a mature platform.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

might upgade from a 9900k toa 13900k for 1440p 144hz.surely the difference in 1% and general low fps should be significantly  higher.,also wished they released e-coreless version of these cpu's :/ would turn them off anyway for a gaming rig.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i mean, i pity whoever has to cool this thing, but if this performance is achievable at a reasonable wattage amd is just fucked.","thereâ€™s no way a 16-core 7950x can get to 54% faster than the 5950x, and on top of all that the 13900k should be considerably cheaper.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at how any watts ðÿ¤£ ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
interesting how this leaks the day after the ryzen 7000 leaks where the top skew of those were hitting 5.7ghz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
amd ryzen 5 and 7 will get absolutely demolished on all fronts.,amd seriously needs to up their core count.,they are asking 300$ for only 6 cores,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"54% faster multi-core, but more than double the tdp, yup, nothing insane here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cool but whats the power draw?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably also uses like 400w to do so.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if itâ€™s under $600 iâ€™ll swap out my 12900 for one of these!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sureee well believe it when we see it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5.8ghz?,are we back in the pentium 4-era or am i missing something?,this will heat up a house!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"remember, this is 5.8 ghz which is unrealistic for real-life usage.","of course the 13900k is going to be better than the 5950x, but so will the amd ryzen 7950x.",remember to observe and evaluate unbiasedly when viewing numbers like these!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as much as i like intel, if they don't make anything that's better with windows 10, i'll probably swap to ryzen when i upgrade.","from what i've heard, windows 10 still isn't flawless with knowing how to use e cores vs p cores and it's unfortunate",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 12900ks is already barely coolable with a custom loop.,whatâ€™s the requirement for the 13900?,dry ice?,ln2 for 14th gen?,liquid helium for 15th?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ill have to retire my 5.4 ghz all core 12900 ks early  it will a 6 ghz 13900 ks bin cant wait,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so it was running at the boost clock during the entire test, doesn't that tell us they were using exotic cooling?",like liquid nitrogen?,how else do you force a modern cpu to keep boosting?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the current r23 leak has it at 2277/39086.,should be a nice battle between the 13900k and 7950x.,love to see it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
building a new rig this fall.,"i have everything except the cpu, mobo and ram.",currently using an i7-6700.,ray tracing and dlss beats the crap out of my cpu.,this is going to be a hell of an upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"quick question:  
i know it's too early to tell since 13th gen is not yet out but:  
any estimates / predictions for raptor lake power consumption?",can an 850 watt power supply (e.g.,"cooler master xg850 rgb platinum psu) handle:  
\-13700k   
\- gigabyte aorus 3080ti   
\- four sticks of ddr4 ram (64gb config = four sticks of 16 gb)  
\- z790 motherboard  
\- all stock / factory default settings (fully-automatic)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
first 5950x boosts to 5.7ghz and then new rumour says 13900k boosts to 5.8ghz.,i'm bit skeptical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wondering if i shlould upgrade my 12600kf straight to a used 13900 in a year or two?,got z690 tomahawk ddr board with strong vrms and quality 360 aio exactly for that reason when i built my pc.,"double
performance in cinebench r23 multi core?",get 20k points on 12600k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so far from what the test will show im really tempted to try out a ryzen build if they compare.,anything that works different when having a amd cpu?,i only ever had intel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i f****** love capitalism when it works!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there's no comparison.,"a brand new, long term support and cheap platform vs a dead end platform at a premium price with lesser features weights heavily on amd's favor.","like, b650 is going to have most of the features of z790 for a fraction of the proce while x670 and x670e will bring proper pcie 5 support (unlike intel) and much more expandability for competitive prices ans will support at least one more ryzen generation.",considering both 13th gen and 7000 series will perform very similarly (besides power draw) the superior platform will probably dictate where enthusiasts go.,i love my z590 hero and it has lots of features that i struggled to find on x570 boards so i went intel but **for me the x670 and especially the x670e seem like *the* platforms to get hedt-like features and performance for a 2022-2023 build.,also considering how arrow lake is so behind schedule amd will likely be the default choice until early 2024.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"might be wishful thinking, but if the cpu and gpu makers can end up all within about 5-10% of each other then no one is going to feel justified in price gouging and we might see some real deals on great kit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am worried about the heat though.,i am eyeing 13700k or equivalent zen4 cpu and whichever has lesser power consumption and heat is what i will go for.,"considering the rtx 4000 series (or rdna3) expected power usage, wouldn't want the processor also to pull lot of watts.","of course, zen4 also to be 5.5ghz+ and need to check their power consumption and heat as well.",competition is good as you can pick based on your criteria.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good times ahead for psu manufacturers too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
these are all engineering samples.,the intel ones in particular get pushed high because board vendors need to ensure their boards don't explode when the typical intel oc'er tries to get an extra 500mhz out of the cpu.,"this is also geekbench, which isn't useful for estimating real-world performance.","case in point, rocket lake (11th-gen) beats zen 3 (ryzen 5000) in geekbench, while zen 3 destroys rocket lake in games, 3d rendering, (de)compression, photoshop, premiere, code compilation, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on what games you play.,if you are cpu limited you can get up to 45% or so better improvements on a 12700k.,generally most games donâ€™t benefit from the added e cores beyond the 8 p cores at this time.,if you are cpu limited and want better framerates in those games ask yourself if the cost is worth a best case 50% improvement.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you are talking only for gaming, yeah there is a improvement because of the core count and other things, even with games only using 6 or 8 cores, in 1440p i dont know if that processor change would matter too much, but it depends on what games you play and you could get a massive performance boost on a game, and just a little bit in other game.",but on multitasking etc the difference is powerful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™ve got a 10900k and i play on 1440p 240hz.,absolutely skipping this tier as well as the best possible upgrade we can get right now are through gpus.,most games are **not** pushing 8 cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe.,wait for reviews.,"never pre-order any intel cpu, because the performance is always worse than what leaks suggest it will be.","i'm reminded of how rocket lake (11th gen) beat zen 3 in leaked geekbench results, but once released, was significantly slower in games, content creation, workstation tasks...basically everything.","also ran much hotter, required expensive cooling, and was in some cases slower than 10th-gen.

it's clear raptor lake (13th-gen) will be faster than alder lake (12th-gen).","it will, however, probably not perform as well as people expect.",i'd be surprised if zen 4 wasn't faster in gaming.,"the only saving grace is, raptor lake will support ddr4, though raptor lake is a dead-end platform with 0 upgrades.","zen 4 launches with am5 motherboards, which will get at least another two cpu generations of upgrades.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™ve got a 10700k too and the thing is still a monster.,if youâ€™re concerned about its capabilities get a cpu load program and run it while your gaming and check its load.,i donâ€™t think thereâ€™s anything out there that is gonna max it out and keep your pc from running smoothly right now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would wait for 14th gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what framerates are you targeting?,i have a i9-10850k and a 3080 ti and my monitor is 3440x1440 @175hz.,i get good framerates but even the i9-12900k can be an improvement of up to 10-15fps.,but the biggest difference in most cases is that the minimum framerates improve and cause less stuttering.,i'm personally most likely going to upgrade to the i9 of the 13th generation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is your monitor 120hz+?,"if so, then yes.","if not, then no.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"5950x is a 2 year old product, i would hope that the new top end from both amd and especially intel (it's their 2nd generation product after 5950x was released) would beat it, if it wouldn't it would be a disaster.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"let's look at it a bit differently:

the 13900k has 8 hyper-threaded performance cores, that are faster than zen 4's cores.","then you have another 16 non hyper-threaded efficiency cores, that are slower than zen 4's cores, for a total of 32 threads.","the 7950x has 16 fully fledged hyper-threaded cores and, again, a total of 32 threads.","the 13900k is gonna be running at a 5.5ghz all-core boost clock on the p-cores and 4.5ghz all-core boost clock on the e-cores, going by current rumors and leaked info.","the 7950x is rumored to have a 5.7ghz single-core boost clock, so the all-core boost clock should land somewhere around 5.1-5.2-5.3ghz which i think is a reasonable assumption.","then of course you have the ipc improvements on both rpl-s and zen 4, you have the cache improvements on both rpl-s and zen 4, etc.","going by all these numbers, if i had to make a reasonable guess, rpl-s will take the st crown by a slight margin (5 to 10%) while the mt performance should be neck-and-neck, with amd possibly winning by an even smaller margin (5% or less) compared to st.

and one more thing to consider, is how much thermal headroom those cpus will have under full load, which will play an important role in the *sustained* all-core boost clocks.","if anything, i think it's fair to say this will be the closest battle between the intel/amd top dog skus we've had in a long while.",exciting times.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they said it was running at the maximum boost clock the entire time for this test, so it was most likely running on liquid nitrogen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5nm 230w vs 7nm 144w.,the 12900k needs 241w to match the 144w 5nm 5950x.,the 7950x probably boosts 500mhz higher vs 5950x at the same power draw.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is an overclocked cpu most likely running on liquid nitrogen and with power limits disabled.,that's why it keeps boosting during the entire test.,so we can't really conclude anything from this leak.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ryzen went through its growing pains with 1000 and 2000, started to become really good with 3000 and amazing with 5000.  
nothing to be worried about when going for an amd system nowadays.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"from the very beginning i used amd... starting with duron, then everything went further... athlon barton and so on to ryzen... and only this year i took the system to 12700k.... and damn it... me it got boring - it works ... it just works .. set it and forgot ... for me, switching to intel turned out to be very boring in terms of ""does not work - you have to pick, you need to edit the bios, you need to even twist ... adjust""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have been amd for a while, but the stability of their products are always a bit lackluster.",especially with fixing issues.,they still have not fixed the c-state issue on linux for ryzen 1 and never will.,they acknowledged and move on without giving a shit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not really.,intel is a tiny bit better for running vmâ€™s and has avx 512 support if you needed it.,intel also tends to play nicer with ram but itâ€™s not like it was with first or second generation ryzen ram issues.,"other than that, just pick what chip better suits your needs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nah, it's the same.",problems can arise if you're trying to use software or hardware designed with intel in mind though.,that's why i'm probably going to switch back to intel for my next upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel  cpu has gpu built in (?),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
b650 and x670 boards won't be particularly cheap unless they cut pcie 5.0 support.,"x670e boards like the recently announced crosshair x670e hero will likely cost 700 usd or more, and you end up with a poor ddr5 trace layout as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">a brand new, long term support and cheap platform vs a dead end platform at a premium price with lesser features weights heavily on amd's favor.","you're making a lot of assumptions here, and i think you'd be extremely lucky to have even half of those right.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cpus will be pretty close in performance if the rumor mill is correct.,"on the gpu side, i really do not know yet.","third competitor in the that segment should help if the battlemage release is in any way successful (i am well aware of the issues with arc, but the driver side of those issues is pretty well addressed for the next gen also now at the same time).",also the significant oversupply in the silicon reservations should push down prices.,"overall, i would be quite surprised if this next gen would not be a great time to build a pc (i personally am just looking for a new gpu and i will only buy that one also if the deals a nice).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you're worried about heat just set the tdp lower on either cpu.,"amd and intel will probably intentionally break the power budget to get ""leads"" on each other, even though all of these parts would be substantially more efficient at around 125~150w stock rather than the 230w+ we're likely going to see.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"who cares, just set it to 150w or 175w in the bios and it's smooth sailing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't know.,i currently run my 5950x pulling over 200w at full load and cooled by an air cooler.,i have zero issues with that.,getting really worried about something that is easy to control (cpu power draw) should not be an issue.,additionally being worried about +- 50w on the cpu and then adding 200w extra on the gpu without a question just seems like somewhat weird decision making process.,i am not worried about cpu power draw.,"you can decide to push it or you can decide to take it easy, the diminishing returns and your own needs decide on the sweet spot that you will take and it will be fine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah i 'downgraded' from 1kw to 750w when i bought my new psu, thinking the days of silly power consumption were behind us.",i guess it comes in cycles now.,"rtx 5k, zen 5, 89xxxt and i714xxxk will probably all be a small performance bump but halve the power consumption.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
like the fermi era all over again.,at least we donâ€™t have to use delta screamer fans to cool our cpus anymore.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thats true, i mean most games still haven't fully utilized 6 cores.",even aaa games.,i guess i was at least hoping maybe a decent 20% upgrade from 10700k to 13700k?,for 1440p?,"of course gpus will be always the way to go for upgrades, but, you know the demand will be high at first for the 40 series, and overpriced.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that is true, i seen some tests where 10700k would outperform a bit vs 11700k.",you don't think that amd new mobos will also have the option for ddr 4 kits?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, i do have an fps monitoring program.",and pretty much all my games running at 1440p don't go above 60% of usage.,its usually 25 to 45% as my avg for cpu usage at 1440p.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seems like the more logical sense.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have 1440p 165hz monitor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
beating it by 54% is commendable however,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"still, 50%+ increase in such a short timespan is insanely impressive.",and it's not even like ryzen 5000 was bad.,"intel 12th gen comparisons vs 11th gen felt like cheating, but that's not really the case here imo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">5950x is a 2 year old product,

maybe zen 4 shouldnt have come out 2 years after zen 3?",nothing from intel at sane power limits came close to 5950x when 5950x launched,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i suppose it's incredible because the previous generation was on par with the 5950x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this applies to zen4 as well.,zen3 too when that came out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™ll refine this estimate:

single-threaded: 
- the 12900k is roughly 20% faster than the 5950x.","a previous mlid leak said that the people at intel are expecting an 8-15% st increase across the lineup, and in the case of the 13900k, i think we can refine this estimate.","5% faster stock clocks and 5% higher ipc seems reasonable, leading to the 13900k being 32.3% faster in single-threading than the 5950x.","- the 7950x has roughly 9% higher ipc than the 5950x, and at stock the 5950x appears to clock at 5.05ghz single-core, but letâ€™s be charitable and say it only hits 4.9. then the 7950x clocks 16.3% faster than the 5950x, and as such is 26.7% faster than the 5950x.","- conclusion: it depends how hard you push each chip, but iâ€™m expecting the 13900k to win by about 5%.","multithreaded:
- here, iâ€™d draw on an old comment of mine from a redgamingtech vid, if i can find it: basically, iâ€™m expecting the 13900k to win by single digits here too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
problem with amd compared to intell is how heat is wicked away from the die.,cpu cooler still don't know how to properly align themselves for perfect cooling due to the multichiplet design.,"i use the offset bracket for my 5900x and yea it got me like 3-5 degree reduction, but that cpu is still spikier than any intel chip i ever had, and i pushed a 5960x to 4.7ghz at 1.385v before.",hopefully the new ihs for ryzen 7k has sorted these issues out a bit.,i remember reading amd is putting like a thin layer of gold on the underside of the ihs where it contacts the die to help combat these issues.,can't remember if true or not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rpl-s ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"actually the leaked 7600x benchmark shows zen 4 will have a 10-20% st perf over rpl, but their multi thread suffers cant beat alder lake in the mid tier cpus.",most likely we're seeing amd will gain the st crown while surrendering the mt crown to intel in quite a plot twist.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not that bad i guess !,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

12th gen doesn't play well with vmware.,having both p-cores and e-cores is a nightmare for virtualization.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel does not have avx-512 that's incorrect.,only if you buy server hardware.,consumer parts lost it when intel started cutting the die on 12th gen after users found out they could enable it on early revisions by disabling eco cores.,now 13th gen won't make that mistake and will have it fused off from the foundry to begin with.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what makes it wrong as long as i am going to buy a chip that meets my performance targets and of wattage in general?,"companies are pushing them, like you said, without a care for power targets.",and i don't like that.,but we only have like 2 companies - so i end up having to buy one of them anyway.,"so, all i am doing is buying a chip that's pushing slightly less than the other.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
generally non k processors have lesser turbos then k ones.,so performance difference will be there.,"not saying it's bad but if the wattage of an amd chip is lower at same performance as the intel k variant, then its better to buy that than the non k part.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wait what?,where did i mention price at all?,"and why are you saying ""cost is same no matter the power limit"" when i wasn't even worrying about the cost factor?",isn't it better to buy something of equal performance but does less power and heat?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what?,not sure what you mean.,"all i am saying is i will compare an amd chip and an intel chip of equivalent performance, and pick one that uses less power and heat.",not sure why i need to solve anything for that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
totally.,the way people perceive brands is based on their high end performance and end up buying mid range or low end.,this is why even amd is pushing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i never said you prefer anything.,i asked if it bothers you that amd uses power limits.,your comment wasnâ€™t about comparing watts it was that it bothers you that there is a power limit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think that what he means by wrong way to look at it is that you are bothered by paying for a performance and lowering it a little, what i understand, but in the end its all just marketing.","in the past the chips could go to lets say 120 but the companies advertized it as 100 stock, so you could use it at 100 or push it to 120, now they changed strategy to already push it to 120 out of the gate and give you the option to bring it down back to 100. 

the end result is the same, only the feeling changes, if you undervolt now you are letting unused capacity the same way if you didnt overclocked before.","as an exemple i have a 6700k since launch and never overclocked it, i know i could probably get it to 4.5ghz and that i am losing performance i paid for, it will be the same if i get a 13700k and restrain it a little.","but again, i understand you, limiting it will feel... wrong.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"considering there are no issues, yes.",but am4 was plagued with early ram issues and even today there are still ftpm stutters and even usb issues still persisting.,that alone would make me hesitant to buy a first gen am5 system.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
im saying the price youd pay for the cpu would be the same no matter what tdp it was advertised at.,obviously its better to buy something of equal performnace that draws less power but in order to determine that you have to run the 2 cpus at same power limits.,else the test is useless.,say i have cpu a at 100watts and 200 performance and cpu b at 200 watts and 300 performance.,"you'd buy cpu a cause it looks more efficient, id buy cpu b and power limit it to 100w",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"although it's up to you, i also think you can feel good if you pay the same price for the higher frequency k model.",then you use your freedom to tweak the processor to unlock better efficiency thus less power usage.,then you will feel like a superhero because you have the best performance and the best efficiency.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how do you know which one uses less power and heat?,"tech notice reviewed the 12900k vs the 5950x and found that although intel used more power on a complete all core workload, it finished faster and used less power on idle resulting in a lower average power consumption than the 5950x.",so make sure to compare things like idle power draw as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"pretty sure many boards don't like 12, 24, 48gb etc ram.",also even if it's same model and kit it's not guaranteed to work together.,it's why buying two 2 of 2x8 kit won't mean they'll run well.,there's a reason why 4x8 kits exist:-),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i am totally with you on that.,"gigabyte ddr4 mobos of alder lake also had memory controller issues - weirdly for ddr4 and not 5. thankfully, it seems to be limited to one oem.",alder lake also had this bending issue.,"one of the reasons why i didn't get tempted, not to mention my 4k gaming system isn't going to gain any fps from 9900k to 12700k/900k.",minimums may be better but not worth it yet.,"similarly, i totally expect issues with am5 , but less with rpl as it's already one gen older w.r.t ddr5 impl.",i will be waiting until early review cycle is expired and realistic reviews set i.e.,2-3 months from launch.,i am not in any hurry with 9900k.,early stock and the price also not going to be easy.,don't wanna beta test for others.,"if rpl is really bringing average fps and min fps at 4k that mich better (>15% from 9900k), then i will be definitely tempted.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, that's stupid.",i never said performance/watt ratio.,so i don't know why you are putting words in my mouth.,"all i said was rhe ""performance i am looking for"" and ""equivalent performance"" meaning in your own terms - if i am looking for 300 performance being enough, then i will look at an amd chip of that performance and an intel chip of same performance figures, then compare the watt figures.",where did i talk about perf/watt ratio?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"> arctic freezer 34

unlikely, what's the average room temp when it hit 90âºc?",and max room temp ever possible?,"it is possible and likely that the fan in the back is not set to increase it's speed based on the motherboard temperature, which could result in higher internal temp, which then would result in higher cpu temps, as the delta would be tighter.","if u know how to set this in bios, try to make sure it's running at full speed when the motherboard is above 45âºc or motherboard vrm is above 50âºc 

on air coolers u do need extra external fans, or at least make sure it's cooling faster when the motherboard is heating up, not only when the cpu is burning, cause any increase in the internal temperature will reduce the efficiency of the cpu cooler.","also if the internal temperature is often above 45âºc i's likely it will cause damage to other parts, ssds or hdds for instance, motherboard vrm,...

&#x200b;

that's one of the reasons that make cheap pcs to end up costing higher than expensive ones in the longer term in regions where the room temp is above 30âºc, cause if the room temp is around 35, the internal temp is likely to be at 50, therefore all devices will easily go above the 70âºc and most hdds and ssd are not designed to work that hot, much less ram, cpu or gpu, that with air cooler with internal temp like that will end up going up to the 80 easily,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"we just passed a bill to keep technology like this in america and the two american companies that developed optane are like, 'nah we don't want to produce this american product in america.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
landfill,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just needs a company to bring the price down, it has fantastic write endurance and latency that makes it particularly useful for use cades such as swap or write caching for flash.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they already tried that, the memory maker pulled out (micron).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they have to be able to sell it though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
donâ€™t forget the random read/write performance.,price is the real problem though.,"nand could have better performance if manufacturers still makes slc drives, but nowadays we mostly see tlc/qlc drives because of their lower price per gb.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's micron's failure to capitalize on it more than anything.,they have an objectively superior technology and it's getting dunked in the trash can.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
absolutely coward move if true,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and there lies the issue.,we all support the idea of â€œmade in americaâ€.,"the problem is as americans most of us(not all), are unwilling to pay the extra premium to buy a product made in america, and american companies in general are always going to be â€œprofitsâ€ first.",these one time incentives to build fabs in america is backward.,the incentives should be purchase discounts that go direct to the buyers when buying american.,i donâ€™t trust corporate america to use the incentives they get ethically.,instead they line the pockets of their executives.,until the incentives are shifted to the consumer/corporate buyer none of this is going work long term.,itâ€™s just going to create a bunch of political and corporate marketing sound bites short term.,you donâ€™t need a harvard education to realize this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they did sell it.,"did you mean, ""they still have to sell it as profitably as their most profitable portfolios?""",">but ultimately intel were sitting on a bunch of 3d xpoint memory, and the price was so high that sales were slow.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there's actually some neat stuff happening in low latency, high random iops nand, but it's all aimed at data center and especially cxl.",i don't think we are going to see consumer grade low latency nvme products again any time soon after how poorly optane consumer parts failed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's one thing if the price premium was 2x or something but it wasn't.,it was more along the lines of $0.10 per gb versus $2.00 per gb.,"good random r/w speeds or not, nobody is going to pay that sort of premium for something that feels only marginally faster in 99% of what people use a pc for.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it depends how much it cost to produce.,"if you can't drive down the costs, then maybe there little to no market for it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think the problem was more that very few people wanted to buy it.,the market wants cheap nvme storage and doesn't really value lower latency while the xpoint dimm product had a lot more interest but was painful to utilize in software.,as a result they couldn't sell what they made and ended up with enough left over parts to keep selling long after they stopped production.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nand used to cost more than $2 a gb.,it took decades for it to reach an economy of scale where we see it today at close to $50/tb.,optane would probably reach similar scale if it was under the leadership of a company with the patience to get it there and compete with the nand market.,early adopter fees(tm) are always expensive af.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bom is always cheap as chips.,"once the r&d gets paid for and it scales up it would meet/beat, nand",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep.,>intelâ€™s productization had to crap the bed with terrible 16gb caching drives first because management wanted to see a more immediate return.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nand used to cost more than that but it was competing against traditional hdd's.,optane drives exist in an environment where they compete against 232-layer 3d nand ssd's which can do most of the same things to a good degree.,the cost reduction per gb of nand coincided with the increase in 3d stacking and my understanding is that intel was having technical problems replicating that strategy with their phase change material.,would they have overcome that problem with more volume?,unknown.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
two years ago they were hyping up their second-gen 4-layer 3d xpoint chips when 3d nand was already up to 128 layers.,i've read that 3d stacking for xpoint might have never been cheap enough to be viable.,i've also heard the manufacture of the special phase change material is more difficult and simply won't ever be as cheap as nand.,you can blame micron all you want but intel deserves just as much.,"intel pulled out of the consumer market, as usual, and where are you going to get the volume you need to scale up if not there?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"given the age and era of that motherboard, i would check everywhere for blown capacitors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

* to make this situation worse, intel is telling aib to focus on low margin sales for oem and systems integrators instead of focusing on retail sales

it's actually not uncommon to go back to an old bios with the same settings & the cpu runs hotter.,gigabyte boards are the more famous boards for it.,"what happens is the settings don't always reset to zero with a bios change, so you need to pull the cmos battery & that'll correct the issue.",there has been an exception to this in the past (x570 aorus master rev 1.0) but it never causes major problems \~ you needed to pull the battery & re-flash the bios twice to fix it unless you got unlucky.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the â€œbase speedâ€ is a meaningless spec from intel that you will never need or see.,"the cpu varies its frequency - of every core, many times a second - depending on workload.","at idle, it will drop as low as 400mhz to save power and reduce heat.",one core under load can go as high as 5.2ghz.,"all p-cores under full sustained load, assuming you are not thermal or power throttling, will maintain 4.9ghz indefinitely.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"4.9ghz - full 24 thread load

">mine has no overclock

mce is essentially a factory overclock, increasing power allowing the cpu to boost and stay higher than intel intended.",if you disable it your power draw will go down.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it boosts automatically.,locked means you can't manually adjust it to go higher.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you'll never see 4.9ghz.,"it's the turbo 3.0 value, which hasn't worked correctly since broadwell e.  there used to be an intel turbo 3.0 utility that let you specify affinity for your best cores, but once turbo 3.0 got rolled into win10 it lost something, hasn't worked right since.",4.8ghz is the highest you'll see on a locked 12700 for this reason (i own one).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"how does that work, does it analyse what game you are playing?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
even on the f variant?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, through load, if it gets pushed it will clock higher till it hits 4.9 single core, i'm not sure what all core boost is for that cpu is.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 12700 and 12700f have identical performance.,the f just denotes that the cpu does not have integrated graphics.,meaning you will need a gpu if you want some sort of output in terms of a display.,"the k variant however, comes with on board integrated graphics but most importantly is also the unlocked version, meaning that you are able to manually overclock the cores to whatever values you see fit, within reasonable working parameters for additional performance but also higher temperatures for which you will need better cooling.",i hope that helps to give you a bit of a better understanding of it all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

* going from one 240mm aio to another 240mm aio will not solve anything for you
* never heard of that air cooler, does not look anything special to me either
* looking at some hardware monitor: how much w is the cpu pulling when reaches 100c temps?",(it should be over 210w for those temps to make any sense because i cool 200+w with scythe fuma 2 \[fans switched to arctic p12's x 3\] and noctua nh-d15 air coolers).,"* what is your pump speed (should be 100% at that point)
* what are your fan speeds when at 100c?","* what case you have, is the ventilation there good?",* have you tested if temps drop if the side of your case is open (if they do drop significantly: your case ventilation is crap).,* have you overclocked your cpu?,if so: what are your settings?,* what motherboard you have.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ok about the wattage under gaming load, i trace it in rivatuner and i assum its less than 100w

pump speed is at max 3000+ rpm 

overall fan speed goes to maximum

the case is msi mag forge 100r, a compact case for sure, the fan layout is: 2 fans in front, 1 in the rear, 2 aio fans on top

i have not tested without the side panels open

i have not oced everything is at default

mobo is asus prime z590-p",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but 10700k is lga1200 if i am right.,isn't that ok?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
100w should definitely not be 100 celsius.,that is miniscule load.,just check it.,use hwinfo64 for example.,post results of cpu wattage and temps in imgur.,your case should be ok. test temps with side panel open to check it.,test temps running cinebench23 multicore test to get maximum load on the cpu.,check that your aio mounting is fine and thermal paste has been properly applied and properly spreads out.,"check that you have not forgotten the plastic sticker on bottom of your aio cooler (i know, a stupid comment, but people do forget that and then we troubleshoot and that is at fault...).",what is your intake/outflow fan config: which fans push and which pull.,overall the fan situation you have should be enough.,update bios.,check bios cpu settings (you really should be able to overclock with that cooler of yours.,"if you are overheating with standard settings, then your cooling is somehow faulty or your standard settings are really weird.",i would personally try a modest overclock with nice voltages to control the power delivery and see if that actually lowers temps) - reset bios settings and just set xmp for your ram.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oops, i've read 12700. sorry and ignore my comment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
unfortunately i am away from the pc for a few days so i wont be able to share pics.,i will definitely check with side panel open and post the results here later.,"when i run cpu-z multicore stress testing, the cpu reaches 100c and keeps being there, and it is intereating that the pc does not crash or shut down or the cpu wont downclock.i remember uaing cinebench and getting the same results this beast wont just stop it kept processing at 100c.","i did remounting and repasting two times a couple months ago and the temps came under control for just a few days, then hight temps happened again.","idle cpu temps are 35-39

about the fan setup, 2 front case fans are intake fans, 1 rear fan is an exhaust fan and two aio fans are also exhaust ones on top( i can feel heat going out)

how does one get themselves in this situation?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"what do you mean by ""how do i know which pins are which?""",?,and this is called socket.,it's almost not fixable since pins are broken.,"you might try to bend bent pins to correct places and find cpu pinout, if any power pin is broken don't even try to put cpu and boot, if some data pins are broken you might try to boot since you for 99% won't do any harm to rest of hw.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i count at least 54 pins on there that are bent in some way, and many of them mangled beyond repair.",you are not going to be able to fix that and get a working board.,"you can send the board and pay to get a new socket installed, however itâ€™s unlikely to be worth the time and expense.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i managed to fix my motherboard which had 3-4 pins bent just like yours in the picture.,"however there seems to be too many in your case :(

fwiw, to fix mine, i have pointed my ipads camera on the damaged area and zoomed in as much as possible without losing clarity.",then i carefully pushed pins back into position with a needle while watching what i am doing on ipad screen.,i donâ€™t know if it is actually an easy job or i was lucky but the pc is still running strong after 3 years.,good luck,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a repair shop can probably replace whole socket.,might be costly though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
someone was juggling a cpu over a socket.,only replacing the socket with a new one will help here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just rip!,cut your losses dude.,frame the board.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
damn.,that sucks.,"bending all the pins back is your best bet, honestly.",hopefully you don't break any.,"go real slow and careful, that's a lot of pins tho.","good luck, godspeed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"honestly, considering the fact that the pins are waaaay off and so many, it's not worth the trouble/risk, booting this up could end up in so many other stuff burnt that could cost twice the motherboard price.","you could look for someone that fixes motherboards, it's a lesser risk, but still, unless it's 1\~5 pins that u can clearly see and be 100% sure that they are correct, i would never even try to boot it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fixing one or two bent pins on an lga socket is exceedingly difficult.,i wouldn't consider this within the realm of repair.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just buy yourself a new motherboard.,donâ€™t risk your cpu or youâ€™ll have double the bill to replace parts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
contact asus directly.,explain what happened and they will fix it for you.,i had the unfortunate experience of accidently dropping the cpu on the motherboard when doing an install.,it bent several pins and i was so upset.,all i had to pay was the shipping cost.,asus repaired it at no additional cost.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"you can bend them back into position, it will just take patience and a delicate hand.",and a magnifying glass so you can see better.,"you're other option is to rma the board but you might be sol if you caused it, and you have to have that cover to send it back btw.","there are tons of youtube tutorials on how to do it, just watch them, find the right tools or go buy them and take your time, and you'll get it done!","i know its a little late now but i always have a firm grip and keep the protector on until i have it near the socket, then flip it open and set it down slowly, then give it a little wiggle.",then close it and let that cover pop off.,and i have the corner that needs to go into the specific spot already oriented the right way.,"i just switched to amd and got a 5700x for a good deal, and always find they pga go in super easy.","no cover to worry about, all you have to worry about is not dropping the cpu which is true for intel cause you dont wanna drop a cpu regardless lol.","google is your friend here, just dont bend them back and forth to much or they will work harden and snap then your screwed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sorry man, you don't.",you buy another board.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if it is under warranty, bring it in and see what they could do.",however if it's not under warranty they might charge you more than what you paid for the motherboard itself,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very slim chance you'll be able to get that motherboard to work again.,you'll need to somehow very carefully bend the pins back to normal and hope it works or buy a new motherboard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hard to tell from pic but if the pins are not broken off you can very carefully bend them back and brush the pins in the direction of the other pins,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's garbage now sadly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
guess you learned the hard way to use the cover for next time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if it was one or two pins, then you could've tried just going for it anyways.",at best you lost a grounding pin and so it doesn't affect anything.,"you could also go through the effort to bend the bent pins back into place, but doing that for one pin is hard enough.","when it's this bad, there's really nothing to do except get a new mobo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there are so many pins working for same function it won't affect cpu to not work try bending pins slowly as they should be or if you just bought try contacting asus by making excuses like happened by accident.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would recommend not to fix that yourself.,contact who ever did the transport and get the money from them.,thatâ€™s a big fault.,donâ€™t try to repair it.,"at the point where you try if it worked youâ€™ll need to put a cpu in it, which could damage the cpu and your system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's a good few pins, so before i point you in the direction of identifying them i should note that you can only lose so many non-critical pins before they become critical, i do not know what the threshold is for that.",exceed that threshold and you risk harm to your processor or further harm to your socket/motherboard as things could get quite crispy.,however if you'd like to look it up i'll try to point you in the right direction.,"to find out what the pins are you'll need  volume 1 of the intelâ® 500 series chipset family platform controller hub (pch) from here:

you have to request for a refund.,that is total negligence of shipping safety.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the best thing to try is to bend all the pins still there into place and plugging a cpu in see what happens.,if the missing pins are critical youâ€™ll find out then,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not even some bubble wrap??,?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
asus replaced the entire socket for me.,they only changed me for shipping to and from california.,it took around a week and a half.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

testing the cpu on it wont damage it?,?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this sounds like nonsense, because it is a violation of the asus warranty service regulations.","if you slightly bent a few socket lamellas, they would be aligned and no one would change the socket, this is a complicated and not quick procedure, as for a warranty service.","replacing a socket is the most difficult motherboard repair procedure, more difficult than replacing any other socket, connector on the board.","in my country, asus removed devices from warranty even if they were just used for commercial purposes, and gross damage to the socket is 100% void of warranty.","therefore, most likely you just had the lamellas aligned, if you just tell the truth that you contacted the official service center.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if no pins were lost you could have tried to bend them back,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why would you even want to test it and risk damaging the cpu too?,the board is completely fucked.,unfixable.,stop looking for validation or reasons to try using a broken motherboard.,"go buy a new one, or pay to have the oem replace the socket for $100-200 and wait 2 months.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nah it will either work it wonâ€™t.. i think.,iâ€™m not an expert so maybe try asking someone else or not taking the risk,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i did call asus directly.,who they connected me with was in california.,the repair receipt said socket replacement.,it wasn't very detailed and entirely possible that just replaced the portion of pins that were bent.,the serial number contained an r at the end when they returned it to me.,they did say if the repair was more extensive then there would be some charges.,they also said my board would be considered refurbished but still be covered by the general warranty period.,i guess i got lucky and it wasn't as serious as you are stating.,i really don't appreciate being called a liar.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"unfortunately lost a couple pins, 6-8 i think",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
someone here implied it will mess up the cpu if i test it on the board,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so i'm telling you if the repair was not significant, they could tell you anything, the repair had to be somehow marked in the asus database.","of course, if they have not withdrawn from the guarantee, then you still have a guarantee.","to change the lamellas in the socket, even a small amount, it is necessary to heat the board from below to a high temperature, and then the engineer will insert new lamellas from the donor socket with tweezers, and solder with a hot air gun.","during this procedure, the hand bakes very much from working in a hot environment.","therefore, i say that no one in their right mind will do complex procedures in out-of-warranty cases.","if more than 5 lamellas are broken in the socket, it is not rational to change the lamellas, it is easier to change the socket, but this is also a complicated procedure.","and if, in some extremely strange case, asus made an exception for you and made a difficult repair, but this, to put it mildly, is not a good decision(dk move) on their part, then there is a special service in the usa.",because in other countries they remove the device from the warranty in such cases,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the i would count my losses and save for a new one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if, it's a big if.","if you only lost ground or power pins, you might be okay with moving them back into position.",i dropped a cpu on my 2066 socket and smashed like 20 pins.,that board still runs perfectly fine after some bending.,"if any of the i/o or memory pins are broken then at best you lose some pci-e lanes, at worse the memory has no signal and it's dead.","bend your pins back, put the cpu back in and pray, or look up the pin out of the socket and see what's missing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m not sure how but i also donâ€™t know enough to confidently say itâ€™s safe.,"if the pins were touching each other or the wrong pad on the cpu something could be shorted or something, but missing pins should just be a non complete circuit.",thatâ€™s what iâ€™m thinking but as i said i dunno man hope you figure it out though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there was definitely more than just a couple of bent pins in my case.,this was also on a brand new x99 board back in 2016. my suggestion to the op was give it a shot.,maybe my case was a rare exception.,worst case scenario they tell him he is sol.,my suggestion to you would be that you don't know everything and calling people liars you don't even know is never a good way to start a conversation.,best of luck to the op!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
am tempted to try it because we have managed to bent back into position the pins now am just left with broken pins if only they were ground pins hmmm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i agree with theisyraff.,if the damage was caused by the individual who sold/shipped the mobo request a replacement or a refund.,if you caused the damage in any way forget about it.,i've fixed bent pins.,"you will need steady hands, magnifying eyeglasses, a fine needle, an x-acto knife and luck.","see: https://www.ifixit.com/guide/how+to+fix+a+bent+intel+cpu+socket+pin/140082

broken off pins, as others said, are not worth the gamble of ruining the cpu.","if this was a credit card purchase, call the credit card company and verify that you have buyer protection.","if you do have buyer protection, as i said before, call the seller and ask for a replacement or refund.",also ask for a free return label.,document the seller's response.,"if the seller does not honor their promise within an agreed amount of time, file a claim with the credit card company.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

anyone heard of trendforce before?,"me neither, good read regardless.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i call it a bullshit.,these guys have no credibility and now internet is running with this news.,that said intel could very well delay mtl.,that wont be a shocker based on recent execution.,only call out during earnings is that intel 4 is entering production in 2h 2022 and they have no other chip planned for intel 4 except mtl.,"also another thing to note is based on ""reliable leakers"" mtl will start from low powered mobile then going to higher powered cpus.",so its possible for intel to start with mtl-u/p and then go on to h/s chips several months ago.,so its possible we will only see mobile chips earlier.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tsmc is facing a yield issue.,their 3nm node is still using finfet transistors.,the same trendforce source states that apple isn't fully transitioning to tsmc 3nm until 2024.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

are we absolutely sure that intel would let zen 4 vcache run amok for close to a year or so since it's coming by the end of the year/early next year?,i mean there's always the possibility they can just make kf mtl-s...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well mtl-s is chiplet packaged so if need be and if the cpu & io side of mtl-s is ready and intel want to release it... they could in theory do that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> but just realize now that tsmc has poor yields?,"that was the case with intel's 10nm, 7nm and sapphire rapids as well

they were also """"on track"""" until they got delayed

even if all this is coming to us today, tsmc, intel, apple may have realised this way before now",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's easy to blame intel meanwhile tsmc 3nm has been delayed multiple times already.,their 2nm node won't be ready until 2025. they need asml high-na euv scanners which intel will be first to get their hands on.,intel announced 5 nodes in 4 years.,intel 20a was moved from 2025 to 2024 on the roadmap.,intel has no yield yield issues on their full euv nodes.,the loihi 2 neuromorphic chip was introduced last year using intel 4 node.,"as they keep struggling (and keep using finfet transistors at 3nm) tsmc had to come up with less dense/downgraded variants of the original n3, such as n3b, n3e nodes that have improved yields and which apple will apparently be using.",it looks like meteor lake was to use the original poorly yielding n3 process and this production postponement is a change of plan initiated by intel in order to switch to the n3b/n3e or even their own fabs if tsmc is still struggling by then.,and we don't even know if n3b and n3e will have sufficient volumes as apple is fully switching to 3nm until 2024.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fwiw zen 4 vcache won't be cheap to make...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, based on rumors raptor lake-s will be the only high end offering intel has for the next 2 years.",intel needs a vcache alternative to counter vcache.,mtl doesn't change cache and mostly focuses on efficiency.,regular ipc increase and 10% cache capacity bump isn't enough to counter vcache.,they'll have to develop their own version eventually i think.,maybe they'll just put a bunch of cache in the base tile once they start using foveros for their entire product line,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you literally listed all of intel's upcoming products not a good track record,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

same for mtl... at least zen 4 vcache reuses chiplets that didn't qualify for genoa.,"mtl doesn't reuse anything, despite being more ""disaggregated"".",that's what intel should be heading towards with their disaggregated strategy.,"maybe the base tile can be reused, and they can also repurpose mobile 6+8 dies to midrange desktop i5 -kf by not including the tgpu.",there's also an opportunity to share gpu tiles between mobile and desktop.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

>tell me one product that was planned that actually stuck to the timeline?,raptor lake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the reason vcache is more expensive is if something goes wrong with the stacking you lose a good zen 4 die.,"mtl costs are no worse than base zen 3/4 as it's ""just"" a chiplet tech.",(vs chiplets + stacking),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">at least zen 4 vcache reuses chiplets that didn't qualify for genoa

that means a ðÿ¤ðÿ» supply if tsmc's stacking is not ðÿ’©

mtl doesnt use ridiculous amount of sillicon like vcache does",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think even zen 5 won't beat zen 4 vcache in all games.,"just like how 7950x won't beat 5800x3d in all games, despite the massive difference in all core frequency and core count.",also i'd bet that zen 4 flagship will need expensive ddr5 memory to have a convincing lead on zen 3 vcache,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i think op's question isn't about e-cores running slower than the p-cores, it's about why they cannot reach the advertised 3.6ghz as listed on the spec sheet.","3.6ghz is the turbo frequency on those e-cores, not the base frequency which is 2.8ghz.",turbo is never going to be sustained at it's highest frequency as it would heat up the cpu greatly and would use a lot of power draw.,"it's called turbo for a reason, it's meant to turbo up during short burst workloads for a couple seconds or minutes and then lower itself back down.",it's not meant to be sustained.,e-cores will also never reach their full turbo speed if your main p-cores are under load.,"an example usage of turbo boost would be booting into windows, opening photoshop/premiere.",the cpu quickly turbos up to speed up and accelerate the process and lowers itself back down once no longer needed.,"you can read more about it here: 

https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000007359/processors/intel-core-processors.html",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they can't reach 3,6 because its the ""max turbo frequency"" of the e cores.",in other words: the moment the cpu leaves its pl state within a time limited scenario given by intel your cpu starts going down to clockspeeds near your base clock or something in between.,you can turn this off in intel power management tool.,there is an option which disables the time limit of high performance pl states.,or you can manually overclock it if its possible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ah yes, i had the same issue before.","its because when having a all core workload, same as the p-cores, the e-core also reduces clock from 3.6 to 3.4. for me currently using the msi b660m mortar, adjusting the 4 core boost to 3.6 does the trick.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because they are not supposed to run as fast as the performance cores.,the e-cores are spec'd for 1-1.3 ghz slower than the p-cores,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"according to your screenshot, the cpu is only using 65 watts.","that exact number canâ€™t be a coincidence since thatâ€™s the stock pl1 power limit of many non-k intel cpus - however itâ€™s not the correct limit for the 12600k, which should be pl1=125w and pl2=150w.",and most people remove them altogether since they are unnecessary in a desktop situation.,"so, first i would say your bios is potentially misconfigured.",what motherboard do you have?,"second, the correct all-core turbo frequencies for the 12600k is 4.5ghz p-core and 3.4ghz e-core, which is what youâ€™re seeing.","higher frequencies than that (like what intel advertises) will only be seen when fewer cores are under load (like 1 or 2, not all 10).","the all-core turbo limit is unrelated to the pl1/pl2 power limits, although if power limits are in place they will further limit your potential frequencies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you have already got your answer + under multicore load, it's unlikely you'll see all cores hitting full core clock speeds.","also, it's unrelated, but what gpu are you using and what settings are you using in fortnite?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

intel's bullshit marketing strikes again.,intel refuses to publish the actual specs in their documentation and on ark only lists the max speed for a limited number of cores.,i.e.,the published max turbo may only be when using one core.,in the past intel would publish the actual turbo specs but now they decline to do so.,"people think the turbo runs on some opportunistic intelligent basis balancing voltage, and temperature and power limits to squeeze out as much efficiency as possible similar to amd's pbo but that's not at all the way it actually works.",the cores have a set max frequency they will run at relative to the number of cores in use and intel deliberately obfuscates that frequency number.,most reviewers never mention it because they are either ignorant / incompetent or focus on overclocking and simply don't care.,it's absurd to do a review of cpus at stock and not mention frequencies which i see all the time.,"hell, reviewers don't even know if they have mce on half the time because they don't check the frequencies.","if you set pl1=pl2 tau infinite, you still won't exceed whatever the hard frequency limits are on the per core limits unless you manually overclock.",this is one of my biggest pet peeves.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why are you running those clocks with a 12600k?,put a 1.25vcore slap those p cores at 4.7-4.9 and e cores at 3.8.-4.0. should be easy to do,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's a 12600 not a 12600k, the specs for the 12600 is 4.4 boost clock which shows on his screen.","the 12600/12600k has 10 cores, 8 p cores and 2 e cores , the p cores have hyperthreading, it's actually boosting higher than it should.",even with 65 watt cpu's you can set all cores to the boost clock speed.,at least on my 12700f i can set all p cores to 4.9 ghz and all e cores to 3.8 ghz.,"the 12700f is a 12 core 8 p cores, 4 e cores and hyperthread on p cores with a total of 20 threads.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

because they are for efficiency in power consumption and workload dumbass.,performance cores will go higher in clockspeeds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
efficiency it's in the name while the performance cores handle upfront tasks the ecores handle any underlying background tasks so they pretty much dont need high clocks to do such be glad they dont or the thermals would probably go through the roof,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that's not strictly true anymore.,"alderlake k-sku comes by default with pl1=pl2 (so effectively ""infinite pl2 tau""), so it *can* and will run turbo indefinitely in the right circumstances.","3.6ghz turbo on e-cores is not observed here because that's only for max 2 e-cores active, with all (e-)cores under load it's limited to 3.4ghz as seen here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

turbo can and does work for at max frequency continuously.,"but it will also only work for short periods of time if it's limited by available power, heat dissipation, or tdp.",your link doesn't support your claims of turbo frequency limits.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
perhaps if you could cool them down more.,"the colder the cpu, the higher the turbo boost frequencies.",though 44c is far from hot.,they should reach at least 65c under constant load.,room for overclocking the e-cores?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"â€œitâ€™s called turbo for a reasonâ€

yes, and that reason has nothing to do with how turbos operate lol.",the reason is marketing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
true but some people maybe disappointed with what they bought or why that is.,so to those pll i say you should have done better research.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"they're not more efficient than the fast cores though, they're just slower.",usually people estimate their performance so that it takes 3 efficiency cores to perform as well as 1 of the fast cores.,"maybe it's closer to 2 though, or at least somewhere in between.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think youâ€™re confusing the limitations of not having gear multiplication with the limit of heat.,"a turbo doesnâ€™t work in bursts because it overheats, itâ€™s because you canâ€™t go any faster without shifting.",a car going max speed at redline rpm will comfortably keep the turbo pinned at max for as long as you have enough runway to not lift your foot.,"on a long enough oval track, even a $70k bmw m2 will run without the turbo heat ever lowering its output.",youâ€™ll sooner run out of gas.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

same reason your p cores are not at 4.9ghz.,remove the power limit and cool them properly and they will.,"intel's boost frequencies are opportunistic and only run at max frequency when power, voltage and thermals allow them.",in spec you will never see an intel chip run at the max boost frequency forever.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

agreed.,"a750/a770/etc aren't bad names - but when released simultaneously with a380, it's just terrible.",let's just hope next gen they go the intuitive fix and add a 1 (ie.,next gen would be a1770 and a1380 - ie.,generation:market segment:bin segment as two numbers),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

>a rare thing with intel - naming that actually makes sense.",can you explain where this comes from?,"intel naming scheme for consumer products is dead simple, and has been like that since forever.","mobility chip naming could be called wonky i guess, but it still gives you enough information about the product.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

next gen would be b380/b750/b770.,"a = alchemist, not arc, and next up is b for battlemage, c for celestial, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"going from a380 tests, it sits neatly in the middle of amd and nvidias efforts in raytracing, so a great first effort if it scales up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

depends on the volume of a770.,it's possible 750 is the big sku for board partners and 770 is intel only.,"i'd expect at least an extra 5% clock speed though on top of 14% more units, similar to 6900xt vs 6800xt.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

other than remount thereâ€™s not much to do.,the cooler might be flat and not concave.,this will result in not enough contact between both surfaces.,noctua usually does have a benefit on intel cpus because their plate is convex.,furthermore lga1700 does have high tension on the socket mount.,contact frames like thermalright and thermal grizzly even out the pressure on the ihs so it doesnâ€™t bent that much and provide a more even area for the cooler.,"check out gamersnexus video

go to bios/ai tweaker and disable multicore enhancement.,it adds heat for really small performance gains and if cooling canâ€™t keep up it actually makes performance worse.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mine with noctua u12a doing cbench r23 maxes out at 85c but i don't have a 3080ti in my pc.,room temp is 26-27.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is fine and normal for your hardware.,i had the same temps with a 750d airflow and a nh-d15.,"you will have 75-80 in demanding games which is, kind of ok.
if you do a slight offset undervolt you can go below 85 even in cb r23.",my undervolt is - 0.025 and i dropped from 92 to about 84 in r23.,"also your airflow is not perfect but it will probably only give you about 2, 3c.","best airflow is 2x in front, 1x back out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yo had the same problem and reduced my mainboards power limit to 150w.,"before i ran around 95â° in cinebench, now its around 70â° for 10% less power.",its a short term solution bc its either an ihs problem or a mainboard bending problem where the cooler doesnt fit the cpu due to mainboard caused bending.,its worth a shot to just limit the power,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

have you moved any voltage settings or limited tdp?,u12a with double fan right?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah if ambient temperature is high then case internal temp might be even higher.,so under load temps will surely shoot up.,-ve pressure might cause more dust buildup and might also affect temp (not sure about it though).try to switch off or lower the speed of exhaust fans if it makes a difference.,"one more thing you can try ""contact frame"" for 12th gen intel it will surely help you reduce cpu temps further.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"depending on the rpms, seems like you might be setting up a negative pressure airflow, which isnâ€™t ideal for keeping dust out.",typically you want more intake than exhaust fans so you have positive pressure.,"as for temps, seems a bit warmâ€¦ but in a warm room with no air-conditioning, you might be fine.",what kind of fan curves are you using?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"msi's ""stock"" which is unlimited pl1 and pl2.",u12a is the one with two nfa12x25s.,i am running memory at 6000 too actually.,i actually had nh-d15s before swapping this and it was a bit a worse.,that one has one fan but nothing major though.,i don't even have a good air flow case.,it's much worse than yours.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have seen thermal grizzly brand ""contact frame"".",is it a good idea to go for one of those and put kryonaut extreme thermal paste on it?,i will try to change the air pressure and see if there is a difference with the temperatures.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
try thermal take contact frame its cheaper.,yeah it will be a good idea as you will be able get temps little bit lower.,changing thermal paste may not cause any difference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why are you comparing av1 to h264?,"surely you should use av1, or at least h265 if you want to compare quality?",h264 can be used literally everywhere.,av1 at this point hasn't reached that point yet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the nature of newer video codecs, designed to beat former generations, means they'll have increasing encoding complexity - which means they'll never get any faster on cpu.","well, there's still some room for encoders to find tricks, optimizations and such to speed things up a bit, but beyond that it's going to be up to cpus to get faster/better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if they are adding ecores to locked i5s and i3 cpus, i think it's going to be insane.","$100 i3 13100f with 4p+4e cores, it is probably going to perform very similarly to 12600k in tests.",that would definitely give amd a big challenge to compete with unless intel artificially nerfs the clock speed... 13400 would be insane as well.,13600k is 6+8 so they probably make sure 13400 is worse with 4e cores.,i think amd will be forced to double the cores in 8000 series so i am waiting out the 7000 series.,my impression so far with current market is that if you are shopping <$250 you are getting better value than ever and looks like its going to get even better.,am4 deals going around right now are pretty nuts too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah it better be considering itâ€™s 24 core vs 16 and itâ€™s oced, not to mention itâ€™s against a 2.5 year old cpu by the time it comes out",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
zen 4 platform will be more expensive than raptor lake platform,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wait, what?",it was 40% faster when overlocked to 6ghz?,i mean the boost clocks are 5.5ghz based on leaks so maybe regular performance is around 30% better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5950x owner here.,i can't wait till the official zen4/raptor lake benchmarks are released.,it seems like both have really improved the clock speeds.,i'll be eager to see where each one wins out based on architectural choices.,"i don't plan on upgrading for another couple years, but i suppose i could give the 5950x/3080ti to my daughter and pick up either of these processors with a 4090 if it is just over the moon better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not a great achievement considering that amds flagship is like 2 years old,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and likely consumes 2x the power.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if they brag to be 40% faster than 2-3 years old cpu, new amd will destroy them",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
raptor lake is trash.,it's basically alder lake oc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is still on intel 10nm right?,"if so, i wouldn't worry if it's slower than ryzen 7000, since that line is going to be on tsmc 5nm, and can pack more transistors.",i'd be really surprised if the 13000 series can get within +/- 5% in term of performance of ryzen 7000. but i'd expect it to be minimum -10% in term of performance difference.,meteor lake vs ryzen 7000 is going to be interesting though with both processes produce similarly sized transistors.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the budget range is going to be interesting.,"i would be curious to see how raptor lake performs with ddr4 vs ddr5, as zen 4 only runs with ddr5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if zen4 brings 3d versions as well this year (which is rumored) they might have quite an increase in gaming perf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and also because intel will use some asanine 200-500w while zen4 will only use 105-170w.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> stop boosting because of power limitations.,yeah ... they seem to ignore that more and more in the past 3 gens.,"they're going the bulldozer/p4 way with every new gen. slight improvements from architecture, everything else with the crowbar and higher power targets.",don't like it.,"as usual, we need to wait for the real stuff to appear, but i prefer a lower power consumption to some more frames.",and amd right now has the efficiency crown.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"damn, my 6c/12t 10600k becomes more obsolete by the day, and i only bought it 2 years ago to replace a 4690k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rumors suggest the 8000 series amd is going to do its own approach to e cores.,i am interested because amd really hasn't bumped core count per price point since zen 1 meanwhile intel has pumped up core counts signicantly.,7700k was a quadcore for around $300 and now the 13600k will probably has 6p and 8 e cores for slightly more then that.,with better ipc obviously.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"all this bs ""40% faster"" claims will fall apart once regular people start comparing them clock for clock.",i doubt it's a lot faster than the alder lake clock for clock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm in a similar situation.,"i have a 5950x/3090 workstation, and i plan to replace that with a newer workstation when am5 and 4090 hits the market.",cant wait to see my daughter using my current rig for browsing websites and using ms word :(,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
weren't you people making jokes about intel being stuck in skylake for years?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seems like amd shouldn't wait 2 years to update their offerings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol.,then tell amd to get with the program and start updating their cpus every year then.,"oh wait, they canâ€™t.",they canâ€™t even ship products theyâ€™ve released either.,"itâ€™s still difficult to find renoir at this moment, while alder lake is everywhere.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i agree.,intel's messing up big time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in the best case,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
zen 4 is trash.,it's basically zen 3 oc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"mhm, at the end of the day i think a 7600x3d is going to be the go-to chip for gamers who are hyper-focused on gaming.",as for mt i think it's gonna be a repeat of zen3 vs alder lake with the 7950x3d narrowly beating the 13900ks as soon as it's boost ends with intel offering better mt performance at every other price point.,great to see that a resurgent amd has made the cpu space competitive again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if the vcache is larger [read: more expensive]

zen4 has a larger l2.",that reduces cores going to l3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
incorrect both for intel and amd.,"amd ppt this gen is 230w, and intel's pl2 ~250w.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it could have been worse.,"you didn't buy 11th gen.

i bought into alderlake 12700k and even i feel a little salty still.",got it for a good price though so i don't care that much.,i wasn't expecting ecores to be as good as they are initially and doubling of ecores didn't mean much to me but they are in fact very legit cores and i like to have 16 of them some day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10600k at 5ghz should still be pretty fast for a while,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol.,how do you people come up with this nonsense?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
more like 0% then,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in mt, raptor lake would be faster than alder lake clock for clock because it has moar cores",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if intel has managed to raise clock frequency, it might not be much faster at the same clock.","however, power consumption will be lower at the same clock.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you guys got some lucky kids lmao,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"24 cores vs 16 cores

also the intel was overclocked to 6ghz.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but aren't you missing the point here?,no one is denying this is blazing fast.,"the thing is that is has more cores, is overclocked, brand new, and still is ""just"" 40% faster.",running against the comming amd cpus is where it has to shine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah probably, though when i'm spending 1k on a new platform i kinda want at least 8 cores ðÿ˜…",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"we'll see how ""practical"" both those tdps are with the new generations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you will still have zero cpu bottleneck in gaming for years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11th is already starting to show some significant gains compared to 10th gen in newer games.,look at hitman 3 with rt: https://gamegpu.com/action-/-fps-/-tps/hitman-3-test-rt as an example.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you could have said that for 5900x, 5950x vs 10900k, 11900k as well

also all cores within 24 cores are not the same",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
people's expectation are crazy high for these past few years.,"15% st uplift on zen 4 was bad, 40% multitread uplift, intel is dead.",i still remember the days of 3%-5% gen on gen uplift.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
look.,"amd going from zen 2 to zen 3 top of the line barely managed to gain 40 percent, with a large portion of this being the addition of 4 cores on top of architectural changes.","in fact, the architectural change only accounted for 20 percent of the performance boost

i doubt zen 4 would manage to make that same 40 percent jump, or even a 30 percent jump.","it would require an unprecedented miracle architectural jump and clock speed jump, something that has never been seen before, especially without a boost to the number of cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"correct, and it should have been said for those situations too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">15% st uplift on zen 4 was bad,

zen 3 got more than that just from ipc without using a new node",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
zen 2 and zen 3 shared the same process node and is limited by am4's power delivery so there isn't much they can do to drastically improve mt performance.,"zen 4 on the other hand is more like moving from zen+ to zen 2 in terms of cpu core, plus a new am5 socket that is capable of much higher power delivery capabilities.",those combined could deliver a much stronger result than that of zen 2 to zen 3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
still zen 4 should be the target.,i want to see flagship against flagship.,"and not against a 2 year old cpu while having more cores, being overclocked, being hot as the sun and needing it's own power plant.",like yeah this cpu is a crazy beast.,but i want a more usefull test.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> with a large portion of this being the addition of 4 cores

sorry, what cores?",zen 2 already had 16 of them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"zen 4 is supposed to release in a month while raptor lake will ship in october, yet there's more info and leaks about the latter than the former.",hard to compare with a flagship that's still mostly in the dark.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah the thing was released in the summer of 1998 at the same time as its bigger brother the pentium ii 450. the celeron 300a had a list price of $149 compared to the $669 of its bigger brother.,when it was overclocked to 450mhz (and pretty much all of them could hit that speed) they were equal in performance to the pii-450.,me and a buddy of mine at the time snagged a couple for far under the $149 list price.,the 300a is on my mount rushmore of legendary overclockers.,"it's up there with the 2002 athlon xp 1700+ tbred-b, another hugely oc-able chip, and the 2006 core 2 quad g0 q6600.",all of the present-day celerons and athlons are rather boring in comparison.,there will never be values like that had ever again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that makes sense for amd because the developers have already optimized their stuff for amd.","they have years of experience doing that, since the drivers for the 6900xt aren't super different than the 5700xt.","and the 5700xt still inherited a massive amount from gcn, which devs knew how to work with, and amd themselves knew how to write drivers for.","one of the goals of rdna was to not stray too far from gcn, because console developers wanted good backwards compatibility.",it's why they stayed on amd with next gen systems.,intel does not have any of those things.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"damage or dent on the  cpu can effect the motherboard, or hdd/ssd.","as it a matter of scratches, you ne not to worry much.",go to the wander and get the cabinet changed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can add that i did some testing and it didn't change in temps or performance at all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'd imagine so.,poor contact with the cpu heatspreder is going to reduce the performance of any cooler regardless of it's thermal saturation.,"that being said, if you're not overclocking and you're not seeing thermal throttling the benefits of ~5c difference in temperatures is certainly of questionable value.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is the cooler flat or concave?,because that's basically what the contact frame is for.,"if you have a flat plated cpu cooler, get a contact frame for some possible thermal reduction.",otherwise it doesn't do much.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"based on experiments by gamesnexus, jayz2cents and der8auer, it helps a lot!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhxzmtwovj4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you get -20c difference then yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"by judging the thermal paste distribution, looks like the center not contact with the surface of the cooler well, you can see most of the paste on middle to the left.",it might due to cooler not installed probably (cooler might sit higher on left hand side compared to right hand side) because the thermal paste only build up on 1 side.,"&#x200b;

before using contact frame, ensure your cooler install correctly, like tighten up the screw, most air cooler use spring loaded screw and it required to tighten up (pls refer to your cooler manual), i once didnt tighten up my noctua (and nocture manual asking to tighten the screw until it cannot be turned anymore) and it have bad temp.","&#x200b;

this is my thermal paste distribution before any mod, you can see the middle have less paste which mean the surface of the cooler contact with the cpu nicely and push the paste to side.","&#x200b;

yes from what i'm seeing in this picture you would benefit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the imprint looks thicker in the middle so yes, you will be definitely gaining something by getting different retention frame.",washer mod will probably work just fine too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
decided to just give it a try as it is only a $10 item.,the average temperature across all cores dropped by 1.8c which isn't bad.,performance wasn't increased dramatically (about 1%) which makes sense as i wasn't thermal throttling even before.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"bah not necessary to use an socket frame, if you dont like the mounting mechanism then just unscrew it and use the heatsink as the cpu holder/mount.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s already be proven and it may not seem like itâ€™s a issue now but with time it will and damage due to time will cause more issues down the road,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"\-5c across all cores is insane, i doubt i will get anything close to that.",also - your first statement doesn't make a lot of sense.,if the cooler is saturated with current contact - giving it better contact won't do anything - it is already saturated and can't take any more heat.,"i mean it is possible that because there is better contact in different parts of the ihs the heat that stays in the cpu will spread differently, but the overall heat will stay the same.",i think the real question here is if the bigshuriken3 is actually completely saturated  or can take some more heat.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"youâ€™re *definitely* thermal throttling, thereâ€™s no way the big shuriken 3 can cool 190w.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is no such thing as cooler saturation.,the heat transfer is entirely dependant on the î”t between your cooler and the ambient - and on the other side - between the heatpipes and the cpu temp.,"the bigger the difference, the more heat it  can dissipate",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm certainly not a physicist, but i would think that the cooler's performance is further reduced by the heat transfer being bottlenecked by limited contact area with the ihs.",at the end of the day the cooler is definitely meant for itx builds and lower power cpus.,you'd almost assuredly benefit more from a better cooler than from the contact frame with the current cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it does work and it gives something like 5~10 degree on all cores if your cooler can deliver.,but i don't know if that is enough to not termal throttle at all or if it will just happen a bit later.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">there is no such thing as cooler saturation

heat pipes work via phase change, so all coolant being in gas state is ""saturated,"" no?","sure 100% saturated isn't real since the copper itself can still transfer heat, it's just much less efficient.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this!,"even the smallest cooler can cool 1000w in theory, the question is at what î”t.","the better the interface between cpu and cooler, the higher the cooler-ambient î”î¤ and therefore cooling performance for a given cpu temperature.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no need to state the obvious dude, obviously the cooler saturation is dependent on ambient temperature - the entire discussion is assuming ambient temperature is constant",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is the best cooler i can get in my system (and even that is pushing it in terms of size),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how quickly the change happens depends on the ambient though.,so yes it takes the same amount of heat to bring them into a vapor state but they cool down to liquid way faster as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are missing the point though.,"if you have better contact, the actual heatsink will get warmer, meaning it will be able to dissipate more heat at the same ambient temperature.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you need to undervolt.,"contact plate should be the last thing you do, you might not need it and it's not going to help that much.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not sure how time is relevant if there's no phase change taking place.,we are talking about when the vapor can not go back to a liquid state because there is too much heat.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
decided to just give it a try as it is only a $10 item.,the average temperature across all cores dropped by 1.8c which isn't bad.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"cpu is already undervolted, do you really think a bs3 can yield almost 23k @ cinebench out of the box?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
uhm what?,if the ambient is lower then the heatsink will be lower then the gas can go back inton liquid,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the heat from the cpu makes ambient irrelevant.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"according to steam, the minimum requirements are as follows:

- processor: intel core i5-2300 | amd fx-6350.",- memory: 8 gb ram.,"- graphics: nvidia geforce gtx 650 ti, 2 gb | amd radeon r7 360, 2 gb.",your cpu is better than either of those.,ram is as much as the minimum.,gpu is apparently as good as a 750ti.,"so if you dial down some settings, it'll probably run well.",i'd recommend upgrading your ram to 16gb later tho.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why tho,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why exactly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, since igpus (both intel and amd) require access to the main system memory, dual channel config ensures the memory runs at the advertised speed (since single channel cuts it in half, so a single 8gb dimm of 3200mhz is really only running at 1600mhz effectively) 
it's also why tech yt channels and many others insist on getting 2 x 4gb if you absolutely cannot afford more ram.","but to be fair, 2 x 8gb kits have gotten pretty cheap--and in the case with most laptops that only have 1 dimm, it's simpler to just get an extra matching one vs replacing it entirely.","it's worth noting that one should always go for the fastest memory the cpu can support, unless it is able to be oc'd or use xmp (which some laptops don't allow, therefore will only run whatever speed the cpu's memory controller is rated for).","they're not intended for gaming, although the xe series has come a long way from the regular intel hd graphics.","amd's rdna2-based igpus are a bit better overall, which is why the steam deck uses a proprietary apu based on that tech.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah.,"lock it at 30fps so it's smooth since you won't hit 60fps no matter how hard you try, play at 720p, 900p, 1080p, low/medium settings.",the youtube video someone linked is a good start for settings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

intel states 8.3gb for that processor.,https://www.intel.ca/content/www/ca/en/products/sku/47341/intel-core-i5520m-processor-3m-cache-2-40-ghz/specifications.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how do you even end up with that number?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the voltage supplied to the cpu is regulated by the vrm on your motherboard and not set by the power supply.,the vrm will hold the cpu voltage at the programmed level.,if you overload the power supply it'll simply turn off.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no you are missing the point.,undervolting is done by the motherboard.,the power supply is irrelevant to this.,the point of the power supply is a contestant voltage.,if you get voltage drop on the power supply you are in a whole world of trouble.,and it means you have a bad power supply.,a power supply they works well will give you a more or less constant voltage even at it's limits.,it will trip the over power protection (because of high current) and shut down the system.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if the power draw exceeds the psu's wattage the pc will shutdown or experience stability issues.,"otherwise, no as far as undervolting.","never skimp on the power supply, arguably the most important component of a pc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

total power consumption: 3.000.000.000.000 w,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
300w for sure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
time to upgrade again.,gonna be chasing that elusive 6ghz 13900k myself.,5ghz.. phsshh.,it's all about 6ghz now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for single core it doesn't matter.,"my 12900k is boosting to 5.7ghz on 2 cores, and im using a.....u12a ;)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there are some hints.,"first, we know their ambient temp, around 27c which means it is room temp, not subzero cooling most likely.","also, it is just a cpu-id bench.",those are very short and probably do not require subzero cooling.,a really good waterloop can get that result.,having said that this is still good information.,"if this is true, that put the oc bottom line for air/water cooling 24/7 stable setup closer to 5.5 - 5.7. most likely can't 24/7 5.8+ with that kind of voltage, but if it can hit 5.8, it likely can hit 5.6 with almost 0.1v less and those are generally very coolable and possible for high-end.",knowing it is targetable at 5.6 is amazing news.,maybe even 5.7 or 5.8 with a good chip.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all the e cores are disabled and hyper threading isn't enabled too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cooling 244w isn't exactly difficult.,even a 280mm aio can cool that long term.,and this is in a synthetic load pulling 244w.,gaming loads would be closer to 100w max.,that will be ridiculously easy to cool and means you might see even higher clocks for gaming loads vs cinebench r23.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

a lot of the bad contact issues appear to be more apparent on aios.,"i'm unsure if the coldplates are a different shape or whatever, but most with air coolers haven't really had issues.",my u12a on 12700k is stock and i get 55deg in games.,"personally i'd put it together stock, especially since it voids warranty etc, and if temperatures are higher than they should be then looking into it or other options like the thermal frame/plate",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"it probably depends on specific boards regardless of brands, so some are affected and some are not.",i will stick to stock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"that was the one,you can find cheaper ones but your cpu will be fine so long as itâ€™s installed right.",youâ€™ll more than likely void your motherboard warranty if you do it though but the thermal performance increases is fairly noticeable compared to stock.,the question becomes how confident are you installing it and what your willing to risk.,the cpu will be fine though and the worst thing youâ€™d likely do is bend pins on the motherboard if you installed it incorrectly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"its actually depend on the cooler's contact plate whether is convex or not, if it was convex, it can counter the bending and make the middle part close contact to the cpu, in this case, washer mod/contact frame will have less effect.","&#x200b;

depends on the price.,"if you can get a ryzen 5600 and cheap motherboard or 12400f and cheap board, it might be better.",you can sell your board to make up the difference.,a 9700k isn't worth more than$120 in performance.,if it was used i would struggle to even pay 100 and probably just spend more on motherboard and new cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how much is the rtx 2060 in your country?,also: a ryzen 5600 + good b550 motherboard is $250.,a 5600 with a cheap b450 board is about $210.,"how much is the 9700kf, used?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
buying a higher-end cpu on a discontinued platform is rarely ever worth it.,you can sometimes even get a brand new cpu with better performance + a new motherboard for the same money as a used i7.,my advice to you is to sell your motherboard and cpu and get a more recent cpu+mobo combo.,like 12400f or ryzen 5600 depending on motherboard deals and budget.,even a 12th gen i3 will outperform 9700kf in games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

use case?,if gaming which gpu?,"imo, a new series always has a price bump on launch and is harder to get, so it's a point against waiting.","this one looks like they essentially have the same core and process, though with more cache, and higher clocks, and more e cores.","if you have serious multi-threaded workloads, it might payoff with the extra e cores, but with more power/heat.","otherwise you will probably be waiting longer, and paying more for a small on paper difference that makes no difference in daily usage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"not really, int acknowledged that raptor cove is nearly identical to golden cove.",l2 doesn't matter that much for gaming afaik.,maybe if they drastically reduced l3 latency and/or increased l3 cache bandwidth and capacity fps uplift would've been way higher.,however that's not the case with raptor cove.,rumors suggest that the next architecture with a cache rework will be lion cove core found in arrow lake(2024).,so i guess that'll be the one bringing another leap in gaming performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yes, disabling the e-cores eliminates micro stuttering.",the stuttering is very very tiny.,99.9999% of the time you won't feel it at all.,"but since i am gaming at a constant 400 fps, so for example, if i switch to chrome and click on some videos or open another software during gaming, a tiny fps stuttering will happen, for about 10 milisecond at most i would say.","it is not obvious at all though, and it does not affect my gaming experience at all.","but **i am just feeling this is not perfect, psychologically**.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">games are extremely sensitive to micro-latencies, and getting rid of them (by disabling e-cores, and in some titles, disabling ht) smooths frame-times out.",makes sense.in some games if you disable ht the fps is higher and more stable and the frametime is straight up more flat.it's probably because the game is strictly using main cores so there's no flactuation between a full core and a weaker core.,"so basically intel added another gimped core besides ht that can cause micro inconsistencies (micro stutters/frametime issues)

nice one intel.in the race to beat amd in multithreaded performance they partially gimped gaming.atleast you can disable the e-cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i could see myself noticing them tbh.usually i can notice 5ms spikes in frametime.,like for example frametime on a fixed 144fps is like 6.9-7ms and if there's a frametime spike to 12ms-15ms (which is tiny) i tend to notice.,man it kinda sucks how intel are making these e-core a thing without the option to have a high end cpu without them just to try to beat amd...the thought of having to buy intel and disable cpu cores to get less stutters feels kinda meh.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm not surprised that the p cores are better - my surprise is that even on w11 e cores are being used for heavier tasks.,it's not supposed to do that.,e cores should be used for background tasks and such.,i wonder how well the scheduler works on the linux distro intel maintains since it usually has the absolute best experience for their processors.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"pl1 and pl2 (power limit) are two settings in the bios that determine the maximum of energy the cpu is allowed to consume 

(one of the two is long term and the other is during boost phases, i always forget which is which).","if you set both to a lower value than what he cpu is rated for (in this example, 100w) youâ€™ll reduce heat and power consumption at the cost of reducing maximum performance.",i have no experience with 12700k but 100w sounds reasonable for that chip.,edit: it is important to note that reducing pl is far easier than undervolting because reducing power limits wonâ€™t reduce system stability (only performance).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

where as now, you need like 6000mhz ddr5 just for a tiny benefit over 3600 low latency ddr4.",and up to 7000mhz or higher for a modest benefit in gear 2. i imagine its going to take 8000mhz or more to start seeing significant increases in performance with ddr5 compared to ddr4 if it has to be in gear 2. where as gear 1 would be an overall performance dream come true at 5200mhz only.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the thing is every ddr ram generation prior to ddr5 could run 1:1 with cpu imc or motherboard northbridge fsb.,"&#x200b;

ddr 266mhz ran with 266 mhz fsb thus 1:1 ddr 400mhz (200mhz single rate) ran 1:1 with fsb 200mhz (double pump).","&#x200b;

and ddr2 800mhz with 1600mhz fsb on high tier and overclocked core 2 cpus

&#x200b;

and ddr3 and ddr4 likewise up to like 4000mhz ran in gear 1

is that just on intel cpus or also amd new zen 4 cpus.,like will infinity fabric have to run 1:2 on zen 4 for it to work with zen 4?,?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, if we set aside the various improvements and changes of how ddr5 functions vs ddr4, and just look at the gear system, then all it means is the ratio between the imc and the ram.","when the imc is 2:1 with, say ddr5-6400 then the ram is running at 3200 mhz and the imc is running at 1600 mhz.",that imc is the equivalent of ddr4-3200 (3200 mt/s -> 1600 mhz ram -> 1:1 ratio -> 1600 mhz imc).,so ddr5 isn't really all that far behind when it comes to the imc speed.,gear 1 will probably not happen as it would be increasingly difficult to get the imc to run at those higher frequencies and ddr5 speeds are only going to keep increasing as manufactures make faster and faster kits.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah well if we could run those chips at 20ghz, that'd be great for performance too.","but uhh, physics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ddr5s bandwidth itself kills ddr4.,6600 mhz hynix based kit tightened properly completely destroys any ddr4 b-die dual rank kit in games (and in productivity it doesn't even have to be tightened to leave ddr4 snorting dust that ddr5 leaves behind).,"no amount of latency can outweigh the bandwidth difference, you are also comparing xmp b-die ddr4 to xmp still-early ddr5 and ddr5s xmp is absolutely garbage.","timings are so loose, that after properly tightening them you get insignificantly higher latency compared to fully overclocked b-die dual rank and 60-80% more bandwidth.","this is not an issue with gear, this is issue with absolute shit we're getting with xmp, for the compatibility sake.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i donâ€™t know the answer to that, but probably has something to do with frequency limitations.","just look at the evolution of cpu frequency scaling, and there seems to be a pretty hard line around the 4-5ghz range.","i mean the first 3.8ghz cpu came out in 2004, but theyâ€™re only hitting 5.5ghz 18 years later?",perhaps gear 1 topping out at 4000mhz is for similar reasons (technical or cost of implementation with current technology).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
infinity fabric itself is more comparable to the ring clock on intel.,what we will most likely see is the umc clock being halfed.,just like intels gear system.,fclk = uclk/2 = memclk,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>is that just on intel cpus or also amd new zen 4 cpus.,intel's alder lake cpus and amd's zen3+ rembrandt cpus both run ddr5 in gear 2 mode.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is there a site where i can see the gains of ddr5 vs ddr4 for productivity?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah true.,"though with cpu frequency scaling while there has been a hard wall at 5.5ghz 18 years later when first 3.8ghz cpu came out, instructions per clock have increased dramatically.","with ram speed, 4000mhz really is 2000mhz but double data rate.",and ddr5 6400 is really 3200mhz double data rate.,i think it is just marketing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"next gen ryzen 7000 will most likely have a 1:1 ratio at ddr5 6000mhz (unconfirmed but likely), and raptor lake benchmarks have shown that it has a greater increase in performance with ddr5 compared to alder lake.","and you talk about the small increases in clock speeds, but really with ipc improvements alder lake running at far lower speeds than previous-gen cpus can perform the same or better.","so it depends on a ton of factors, and it is still to early to tell.","we will have to wait probably another month to know for sure, but based off all the leaks we are looking at close to 6000mhz for raptor lake (with a lot more power draw), so who knows what the raptor lake 1:1 ratio might be.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah that makes sense, though how come with intel ring clock, there is like very low latency to access another cpu core on the ring.",but on amd i have heard having to cross infinity fabric for fast communication to a core on a different ccd has like a 300 to 400% increase in latency and incurs a penalty.,where as inter ccd communication is very fast like intel ring bus fast.,"&#x200b;

but if intel had 2 rings i imagine it would have to cross the imc or something to get to a core in another ring which would have a bad penalty like amd crossing infinity fabric as intel ring is like dramatically faster than amd infinity fabric right??",though amd inter ccd core communication is slightly faster than intel ring core to core communication but not much?,?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"any 12900k review, that has both dram compared.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the latency increase is there because the data first has to travel through the internal ring bus on a ccd to the if interface.,"from there to the data arbiter on the iod, from there through another if interface to the other ccds ring and from there to the destination (the core).",itâ€™s just a lot more steps involved.,on intels client chips just everything is on one ring.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you can remove the power limits from the 12700 as well.,theyâ€™re not locked.,"almost every board allows you to customize those values, although cheap b660 and h610 likely canâ€™t supply as much power as the 12700 would want.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not sure in what you meant by that",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
performance doing what?,just gaming with some background tasks?,probably either cpu would perform about the same.,if you were doing heavy number crunching or rendering i would definitely say go for the 8 p-core.,"with that said, cost of cpu = performance, so when you spend more you will get more.","i personally feel the 12700 is a great â€œsleeperâ€ cpu (great performance for the cost, due mainly to intel putting a very low but easily defeatable power limit on it), but with a z690 board youâ€™re kinda leaving a lot of tweaking options on the table by not getting a k cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"means in the past ""f"" versions were gpu failed versions.","basically cpus where the gpu didn't pass, and was disabled.","it's a fully fledged cpu with built in igp, which adds some silicon below the lid.",more silicon is better for cooling.,hence why the 'f' versions reached a bit higher in clock speed (like 100mhz or so).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that board should have no problems with either cpu.,"note that you will not be able to take advantage of most of the k â€œunlockedâ€ features on a b660 board, but it will work fine.",the kf model (or any f model) costs less (usually $20-30) because it lacks the igpu of the normal k model.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

>they have a chicken and egg problem.,"developers won't optimise for arc, and gamers won't buy arc because it's not optimised.",as much as it pains me to say it miners would help solve the chicken egg problem.,there's enough money in mining that they can create their own software and drivers if they need to.,it would move cards and give intel the time they need to work on drivers.,"also enough miners game that, while it wouldn't be fast, developers would begin to optimize for arc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pos is around the corner like arc is around the corner amirite xd,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ravencoin maybe?,"don't know about the current state but somewhere early/mid 2021, it was even more profitable than eth for a while",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we're not talking social miners using their gpus to mine during offtime.,we're talking industrial miners who buy thousands of gpus and run 7 or more gpus on the same device - they aren't going to game.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"now that you mention it, i think eth might actually go pos before we get the full arc lineup.",that'd be hilarious stuff.,"edit: read the article people, the headline is plain wrong.","mining programs don't support arc yet, not the driver itself (which would rule out a ton of use cases which makes 0 sense)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it would be significantly better than the i5 12600k?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gaming computers are pretty much always by their graphics cards.,"i have a 12600k with a 3080 and itâ€™s not even breaking a sweat, i am always gpu limited.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think it will be pretty balanced pair, probably 12700k +2 cores, will be better in terms of longevity of the system",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"we donâ€™t know how the 4070 will be, it depends on what youâ€™re gonna do with said pair but since you didnâ€™t state anything that indicates what you would be doing isnâ€™t gonna give much help

if youâ€™d be doing 1440p or 4k gaming your main bottleneck most, if not all of the time would be the 4070 since itâ€™d be gpu bound at that resolution",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i've been wondering the same thing tbh, kind of hard to say without seeing official specs and benchmarks for rtx 40 cards.",i have a 12600k right now and ideally want to get a 4080 by the end of the year if i can but i'm worried about bottlenecking since the card should end up being much better than a 3090ti.,looking back i wish i'd gone for a 12700f or 12700k but too late for that now.,i always have the option to upgrade to 13th gen i guess since i have a z690 board.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

exactly.,and i guess i should have capitalized not long ago cause the affordable i5 12600's are expensive again but i've heard it doesnt really have an upper limit on gpu bottleneck,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what resolution?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah but i can get an i5 12600k on like mercari or fb marketplace for right around 200, sometimes less.",cheapest im finding i7's is like 350 which does not seem worth imo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

unplug all your drives except your boot drive, unplug your ethernet cable and disable wireless in bios

install fresh copy of windows

install your nvidia driver

like it says, itâ€™ll work fine in windows 10, but things will be â€œsmootherâ€ in ensuring the right workload goes to the right core with windows 11.

1) compete with tsmc as a fab

2) receive government subsidies to fund their investment

3) switch to tsmc all together for new products

nobody paying current price for amd expects to get so much profit from owning it that it makes much sense as an investment for the profits.,or if they do they are idiots.,this is why things like earnings per share mean very little in that equation.,on the other hand intel is more traditional boring investment target where people expect to hold it for a long time and get dividends from the corporate profits.,nobody expects it to shoot to the moon because of some hype.,market capitalization is sort of a broken metric for the value of the company because it is formed mainly by relatively small trades that are often made for relatively short periods.,when measuring whatâ€™s the company is actually worth you would have to look at what somebody might be willing to pay if they were actually buying the entire company.,"like, would someone pay the amount tesla market cap is?",why would they do it when there is no chance for them to make the investment back in a century even if the wildest growth dreams are realized?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the issue is if they don't get this stuff out the door soon it will be completely doa as amd and nvidia release entry level gpus in the next gen that blow a750 and a770 out of the water.,imagine how bad it will be if 7400xt and rtx 4050 cards launch the same time beating the top end intel sku.,that would be a complete disaster.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">yeah, but now intel will come to a gunfight with a knife.","they are a full generation behind, now.",this was always going to be the case.,you can't create a brand new device from scratch and expect to compete with the market leaders immediately if at all.,arc is for better or worse going to be a budget product line for at least it's first 3 generations if i had to guess.,comparatively amd radeon is usually around half a generation behind by which i mean it handily beat the prior generation nvidia flagship but falls short of the current gen one in it's top model.,this gen it did better and the 6900xt/6950xt matched the gaming flagship which was the 3080 ti.,the 3090 series is in nvidia's own words titan tier and not necessarily made for gaming alone despite people buying it for that.,i got it for sheer compute power via cuda.,"anyhow back to the point, if radeon is still trailing nvidia with decades of accrued and acquired r&d then you can't possibly expect arc to come anywhere close at the high end or enthusiast grades anytime soon.",that was never a realistic expectation.,in fact you can't even expect it to touch current or even last gen radeon at those tiers.,not for a while yet.,and certainly not with raja koduri at the helm.,his track record is just too bad.,if intel wants to catch up they'll need to poach nvidia alumni and even then it'll be a long while before it can compete across the full spectrum of product tiers.,that and while gpus are a hardware device they're designed as a type of specialized coprocessor for accelerating parallel software workloads and as such need a ton of supporting proprietary software starting with os drivers and building upwards into userspace with a whole software api and library ecosystem to be useful.,and if amd still struggles with getting that up to par with nvidia then again intel will take forever to get there despite having more and maybe better software people on staff.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

so would launching a buggy product or one with missing features.,and without good os support on windows and linux it would also be painful for end users as well which would hurt the brand before it even really gains any ground.,the 30 series will remain in production so competing with it is somewhat acceptable for arc.,idk if amd has said anything but i suspect they'll want to keep the 6000 series in production as well.,the new ones have way high power draw and probably high prices too and both companies will want to give customers options.,if intel can compete with the previous series and get some sales that's enough of a win for a first generation.,on the enterprise side i don't see intel making a dent in the markets served by the nvidia hopper and amd instinct.,those are both monstrous compute accelerators the latter of which power some of the world's top supercomputers doing hpc workloads and the former of which are used for data processing at massive scale.,intel just doesn't have anything gpu or parallel accelerator wise to compete.,well it has fpga accelerators but those are somewhat different and still can't touch the amd xilinx versal acap.,the enterprise market is incredibly important amd intel needs to put up a serious fight for it.,cpus and cpu based software aren't the most important things there anymore if anything those are just there to host the accelerator and coprocessor units.,"amd, nvidia, and various other vendors know that.",intel and microsoft are the old dogs that haven't been willing to constantly change things to keep customers interested and satisfied.,"amd, nvidia, aws, google, and various other companies aren't just talking about exascale, they're doing it while the old fashioned companies are starting to fall behind.",intel is at the turning point where it needs to decide which side of that it wants to land on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

well we'll see what something like a 4070 costs which will outperform all of these cards easily.,with nvidia now having an overstock of rtx 30 cards and reportedly same situation for rtx 40 i wouldn't be surprised to see them release a bit cheaper than people are expecting.,next year when the real value propositions like 4060 and 4060ti launch i think intel will have trouble selling alongside those.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

except vega launched and did something.,dammit the gpu market needs arc before nvidia 4k and amd 7k launches.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"vega turned out to be ok (though probably not that profitable considering how much hardware power it has) but it's quite clear that amd's gpu division were the least competitive in the period he was there (2013-2017), basically between r9 200 series and 5700 navi/rdna",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yea that's this quarter, which looks like it ain't happening",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good points.,they are all right.,"however, amd brought something that made sense both for the buyer (performance/price, linux driver strategy) **and** for amd (terms of money).",amd always could benefit financially from gpus.,intel can't as of now.,"with integrated graphics covering the 100$ discrete gpu market going up, the market now for intel puts them this decision on the table:   
invest another two years with basically no roi or stop loss & exit discrete gpus.",or something.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the issue is competitiveness.,"if you can't sell the card for high enough price to justify the cost of production of gpu or the card then you will lose money, none of your aib parters will build or sell it.",keep in mind it also has to compete against the glut of mining used cards pouring into the market right now.,"intel might take a massive loss on the whole gpu project, and shareholders won't stand for that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in 2018 they were only saying that they were going to launch a high end discrete gpu in 2020, not giving any specifics from what i can find.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you trying to say you think there will be a surplus of rtx 40 cards?,or are you saying there is a surplus currently?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mistake?,"most new games coming up are supporting dx12 already, only old games on old engines stick to dx11.","also, it's easier to focus on dx12 in the driver and emulate previous dx versions with projects like d3d9on12.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>dammit the gpu market needs arc before nvidia 4k and amd 7k launches.,not really.,arc isn't even close to a competing product line to either of those.,so far it can only compare to the rtx 3060 and rx 6600xt which are among the lowest end current gen gpus.,i don't think it matters if arc launches later because it's going to be targeting a very different market segment than rdna 3 and lovelace which are both mostly enthusiast grade product lines.,arc's competitors are already out and have been for a while now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nvidia 4k and amd 7k launches is irrelevant for arc.,"to gain market share they need to compete in the mid tier gpus, not for nothing steam survey show that the majority of people use 1060 6gb, 2060 and 3060 level of power gpus.","and they need to launch without driver issue because even to this day people ditch amd gpu because they use to have driver issue and bod, bad press is hard to wash away.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and gelsinger promoted him to executive vp a few months ago!,!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
isnâ€™t that not why larabee failed?,"larabee failed was because management wanted them to compete with the igpu division for funding for some odd reason, which lead to them loosing in the end.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">intel puts them this decision on the table:
invest another two years with basically no roi or stop loss & exit discrete gpus.",or something.,as a finance guy who went back to school and became a computer scientist my thoughts on that are that very conflicted.,intel's leaders need to think of their new product market like a startup company.,that is to say it cannot be expected to even break even for the first 2-5 years.,the semiconductor industry moves slow so i'd aim for the longer end of that.,that said intel's focus should be less on money and more on establishing a solid base upon which to improve later.,"get one good architecture designed, create all the supporting software code and test it all thoroughly then refine it or if need be scrapnit and start from the ground up until it gets to the point where it not only meets consumer expectations but is robust enough to be improved upon by future hardware designers and programmers in subsequent generations.","until they've established that baseline architecture and throughly tested it and worked out issues, money shouldn't even enter the equation.",as for bailing out that would be a total wash now wouldn't it?,a pure finance guy would say past a certain point you have to cut your losses but an executive with the heart of an engineer like gelsinger would be hard pressed to scrap such an ambitious when it could bring things that are completely new to the table and provide real value given the right amount of time and effort.,people don't realize how much of engineering is trial and error and if you pull the plug every time you hit a snag you won't get anywhere.,"and of course this is intel we're talking about, they don't want a repeat of larabee.",i haven't worked for intel but they're a major vendor for my current and past employers.,intel's company culture is one that highly prides itself on being number one and being winners.,"they prefer to hire a wide variety of different people when they're young, a lot of times their own interns, and grow their people internally.",a company like that wouldn't want to hang it's head in shame having failed to deliver graphics hardware twice.,only time will tell how this plays out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there's currently an overstock of rtx 30 which nvidia thinks will hurt demand for rtx 40 meaning i bet the pricing will be lower than many expect.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes there will be overstock of rtx 40 because demand dropped a lot but nvidia already booked a ton of capacities at tsmc and they will have to use them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>rtx 3060 and rx 6600xt which are among the lowest end current gen gpus.,"at what point do we get to call a graphic card ""mid-range"" anymore?","if intel can offer mid-range cards as their base lineup, i am all for it.",not everyone is hoping to buy the next bleeding edge flagship cards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i still think it would be much better for them to launch all of arc asap.,"if 4k and 7k comes out and arc releases competing with mid range gpus that are from last gen, it won't work out at all.","if they are out now, and intel can work on the driver for a while, they might be better equipped to launch battlemage with more confidence.","and battlemage is supposedly not targeting the mid range, its going for the higher end.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
koduri is book smart but a lot of executives don't realize that that oftentime doesn't translate into real results in industrial r&d.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there were probably more reliable people they could have poached instead...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gelsinger himself is a questionable choice at this point with his whole let's turn the foundries into a customer facing business plan hasn't exactly paid out in spades yet and if anything instead of stealing their customers future intel products are slated to use tsmc processes for certain chiplets.,intel needs some big time changes from the top down.,it needs to do something to get customers excited and on board again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there were loads of reasons larabee failed, but competing for funding from overfunded departments probably wasn't it.",they built it to function more like multiple x86 cores that would work as a gpu.,"it was more of a gpgpu first than a straight graphics card, iirc they wanted it to use a weird compiler and just generally tried to make multiple products into one before they'd ever successfully made either individually.","there is also a reason it went on to become the phi, which was effectively a not very good closer to x86 accelerator than a gpu.","it had a shitload of terrible design choices and again definitely marketing trying to make it the best of everything without engineers stamping their foot down and saying stfu morons, if we try to make that it will be billions down the drain.",it was like marketing came up with segments they wanted to compete in and told the engineers what they had to make.,"best engineering comes when the higher ups go to the best engineers and say what can we make, what do you need to do it, how can we make sure it's a solid base that we can iterate on rather than make some final perfect product.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ah.,i think they will probably lower price on 3k before they sell 4k at any kind of discount.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"since the cheaper option seems to match and occasionally exceed the tg variant in testing, i'd say it's worth factoring into your budget if you're building a new pc entirely or just upgrading to 12th gen. especially since *bending* your cpu is never a fun time, even if it's only a miniscule amount.",over time the stress from it flexing will begin to affect things.,and since raptor lake will use the same socket i'm sure this adapter will be compatible with 13th gen cpus as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there is a difference between a company supporting non-stock operation and reverting your hardware to stock and/or leaving key details out of your rma ticket.,no way this is covered under intel or your motherboards warranty lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
modification of the mounting mechanism almost certainly voids warranty.,furthermore it also very likely voids the warranty of the cpu (intel already warned about this).,damage caused by user modifications are traditionally in warranty exclusion criteria and tend to be the suspected culprit by default.,so be prepared to prove that the modification wasnâ€™t what killed the thing.,they can guarantee that the stock mounting mechanism doesnâ€™t damage anything but itâ€™s perfectly possible for the user to damage the chip or the board by for example over tightening the mounting bracket.,itâ€™s of course another question if you might be able to cheat them by putting the original mounting mechanism back and saying you never touched it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is an rma issue.,you should have returned it instead of sanding.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i would say yes haha.,it works rather well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
xmp also voids warranty but it's a stupid point since people ignore it and just say no oc was done.,i wouldn't consider it cheating if something completely unrelated was at fault on the motherboard that required an rma.,"if you're not responsible, they can eat up all the fake shit they want.",this sort of fake warranty bullshit should've been illegal a long time ago but laws move slowly.,it was only a couple years ago that 'warranty void if sticker removed' became illegal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

just the other day people were trying to argue intel is swimming in money and just doesn't want to pull up another $100 billion out of nowhere.,so much for that lol.,it was so obvious that intel is dumping all their money in their attempt to course correct if you just looked at how much of their profit required unrealistic client sales growth.,i hope they turn things around but they're definitely going to be hurting for cash for the foreseeable future.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think you seriously under estimate the lead time in tech.,"pat influenced designs i'm guessing at earliest will be granite rapids and maybe arl, since it literarily takes years to design and validate cpu architectures.","and guys, mlid has been leaking stuff about intel arc literarily 2 years ago.","and that's when he began leaking them, actual design of arc probably started a while earlier than even that.",pat had no influence on that.,"obviously pat should shoulder much of the responsibility, being the ceo, but lets be reasonable here, a lot of the design choices and goals for the products that are releasing right now, were not under pats control.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the raptor lake delay is not really a delay considering that alder lake launched in november 2021. and meteor lake is expected late next year.,that's normal release cadence.,what's not normal is their inability to replicate that on the server side.,"gpus, ifs that's all long term stuff",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'm hoping the retail units will be optimized to run at 160w for the i5 and 200w for i7.,"240w for i7 will basically make it require an aio as minimum, which shouldn't be a case for high-mainstream cpu, but for the absolute top.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"iâ€™d say yes, but donâ€™t quote me on this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am pretty sure meteor lake launches exactly as fast as possible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think rpl p/u is for budget laptop options.,mlt is on an expensive process with expensive packaging.,both might coexist.,"meteor lake powered on in q1 so will launch q1 2023. again mtl is a huge lineup with multiple skus, some will come early, some later.","it's really a power efficiency focused product, not outright performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
on par i would say.,"but don't forget, the 13600k has less p-cores and more e-cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nope it's just that they are being pushed to their limits.,down clocking these parts from 5.3ghz/4.2ghz all core to 5.1/3.9 will probably lower power by 30-50w while performance is almost unaffected.,"ideally the frequency for the e cores is around 3ghz mark, but they are being pushed to over 4ghz",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

> but now itâ€™s even harder to cool because of the increased thermal density.,"when i went from an overclocked ryzen 1600 to a ryzen 5600 with pbo+co, power usage from running intel burn test dropped from +120w to ~90w.",but the 5600 was still going into the mid 60c range with a ~4lb 135mm dual tower air cooler (thermalright frost spirit 140) running at max fan speed.,compared to the oc'ed 1600 that was getting mid 70c with its ~1lb 96mm single fan stock cooler (wraith spire).,"i'm pretty sure if i had mounted the wraith spire on the 5600, it would have shot to 85-95c temperature range with the same power usage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
aida64 latency test isn't a good test.,it gets skewed by higher clocks which is the case here with 13700k having a clockspeed bump.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it likely will get both.,the 12400 silicon can easily do 5.1ghz.,"and the way intel bins, i can easily see the 13400 becoming the new 6+4 chip performing like a 12600k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the i5-13400 wasn't rumored to get e-cores, but we'll see i guess.","if it doesn't, it will in meteor lake most likely.",the rumors point to just the i5-13500/i5-13600 gaining e-cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

depends on what your use case is.,"in gaming the 13700k will probably just act like a 12900k, pulling 100w, that gives your 4080 600+ watts to use and if its a good psu, it can handle quite a bit more for transient spikes.","if you have a workload that hammers both the cpu and gpu, then youll probably need to undervolt/power limit",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"more p cores would be the waste of die space, not e cores.",there are very few programs out there that can scale to 9 cores but not to arbitrarily many.,10p+8e would perform noticeably worse in heavily threaded stuff than 8p+16e using the same die space.,"my rough ""napkin math"" estimate is 4 e cores â‰ˆ 1.5 p cores, so we're talking 10p+8eâ‰ˆ13p vs 8p+16eâ‰ˆ14p.","obviously it's gonna depend on the exact benchmark you do, but that's like a 7% performance delta with only the rare drawbacks.","apparently the rumor is that arrow lake will push it to 8+32, they seem pretty convinced that more than 8 p cores is a waste for now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

actually stock turbo clocks without power limits (my default mobo settings) and light undervolt (heavy undervolt will cause clock streeeeetching) are very well judged.",with just a 120w power draw you're within 1000-2000 cinebench r23 points of the 180w oc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

maybe barely,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm in the same boat.,meteor lake will be the next generation that's truly worth the upgrade.,raptor lake has the exact same e cores and the p cores are also basically a refresh of golden cove all done on the same intel 7 process.,"meteor lake will use chiplets, be built on intel 4, and feature brand new redwood cove p cores and crestmont e cores.",overall it will be worth forking over oodles of cash for even if it means building a new machine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when will it launch approximately?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"makes sense, can see some premium thin&light refreshes launching with 2+8 mtl-m and mtl-u early to mid next year, while mtl-p with 6+8 core config launches later similar to the tgl launch, where h series launched later in 2021. then mtl-s in 2024 launching alongside arl-s, with the former being in the midrange part of the lineup.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah itâ€™s the corsair unit.,i bought it cheap from a friend who gets a great discount.,to be fair iâ€™m running a 12900k 128gb if ram and a 3090ti and i didnâ€™t want the psu to struggle feeding up to 490 watts to my video card so really what with everything i have some great headroom and i know for sure i very stable power supply,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

>read any psu manual.,"while you do generally want to have some headroom, he is right that ""650w"" refers to (roughly) the sum of the power the rails can supply, not the total power consumed at max load (which will almost certainly be higher than 650w).",> i'm talking about the percentage of 12v dc rail power delivered by the psu which is not 100% .,on a lot (most?),"supplies it is actually 100%, since the 12v rail powers all the other rails.","so for example on this 1300w power supply, the 12v rail can supply 1300w, which is then split between 12v devices and the other rails:

>what you are talking about is power factor

power factor is the ratio of real to reactive power consumed, and is not related to the power delivered.","so for example, a 600w power supply might delivery 600w on the 12v rail, consume 650w of real power, and have a power factor of 0.9.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i'll try to summarize the purported 1700 problems with ihs/cooler plate geometry:

1. any 1200 cooler plates need to be adjustable to about 0.8mm lower than the 1200 ihs height to contact a 12th gen ihs, via adapter kits or mod of the original hardware.","2. there are at least two mfgs of stock ilm's, lotes and foxconn.",igor's lab tested them both for washer mods and found them to behave about the same.,pictures are on the website.,3. the ilm's exert force on the middle of 12th gen ihs's tending to produce a concave shape.,they also exert a differential force unsymmetrically across the ilm because of the one-armed design.,4. how much the ihs is distorted seems to depend on what series the cpu is; reportedly intel has varied the 12th gen ihs material/design.,5. the ihs may take on a warped shape if left in the stock ilm long enough.,"6. there is a possibility of an ilm corner projecting slightly above the mounted ihs, causing a large cooler plate to rest on it, not the ihs.","7. some mb's, asus among them, are quite warped in the area of the socket, complicating the situation.",the above seem to have a best solution: replacing the ilm with a contact frame before the ihs takes on a set.,note that the frames do not fit a replacement copper ihs.,"it is essential to follow instructions on the screws, do not overtighten, but usually reversable if the cpu seems affected.","since the cooler plates come either flat or varying degrees of convex, and if your ihs is not flat, matching up the shape of the two surfaces even when using a frame is somewhat guesswork.","the *only* final test of importance is paste distribution after mating, which should be very thin at the center and almost as thin or equally thin around the periphery.","however, the sticky opaque paste distorts when the cooler plate is pulled away and may not be very readable.","instead of wasting paste, one can run a mating test with clean surfaces and some small pieces of dark lipstick.",the transparency of the spots produced tells all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i simply tighten it until i couldn't screw anymore without a lot of pressure.,system shows all memory on xmp and has been stable so i'm assuming i did well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

another reason to get it was the ilm bending the chip overtime.,but since your temps are good might not actually be bending at all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah.. low amount of thermal paste or low mounting pressure are the main culprit.,thermalright straightener bracket only improves temps by up to 5%,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"don't bother, your temps are great.","keep in mind, messing with the ilm voids all warranty and there is definitely the possibility of doing things wrong (too much / too little torque) and getting worse results.","personally, i would not bother unless i'd see critical temperatures in real life workloads (like the op) and not just in benchmarks/torture tests.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ihs was uneven, kinda like what gamersnexus showed on his video about the subject",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

prime 95 you would definitely be slamming into a 100c wall.,the only reason your temps are that good is a lack of utilization.,of course your temp is going to be good at 30% utilization.,60c idle on the op isnâ€™t normal on a 12700k even w/ out a contact frame though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a flow meter there no issue with the flow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or like the original op posted it might be a combination of low quality silicone uneven pressure along with the die being the worst shape to fit the waterblock surface could very easily result in a 30c increase,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"way worse than yours, a good 25-30% of it had clearly not made any contact whatsoever leading 2 or 3 of my p cores to get insane temps which was the root of the problem, honestly regret not taking pic of ihs.. it was worthy of seeing, you'd think i simply laid the aio on top of it without screweing it in.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"oh, so it's flat?",i genuinely thought it's convex.,"well, that explains his results.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, that's fair, the 12900k is notoriously difficult to keep cool.",it's a little worrying if you ever run into a game that is cpu limited and uses avx as you lack thermal headroom but if it works for now it works.,another thing you could consider is using a liquid metal thermal paste like conductonaut.,probably will only net you a 5c improvement though.,i am still on a 8700 anyway and avoided the 9900k because i thought that was too hot and intel has just cranked more and more power onto these chips.,nvidia is going in the same direction.,i held off on upgrading hoping future generations would tame the increasing power consumption but boy was i wrong.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">all parts are new, so ram should be fine.",that's not how that works.,it probably will be an issue with your ram.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
completely fine.,"max temp is 100c (which the chip will shut down the system if it passes this too much, anyway).",i'd say anything in the low 90s should be fine.,"though just be aware that if you're pushing your chip that hard, you're losing out on some performance because the chip won't boost as far (it will run at a slower speed) to stop from overheating.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

valorant is pretty cpu-intensive afaik.,"so i guess it's kinda normal, especially if you're using something like stock intel cooler.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thats good , if you still not satisfied with the result depending on the cooler itself.",may try to replace the original paste to something better or and lapping some of the surfaces... hope that helps ðÿ˜‡,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
okay and i am using the cooler you get with the cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's normal.,with the stock cooler you get what you pay for.,"a $30 tower cooler will be significantly better, but it's not needed for an i3-12100",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the video is very long.,"overall it is an interesting discussion between moore's law is dead and bryan heemskerk, art director at massive damage.",comments speculate on the possibility that architectural flaws in arc alchemist might be present noted by inconsistent frame times as well as a strange cap [with identical minimum performance at 720p](https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/control-fps-1280-x-720-dx12-lowest.png) between default a380 and an oc a380 identified [in a review by igor's lab](https://www.igorslab.de/en/intel-arc-a380-6gb-in-test-gunnir-photon-total-benchmarks-detail-analysis-and-extensive-teardown/1/).,"interesting comments:

* intel placed engineering samples in the hands of game devs 8 months ago

*  all intel alchemist chips and oem cards were manufactured between jan - mar 2022.  intel has been sitting on units since then apparently trying to correct or workaround stability issues and fix bugs.","* aib partners still have not been fully briefed, nor do they have all chips in hand as of yesterday.","* power, scaling, and stability issues in arc alchemist are speculated to be attributed to intel trying to create their own version of ""infinity fabric""

* intel has had 10 years to try and build a driver stack beginning with igp, and more recently with dg1.",intel has not created sufficient technical documentation and built relationships with game developers enabling optimizations and bug fixes to the same extent as nvidia and amd.,"*  it's stated that intel's in a difficult position unless it improves in technical documentation, dev relations, driver/software engineering and potentially hardware design (power/voltage issues, die size, scaling, etc)

* comments are fair but critical toward intel management and the consensus seems to be that if issues were not significant that intel would have released months ago.","one thing seems clear, that there are kind words for intel's tom petersen but not for intel's marketing man ryan shrout.","shrout claimed no a780 was planned, but leaks inside intel claim otherwise.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is arc going to have dlss 3 ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not going to watch the video as tom's content is pretty shit these days tbh.,and an art director at an indie studio with one 2d game isn't going to be able to add insight to arc/gpus.,"> aib partners still have not been fully briefed, nor do they have all chips in hand as of yesterday.","except gunnir is literally an aib with the first arc dgpu (and its a custom pcb) available for retail, and there have been a couple of other chinese brands that have announced they have arc cards launching soon, msi also has a prebuilt in china featuring the a380.",unless im misunderstanding you.,">one thing seems clear, that there are kind words for intel's tom petersen but not for intel's marketing man ryan shrout.","shrout claimed no a780 was planned, but leaks inside intel claim otherwise.","probably because tom is extremely arrogant, and when ryan stated on twitter that the a780 rumors were false and never existed, tom felt attacked and doubled down on it, calling it damage control and that they simply failed to get the full die working, which makes no sense as the a770 is the full 32 xe core + 16gb configuration the a780 was alleged to be, tsmc 6nm has low defect rates.",intel simply never had an a780 or was deciding between a770 and a780 names and didnt want to risk a 3080/6800xt comparison despite being completely different price segments.,"there is no reason for ryan to go out of his way to lie about this, and tom's claims dont make sense.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think the comment was that dlss still isn't in the public driver.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh no no no, it's not just ryan shrout who claims there was never an a780, its literal intel engineers in the intel insiders discord server who also claimed there was never an a780 being planned.","this video is basically a 2 hour rant on tom trying to save face and claim intel arc is a giant failure, which is debatable, but the funniest part is that he only started saying this after he was proven wrong about the a780.","before, he was a lot more amiable towards arc.","also in the video or 2 videos before this one, he ended it with a weird rant about how he hates it when intel lies to the public.","which ig the sentiment is right, but he was basically saying intel lying about there never being an a780 is a huge disservice to the consumers or something, which makes 0 sense.",you know what the best part of this video was though?,"when the guy with him on the podcast started *arguing* with tom to give arc a break since devs didn't have much hands on time with arc to develop optimizations for it, and tom claimed he had a ""source"" who has had arc for nearly a year, but it was ""secret"".","i mean cmon... and even if it was true, it still wouldn't invalidate bryan's point since the vast majority of devs didn't have access, even if his one ""source"" did.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'll reference by mlid instead of tom as not to confuse mlid (tom) with intel graphics engineer tom petersen.,mlid has leaked information on alchemist a few times and claims to have more than one source at intel.,it's possible he has contacts at intel's aib partners from statements made.,"to what extent his contacts actually are, he has leaked information which has proved accurate.","last december mlid leaked info on two intel alchemist die,  dg2-soc1 (512 eu) and dg2-soc2 (128 eu).",the later soc is used by intel arc a380.,"https://twitter.com/locuza_/status/1469727449546117123

the comment as stated could be accurate in that aib might not have yet been briefed and supplied with  dg2-soc1 (512 eu) chips required for aib to test and manufacture a750 and a770.",that seemed to be the intent of the comment.,"it is true that gunnir, asrock and others have either released or built a380 boards based on dg2-soc2 (128 eu) soc.","> when ryan stated on twitter that the a780 rumors were false and never existed, tom felt attacked and doubled down on it, calling it damage control

maybe mlid is annoyed because he has internal sources at intel informing him that a780 was originally planned and mapped for the alchemist product launch but was pulled as a result of various issues with the alchemist line not fully made public.","alchemist was originally projected for a q1 2022 launch window with whispers of cards shipping in late january, early february.",that did not happen.,reviewers and the general public can read between the tea leaves.,intel released the a380 in china.,"there are reports of crashing, voltage issues, frame time spikes, and other stability and performance related concerns with a380.","the issues with alchemist might be corrected by software, but it could also be one or more engineering design flaws that can not be corrected.",again everyone outside of intel management and the graphics design team is largely left to speculate absent leaks.,"> tsmc 6nm has low defect rates

again this discussion is not about tsmc wafer yields.",if there are potential architecture design flaws they will be present whatever the yields may be.,"> there is no reason for ryan to go out of his way to lie about this, and tom's claims dont make sense.",there are plenty of reasons for ryan to lie.,for starters any bad news pertaining to alchemist could effect intel's share price.,managing bad news is the job of pr.,claims by mlid do make sense and i'm inclined to listen given the amount of bad news pertaining to alchemist which intel is not being entirely forthcoming about.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>indie studio with one 2d game isn't going to be able to add insight to arc/gpus.,more than tom.,i thought he brought a lot of valid opinions and insight to what's being said.,pushed back against some of the things tom said.,"he knows a lot from talking to other devs in some triple-a studios about architectures, and drivers.","i wish he'd make his own podcast, and i'd listen to that.","he's no  john carmack, but he knows more on a technical level about gpus, and drivers than anyone working any gpu/cpu review site or channel i've watched.",i do think there is a reason for ryan to lie about this.,that does not mean he did.,"if alch does not scale well with higher frequencies, because of some internal bottlenecks, you would not want to make the company you work for look bad by saying there is currently a flaw in these gpus.",especially if you're part of marketing.,"saying ""we did not hit performance targets"" does not look good.","personally i think he's not telling a lie, though, as internally they may have never called it the a780.",i'd imagine branding is the last step in the whole process.,"maybe there was a 2600mhz and 280w internal model, using faster vram that never made it past validation, and never got a name slapped onto it.","reviewers that oc'd some of these cards say ocs worked on dx12 games, but the card crashes on dx11 games with almost any frequency bump.",maybe they are just playing it safe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the 12100 is a very capable cpu and a very good choice for budget builds.,itâ€™s on par gaming wise.,"the lack of 2 extra cores makes it a little less suitable for streaming, video editing and other multicore demanding tasks.",intel made good progress in their 12th gen cpuâ€™s even exceeding amd per core.,the 5600 is definitely no slouch either.,the choice will depend on your budget and use case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the i3-12100/12100f is basically the entry level cpu for gaming.,it's $100 and works well enough.,"but the more recommended cpu is the i5-12400/12400f, which is on sale for $155 and performs like a 5600x in gaming.","[newegg via ebay sale](https://www.ebay.com/itm/294691315265?mkcid=16&mkevt=1&mkrid=711-127632-2357-0&ssspo=ok6nawekspa&sssrc=2349624&ssuid=d4vhplbfqke&var=&widget_ver=artemis&media=copy) i would get the 12400f, especially if you plan to keep the cpu for several years and want to play aaa games or do any productivity tasks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a 5600x and can confirm it will be better than the i3 also don't pick i3 because they are kinda not good for anything a bit more extreme.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12100 is a lot slower in games than 5600 not sure what people are talking about here.,even the 12400 is often beaten by the 5600.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it has two less cores at only 4 vs 6, so the 12100 will be worse in most modern games that use 6 or more cores.",if a game is older and uses only like 4 cores the 12100 could be about the same as a 5600 in a lot of titles.,"they are both good value, but intel motherboards often cost more than amd for a board with similar features.",we don't know what the 13100 will be.,it might be 4 big cores with 4 little cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hello op.,i apologize for the necro but i am in a similar position as you right now.,would you mind telling me which choice you ended up making and if you are happy with your decision please?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in real life you wonâ€™t feel any different.,in my opinion the intel i3 12100 is more stable and less â€˜smaller issuesâ€™.,intel 12gen motherboard also can upgrade to a 13gen cpu.,but amd next gen requires new motherboard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

oh.....very thanks for the reassurance.,"here's the thing, i think i'll be using my would-be pc with all the things you listed above cause i want to try content creating out, and being a beginner and curious, really wanting to try and make something on blender (like explosion/destructive sequences and doing a little photoshop for illustrations.","do you think the next i3s will be atleast *decent* in doing some of that, and simultaneously with tabs on the back.",streaming too if i get ambitious hehe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so far the 13th gen i3 series is rumored to be 4p+0e.,the regular i5's will be 6p+4e and the 13600k will be 6p+8e.,"so in terms of performance gains from 12th to 13th gen, the i3's are expected to be the least impressive compared to everything else in the upcoming lineup that gets extra e cores.","it will still be a respectable chip though for budget gaming, it's really solid for $100.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hopefully there will be other small cores to it other than 4p in the i3 13th gen, i only play overwatch and pubg on a laptop and i hope that in a pc it's much better terms of framerate and resolution, and screen size but that's already a given.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if this is all ""just for fun/i want to try it out"", you really shouldn't over-spend, the 12100 will manage those tasks at the very least an acceptable level.",sometimes people give advice as if you're going to be doing this sort of stuff professionally.,in reality you'd probably be pretty happy with a 12100 + rx 6600 system or the equivalent.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it would work but it doesn't make sense, if you're doing heavy cpu loads then buying the worst cpu with the fewest cores is a bad idea",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">1x 16gb ram

this isnt the issue, but dont do this.",get another 16gb module and go dual channel.,you need to give more information like how the cpu performs in cinebench and its temps to help us try and figure out whats wrong with your pc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

maybe your 11700 is being power limited causing a cpu bottleneck?,"might want to check if it's boosting while at 100% usage, if so you may need to increase the power limits in your motherboard's bios.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cyberpunk 2077 is a very cpu intensive game.,at ultra settings itâ€™s entirely possible your 11700 canâ€™t keep up.,"but with that said, i think you first need to ensure everything is working properly on your system.","if you want, you can look at doing the following:

1) please provide your full system hardware specs, especially motherboard, cpu cooler, case, and fan configuration.","2) please download and install hwinfo64 so you can monitor your systemâ€™s performance
3) please download cinebench r23 and run a 10 minute multicore benchmark while hwinfo is running.","4) while r23 is running, monitor the cpuâ€™s temperature, â€œpackage powerâ€, and any thermal or current throttling and report back.",also post the resulting r23 score.,"if thereâ€™s no heat issues, then itâ€™s entirely possible the 11700â€™s pl1 and pl2 power limits are still in place.","the 11700 has a pl1 of just 65 watts, compared to the 11700k at 125 watts and a pl2 of 251 watts.","so ideally the power limits would be removed, but without knowing more about your system itâ€™s hard to say more.","also, as the other poster mentions, never run a single stick of memory in a dual channel memory system.",youâ€™re leaving performance on the table.,"and yes, it is very common for lazy oems to do this and not give a crap.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ram in single channel could be one issues.,"you'll have to find an identical stick to get dual channel after putting it in the correct slot, not just any slot.",other thing is your settings.,"are you playing without dlss with ray tracing set to ""ultra"" and even ""psycho"" ray traced lighting turned on?",that actually can cause the game to drop under 45 fps in certain places in the game.,that in combination with single channel ram would probably be a reason.,"ray tracing is extremely cpu heavy, and bad ram speed will make it even worse.","i would find the exact model number of your ram, and put a 2nd one in the *correct* slot.","or sell your stick, and buy 2x8gb.","then reduce rt lighting to high or medium, but you can leave the rest on.",or use dlss in quality mode.,"the ""psycho"" lighting setting is not worth the insane cost it has on frame rate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got this issue too.,and there is a lot of article talking about high cpu usage no matter how good cpu you got.,"9700k

48 gb ram

thanks for the info.,"cpu monkey shows the r23 score for the 11700 should be more in the 14000 range, so based on that and the low system temps, iâ€™m going to guess that the power limits are still in place and the cpu is being current throttled.","in hwinfo, under one of the many cpu fields, thereâ€™s a group called â€œenhancedâ€.","thatâ€™s where you get all your power info, including the cpuâ€™s active usage.",but thereâ€™s also two fields called pl1 power limit and pl2 power limit.,could you check what those say?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
