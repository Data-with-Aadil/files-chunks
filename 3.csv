are you actually getting bad cinebench scores?,i haven't checked myself but it could just be that task manager is averaging the frequencies of p and e cores.,try monitoring frequency with hwinfo64 instead.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your cpu is most likely screaming for mercy due to that extreme thermal throttling.,run hwinfo64 and show us those wattages and temps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
task manager doesn't provide true frequency reading.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"expand the core clocks in hwinfo and test cinebench again with hwinfo open, also report what the score is, and take a screenshot of all the core speeds during a cinebench run.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are getting throttled somehow.,"try downloading intels xtreme tuning utility (xtu), and see if you're seeing thermal throttling or power throttling.",thermal throttling means your cooling isn't working very well for some reason.,power throttling means your bios is limiting how much power your cpu can pull.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thanks for the clarification.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is the reason of low performance.,"download and run xtu, you have to change the power limits to a 253w in the advanced tab.",re-test.,but be cautious.,your cooling cant handle this cpu under an all-core load with all its power.,i expect 100c at all cores after that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you need to disable memory integrity in windows.,then it should open,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&#x200b;

ok. bit serious:   the ***boxed*** cooler is the stock intel cooler that you often get 'for free' with the cpu.",yes it is trash.,so maybe that is what they meant.,"if you buy a better cooler, it is certainly better than the boxed cooler.","also, your ***case*** (xigmatek venom x) seems pretty trash, because it sucks the air from the front air intakes right from a glass panel (and you can maybe understand that air cant teleport through glass?)",with only a tiny edge for actual airflow.,maye this is what they mean by ***box.,*** the case?,it's kind of a box.,"but with a good actual cooler, you'll probably be reasonably ok with that case.",don't confuse the case with the boxed cooler.,anyways.,both are trash.,and dont put a box on your cooler.,also suggest to remove the case from the box (whot?!,inception!!,a box in a box?,and with the stock cooler it would be a box in a box in a box)  so you can see the rgbs and stuffs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes they meant the case, didnt know the proper english term for the whole pc ""box"" sorry for the bad explanation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah the case is pretty trash.,but if you put an actual good cooler on your cpu it will probably be 'ok'.,the fans will probably spin faster to compensate for the lack of breathing space so it'll be louder.,also depends a bit on the gpu that you're using how bad it'll all be.,just try it.,if it gets a 'hot-box' (see what i did there?),you can always replace the case.,"but if you can still return the case without too much trouble, i suggest you do and get something with better airflow.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

honestly the nv 3070 is going to be your best bet here.,i love my a770 and a770m setups but for the perf/$ you're talking about here the 3070 is the way to go.,alternatively you may want to consider an a750 ($290).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for you 3070 or wait for next gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 3070 price isâ€¦ fine, i guess, but the a770 is trash at any price above $275.","donâ€™t be a beta tester, buy the 3070 or look around for a 6700 xt at around $350 or so.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"me personally, would go for the 3070. intel still has some issues to iron out with arc and you get better performance with the 3070 anyway....

as for waiting for next gen, it's going to be a while for them to release i'm guessing.","add to that the bumped up prices per tier from nvidia, i would just bite the bullet.","and the 3070 at 410 dollars is ok. not a *good* deal imo, since it launched at 500, but looking at the gpu market rn, it's fine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

first of all - stop using that website.,"your xeon is 4 core 4 threads cpu back from 2014. for systems like yours, i wouldn't be worried about any bottlenecks.",if your system runs - that is completely good.,just put them together and play.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that cpu is essentially a 4670k, so can look up benchmarks for that.","in terms of gpu, probably a rx480 or geforce 1060 would be a good match, but for a ~ 10 year old cpu core i wouldn't worry too much about that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"alright, thanks so much!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it was an older build of course its not my main pc, just found it i used it back in 2017 as i remember, it has 16 gigs of ram with this processor, so it just doesnt worth it to get these cards to it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you might have gotten a very good chip.,the voltage isn't the same chip to chip there is always some variance.,my 13700k default voltage in the bios is 1.296v.,but i undervolted it and it's perfectly stable at 1.16v.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
might depend a bit on the motherboard also and also where you measure / which sensor is read out.,its called load-line calibration and is basically the voltage drop over the supply lines to the cpu.,so maybe 1.35v goes in at the vrm side but there is a 0.15v drop in the pcb so 1.21v reaches the cpu.,and some boards apply a aggressive load-line calibration (because they expect a larger drop and want to be absolutely stable for all cpus) and some boards have a default of less load-line calibration.,etc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you run on auto, then voltage runs on adaptive mode and adaptive mode uses voltage/core ratio curve built into the specific unit of a cpu, it varies from one to one.",1.15v stock seem like an outstanding silicon quality.,"also, ditch prime95, it's useless for stability testing, will cut off lots of working completely fine frequencies and voltages, no reason to go above cinebench r23 unless you have some specific server grade workload.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your cpu volt settings is set to auto?,because when mine is set to auto it jumps to 1.4 sometimes.,"so, i just set it at 1.340v, and i hover around 1.30 to 1.32v at 5.5ghz on all pcores for my 13600k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's called silicon lottery.,"my crappy 13600k pulls 180-200w on prim95 as its vid is around 1.3-1.4

i tried lowering the voltages by undervolting, but then it crashes.",it's a junk chip.,thinking about returning it to amazon and gambling with another one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're probably throttling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think that's it.,"by default llc is set in auto, which is 3 in a scale of 1-7. when i manually set llc to 6, the voltage under load is now 1.21 all the time compared to 1.15 with llc on auto.",also power draw increased to 170w.,still that's not 1.35v so i think my motherboard and cpu are just exceptionally good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i didn't realize voltage settings are not the same on each cpu.,that explains why the 13600k i just returned was hitting 1.6v stock and instantly thermal throtting at 114c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"core voltage (actual vrm core voltage in bios) is set to ""auto"" (default).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
these chips do not throttle until it hits temp max.,which is 100c.,def not throttling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, my cpu temp reaches max 77c.",temperature is not a problem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think 1.35 is only default for single core (because then the clocks are highest).,"as soon as you stress all cores, the clocks drop and the voltage also drops.",1.35 for all core would be insane.,on my 12700k that gives 250w or something.,"of course you can force it to all-core high turbo (and that is probably what people with aios etc do, or some motherboards even by default..), but technically that would be overclocking?","on my asrock board, there is a simple option to select what cooler you have, and that determines these settings etc.","i'm sorry, but it canâ´t be that your 'cpu is exceptially good'.",the motherboard and cpu donâ´t *know* that.,"a 'good' cpu would remain stable under lower voltages, but it's not so that the motherboard or whatever tests for stability and determines voltages according to that.","these things are fixed settings for all cpu's, and thus they will be conservative because they have to be stable for all cpu's (good and bad).",afaik there is no such mechanism that automagically lowers voltages for a 'good' cpu.,did you at least set unlimited pl1 and pl2?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"adaptive voltage uses v/f curve, that is individual to each cpu and is reflected by vid values, e.g.",shown by asus motherboards (there are also methods to quickly acquire the curve at any other motherboards).,"but 1.6v is absolutely a motherboard fault, there is no way to get a cpu with vid of 1.6v.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hmmm.... ya kinda weird you have that such low volts set at auto.,could be your mobo bios controlling the volts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's not correct.,"you can have power limit, current limit or vrm throttling at any temperature.","in fact, the cpu temperature will usually be much less than 100c if for example power limit throttling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the low temperature under very heavy load means you're almost certainly throttling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had pl1 and pl2 set to default which is 181w.,i changed them to unlimited (pl1 time 56 seconds) and the voltage remains the same maxing at \~1.15v under load.,cinebench result was also the same.,(24k),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the info.,"it was an asrock z690, i refunded it and got an msi pro z790 instead.",i heard it's a lot easier to fix voltage heating problems with msi's cpu lite load settings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, i was wondering about that too, but this is the voltage when set to auto.",what mobo do you have ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the odds of current and vrm throttling is extremely low except in low end motherboards.,but on that end they shouldnâ€™t get a high end chip.,the newer chips do not throttle until temp max.,the specifics you listed are very specific cases.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, the p-cores stay at 5.1ghz and e-cores at 3.9 ghz during the entire  cinebench benchmark 10 minute run.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

did you undervolted your cpu?",my 13600kf power draw (on stock voltage) is 171w on cinebench r23.,but it draws 132w on a -0.100mv offset.,pl1 & 2 are on unlimited limits.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"look, the 13600k has (by default) a pl1 of 125w.","so if yours draws 140w on a long duration test, it draws *more* power than the intel stock settings.","many motherboards set unlimited pl1/pl2  (for example, if you select that you have an aio cooler), but that's another story.","if you leave the settings on default, you'd expect it to draw 180w for a short duration (tau) and then drop to 125w (with the voltages that belong to such a power setting) during  a long cinebench run.",that is the default behavior.,where did you get that a 13600k should draw 180w+ for long duration?,that's overclocking.,or at least not the default behaviour intel specifies.,"again, many motherboard makers have different settings out-of-the-box than the intel defaults, so a lot of this stuff depends on your board settings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

normal cpus put the power/data wires above the transistors which sit on a flat plane of silicon.,the heatsink is on the other side of the silicon.,"backside in this case refers to behind the transistors, so wires that are closer to the heatsink (""buried"" beneath the transistors).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

with msi motherboard it's much easier to undervolt with cpu lite load.,"watch this video 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mkavitzoly

lite load mode 3 and mode 1 are best

without throttling you should reach 24k at r23 multi at stock frequencies without pl1 and pl2 limits",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'd recommend starting with a -.05 undervolt and go from there.,"my 13700k was stable at -.12, but between -.08 and -.12 there was no difference in temps, so i ended it up leaving it at -.08 because i didn't benefit from any lower stable voltages.","after -.12 temps started dropping again, but i lost stability.","also, i highly recommend using a contact frame if you don't have one already.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you set voltage control to adaptive mode, then set some voltage that's needed for low load workload, then you use ac loadline (lite load contol set to advanced) to bump voltage for all core workload (ac loadline is a coefficient that rises voltage in relation to power draw) and keep balancing these until you've got a stable, satisfying result.","dc loadline is required to be set correctly and in accordance to impedance introduced by llc level, setting dc loadline correctly results in accurate power draw reading, you know dc is set properly, when vid = vcore under all core workload, like cinebench r23.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"since you have an msi board, you can easily undervolt by lowering the cpu lite load https://youtu.be/gcpuuujrqku",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hi, i m at lite load 5 atm .","i get 24k at r23, but on longer runs it goes to 23k since i thermal throttle.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just dont know which setting i should change along with the cpu lite load.,voltage override?adaptive?,adaptive + offset?,vf curve?,"some where unstable, some where stable but with 22k cinebench, some throttled faster etc.. i have a contact frame but i still thermal throttle in long cinebench and ycruncher runs (half the cores @ 100c the rest @ 97c ) .","granted the cooler is not made for so high w/tdp but i thought i could at least get a stable 85c cinebench run...havent tried gaming yet, if it spikes @ 90c during gaming i ll start thinking about resitting the cooler..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

did you set the load line calibration at something like 3?,"you probably have a ton of vdroop at lvl1, compensate it with llc3",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i ll try lite load 3 and llc3 then .,how many hours of ycruncher -or other bench?-  is considered stable?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i m already at  \~100c on ycruncher/r23.,"p95/occt will just throttle even harder, p95 goes as low as 3.6ghz.","tried a bit with lite load 1 and llc3, vcore and temps are higher than plain lite load 5 and auto llc :/",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

scared of 70-75c?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 13600k [isn't hard to cool](https://youtu.be/qklb9pm4hdk?t=351).,it can be cooled by a $30 air cooler.,you probably didn't install that aio properly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which b660 mobo?,check if they have a utility app to monitor temp.,those give more accurate reads of the score and temps.,generally z690 boards have more number of power phases as each individual phase has to work less they make less heat.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
use lite load setting in bios and reduce to ~3-6 vs 9 as default.,"it's an undervolt and should reduce voltages, power and heat with no impact to performance.",it's a bit smarter than a hard power cap.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nope not at all but when i run benchmark in xtu it hits 100c instantly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
undervolted(which op cant do with b660) and with power limits reduced.,"on stock it cannot be cooled with cheap $30 cooler, nonsense.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that impacts vrm heat not cpu temps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's a gigabyte b660i, i couldn't see an option for lite load anywhere",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
look at hwinfo64 and power consumption.,it might go over 181w.,but if you're playing only on this pc - leave it as it is.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can undervolt on any motherboard.,"in fact, that i5 in that video was running on a [b660 board](https://youtu.be/qklb9pm4hdk?t=8).",here's more proof.,"[i5 13600k paired with a $30 ak400 air cooler vs a 240mm aio](https://youtu.be/yxmmbtaclyo?t=572)

top = intel's default power limit.",middle = power limits removed.,bottom = aio with power limits removed),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
better stability of power for the cpu will improve cpu temperatures and lifespan.,also vrm phase component quality is important and the components used in b mobo are low quality compared to z mobo.,13600k will boost past 5ghz in gaming and i say power quality matters here.,"see link below, i paired my baby raptor with a budget z690 mobo from mc.",https://www.reddit.com/r/intel/comments/1007dk9/a_baby_raptor_is_born/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you need to replace the b660 for a z series board for 13th gen  k chips.,the only brand that includes the correct voltage controls for 13th gen on b660 is msi.,otherwise nothing you can do to stop it running at 100c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have one but i'm not with it right now.,i'll try and remember to get back to you if/when i've found the setting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then that reviewer is forgetting about clock stretching.,"at the start of video, you can clearly see cpu instantly hitting almost 100c on cinebench default settings with cheap cooler.","after undervolt, temps are better, 85c on cinebench, but p cores goes only upto 4.9ghz, meaning undervolt doesnt work correctly.","undervolt doesnt cap your clockspeed, correct undervolt doesnt result in any performance drop, only lower power usage.",only msi b660 boards allow correct undervolting by using liteload settings.,"all other b660 boards dont undervolt correctly, because even tho you can apply undervolt, it doesnt work correctly, even with small negative offset cpu starts to clock stretch, meaning it reports clocks as correct, 5.1 for p cores and 3.9 for e cores, but by running something like cinebench you see that bench results are way lower than they should be.","other observed behaviour is, instead of clock stretching, cpu no longer boosts as high as its supposed to on stock settings.","so yes, undervolt dont work correctly on b660 boards, just like i said, and just like your video proves it.","im myself using gigabyte b660 gaming x board, can confirm this is the behaviour you get when trying to undervolt.","you cant do it, without loosing performance.","if your argument is, that 13600k can be cooled with cheap cooler by not running at default performance level, then yes, absolutely, because any cpu, even 13900k can be cooled with 30$ air cooler, by capping its power and not using everything it has.",but you cannot cool 13600k on b660 board with any cheap air cooler without loosing performance.,"and sorry, but random chinese or japanese video from 10k subscriber channel is not a proof.","here is your ""proof"" from reputable channels, running 13600k with good cooling setups at default settings, and sometimes even throttling:

okay thank you.,the cooler i bought is the noctua nh-d15.,do you think my cooler is too weak?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is my personal opinion that anything like a i7 or i9 should be on an aio or watercooled.,that is probably the best air cooler you will be able to find.,so if you do not want to get an aio then do not worry.,that will be the best air cooler for you.,but try to play with fan curves,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

mine idles with a c14s around 32-40c package/individual core temps so itâ€™s pretty standard for air cooling atleast seemingly.,air cooling is fine.,you might just have to tighten the power consumption pl1/pl2 settings from their stock 253w or disable things in bios that unlock this to 300w+.,if only gaming iâ€™d do an undervolt first though and you might be able to recuse temps without lowering those values at all.,the d15 should handle around 200w easily or even more.,just keep changing it then testing until you donâ€™t thermal throttle for indefinite benchmarks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ambient - your room temperature.,"like are you in a basement in winter where itâ€™s 15c, or an unairconditioned tropical climate where itâ€™s 35c.",use a program like hwinfo64 to check your fan speeds.,what case are you using?,thatâ€™s a lot of airflow.,how are case fan speeds being controlled?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

excuse me sir.,do you know if 12100f with sata ssd is good for rpcs3 emulating?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't agree that it only applies to older or indie games.,"if you look at benchmarks of two processors with very similar specs but a different core count, such as the 12100f (4-core) vs the 12400f (6-core) then you can see how much the games really scale with the number of cores.",and the result is that the vast majority of *modern* games today still don't scale much beyond 4 cores (with hyperthreading).,it only gives a few percent increase in fps.,"one notable exception is cyberpunk, which gets a substantial boost in fps when going from 12100f to 12400f.",i'm sure there will be many new games coming that will behave similarly.,"but for now, 4 cores with hyperthreading is definitely the sweet spot for price-to-performance imo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i donâ€™t know about cpu heavy games (like esports) but for typical aaa single player games, it can handle a lot of them at 80-120 fps at 1080p and often 80-90 fps still at 1440. not indie games - but like hzd, sotr, stray, rdr2, odyssey/valhalla, ghostwire tokyo - the stuff iâ€™ve played recently - playing all of this acceptably at 1440 (or at higher fps on 1080) on a 12100f with 6600xt.",undervolted.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for 6 cores vs 8 cores, i haven't yet seen any benchmarks that shows a substantial difference, for any game.",just compare benchmarks of the 5600x and the 5700x.,"even with the added advantage of the 5700x having a little more cache as well, you still can only get a few percent increase in fps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's not about fps.,the difference between say a 4 core and 8 core cpu with identical fps will not show up in a benchmark.,"the frametimes, smoothness, responsiveness, difference in input lag will not show up in a benchmark.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm sure it does and that's great.,but more than 4-6 cores is not about the number of fps you get.,"it's about smoothness, system responsiveness, frame pacing.",there's a noticeable difference between 4 and 10 cores in games that will use more than 6 cores.,it just plays better.,"esport games will run great on 4-6 cores, i mean why would you even upgrade to this if that's all you're doing?",to get 500fps instead of 400fps?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
stop using fps benchmarks to determine which cpu to buy.,there's so much more to a cpu than the average fps you get.,"for gpus sure, but not for cpus, nor for ram.",there are differences that cannot be measured in a benchmark.,you have to use them to notice a difference.,it's like ssds vs hard drives.,there is no benchmark that shows the difference in using windows on a hdd vs ssd.,sure there's drive speeds and loading times you can measure.,but actually using your computer instead of reading numbers off a chart is the best way to feel the difference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no offense but those are all quantifiable aspects of gameplay.,it takes a knowledgeable reviewer to get the data and make sense of it but it's not magic.,"of course if one is always buying the best of the best like a 13900k and 4090, they will have the best gameplay experience.",anyone looking to maximize value will prioritize different aspects of gameplay and put their money into components where it'll make the biggest difference to them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it will show up in a proper benchmark, with frame time graphs and 1% lows measurements.",there are videos on youtube that do all of this.,i haven't seen any data that shows any game having a substantial increase in performance beyond 6 cores.,you'd get a much bigger performance increase just by overclocking a few hundred mhz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no he is right.,the difference between those cpus is not about core count but mainly the amount of cache and small difference in clock speed.,basically if the cpu is not near 100% used then adding cores won't make it faster.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

probably lower clock speeds than raptor lake for the first 1-3 tile generations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i don't think there will be many things that are worse but i also don't entirely believe that all the skus will use a tile approach.,at its current state tiles hardly make any sense,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12th and 13th gen were a straight up downgrade in superpi and pyprime performance at equal clock speeds compared to rocket lake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thank you for that.,i figured it was something straight forward like you explained :-),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel will move to chiplets in laptops this year.,the principle is the same but the problem should be smaller due to use of 3d stacking instead of going through substrate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">amd has been fighting this ever since they introduced chiplets

>for laptops intel will probably keep using monolithic chips

amd were using 14/12nm iod.",totally irrelevant today.,3d stacking and interposer will make chiplets tolerable for high end skus.,obviously 4p chips won't be worth the overhead and cost.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
clock speeds aren't really problematic.,each core has it's own pll.,the interesting part is how much slower the memory subsystem becomes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel igpus now are basically on the same ring bus as cores, l3 and memory controllers are.",so it will be in a much worse position in the 14th gen - a change that can substantially affect its performance.,although it will make igpus resemble their dgpus much more so it will be easier to optimize for a more unified architecture.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's opposite of what op is asking about.,they're asking what current gen monolithic chips might be better at doing than the new tiled processors.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i always heard that rocket lake was a travesty of a cpu compared to 10th gen intel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">intel igpus now are basically on the same ring bus as cores, l3 and memory controllers are.",that's not necessarily a good thing as it has to share resources with cpu cluster.,having its own dedicated l2 block should help it perform better(cpu cores as well).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ah.,i read the question wrong ðÿ˜…,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"rocket lake was sometimes slower and sometimes faster in games, but it didn't have any of the *l0 cache error* and *internal parity error* wheas.",it also sucked down a lot of power.,"one of the strengths of rocket lake however, was it's performance in superpi, pyprime, and other single-threaded benchmarks on hwbot.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

nothing socket wise has changed between z690 and z790.,it's not necessary in either case.,unless you want it.,"it's cheap, and it gives better contact to coolers and allows your cooling to do a more effective job.","if you have the mechanical skills required to use it, i'd use it anyway.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"it's for both cpu family, contact frame is either no change or significant to big improvement, there's no contraindication as to not use it.","there's also the case of evening out the pressure on pcb and pins, which will secure your cpu and socket from bending (i already know about one 13400f that was bent to a point it stopped working, when used with stock ilm) and will prevent weaker contact between pin pads and pins in socket, which will eventually lead to worse ram compatibility.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no it doesnt, you can just go in your bios and deactivate the igpu to have a ""kf""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i7-13700k owner checking in, my igpu idles at about 0.002w so completely negligible, but anyone who is really bothered by that can disable it and still have it just 1 cmos clear away if needed for troubleshooting.","qsv encoding can be nice to have especially if you want to buy a radeon card and stream off of qsv (not sure about the state of radeon encoder these days, my last radeon card was a 5700xt, but qsv is practically indistinguishable from nvenc).",it's also another piece of overclockable hardware in your system for those who enjoy overclocking for the sake of overclocking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they have the igpu and it is disabled on the kf chips.,and the kf models will usually be a lower bin as opposed to the k variant.,so they might not oc as good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is no non-k 13700 yet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to be honest, this can go either way.","you could also have amazing core silicon and a tiny glitch in the igpu, and that gets marked down to a kf.","conversely, intel might be scraping off the best k silicon for the future ks model, which also needs a functional igpu.",iâ€™ve seen awesome kf units and horrible ones.,it really is a lottery.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"k also adds the advantage if you ever have gpu issues you can use the igpu to try to diagnose the issue before you rma your card or send it to a local computer shop, unless you have a cpu lying around with an igpu that works with your current socket.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah going for cinebench scores this can be important,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for the price difference between k and kf you could just buy spare gt 730. then you can troubleshoot igpu issues.,how frequent is igpu issues you face.,doesn't make sense.,but k is definitely better for a slightly better but negligible performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can encode with the igpu so it does help.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in most scenarios, you'd be using the encoder on the graphics card for game streaming so functionally will still be the same.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no problem!,"if the deal on the kf is quite a bit better than the k variant, go for it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"both will look about the same at the low bitrates required for most people trying to stream on twitch tbh, assuming using h264; somewhat similar to x264 fast.","*maybe* nvenc has a bit less block artificating, but is more blurry.","fast motion looks bad on both though, tbh.","i don't think nvidia have made any changes to the h264 encoder since turing, all improvements since have been related to h265 or av1.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not sure.,wouldnâ€™t hurt to try.,i just know that encoding with the igpu on 12th/13th gen is really good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looks like 14th gen (and not 13th refresh) will get av1 encode :-(,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i have a spare gpu hanging around if my main one goes out but itâ€™s handy to not have to go that route if you can avoid it.,iâ€™m glad amd finally added igpus to their new ryzen lineup.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for the entirety of 2019 it actually did because intel held back good k's to rebrand as the ks

459 euro.,it was on sale this weekend at mindfactory in germany.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
encoders donâ€™t make performance differences but it affects the bit rate of an image.,like a good encoder makes a 1080p video look like itâ€™s in 1080p and not just 360p with more pixels,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whatâ€™s that ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no guarranty it's there

also no lower bin at all, my 13700kf can do 5900mhz on 3 cores easily

if anything, they generate a bit less heat",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
really?,lol.,i'm just not into such high performance things,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
anyway to test this ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thereâ€™s an argument that youâ€™ll lose a slight amount of gpu performance in doing so.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"only $360 usd sealed, very low",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s pretty impressive.,"cpu encoding usually is overlooked, never thought it would actually be close.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how do i pick it?,in obs only cpu and nvenc show up i think?,can i see a screenshot of yours in options of obs?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'd recommend them more now if prices weren't so bad.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they affect it slightly.,"run a benchmark with no streaming, then run a benchmark with nvenc streaming and run the same with quicksync.","youâ€™ll probably have the most fps streaming, second with quicksync and nvenc will come in last.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the built in nvidia encoder.,theyâ€™re basically saying just use the encoders on your main gpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i stated.,usually.,you got a good bin.,thats why it's called a lottery winner.,most buyers do not.,and they bin those chips to cherry pick the potential upcoming ks variant.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fair but yeah they usually release k and kf versions first and then other stuff starts coming a few months later,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in advance, for purchasing?",nope.,silicon lottery is literally a lottery.,"you could get one that meets intelâ€™s spec, or one that greatly exceeds it.",overclockers pay big money for good overclocking chips.,"asusâ€™ sp rating is a basic way to roughly determine how good a chip is (although what it bases that on is not the sole metric for how well a chip will overclock), but you donâ€™t know what you got till itâ€™s installed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the 10900k is a 10th gen cpu and has igpu functionality, but the newer gen chips seem to be more geared towards streamers than the older generations, the new 13900k's igpu is also twice as fast.",i can't seem to find much info on this either as i have a 10850k and stream sometimes.,i would like to upgrade to the new 13900k but i'm poor...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yes even if he has nvidia, since itâ€™s still taking marginal processing power to use the asic.","quicksync is also an asic, but the igpu isnâ€™t part of the cpu, it just shares the physical space.",the cpu load is similar whether youâ€™re using the igpu decode asic or the dgpu decode asic.,"however, if the dgpu is rendering at the same time, it canâ€™t render as many frames compared to when the nvenc asic isnâ€™t active.","that being said, weâ€™re talking single digits to 10 frames when the unaffected rate is 140+ fps.",itâ€™s not significant but itâ€™s noticeable if youâ€™re tracking and recording fps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

so this is something youâ€™ve heard of before?,didnâ€™t happen with the 13700kâ€”that chip would get to 97 or 98 before the throttle indicator came on.,tried to google about this discrepancy but couldnâ€™t find anyone else with similar issue.,"either it thinks itâ€™s throttling but it isnâ€™t, or itâ€™s misreading temp by 10 degrees which 13700k didnâ€™t do, or this chip does throttle early at 87-90?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my hwinfo reports 95c as throttling for me for my raptorlake.,you have to change that in the bios.,i think max is 105c (can also depend on motherboard) but i suggest keeping it at 90-95c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is the beta version of hw64?,did it correct temps?,coretemp was giving identical temps too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
z790 rog strix gaming-f mobo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah iâ€™m finding i can set an offset of -.08 and still run stock with lower temps,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what cooler are you using?,"also, could it be that certain cores are being used while others are throttling, so therefore the throttled cores are going to have lower temps?","this pic was during a benchmark of cinebench while various cores were actively throttling, but not all cores",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you are on an asus motherboard go check in the bios what the core temp limit is and set it accordingly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"5.8 is only two cores at a time, thatâ€™s the boost speed of 13900k and does that with two cores at a time only.",if you overclock manually you can set whatever you want though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
some do some dont.,"for example my msi z790 carbon asks you if you're using ""stock"" ""air cooled"" or ""watercooled"".","if you pick watercooled, it goes to unlimited.",if you pick stock it's 125/253.,"if you pick air cooled, it sets to 253/253 which while limited at the same pl2, it will throttle a little later than 125/253.","unlimited is 4095/4095 and it will run until it hits 100c, and then throttle.",it's possible that yours is set to 125/253 or 253/253.,253/253 would throttle around 90c.,125/253 i think throttles around 70c.,i tried all of these btw and witnessed the different throttle points myself so i do have some first hand experience with trying to understand this behavior.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
like i said.,itâ€™s a hwinfo error.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah i found the setting finallyâ€”in my bios it was under multicore enhancement, disable limit 90c or disable limitâ€”i tried both and the disable limit without the 90c got me back to throttling at 100",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"don't use offset, use my flair.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"also, searching after your comment to get some info, it seems itâ€™s normal for a range of less than ten degrees between cores doing different amounts of work as workload gets distributed, there are â€œfavored coresâ€ etc with 13900k",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so i checked and power limits are unlocked.,"all temp monitoring programs show max tjmax of 100 but the max it will record is 90 in any program, for example in intel extreme tuner, the ceiling of the temp graph is 90 degrees",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks, thatâ€™s a super helpful reply.",i just have to start it up and find out.,"maybe asus bios autodetects your cooling capability and does it that way, because i never received a prompt.",i did experience limiting the pl2 to 230ish with my 13700k and it had lower temps but never throttled when i did my pl limit setting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes but is the error that iâ€™m not really throttling, or is the error underreporting temps?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is true when gaming or doing something that is not using every p core heavily.,but with prime 95 every p core is used evenly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just go change your max temp to 95c?,it's a setting in the bios.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no itâ€™s not actually throttling.,which is why i said look at clockspeed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not when certain cores throttle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i checked bios and tried setting temp limit from auto to 100 for both max core and max package temp, yet still wonâ€™t go higher than 90c in hw64, or any other temp monitoring software iâ€™ve tried when cinebench.",it throttles at 90 and clock speeds go down regardless of what i set that value to.,"still getting normal scores for my chip in cinebench, 40k for multicore, despite weird temp readings.",i also checked and the power limits are unlimited for pl1 and pl2 so itâ€™s not capped at a wattage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s actually throttling clock like it says it is.,gonna try to reinstall windows fresh to see if that fixes it.,thinking that maybe booting into windows with a new motherboard screwed something up with sensor reading,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it even says it's throttling in the screenshot.,"stop this, it's not a hwinfo bug",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"dude, stop your stupidity.",these cpus are designed to run at 100 c and do not throttle down until it hits that mark hw info shows throttling when it should not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah he fixed it by changing it in the bios,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can change the thermal limit in the bios.,it is not always 100 c. thatâ€™s just intelâ€™s spec but not every motherboard follows it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if you re-use a z690 board for 13th gen you'll still benefit from the contact frame if it helped your 12th gen cpu.,"the contact frame corrects the socket mounting bracket and its pressure distribution, not the cpu itself.",it'll be interesting to see if the bracket and its pressure points have been fixed on the new z790 boards now that intel's been aware of it for a while and it's been proven that the contact frame does indeed help more often than not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think 3d cache would be niche for sure.,they wont span across segment and will be lot more expensive as well.,plus raptor lake has lot more cache than alder lake for gaming and refresh could potentially add more if required.,so i dont see its that big of a deal.,plus its diy desktop which is a tiny segment of overall revenue.,bread and butter of client is oem laptops.,that is where intel needs meteor lake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
id rather them release nothing than release duds like the 11k series and hand an easy win to amd...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 why do you need a new cpu every year?,so what if it takes 18-24 months for the next generation?,however there is a raptor lake refresh planned.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but he isnt wrong and you seem mad af at intel.,"this is how many industries and businesses operate for profit, just like we could have batteries that last waaay longer but they wont give them to us until they have to so they can maximize profits.....make sure to get the pitchforks out for all the injustices we suffer then?",it's gonna be ok dude...lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">if 3d v cache is so good, why do amd even bother releasing new chips without it?","it comes at a premium price, so i imagine they want it to be the ""enthusiast"" grade option.","i would imagine in the future, it would probably be standard on the high-end series.",>why does the 5800x3d remain the only currently available chip with it?,"in my opinion, the 5800x3d was always more of a prototype, something they could test in production to prove the concept works.","i'm pretty sure they limited v-cache to the 5800x3d because it only has one core complex to add the 3d cache, while the 5900x and 5950x have two core complexes with each having a v-cache stack.",">also it wont be hard for intel to match or even stay ahead of amd when their ddr5 imc cant even run much higher than 6400.

true, but that's a limitation of their infinity fabric concept.","keep the memory controller frequency and memory frequency coupled at 1:1 for lowest possible latency, but limits the max frequency what the imc can handle.","you can uncouple the infinity fabric if you have a high enough memory frequency to overcome the latency penalty, similar to gear 2 for intel.",that's how it worked for ddr4 - i would imagine ddr5 is the same.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the ddr5 imc isn't as big of a deal for chips with v-cache, because the massively larger cache reduces the need for fast memory.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is that hard.,what you said above (that mtl will release) is true for mobile only.,the current roadmap doesn't have anything about mtl desktop and there's rumors that its cancelled and we will just go right from raptor lake refresh into arrow lake,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea but the caches isn't exactly big enough to replace ram.,what happens after the cache is maxed and you need the ram?,maybe this is why not all games benefit from 3d cache?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this looks to be a genuine ax210 m.2 1216 module that has been soldered onto a third party half mini pcie pcb.,"the soldered 1216 formfactor has been increasing in popularity unfortunately with the likes of lg using them in the gram series, however this also means enterprising third parties can used them to make products intel will not like this one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
update: card has arrived and installed into my laptop.,speeds are massively improved from ~200 mbps to 600-700 mbps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel has never made a mini pcie version of ax201, but that doesn't necessarily mean this card is fake, from a silicon point of view.",from the pictures and the descriptions i guess they recycled ax201 chips and soldered them on these mini pcie boards.,"i think you will have to take the risk of getting an non functional card or less-stable signal, but if it works, this is a great product for older laptops.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"half mini is a pcb shape for a pcie device, so any pcie device can be made in half mini, at least if it is physically able to fit in that size.",since m.2.,"is smaller, it should always be possible to take an m.2.",pcie device and make it larger to fit into mini pcie.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's interesting.,i thought half mini has died past intel 7260 wlan module.,there's demand for newer wlan chips for half mini pcie (i.e upgrading wlan card that uses half mini pcie) so i guess it makes sense for side business.,plus the carrier board for half mini pcie -> pcie x1 is really cheap,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
where did you download the driver from?,i plan to upgrade my intel ac7260hmw to this wifi6e network adapter as well?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes there is plenty of demand for newer wlan chips in older form factors but not enough for intel to manufacture them.,"this kind of reminds me of when intel moved from slot 1 to socket 370 pga for cpus, then third parties came up with the s370 pga to slot 1 adapter.",showing my age now.,if there is a niche like this someone will usually fill the gap in the market like they have done so now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i7 10700k should not bottleneck the 4090 much.,sure there will be bottleneck but its like in 1080p at 300 fps.,there should be no bottleneck at 4k.,i9 10850k is like 2-3% faster in gaming.,the main issue with your system is pcie 3.0.  thats holding you down i guess.,also if you want to upgrade wait for 14th gen its going to be a massive improvement over 13th gen.  plus 13th gen has reached eol for that platform.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"13700k is great, but make sure you get a z board.","also if you don't already have one, that 4090 deserves a 4k oled screen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

will you be fine with a i7?,"sure, will you be finer with a i9?",yes.,you want to pus hthose high frame rates than a i9 is how your going to do it.,i have the 13900k and i have never been happier.,at stock cpu goes to 5.5ghz on p cores.,i got my cpu when it was only $520 at microcenter at launch.,the prices have gone up so if you think its worth it or not that is up to you.,but you have a fucking 4090. shell out a little more for your cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"instant options i can think of:

a z590 mobo is probably your cheapest option.","a rog strix board is 150 bucks, everything you have is compatible.",might even be able to clock your ram a bit higher.,"if you really want an i9 the best bang for buck rn is a 12900k and z690 board and use your old ddr4, that would be like 600 bucks together if your power supply can handle it.","(asus prime board and cpu from amazon, from intel and asus, less than 600 so taxes should be covered) and should get you by no problem, maybe upgrade ram when a reeeealy good price is met.",ddr5 board will be same price but you will have to buy compatible ram.,"if you want all out, go 790 dark or hero, good ddr5 ram to go with 13900k.",only reason is why spend so much money on a cpu if you aren't throwing great components at it.,"also, a good cooler is required if you do any i9 upgrade.",thats been an intel thing since 10th gen...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i had a 10700k oc'd to 5.1

it was ""good"" but has been left in the dust by 12th and 13th gen. it is a major bottleneck in most newer games and many less new games in peak fps you can now get out of the 40 series",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you won't notice a difference in games between the 13700k and 13900k

only difference is the # of e-cores",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i checked a few of their older posts.,"they're already *on* a z590 rog strix, with a 10700k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i really dont think cpu bottleneck should be a issue at 4k.,it could be due to pcie 3.0.  i went from 9900k to 5800x and the 5800x seemed faster only in games.,i guess newer cards are being limited by pcie 3.0.  i am using a 3080 though.,also i would say wait for 14th gen.  it will be a great upgrade.,however 13th series is good though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s not a mess but it is more difficult to cool compared to the i7 for basically negligible gains in gaming performance.,plus you only get extra e-cores.,both the i7 and i9 have 8 p-cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thats not true if you play at high refresh rates.,you get better 1% lows and better avg framerate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then theyre already pcie 4. dr5 would be a best bet.,am5 or wait for 14th gen intel..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah i have a z590 rog strix, but it doesnt support 12 or 13 gen processors....so i need to update my mobo as well now if im going to be getting the i7 13900k",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i play at 4k 120

lots of games had issues with the 10700k, even when i had my 3080

granted, many do not have a bottleneck for many do as well

"if you play csgo at 600fps i am sure you won't notice a difference between lows of 515 and 535 fps

mathematically yes but we are a meatbag interfacing with this, i assure you would never notice

both cpus have 8 p core and can be boosted about the same",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would say wait for 14th it supposedly has 20% ipc bump.,its really a big jump if its so.,intel is making steady progress so they might really do this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no it doesnâ€™t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on the game of course.,aaa games like cyberpunk you will definitely feel the difference in 1% lows.,but csgo probably not.,"but what im trying to say is, he is a freaking 4090. he can shell out the extra money to buy the better processor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i already went from 10th to 13th for at least a 50% jump in single core and around 200% in multicore.,already happy with my choice.,waiting is fine but i could afford gifting myself the upgrade,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sorry for some reasion i put p cores instead of e cores,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
he could but it's wasted.,8 efficiency cores vs 16 efficiency cores would only pay off in productivity.,"in gaming, you won't notice the difference other than low single digit difference which can only be seen mathematically.",the meatbag interface would never notice the difference between 150fps and 146fps,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

how do i go about that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
could you tell me the normal voltage for this cpu?,i can't find anything about it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my gigabyte z690i itx showed around 1.250v in bios  before i undervolted it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"holy fuck thatâ€™s high, it should be around 1.25 max",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1. download intel extreme tuning utility.,2. run.,"open advanced mode

alright i'll make sure to check that out thank u,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1.3-1.4 is way too high this is only needed for extreme overclocking.,watch this video he manages to run high 13900k with 1.1v with extreme undervolt/underclock for efficiency.,https://youtu.be/h4bm0wr6oeq?t=807,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

same.,why not share them if it's easy :)  i found some bios settings to tinker with to raise the base pl1 and also limit the pl2.,i've also lowered the voltage and tried to set the gpu throttling temps at 100c.,although for some reason it's throttling at 95c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

your windows might be re downloading older version.,this happened with me too.,avoid installing the driver windows wants to.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dsa is beyond busted.,it will just pop back up again every day or two.,the solution is to disable and never ever use it again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"manually download and install the latest drivers, and then windows will leave them alone:

probably.,if not overpriced and reviews well.,otherwise the 7900 will likely get my cash.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"first off, it was never necessary, the cpus can run without them, they would have been recalled if not.","they just improved cooling, the degree which depending on your motherboard and heatsink.","i honestly can't find any tests done with z790, and considering there was always some variance with how much the contact frame helped between manufacturers, i'd say it's plausible work was done on it.","honestly, i'd first ask if the cold plate on your heatsink convex or flat?","if it's convex, then you wouldn't need a contact frame even with z690, so no worries.","if it's flat, it couldn't hurt to try a contact frame, but i'd probably see how it runs beforehand unless you already have a contact frame lying around.","i know that answer isn't totally satisfactory, but without someone having done tests it's the best i can say.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
per intel - â€œwe strongly recommend against any modifications to the socket or independent loading mechanism.,"such modifications would result in the processor being run outside of specifications and may void any product warrantiesâ€

https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-comments-on-alder-lakes-warping-and-bending-issues-mods-void-warranty",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would recommend using one.,the cpu frame is the same essentially as on z690 boards.,i used 3 of these so far they are easy to use just be careful.,used this on a 13900k also it's fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks guys, i guess i'll try it without the contact frame first and see if the temps are ok",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not necessary.,i've been using gigabyte z690 aorus pro with a 13900k without issue.,i would imagine z790 isn't much different.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just be aware that there are issues with the thermal grizzly frame fitting some z790 motherboards, the included ilm screws on these boards are only 1/4"", which isn't long enough to mount the tg frame, and the tg frame doesn't come with the necessary 3/8"" screws.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think you might be mistaken.,the contact frame is not for the temps it was never was.,it was due to the ilm (intel locking mechanism) putting to much force  on the cpu and bending them making them uneven.,this caused the uneven surface.,the reason intel never recalled them as they don't acknowledge it as an issue.,the lower temps are a bonus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i donâ€™t know why you are getting downvoted but my take on this is how does the contact frame run it out of spec by correcting the ilm?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it varies from motherboard to motherboard.,i have 2 asuâ€™s motherboards i used them on both.,personally i only saw a minor drop in temps 2-3 degrees so not a major drop.,but primarily i bought the thermalright one which was like â£15 for peace of mind for both the 12900k and 13900k setups that i have.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you continue with the stock contact frame of the motherboard?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the contact frame is for temps actually.,"check thermal grizzly's website, they talk about heatsink contact and heat dissipation.","https://www.thermal-grizzly.com/produkte/522-cpu-contact-frame-for-12th-gen-intel-by-der8auer

and intel has addressed the issue.",they refer to it as deflection.,"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-comments-on-alder-lakes-warping-and-bending-issues-mods-void-warranty

yes, the contact frames address the concavity, but why is that important?",because it impacts temperature.,the concavity doesn't violate your warranty.,it doesn't cause the cpu to stop working.,"it is a problem because it can cause poor contact with a heatsink, which result it higher temps due to poor heat dissipation.","the bending and the heat problem are literally one in the same, because the only issue caused by the bending is the heat.","which is why if you have a convex coldplate there's no worries, because a slight bend wouldn't hurt contact with the heatsink.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have that same question,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel left it a while before commenting on this issue.,i used a 12900k for quite a while until it would not boot with 4 ram sticks.,this was down to the bending causing bad contact with the pins.,"the 12900k came out in october/november 2021 and the article was in april 2022.

many people raised or posted about the issue and intel would not acknowlege it at first.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no the contact frame absolutely is to prevent the cpu from bending.,"the reason some people see improved temps right away is because it also flattens any variances in stock ihs curvature, almost like lapping.","this is what happens when you use a 12th / 13th gen cpu without the contact frame:

"here's my story, i recently built a new 13700k system and i have literally installed and reinstalled win10 and win11 like 5 times trying to spot core utilization differences among other things and honestly i can't really see where one os manages my apps and programs better than the other.",i've actually found that my performance has been better with win10 than win11 believe it or not lol.,"what i can say is this, win10 does manage the e-cores but there are some differences that the thread director on win11 does slightly better like automatically learning core prioritization which is convenient.","while using win10 it is strongly recommended that you edit your power settings in the control panel and switch it from ""balanced"" which is default to ""performance"".",they say this does a better job prioritizing your main apps on the p-cores while still leaving those background apps on the e-cores.,i recommend leaving all cores enabled and if you run into any issues with a certain program bouncing off the wrong cores (not common btw) then you can adjust the priority level for that application in task manager.,i am a productivity user and gamer so i tend to float between these 2 worlds daily and i've found that win10 is still the sweet spot right now.,i really do like win11 but the bugs (especially with 22h2 build) are still annoying and can degrade some gaming experiences with random stutters and fps drops.,"this can potentially be managed by disabling core isolation/memory integrity, tpm,  or in some cases disabling resizablebar.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why would you buy a 13900k just to disable the e cores?,"at that point just buy a 13700k, the only benefit of the 13900k is the extra e cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's funny because the e-cores are just crappy intel atom cpus bolted to real cpus.,atoms were and always will be shit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i would agree.,it seems those rumors are from win11 being a crappy os.,"&#x200b;

or maybe just fear mongering from the anti- disable e-core crowd trying to convince everyone to never disable the e-cores even if we simply do not want them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no l3 cache is reduced as it is shared among all cores.,"&#x200b;

the l1 and l2 cache is private and only accessible to the core in use.",so disabling the e-cores should not take any cache away from the p cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well the extra 6mb of l3 cache, and that could be huge for games down the road.","&#x200b;

and i got a good deal at my local micro center for only $549.99 which is way below what it is selling for elsewhere.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 13900k also has higher single-core performance  .,.,.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
skylake not atom lmao still better than nothing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you crack me up with this tirade of not believing falkentyne.,one of the most knowledgeable people on ocn.,discounting him is one of the most foolish things you can do.,lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's the same architecture, just clocked higher, and you can oc to achieve the same clocks",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the e-cores in the 12th and 13th gen cpus are definitely atom (gracemont) cores.,they are even identified as such in the bios.,intel just *claims* these 2021 atom cores have the performance of skylake class cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am not discounting him.,but want to know if anyone else can see the same experience.,i have not heard this from anyone else.,i tested myself with 13900k turned on one e-c0re and cinebench r23 score and cpu-z score were exactly the same.,so i do not see the issue.,"&#x200b;

though could that not tell the whole story.",so what is the deal.,is it only a win11 thing.,is it only their configuration??,"&#x200b;

is there any noticed behavior as i do not want any e-cores on in my win10 install.","&#x200b;

with win11 no choice due to thread director and problems potentially even on 12th gen, but i am staying with win10 a long while anyways.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"maybe i missed something, but in your op you were originally talking about the performance penalty of having zero e-cores enabled, but now you have switched gears and are talking about results with 1 e-core enabled.","on my 13700kf, with all e-cores disabled i am seeing about a 5 percent performance hit in single-thread.","with 1 e-core enabled, the performance is about the same as having all the e-cores enabled.","so it seems that for the best overall single threaded performance, you need to have at least 1 e-core enabled.",it appears that one little e-core is assisting the p-core in that regard.,here are my quick cpu-z benches (windows 11).,"cpu-z benchmarks will vary a bit run-to-run, so i have recorded the min/max ranges of 5 runs each:

1 or more e-cores enabled, single thread: 895-920
all e-cores disabled, single thread: 830-880

all e-cores enabled, all threads: 13100-13230
all e-cores disabled, all thread: 9070-9180",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"w11 can't even deal with multichiplet ryzens still, it's really a garbage os.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes that is what i was talking about single threaded performance.,"&#x200b;

it is puzzling how e-cores could assist p cores in single threaded performance.","&#x200b;

though with win11 it looks like it is a thing likely and perhaps because of this info here:

&#x200b;

which applies to 12th gen too.","&#x200b;

well you are using windows 11 and it appears you are getting similar results to falkentyne over at [overclock.net](https://overclock.net) where there is like a 10s of points single core speed reduction.",falkentyne is also using win11.,i tested it with win10 and cpuz score was 914 at 5.6ghz p core with 1 e core enabled vs all e-cores disabled also 914. i have not yet tested it on win11.,"&#x200b;

and your score is varying even with e-cores on or off for single thread.",is yours a dynamic clock left to boost and not static.,i have mine static manual fixed at 5.6ghz all p core and getting only 914 in cpu-z single core score.,"&#x200b;

what i was trying to get at is maybe falkentyne on to something claiming that e-cores being disabled somehow for some unknown reason hurts single thread perf of p cores due to redesign of raptor lake to allow ring to clock higher with e-cores enabled and perhaps there is something to it with 13th gen universally on all os????",**or maybe just findings with win11?????,"**

&#x200b;

it appears its your findings with win11 as well.","&#x200b;

i need to find win11 22h2 to test it with and see.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got somewhat different results with cinebench r23 compared to cpu-z.,all of the test results were within roughly 1 percent of each other.,"here are my single core results on my 13700kf with 2 runs each of cb23:

one e-core enabled: 2211,2205 

all e-cores enabled: 2209,2214

all e-cores disabled: 2189,2187

when all e-cores are disabled there was a very slight decrease but we are talking 1 percent, so within the margin of error.","to answer your question, i have my p-cores setup in turbo ratio groups in the bios.",group 1: up to 2 cores will run at 5.7 ghz.,group 2: up to 6 cores will run at 5.6 ghz.,group 3: up to 8 cores will run at 5.5 ghz.,i have all the e-cores set to 4.4 ghz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes your scores were within margin of error and on win11 the cinebench single thread score was within margin of error no e-cores vs 1 e-core on.,like 2215 or 2207 or something.,"&#x200b;

but cpu-z a different story.",1 e-core on cou-z single thread score 913-914 multiple runs.,"all e-cores disabled, almost always 875 though one rare run it hit 914. so there is a thing to it with win11.","&#x200b;

now in win10 all e-cores disabled cpu-z single thread score always 914.",1 e-core enabled always 914.,"&#x200b;

thee tests were all p cores statically set to a fixed 5.6ghz.","&#x200b;

so it appears issue of disabling all e-cores creating weird single or slightly more threaded issues and strange behavior reducing performance even as an 8 core 16 thread cpu should behave is a problem with win11 and not win10.","&#x200b;

probably because of win11 being thread director aware and 12th and 13th gen thread director does not know how to behave with the e-cores all disabled.","&#x200b;

but win10 is not thread director aware so the thread director is effectively not being used and thus no issue disabling all e-cores for win10

you can go for high core count e5 v3 or v4 xeons.,advantage of v3 is that you can turbo hack them to get max turbo working for all cores and they are less expensive.,you also can just oc your cpu to get some performance increase.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">my question is, i was thinking of upgrading my memory to 64gb 3300mhz.",is it worth upgrading?,ddr4 is so cheap and so useful in a workstation i would have upgraded that to at least 32 gb a long time ago (jumped up to 128gb recently).,i would not expect the faster frequency to make much difference though given the age of the processor.,"if you're ok with 8 cores and want to stick with intel for mkl, alder/raptor lake would be a pretty big upgrade for single threaded stuff, and maybe you can get some value out of the e cores as well.",not that expensive either.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
buy a cheap 28 core broadwell xeon lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm on x99 still, 5930x.",i bought 32gb of corsair dominator a little while back and it's incompatible.,not sure why tbh but certainly didn't work.,thinking it was just because the bios hasn't had a revision since 2019 (mobos a rampage 5 extreme).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you need the cores there's certainly better cpus.,"i'm pretty sure there's like an 18 core xeon for that platform, but clockspeed will be lower.",as for the single core the 5960x is very good and ocd to 4.5ghz isn't far off from new 8 core cpus.,"3200mhz will be the cap for ram depending on the imc, i'd focus on lowering timings",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so im about to contemplate this exact upgrade.,"&#x200b;

its extremely compelling.","&#x200b;

i would love ddr5 and pcie 5.0 but the current demand and scalper premium is outrageous and too costly to create a spiritual successor to my \~'14 ""workstation-ish"" hedt system.","&#x200b;

i built my system exactly the way it was described when the motherboard was marketed  sabertooth x99, supposedly ""overengineered""  with its backup bios chipset and at least a few methods to mitigate a bad flash or simplify oc (the usb to smartphone plug via that special usb port, although i cant find the app anymore)

those systems.... from the oustide world i cannot say if asus was honest in their busiesss practices but i believe it.","i have built several more workstation-ish machiens using the original blueprint, and they have survived the same 8-9 years in the hands of far more negligent and ignorant ""normal people""

for $200-$500 (i7 to e5 xeon + ecc ram) i should be able to follow the typical upgrade path that posters here and elesewhere have outlined.","i'm genuinely considering giong to a xeon, even if i have to invest more for the ram, so as to give myself a true final ""retirement job"" as an x86 nat/layer 2/3 type router and fileserver.....or even a compute server for offloading media transcoding......   until i find a workableb option for an accelerator, and then i will embark on the long tortoruous process of ai upscaling my image library.,    that was a bit of a digression...

i have a few questions that others who have done this might be able to answer:

&#x200b;

1. given the requirement to either overclock or an outright requirement for anew bios:

a)  what type of software compatibilities, if any, does this create (eg in the sense of unsigned/not verified/not ""trusted"" bios?",are we looking at?,"will this break the trust relationship with the tpm header dongle thing if i want to force windows 11 (i think this is better than the software workaround, unless bios hybridization will break it)

&#x200b;

2)  **with the requirements of oc and/or management of the system under the**   
 **modified bios,** do you have to run asus' terrible horrific com and certificate services and all of the other garbage that comes with ai suite?",afaik the in-os sensor data requires this software.,"asus's fumbling attempts with software continue to be embarassing, especially when you consider how much they have grown since the ri9nky dink days in the early '00s

yes the the m.2 on my rampage board is only pcie3.,only reason x99 is still kicking for me is for multi-core and quad channel memory.,as workloads such as cfd benefits from cores and memory channel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh i'll keep that in mind, i saw on overclock forum that the max xmp someone got on haswel-e was 3200mhz.",most likely i'd get something like 2 32gb kits running at 3000mhz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"about a year ago i spent a long time researching what i would upgrade my x99 5930k cpu to, including all the mega-core count xeons, and did up a chart comparing all the specifications and effective speeds to help me decide.","if your workload involves a ton of rendering or easily scalable processes, those high core count xeons will really churn - but for normal daily use, the extra-slow single threaded clock speeds are a huge hinderance.","in the end, i abandoned going the xeon route and picked up the 6950x - while not the most powerful for multithreaded, probably the most well-rounded cpu available for x99, and it overclocked like a champ too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i actually stumbled upon a youtube video discussing that using the 18 core haswel-e xeon.,it's tempting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"certain workloads like cfd see a performance drop from quad to dual channel, that's partly why i haven't upgraded in a long while.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ah fair, most open-source cfd simulation software has no core limit, and i can access research license for commercial code, so they can use as many cores as possible.","however i also like to run single threaded applications like cad and emulation as well, so it's like a tug-of-war between clock speed and core count",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
p.s.,"ram i'm running now is 16gb dominator platnium @ 3600 mhz, been running that since 2014, new kit was 32gb @ 3200mhz both 4 stick kits if that helps.",i don't think it's a frequency thing in my case.,maybe just too much for the mem controller with more capacity but seems more like a bios compatibility thing to me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gpu's have only gotten to the point where pcie 3.0 is a problem in the last 2-3 years and in general intel were pretty late to the pcie 4.0 party.,x99 has so many quality of life issues like depending on what cpu you out in your motherboard it changes all of your pcie lane allocations and you may loose some functionality if you don't have one of the top end cpu's.,also most of them only have nvme slots running at 2.0 speeds and many even have them only running at sata speeds.,also the boards for the most part lack usb 3 and faster ports and this is especially bad on the lower end models with many having usb hubs onboard rather than multiple controllers which can make things like vr an absolute pain.,"they just aren't very liveable by modern standards plus the record for reliability on the platform is shockingly bad, everyone i know who upgraded to x99 at the same time as me had their motheboards fail in one way or another.","x99 singlehandedly turned me off of ever buying a early adoptor hedt platform ever again, if i had just keept my 4790k for 1-2 more years the experience would be so much better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there were decent boards available.,"the asus tuf x99 sabertooth i bought in 2015 has a pcie 3.0 m.2 slot (does work at full speed, although not sure whether it can boot from it - need to replace the gpu before i finish rebuilding the system).","the x99 chipset itself supports 6 usb 3.0 ports, and the tuf even added dual gen2 10gbit ports.","frankly, the thing has held up really well feature-wise for its age.","i had a major system failure on it last october and thought my motherboard had died (itâ€™s been on 24x7 since 2015), but turns out the gpu had failed instead.","so the system lives for another dayâ€¦ however with many of the cheap modern gpus being pcie 4.0 x4 or x8, thatâ€™s not a great fit for a 3.0 system, so iâ€™ve held off buying anything, but the ancient x1950xt i slapped in is not uefi friendly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"from what i remember there were only 2 boards at launch that supported bootable nvme and they were the top rog and top msi board, later on a couple of the top end boards did get it added in bios updates but it wasn't all that many of them (the asus x99 deluxe 2 i owned never got it despite being the 2nd best board asus sold) 

the issue with the usb was that quite often the stock usb would be allocated as internal headers leaving 2 from the chipset, usually ran into hubs for the lower end models and the higher end models having multiple onboard usb controllers which was sometimes great, other times a nuisance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

so you throw your boxes away before checking theres nothing else inside them?,"every company consolidates orders into fewer packages, if you had bothered to check on your order history, you might have noticed the same consignment / tracking number for the cpu as whatever else was in the box.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what cable are you using?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most likely some bandwidth issue.,"check if the monitor has a diagnostics menu, where it shows the current connection properties (dp speed, lane-count, dsc active?)","and check with the manual of the monitor what bandwidth it needs for 120hz, to find the discrepancy.","&#x200b;

some of dell's laptops for example have dsc disabled in the registry when you use dell's official graphics drivers.",or maybe the monitor only has enough bandwidth for 4k120 when usb3 is disabled through the usb-c input.,or there is only enough bandwidth to reach 4k120 with 8 bit color depth and you have 10 bit selected.,or maybe the the cable is detected as not good enough for the highest dp connection speed (this is a dp feature.,settings that would exceed the available connection speeds are often hidden as a consequence).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

cable needs to be rated for 40gbps for 4k@120hz.,otherwise it downgrades the link speed.,sadly with non-tb cables it's sometimes difficult to tell.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">(except dsc since i have n lg laptop)

what is that supposed to mean?","i just gave an example, that some manufacturers prevent their devices from using dsc in software.","so if the connection you have with your monitor requires dsc to achieve 4k120, than that could be a reason.",i gave you all the reasons i can imagine.,the xe graphics itself far surpasses the bandwidth needed for 4k120.,"if it is running into an issue like too many active monitors or too slow ram, intel's graphics control center would tell you.","like i said, highly likely some form of bandwidth issue, you just need to find the cause, then one can maybe eliminate the problem.",what kind of diagnostics does the monitor show?,does it show the displayport connection speed and lanes etc?,that could be used to eliminate or confirm what precisely is the issue.,what exact monitor is it?,"&#x200b;

may i ask what is the monitor?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the monitor specs make it a point, that over usb-c it only supports 120hz, while it supports 144hz via dp in.","this difference only makes sense, if the monitor uses a 2x lane configuration via usb-c instead of the full 4 lanes of dp.",this means it requires dsc in order to achieve 4k120 on usb-c input.,\-> you can troubleshoot by using a usb-c dp adapter and use the dp-in on the monitor.,this would change the dp lane configuration.,"&#x200b;

the monitors manual lists a usb option, where usb-speed can be selected.","this is typical, as it allows the selection between usb3 and usb2 for usb-c display inputs.","with usb2 selected, the usb-c input will function much like the normal dp input and allow the full 4 lanes.","\-> find this option, check to what is set and if changing it makes a difference.","the existence of this option contradicts that the monitor can only achieve 120hz on usb-c. with usb set to only usb2, there should be no difference between dp in and usb-c in.","furthermore the manual i found online includes a note, that with usb3 active, the monitor can only achieve 4k30 which contradicts simply everything.",it at the very least shows that aoc does not take care when writing their manuals and their specs cannot be trusted!.,"&#x200b;

the manual further reveals, that the monitor is using very custom (= not standardized) video timings to achieve 4k120 & 4k144, whereas it uses standardized timings for 4k60.","as intel igpus are not typically used with gaming monitors, intel drivers might not support those custom timings as they diverge heavily from all of the standard options.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ok it's clear now, this monitor usb connection is usb3.2 gen1, which means it supports up to 5gbps.",your best bet is to connect your monitor through a hub/docking station and use the hdmi inputs instead.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, the manual is subpar and i would need to troubleshoot with different hosts with this monitor to find out the truth.","i looked into the gigabyte m28 / m32 manual, when i considered buying that and while i saw no contradictions the manual left some details out that i would like it to include.","of those monitor-manuals i looked into, lg, dell and benq seem to have the most comprehensive ones, but that still does not mean anything, as for example my expensive dell u3223qe still fails to have working hdr with nvidia gpus (but works fine on intel gpus), so that better manual does not necessarily get you very far.","we just need to factor in testing everything one wants out of the device immediately after purchase and returning it, if it fails.",especially for anything that comes close to the boundaries of the currently possible...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

oops my bad.,sorry.,new to reddit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just because you've been using this pc for almost six months doesn't mean the pump is still working.,have you checked to see if its still working?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so?,did you shake the computer?,did the mount come loose or something?,did the cable come loose?,did the pump stall for whatever other reason?,\-what answers do you expect here?,its like a 65w tdp cpu.,check hwinfo64 to see the actual tdp.,go into the bios to set the maximum temperature to at least protect the cpu.,but then its just throttling and obviously that shouldnt happen with such a lousy cpu and with such a cooler.,so you investigate the problem.,"open it up, check if the pump is running and if the mounting is ok. â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)\_/â¯",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m a total noob at this stuff.,how do we know if itâ€™s working?,the led is lightening up on the pump and the fans are spinning at max speed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol why would i shake it.iâ€™m a total noon at this stuff.,i guess the pump is working fine.,the led is lightening up and the radiator fans are spinning max speed.,it sounds like a jet engine down there.,i guess it is a lousy cpu for 8k rendering.,gave me around 80 to 90 fps in cyberpunk so didnâ€™t think of it as a lousy one yet.,thanks for the answer.,really appreciate it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you get a rpm sensor reading for the aio pump fan in a program like hwinfo64 the pump should still be working.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how the f\* should i know.,maybe your mom vacuum cleaned it and knocked it.,"obviously something is wrong between the cpu and the water, so do whatever the hell you want with this information.",>i guess the pump is working fine.,the led is lightening up and the radiator fans are spinning max speed.,stupid guess.,the actual rotor of the pump can still be jammed up or whatever.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

question i donâ€™t know the answer to: did intel open up the ability to create a raid volume spanning cpu and chipset ports?,for a time i know this was limited to intel-branded ssds only.,may i ask why raid 1?,"ssds are far less likely to suffer failure than mechanical drives, and the ways they do fail might be complicated to diagnose in an array.","additionally, raid 1 is mostly used for mission critical availability, and is not ideal for critical backup as corruption can still be introduced.","proper backup is better done with an external drive/nas or, more ideally, offsite.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they did, i have raid 0 2x4 tb m.2s using the cpu and 1 chipset port on my z790:

https://imgur.com/a/vt3halx

after half filling the array though, it dropped to 12k read and writes.","its just limited to 2 drives max as only 8 dmi lanes, and i was advised that putting both drives on chipset slots would oversaturate the lanes and doing it with the cpu port was better.","and as for raid 1, its a complete waste on m.2s, both for the capacity loss and cost.","if you want a raid 1 array use a pair of hdds for that as a nas, i use a pair of exos 16 tb in raid 1 to back everything else up onto.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so there's like... no option to have a pc with 2x raids on anythying but z790 hero?,as intel canned their ssds.,"https://rog.asus.com/us/motherboards/rog-maximus/rog-maximus-z790-hero-model/spec/

and everything else is a mix of ports.","as for raid, i've lost multiple drives over the 4 decades, and paying 160 eur extra to setup raid for another hdd is cheaper than any headache",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, on my z690 i have a 2tb samsung 980 pro system/app drive on the cpu port, but then i have 2 x 4tb wd red sn700 in raid 0 for data storage.","theyâ€™re just pcie 3.0 (and one of the onboard m.2 slots is 3.0 anyways on most z690 boards), but performance is pretty good - benchmarks are slightly better than the 980 pro.",mass storage is on a couple of external nas systems both in raid 6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is definitely not normal.,can you open the telemetry overlay?,"(ctrl + o) check the temperatures, the reported fan ""speeds"" etc.",post a screenshot if you can.,the fans kick in at temperatures of around 45-50c.,"in my room at 22c the idle temperature of the gpu is 48c, so the fans run at 400ish rpm.","if the fans don't run, you will definitely get thermally throttled very quickly.","if indeed the fans do not run no matter the conditions, then you have a defective card and you should get it replaced as soon as possible.",from the looks of it the problem could be that the fans are not connected to the gpu at all hence the no rgb and no fan power.,"unless you bought the card second hand (and thus can't exchange it), you will have to open the card to fix it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you have no *fans* on the card?,"also, manual fan control isn't in the arc control interface yet, and the rgb is controlled by a separate board in the card and you need to connect the rgb cable to an internal usb header.",the plug for it is under a small rubber cap next to the power cables.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so a few things ive evaluated here.,\*multiple clean driver installations and releases including beta.,\*updated board bios on pc to verify any issues present with compatibility.,\*observed one screen always gets artifacts now out of 4 screens .,issue unique to card.,\*attempted to start a few games.,all ctd (crash to desktop ) after a bit of working .maybe 1 min max.,new and old games.,"bf5 , fallout 4 , etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sounds like your card isnâ€™t getting enough power.,how big psu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
placed card in for rma to newegg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks.,this is my thinking also.,from the looks of it the board is connected to the fans by at least the visible plug.,i've taken the card out at this point but it was running over 75-80c without any fan activity .,could fry an egg on it and when i removed it i couldn't hold it with my hands.,it started artifacting on my larger 4k screen badly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this header i did connect and still nothing.,"fans are off to the point of overheating it seems , so it never activates them at all .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1200 watts and runs my 3070 + 1070 + 1070ti and cpu all at full load no issues.,"i have this card by itself and no lights , no fans running ever .",something may be defective about it.,but i figure i throw the experience out there and network to see if there is some continuity with other users .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so sorry to hear that... 

i really hope you can get the card replaced easily and quickly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looks like the process will be easy.,sent it off a few hours ago and hopefully can get a new one in  .,i have a lot of testing and data processing id like to attempt with the setup .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"out of curiosity, what kinds of testing and data processing are you interested in doing?",are they related to the gpu itself?,"i bought the a770 to  see their potential in ml and other productivity related tasks, so i'm curious if you have similar things in mind.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that's exactly what intel are doing right now with their p-cores and e-cores.,"the e-cores are the ""mediocre cores"" that are slower but more efficient.","13900k also has the fastest single core performance in the world right now, so i don't know what you're complaining about.",there's always going to be a bottleneck somewhere.,the fact that rust is cpu bottlenecked  with a 3080 ti just means that it's not a graphically intensive game.,intel isn't sacrificing single core performance just because they are pushing up the total core count.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"op you seem to have the hypothesis that if only intel done away with 6 out of the 8 p-cores, they could make the remaining two more powerful.",this is not true.,the current p-core is the best that they can make (at scale).,and you get eight of them.,"they could probably make cheaper cpus if they cut down the number of cores, but not faster.",now there is one aspect where fewer cores can help performance: thermals and power draw.,"intel is also taking advantage of this: unused cores are idling and the used cores can now boost to higher clock speeds, and if temperatures are low, tvb can boost those cores even higher.","my 13900k can run a single core at 6.1ghz while when all cores are active and loaded heavily, they will only run at 5.5ghz.","tl;dr: intel is already doing what you are asking for, without cutting back on cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they kinda already do, the i9 is 8 big cores/16 small cores.","also these cores will go into servers, which usually love lots of cores/max multi threaded performance(hecc, amd is going for 128 this gen on servers).","also games for a while used to be very bad at using many cores cuz desktop maxed out at 4c/8t, so games didnâ€™t expect many cores to use.",newer games are better at using more cores generally from my experience.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
apple has done exactly this.,although core counts are still very important even with big.little architectures.,intel is on the right track.,the 13900k is an amazing accomplishment.,intel has made significant performance and efficiency gainâ€™s despite their inability to make chips smaller than the competition.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it looks like someone got wrecked in rust.,it was never an optimized game.,i honor the devs who put so much effort into supporting this game for a long time.,"but performance-wise, especially on high-populated servers, rust is a dog-shit on any pc, even 13900k.",if you're using 13900k you can try to disable 14 e-cores and push a few p cores to a 6.5ghz.,this situation might fit in your 'spandragon' architecture.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> single very very powerful core/normal cores/efficiency cores

look into 10th gen vs 11th gen, because 11th gen was backported, despite having a decent improvement to ipc and single-thread performance, some things saw regression in performance (especially in gaming) because of the core being larger, which caused latency to increase.",so just because the core is larger/more powerful doesn't mean it'll bring an improvement to performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

* ia dc load line = 1.10 mohm

adjust the ia\_acll value higher if needed if it's not stable.",or try an even lower value for lower voltages and less power draw.,however not all chips will be able to drop that below 0.10 mohm.,the 0.20 mohm is already an undervolt fyi.,if you want to use the stock intel svid voltage then set that to 1.10 mohm.,basically this method avoids the issue of using high negative offset voltages and crashing on idle load.,"using the load line tweaking will only effect the loaded voltage, not your idle voltage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

really?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

undervolt it like (-)10mv.,"also just asking, what paste are you using?",i am about to a pc with 13700k pretty hyped for that!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
those temps look in line with what my 12900k would get with the noctua nh-d15 1700 version.,i'll take a guess that those peak temperatures were experienced while loading the game.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah that's your problem or at least one of the problems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,with the undervolt it goes to it's max boost (5.1/3.9) at all times while producing less heat and using less power.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

his 10900k is running at 4.5 instead of 4.9 all core.,the u14s may have problems at full 250 watts load but should handle games.,cyber punk is kinda an outlier as it hits the cpu quite hard for game,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they use a deep cool ak620 which appears to not be enough if it can hit 90c at 50% usage.,the results are also skewed as the 10900k is at 4.5ghz and not 4.9 all core,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"since you have a 4090, both the 7950x and 13900k blow the 5800x3d out of the water

if you have ddr5 you will probably see more gains.,but ops 10900k is also oddly low at 4.5ghz when stock all core is 4.9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at stock 4.9ghz is all core and 5.1ghz would be single core.,but yea i am wondering if the missing 400mhz-500mhz would change some things depending how many cores have load.,this seems unfair tbh but maybe it helps them justify their purchase,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i currently have a 3070. for my 1440p 165hz.,and it has been great.,i usually avg 120fps solid for aaa titles.,with a mixture of high to ultra settings.,"but, i know with the 3090ti, or at least with my calculations, i should be able to reach that 165hz, and most likely stay at that refresh rate with the 3090ti.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's below a nh d15 in all the reviews i've seen so you should be fine with a h150i.,most games also won't be near cyber punk levels of usage.,at max usage if you intended to like render at 250w it will still be quite hot though but nothing like the 320+- the 13900k pulls.,i believe op is also in a smaller form factor case which also drastically can affect air coolers if air flow is not great.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seems they talked about it on another subreddit.,and they mentioned their cpu at stock only holding 4ghz under heavy load.,so they said they set 4.5ghz.,it would be nice to see it re tested at the stock 4.9ghz and unlock the power limits as i wonder how much of the gain would disappear,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that's great to hear.,since im on 3440x1440p the cpu load should be a little lower.,thank you very much for your help and all the answers.,i wish you alot of fun with your setup.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah no problem!,you as well!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is incorrect.,both high performance and balanced should allow for max boost.,you may need to change settings in your bios if you aren't seeing the appropriate boost speeds under load.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is only applicable to laptops if you want to save power.,"for desktops, it does not matter which one you choose.",just do not use power saver though on desktop.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is not the case.,"it is possible that at max performance your cpu was throttling due to thermals, and reducing the temperature may be allowing it to boost higher.",this could be more of a cooling issue than anything else.,"in a *normal* situation, setting the computer to *max performance* is what would yield ... maximum performance (not balanced).","ideally, you'd want to take care of these things in bios anyway, not by playing with windows power plans (let alone doing it in ways that would ordinarily harm performance).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"choose power plant on windows settings to "" performance mode "" to archive your processor maximum performance.",intel turbo boost app had no longer used.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, as others have mentioned that is not nor should normally be the case, but the advice to use balanced versus performance is still relevant, especially for laptop/sff pc users.","but, even on desktop itâ€™s the difference between a cpu idling at 10 versus 30+ watts, and the now-antiquated performance mode (maybe it was useful years ago) does not actually result in any meaningful performance increase.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is not accurate for most users.,power plans control only two relevant settings.,minimum processor state and maximum processor state.,"the plans have the following settings on w11 by default:

high performance - these are both set to 100%.","balanced - min is 5%, max is 100%

some manufacturers change the plans/settings by default particularly on laptops they may have a rather aggressive power saving mode in which switching to balanced may help, they may also modify existing profiles so they're less meaningful, this might help others with the same device with a similarly customised install (assuming that's why this worked for you) but it probably would harm performance or have no positive impact for the majority of users.",in your instance it probably worked as maximum state was set below 100% or you've lifted up minimum state compared to your original power plan.,i hope this clarifies a little :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so just messing around with my 12900k and my 13900k if you put on performance mode the cpus wonâ€™t hit the two core boost and will be locked at the max all core speed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your cpu is getting too hot.,you need to get a better cooler if you want to run higher clocks/boosts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the reply.,"i tried to find this option in my motherboard's version of bios (not the original blue screen), looked under every setting, and it wasn't there.","however, changing the power mode fixed my problem instantly.","&#x200b;

and i should probably add that i put my minimum processor state at 95% and max to 99, because i found out on some forum that it will increase my performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's fine, glad it worked for you, but that's not how things normally work.","some oem pcs won't have any sort of bios settings like that, so windows power is what you're stuck with.","high performance should be the one that holds boost longest, but it's possible you had custom settings put in that made balanced better.",realistically the difference between balanced and max is going to be minimal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
youâ€™re maxing out at 60fps with a 4080 and 9700k???,that seems off.,"i was playing 1440p 144hz with a 8700 and 3070ti before upgrading to 12th gen. even then itâ€™s mostly just my 1% lows that improved, barely more fps.","sounds like something may be off, maybe you plugged the monitor into your mobo not gpu?",did you cap your fps?,is that at 4k?,"even at 4k you should get more in wow, and the cpu wouldnâ€™t affect high resolution gaming.",in my opinion iâ€™d wait another generation.,the 9700k has enough cores and single core performance to continue doing well in gaming.,"yes new cpuâ€™s are a lot better, but for gaming your setup sounds quite high end already and you wouldnâ€™t see much improvement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i just recently upgraded from a 9900k to a 13700k and it's definitely a worthwhile difference if you have the money to do it.,the change in the 1% lows makes my 3090 feel that much better on top of the few frames i gained on the top end.,"only because you were on a 9700k beforehand, i'd say to maybe look into the 13600k with a ddr4 board as well to offset the cost of the cooler, as it is a more efficient and better performer than the 12900k, and would allow you to incorporate the ddr4 you currently have if you're so inclined to.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have 9700k and i don't think upgrading 13600k is worth the price.,you gotta spend at least $500 for a 15%-20% performance.,i just got an alienware qd-oled and it is one of the best upgrades you can do for your 4080 to really enjoy the games.,"also depends on the games you are playing as well, if you are playing old games like i do not worth it.",i am waiting for more cpu performance lift to upgrade.,"if you can wait a year or two, fast ddr5 ram prices will come down probably as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i tried going from a 9600k to a 9900k and it was not worth the money at the time which was 300 used.,much bigger improvement going to a 12400f which i recently upgraded to a 12700kf.,iâ€™d definitely go 12 or 13th gen if you want to notice a difference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it depends on whether you just play wow or if you plan on playing more demanding games.,"also, what else do you use your pc for ?",and how much are you willing to spend ?,strictly gaming ?,your fine for now.,however a b660 and a 12400f would give your card room to breathe and would be light on your wallet as you can reuse the rest of your components.,or wait a bit for the 13400f.,supposed to be coming with e cores.,both those would be inexpensive and give you some more frames.,true next gen games are just trickling in now.,surprising for year 3 of the next gen consoles but it's been a tough 3 years worldwide.,so your current rig is fine for wow.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for sure you need to ugprade... you can go wrong with either of the 13th gen chip.,"i have 13600k paired with my 3080, for 1440p gaming 165hz, its been perfect, most of the time going over 165hz.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"some might disagree, but what about sticking with 9th gen, and getting the i9-9900k?","you won't need to swap your mobo, and you'll get double the threads, and higher clocks.","cheaper too, since second hand older processors can be found for lower than their original msrp.","edit: by the way, that is a 100% bottleneck with your current processor, so any upgrade is a worthwhile one!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"get a 13600k or 13700k, the 13900k is a terrible value for gaming although if you got a 4080 you clearly donâ€™t give much a shit about value",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're already with 4080. what would be more pricey lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it depends on how fully utilized your current system is, do you find yourself often in a cpu-bound scenario?",no?,then you don't need any more cpu power or else you will be paying for something you don't need.,gaming alone will usually not maximize the usage of a modern cpu.,"but if you multitask a lot and have background apps running, or you have a workload in the background(eg, video encoding/streaming/etc) when you are gaming then yes, a more powerful cpu will be helpful.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you will feel the difference when you upgrade to a 13600k.,you donâ€™t need the 13700k or 13900k since you mostly just game on your system.,you can easily overclock your 13600k to 5.4-5.5ghz and get a good ddr4 mobo.,make sure your ddr4 kit is samsung b die and tune it.,ddr5 will not make sense unless you can bring it to 7000+.,if youâ€™re going ddr4 route z690 will be fine.,if youâ€™re going ddr5 make sure to get a good z790 mobo (8 layer pcb minimum).,z790 mobos overclock memory way better than z690 mobos when it comes to ddr5.,ddr5 6000+ and below will lose to tuned ddr4 in almost every game.,people donâ€™t realize how strong ddr4 still is.,"ddr5 is really just for people who can push the platform above 7000. 

might i add, if youâ€™re the type who does not have any idea about tuning and you donâ€™t want to touch any bios settings.",just get a 5800x3d.,this will pretty much give you most of the performance of a 13th gen system without having the need to tune.,you can also just plug your existing ddr4 kit here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

maybe.,i donâ€™t use facebook at all anymore though but thatâ€™s a good idea if you are in the hardware flipping game.,also your flair made me chuckle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fair enough!,"facebook is a cesspool, but marketplace is the best for good deals.","and yeah haha, flair depicts my immense saltiness over intel dropping 11th gen support to perfectly capable boards.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intels official specs list 1.1ghz as the base clock, 4.7ghz as the maximum turbo clock.","not sure where 2.5ghz comes in, probably just an improperly labeled spec.","base clock for the most part is an irrelevant metric anyways, as the system is only going to be running at base clock when completely idle, or severely overheated.","the 4.7ghz max turbo is much more relevant to average users, although that is depending on thermals, power limit, and also is only calculated for one core, all core load turbo clocks will be a few hundred mhz lower.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the official base tdp (pl1) is 9w / 1.1ghz.,"however the manufacturer can change the tdp as much as they want, lower or higher - like the official turbo tdp (pl2) is 29w, which gets you the â€œup to 4.7ghzâ€ part.",iâ€™m willing to bet that laptop has a higher pl1 than 9w (which is very low for a laptop vs a tablet or tiny ultralight) which is why theyâ€™re giving you a higher spec.,base clock in this case is just an estimate of what speed the cpu will be running at under full load while maintaining pl1 power limits.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that clears things up.,thanks for that.,"the retailer was advertising 2.5ghz clock speed, which clearly is misleading.",thanks for the extra info on the other cores.,wasn't aware that was a thing.,i'll ensure extra precaution from pushing the laptop to the nth degree.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
everything with these processors in a laptop environment is bs.,"it depends on the tdp set by the manufacturer (yes, laptop manufacturers can go below or above what intel specified), it depends on the cooling solution, it depends on so many factors.","for example, the 1.1ghz base and 4.7ghz max only applies to the p-cores, of which this particular processor has 2 of them.","for the e-cores, base clock is 0.8ghz and max clock is 3.5ghz, of which this cpu has 8.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

of course.,nvidia is the worst.,"but since weâ€™re talking about intel in laptops well yeah, donâ€™t judge the ghz op, better watch real reviews.","no one should care much about the ghz anymore anyways, because different architectures produce different results and ipc is more important anyways.","all that, besides the usual marketing bs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you'd also have to look at iccmax as that should be 500 amps for 13th gen by default.,i believe 12th gen was 240 amps.,having this lower would limit your power draw to around \~190-200w max.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"some motherboards will default to unlimited power limits, but stock should be pl1=pl2=253w.","it looks like your power limits are correct, but your scores seem power limited if it's using a max 190w.",it should be boosting up to 253w.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" that pl1 limit is unfortunate but it's pretty expected for an itx board, it may be that the board's vrm cannot handle sustained loads higher than 125w so it might be fixed there to stop you from frying it.","ia limit reasons shows that you only got thermal limited and pl1/pl2 limited, so it doesn't seem like there are any other problems.","the max cpu package temperature shows 90c, maybe you can try to change the max temp somewhere in the bios to 100c (intel's spec) to eek out a little bit more performance, if the motherboard allows that.",you could also try a better cooling system to stop the thermal limiting.,"however, if you aren't reaching 90c anymore after the pl1 limit kicks in, you wouldn't see performance improvements from a better cooler or a higher thermal limit (except for the few seconds you get under pl2, before pl1 kicks in), since the pl1 limit will stop you from thermal throttling anyway.",it looks like the main limiting factor is just the pl1 limit so you'd have to get a new motherboard if you wanted to change that.,"other than that, you can only try to undervolt as much as possible to get the maximum performance out of 125w.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"apparently there is a hidden option to increase pl1 to 150w, in the bios at ""oc tweaker - base frequency boost - 150w"", i found it in this thread with people who own the same motherboard:

"sorry, i just saw your request on one of my other posts...

&#x200b;

as another user has already posted, go to oc tweaker menu and right near the top is base frequency boost, set that to 150, then at the bottom of  oc tweaker, set pl1 to 150w, time to 224s, pl2 to 241w.","&#x200b;

go to fivr.","set p-core undervolt to ""legacy all core undervolt, -100mv"".",set e-core same: these will reduce your peak load vcore...  set cache undervolt to -70mv.,"set uncore/sa undervolt to -70mv:  these will reduce your low load vcore... (because vcore is actually set by whatever the highest requested is between pcores, ecores, cache, sa, and igpu)

&#x200b;

somewhere is vcore compensation with values of auto, lvl 1,2,3,4,5.  i left this on auto.",somewhere else is load line calibration with the same potential values.,i set this to level 5.,(this allows vcore to droop at higher loads.,"&#x200b;

these settings work for my 12700k on this board (in fact i can use -105 to -110mv on p-cores and e-cores with stock settings, but i overclock too, so i pulled them back a bit for stability)  with my cpu at stock frequencies, -105mv on cores and llc level 5, i went from 190w out of the box to 145w (in cinebench r23).","no throttling **at all** for power or thermals, as it was persistently below that limiting pl1, and my scores in r23 went up noticably.","&#x200b;

your aio cooler is small unfortunately so your returns may be limited a bit, however are you getting a good thermal interface between the cpu and waterblock?...","this motherboard is one of the ones that **will** bend your cpu a bit with the mounting bracket on the motherboard, which will cause a poor thermal connection.","i used the washer mod initially, which actually worked great for me, and i bought a cheap, under â£15 mounting plate from amazon when they became available, which also worked great but didn't work any better than just washers under the original mounting bracket.","the washer mod was instrumental in reducing my temperatures significantly...  my cooling solution is nowhere near comparable to yours as i have a 240mm rad and a 280mm rad in series in a custom loop, but if your cpu isn't contacting the waterblock well, no matter what size your radiator is or isn't, you wont even be taking the heat out of the cpu to begin with!",**i suspect that this actually could be your main issue!,"if you are only at 125w and you're hitting 90c, then your cooling is the issue.","fix that, then you can enable the 150w as above.",**  ***but your inability to cool 125w with even just a 140w rad is concerning.,"***

is the pump actually running?","at idle workload, set the fans to 0%, and set the pump to 100%.",can you hear it?,"if yes, set the pump to 45-60% (wherever it just starts being audible), and set the fans to 100%, then run r23 and see what the temperature is... with your 125w limit it really shouldn't be over 70c, even with a 140mm rad.... if it is, take the cpu waterblock off and firstly check that you haven't accidentally left a plastic film protector on the waterblock (it is easily done).","if that's not the case, check what the leftover thermal paste looks like on the cpu.","if it hasn't spread to cover the whole cpu and has left a nice circle shap behind from the factory fitted thermal compound on the waterblock, then that factory fitted compound had dried up, and you need to clean it off with proper tim cleaning solution, and re-fit the waterblock with a fresh application of grizzly kryonaut thermal compound.","if that second one wasn't the case eiter, look at the pattern the thermal compound actually did leave on the cpu...  if it looks thick in a line across the middle of the cpu and there is very little on the top and bottom edges of the cpu, then your cpu is being bent in the middle by the motherboard mounting hardware and you need a mounting plate or washer mod.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"honestly that bloatware that is ""armoury crate"" isn't doing you any favors.","firstly i would assume its reporting the temp of the highest core, which, assuming you don't have anything else running, is probably whichever core(s) is handling running that software, and given that it is terrible software...is probably using more cpu power than it needs to.","as the other have said though, undervolting and adjusting your fan curves are some quick things that can/will make a difference.",you can also try a contact frame.,"some people are reporting modest improvements on 12th and 13th gen.

no.,everything turned on.,fans.,block.,pump etc.,the vga led on the board was lit solid and the fans on my rtx 4090 spun up for 3 seconds then stopped.,no display was showing.,so removed it and tried booting just using the onboard hdmi and it still didnâ€™t post.,i reseated ram.,cpu.,nothing worked.,i tried to flash over a new bios it even failed to do that.,everything i got is new and arrived sealed and the cpu i ordered direct from intel u.s. but yes it says on gigabytes site the board is supported but the reply i got back from them claims it isnâ€™t.,who knows i just know itâ€™s not working.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i thought it was strange too giving the claims i seen (the links you posted) but no matter what i did it would not post.,"i went as far as disconnecting everything from the board, using just the pump and one dimm but for the life of me i could not get the vga led to go off and nothing would post on screen.",i was as stumped as you are considering the cpu is claimed to work best with the z790 chipset.,due to work i gave the board to my partner to post back which she still hasnâ€™t done yet.,this is why iâ€™m confused.,those sites claim it is compatible but gigabyte said itâ€™s not and going by the problems iâ€™ve had just trying to get it to post i assumed the same.,i donâ€™t even have a multimeter to test the board.,i tried using qflash hoping it was something as simple as the board didnâ€™t have a bios flashed over or it was outdated but it even failed to do that.,thatâ€™s when i decided to just remove it i had nothing else to try.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's rather unusual.,"aside from individually testing each component in another pc, i'm not too sure what to do.",there's a chance you were affected by long ddr5 post times.,"this was more of a problem on [am5 motherboards](https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/long-am5-post-times.300869/), with asrock initially warning of boot times as high as [400 seconds](https://www.techpowerup.com/298463/asrock-x670e-steel-legend-motherboard-needs-hundreds-of-seconds-at-first-boot-or-clear-cmos-to-train-memory#g298463-1).",some [z690](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/s0d2y6/is_it_normal_for_asus_rog_maximus_z690_hero_to/?sort=top) and [z790](https://www.reddit.com/r/msi_gaming/comments/zqh4zr/z790_msi_carbon_wifi_boot_times_4x_slower_than_my/) users have reported a similar issue.,"if this impacted your board, you might've not given enough time when booting.","this is pretty far-fetched since it doesn't seem to be as much of an issue with lga1700 motherboards, but i think it's worth asking.",do you remember how long you left the build after turning it on?,"as for motherboard recommendations, both of the msi boards you mentioned should be solid at around $300.","you could also consider a z690 board instead; according to [intel ark](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/compare.html?productids=218833,229721), there aren't many inherent differences between z690 and z790.",a cheaper board like the [pro z690-a](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/qnwypg/msi-pro-z690-a-atx-lga1700-motherboard-pro-z690-a) ($207) is good enough for most people who aren't competitively overclocking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
unusual indeed.,i ripped the i7 chip from my test bench last night and tried with the crucial 128gb ram i got for the build.,it posted.,"however, my test bench has 64gb of corsiar vengeance ram so i tried that with the i9 cpu, sadly it failed to post.","but my test bench is a 1700 socket so i put the i9 chip in just to make sure it wasnâ€™t faulty, it posted instantly.",so itâ€™s defo the cpu thatâ€™s causing it which backs up the incompatibility claim from gigabyte.,i donâ€™t understand how they can list it as compatible without actually testing it first.,thanks for your input on the recommend board too iâ€™ve ordered an msi instead.,reading up online gigabyte donâ€™t seem to have very many good reviews these days which is sad because they use to be a good brand.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what's the lowest amount of memory you tried to post with the cpu on the gigabyte board?,ddr4 or ddr5?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
32gb dimm of ddr5.,i never put all ram modules in when i build a system until it posts.,the board has been sent back.,as i said above i ripped hardware from my test bench corsiar vengennce ram ddr5 and an i7 on the gigabyte board and it posted no problem.,i swapped the ram for the original ram i got for the build staying with the i7 and again it posted.,itâ€™s only when i put the i9 chip in it failed to post.,the i9 posted in my test bench so it was the mobo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

my pc has crashed 3 times since iâ€™ve built my new pc due to kernel power 41. first time was while i was gaming.,second time was while i was shutting down my pc for the night.,third time was while gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what does the bug check event say?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is the nature of the crash?,does it just suddenly go black then reboot?,does the screen freeze and require you to hold in power button?,do you get the blue screen thingy?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've been getting a lot of kernel-power 41 crashes when i'm gaming.,i am suspecting it's my psu because i am running an arc a750 on a 450w white rated psu.,i already ordered a 650w gold rated psu and hopefully that would fix that issue.,"if not, i am blaming my arc a750 next.",but your psu is really good.,so i can't say we have the exact same issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

donâ€™t think so.,only things iâ€™ve changed about my pc are that i turned on xmp profile timings but set my speed to run at 3200 mhz rather than 3600 (bc my pc black screens when i set to default xmp) and ran memtest and it was stable.,changed my pc power plan to balanced.,ran troubleshoot and diagnostic stuff but that said there were no issues.,made sure my intel me drivers and all other drivers were up to date.,also apparently corsair dom plat ram is pretty unreliable so iâ€™ve submitted a return request for it and have ordered a g.skill set from my moboâ€™s qvl list.,hopefully that solves some ram problems i was having previously.,but as of right now i havenâ€™t gotten any crashes but that happens randomly.,so no way to tell if my system is stable now or not.,i still havenâ€™t gotten a concrete answer as to what typically causes kernel power error 41 either?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you can look at cpu clocks right after the test is done - scroll down the result page,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends what you define as gaming.,i use 6700hq.,it's fine for general use and most games released before 2016 or the lighter esports titles,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"most games are more gpu reliant than cpu, like first-person shooters and open world games.",some games are more cpu-heavy and those might have trouble.,"depending on what graphics card you are using, it should be ok for all but the most demanding modern titles.",pick a few games you either like to play or would like to play and just have a look at its minimum and recommended system requirements for each game.,"for example, world of warcraft recommends intel core i7-4770 or amd fx-8310 or better and warzone 2.0 recommends intel core i5-6600k / core i7-4770 / amd ryzen 5 1400 or better.",so the i7-7700hq is better than both the minimum and recommended requirements for those two games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i would say yes but really it all comes down to how you define ""general use and occasional gaming"".",it has a high single core clock speed so lightly threaded apps/games should run well.,you just have to be aware that you have limited threads.,modern apps that use a lot of threads may run worse.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is even a mobile one.,"you can watch youtube, read reddit, send emails.",play terraria.,what else you need?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i use a 3930k for general stuff and it works great.,i sometimes play [beamng.drive](https://beamng.drive) and it works fine there too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
general use?,absolutely.,youâ€™ll have no issue doing any computer tasks with it?,gaming?,mostly yes.,some newer games really like having six or more cores but for the most part there isnâ€™t going to be a game it canâ€™t run at 60 fps and it will have zero issue running e-sports games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh very much so.,that cpu will be good for all your basic use cases.,"i have a potato toshiba laptop(windows 10 os) i use when travelling which has a amd a4-5000 apu and it handles general tasks like browsing, office tasks and video streaming/casting just fine.",just make sure to pair the cpu with a ssd and 16gb of ram.,edit: if using only the integrated graphics for gaming expect to play e-sport games at low resolutions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the cpu is fine for general use

if your laptop only has integrated graphics, it won't be very good for most games.",just some very simple ones with settings turned down.,"if you have discrete graphics, it depends on how fast the one you have is.",usually kaby lake i7 are still pretty capable if paired with a good enough gpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i use a 7700 with a 3060 and 99 percent of games run very smooth on ultra settings.,plague tale is the only one i have trouble running at 60 on higher settings.,if you need you can turn cpu heavy settings lower in cpu heavy games if you ever have stuttering or lower frames.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have a dell xps 9560 with this chip and a gtx 1050. it may just be my laptop model but to run games without the chip throttling to 800mhz until a reboot i need to undervolt it and disable turbo boost.,"in terms of games i can play destiny 2 at medium settings at a locked 30 fps and ace combat 7 at the setting under ultra at 60. not tried much else, mw19 didnâ€™t run well on it so iâ€™d imagine more simple recent games from 2017ish and before aaa will be okay though.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i can set the offset as low as i want on my 13600k but it seems to be clock stretching as the performance decreases very quickly.,even with just -0.010v offset.,there's either something new with the 13th/12th gen cpus that is trying to block undervolting or it might be that the b660 motherboards don't properly support undervolting.,"i found out about a setting called cep, current excursion protection, which you apparently have to disable if you want to undervolt, but it didn't change anything when i disabled it in my bios.",do you get the same performance in benchmarks with the -0.050v offset compared to stock settings?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had a msi b560i gaming edge board that did the same exact thing.,it's got to be a hard limit msi sets on certain skus of boards or the cpus socketed into them.,i got around this by using throttlestop to lower my voltages instead though.,"so you could look into using that, intel xtu is an option as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as far as i know, xtu does not allow you to change voltage, or am i wrong?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i currently use xtu to tweak voltages for overclocking while i'm in the os so i don't have to constantly go into uefi while experimenting (on my main desktop; not the sff that uses the b560i).,"so it will let you, and you've got an unlocked cpu so i think you should be able to do it in xtu as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for me all voltage controls in xtu are greyed out.,it was the same when i had 11700k and b560m aorus pro.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
xtu doesnâ€™t allow you to change any overclocking options unless you have a z-series motherboard.,you can change some things like the power limits but pretty much everything else is greyed out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i recommend taking a look at throttlestop.,i wasn't aware xtu only allowed options for z series motherboards but i've personally used throttlestop on my own b series boards and locked cpus as well as on laptop cpus.,"there are some very quick guides you can read on undervolting in throttlestop, for the most part it works just like anything else with the caveat being you've got to manually start it when you boot into your os to apply the undervolt again (at least i've never been able to get the auto start feature to work, but i'm on windows 11)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they must have locked it out for b motherboards recently.,i remember using xtu for undervolting a year ago on my b560m aorus pro ax.,"thanks, will take a look at it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

jesus christ the amount of misinformation here is insane.,i thought at r/intel you people would at least know about intel cpus.,have you commenters that keep saying voltage or temp too high not seen reviews yet?,this is just default behavior for 13th gen on any high end motherboard that uses high power limits by default.,the cpu will clock as high as it can and hit 100c even on high end cooling.,itâ€™s literally in every 13th gen review wtf.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what cooler are you running?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1.473vâ€¦ please undervolt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
go into bios and do a -0.100v offset you will thank me later ðÿ˜.,running 13900k stock boost clock with a 360mm aio and max temp in cinabench r23 is 82 celcius.,score increased from 38k to 39.8k from just that one small voltage offset while running cooler.,"itâ€™s a win-win

ps: my cpu temp also went to 100 celsius in cinabench before i did the undervolt so my cooling is nothing special.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you peal off the sticker on aio.,"surprisingly, i've seen many people to made the same mistake.",also do check your thermal paste application.,it very unlikely that a brand new aio is busted.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
make sure your mobo manufacturer doesn't have multi core enhancement enabled by default.,could be overvolting the cpu and trying to run everything at max boost at all times.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your voltage is way too high.,i recommend trying to undervolt your chip until it starts to lose stability.,a h150i should be more than enough for this chio,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1.473v lol.,"i'm not even bothering to help with this anymore, you need to send this shit to intel support and get a replacement chip, stop wasting time even bothering to do anything else.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you should try to undervolt like other stated.,that will help.,you can also likely change your max temps too.,i put mine at 115c.,i know it will never get close during real work loads but 100c is too low for a 13900k imho.,"when benchmarking or testing for stability itâ€™s nice to make sure you arenâ€™t throttling, and reaching 100c while on stock settings will certainly make you throttle down to 5.2-5.4ghz.","the aio is fine, but you are likely drawing 300-330w at those settings, assuming multi core enhancement is turned on by default in the bios.",the 13900k is just super hard to cool.,24 cores at 10nm is just too much lol.,things a beast in benchmarks but damn.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what cpu and are you overclocking ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 you probably need an updated mounting hardware for the aio?,"i had this with an arctic freezerit may hit the proper holes on the mobo, but the spacers are too big, so the cooling plate is like .1 mm off the cpu die.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
check the mount if that's good then just undervolt.,i've undervolted my 13600k -.140 core offset cache offset an e core offset.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whatâ€™s your motherboard?,the voltage seems too high for me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
go into your uefi and change your power limits and/or undervolt your cpu.,very few coolers can run the 13900k in cb without thermal throttling at all stock settings.,edit: if you want to tweak it first before doing changes in the uefi download intel xtu and mess with the voltage offsets / curve and power limits in there first.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you ensure at least adequate airflow?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"read up, there's lots of info about how to cool down the 13900k on this sub and others...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hey man, before rma anything like your most recents redditors said, check your motherboard settings which can still be too aggressive, even by default.",i had those 100c when i just ran my new 13600k on cinebench and the problem was the motherboard that didn't cap the power limit.,i have an msi motherboard and there's a setting which is called cpu lite load which was at 12 by default.,"if you have something similar, try 9, or even 5 and try your benchmark again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the idle seems rather high.,cinebench r23 should complete in less than 1 minute.,corsair aio come with a bunch of adjustments.,are you setting the pump and fan to the appropriate levels?,you have to install their ique software to tweak it.,then disable the ique auto start as it will prevent the cpu from idling.,my 14nm intel chip idles at 31c on an arctic lf2 240mm aio,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

my 13700k was hitting 100c very quickly too.,i undervolted by -.125 and that brought max temps down to about 85c during stress testing.,"then i moved my aio radiator from to exhaust to front intake, and that helped lower temps by about 5c during extended gaming periods.","now, the max i see playing cyberpunk 2077 for a few hours is around 72c with an average temp of 65c.",for comparison i was seeing 92c playing cyberpunk before undervolting and moving the radiator.,these new processors need to be undervolted to get them under control.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

itâ€™s still too high and explains the high temps,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no anyone that says the voltage is too high doesnâ€™t know what theyâ€™re talking about.,if you havenâ€™t messed with overclocking this is just default behavior and its fine.,13th gen just runs hot.,how tf did a lot of people at r/intel not even see the reviews?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my 13600kf does 1.409v max, 1.36v under load, and 100c in under 2 mins of cinebench with an arctic 420mm aio on an open bench.",same result for several users with custom water loops.,bios settings at full default.,"theres something like 10-20 of these threads posted daily, the issue is always overvoltage through the load lines on stock bios settings, not user error.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"furthermore several users that have tried using a 13600k on a b660 without loadline or voltage controls at all still hit 100c at stock and can't do anything about it, as for some reason simply undervolting the chips throttles their performance as opposed to reducing ac_ll and dc_ll.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, it indicates that the cpu is overvolting / overheating at its stock programmed vid and therefore not running as specified on the ark page specifications provided by intel, and its not a chip that anyone has to keep if they don't want to bother with manually configuring the tuning.","also higher stock vid = worse bin chip, and this chip here is literally atrocious.",also so intel can actually fucking recognise this is a problem?,why aren't any of you reporting your overheating chips?,"and despite saying no at first, to me yes this is faulty as it is not running at the correct voltage or tdp as specified by intel (13900k should run at 253w with 5.4 all core boost, no way this is running at 253).","my 13600ks is specified for 5.1 all core 181w, it actually runs at 225w, 1.409 max volts in cinebench, and 100c on a 420mm aio and open frame case.",and the issue is that intel will not accept any blame because so far i am the only person actually reporting these issues to them!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have 13600kf with noctua air cooler and stock it was hitting same temps as yours with an aio.,"i changed settings in bios z790 mobo as well

i'd recommend no smaller than a 360mm aio with a contact frame and a pretty aggressive fan curve if you intend to leave the 13900k at it's stock power limits without undervolting and don't want it to throttle during cb runs.,there is a aio cooler guide specifically for the 13900k on tom's hardware i believe.,only a couple of the models tested were able to keep the heat under control without the cpu throttling without any further tuning (i believe one model was by arctic and the other was deepcool).,"though if you power limit you'll lose a very small margin of performance, unless you absolutely need the most performance you can get without compromise that's what i would personally recommend doing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"it sounds too aggressive as well, but if this person has a better-binned one with a high sp, it's possible it requires a lower voltage at the same frequency.","i've seen some 13900k have a factory vf curve for 1.44v at 5800 mhz, and another better-binned one with 1.33v at 5800 mhz.",it just depends on the quality and binning.,undervolting is also hard to test.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

should i change the aio?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well it's a maximus extreme with mce on ...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"truth, op probably has a lower sp and has an aggressive vf curve from the factory.","my 13900k has an sp of 107, which is almost exactly the median sp, and has a factory vf curve with 1.43v at 5800 mhz.","if sp is lower than 107, i could see it easily hitting 1.47v when boosting.","op most likely has the asus mce turned on by default, which is causing the crazy thermals.",this isn't a voltage problem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can run a 13900k at 1.2 to 1.3v depending on the chip.,that would drop temps by an awful lot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"13th gen runs hot with the crazy power limits mobo maker allow, if you enforce intel power limits, it becomes a much more tameable chip.",my 13900k used to run as hot as op's but dropped at least 10c in idle and 20c off the max after i enforced intel power limits.,"these are good cpus, do not beat them up for no reason.",there's is no thermal solution available at this moment for these cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have seen others having the same results as me but some youtube videos showing benchmarks going up to +38k claiming itâ€™s stock.,i donâ€™t know which to believe!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"stock bios settings have always been extremely conservitive and can benefit greatly from user tweaking, lowering vcore via adaptivr voltage or whatever applicable method for that generation.",nothing's changed on that front.,"the last maximus extreme i owned was for 10900k and that ""stock"" out of the box experience would thermal throttle also.",business as usual.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
getting a new chip from intel isn't going to do anything.,the loadlines are defined by the bios.,only the vid changes with a new cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the factory vf curve on my 13900kf is 1.43v at 5800 mhz, and that's with an about-average p-core sp of 107. i would imagine worst-binned chips would be even higher voltage than this.","i'm not saying this can't be undervolted, but this is clearly by design from intel.",the 13900k at stock pl shouldn't hit 100c.,"it's pretty clear op has a cooling issue or unlocked power limits, which is usually enabled by default from motherboard manufacturers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
those numbers are in no intel spec.,intel makes no promises about power consumption at boost speeds with some arbitrary workload.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what issue?,these cpus are trying to maximize clockspeed at the available thermal headroom.,"hitting 100c is normal and its the same in the amd cpus this gen. this isnâ€™t overheating, itâ€™s not going over the spec tjmax.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what about the performance?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you have a contact frame?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it looks fine tho, i have a 13700k and it goes to 94c max.",if you undervolt a bit it will drop your temps by alot and you won't lose much performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it says cpu temps are 89c on mobo and package is 100c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i also ordered one yesterday.,itâ€™ll take some time unfortunately.,"btw, what the option for setting a voltage offset called",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wouldn't adjust the e-cores too much unless you have a good sp score on your e-cores.,"they might be ""efficient"" cores, but at 16 of them, they can produce some serious heat if overclocked and negatively affect your p-core frequency.","just sayin', don't prioritize them...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that aio should be more than enough.,"check paste, check pump operation, confirm mounted properly.",depending on your cpu might be wise to invest in a contact frame.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mce is known to push too much voltage into the cpu though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is also hwmonitor so idk how accurate it is and its not the real vsense just vid.,"but yea totally, a lower sp can mean much higher vid requested.",also on asus boards it asks what cooler you have on first boot and if you pick watercooling it sets to unlimited power which is mce and this is fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah, i have my 13700k running at -0.65v @ 5.3ghz, and it'll do 4 cores at 5.8/5.7 all core with +0.025v over reference.","it  throttles itself in things like cinebench at that clock speed because my cooling solution/sff pc can't keep up, but in games and regular productivity apps it happily chugs away at 5.7 or 5.8.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there won't be any thermal solution possible to cool these below 100c at unlocked power and full boost.,it's just physics.,the heat density on these new chips are insane now and the clocks they're pushing are so high.,the only way to cool them properly is with a delid and direct die with watercooling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dude this is normal.,you bought the latest and greatest high performance cpu.,donâ€™t expect it to run cool and use low power if you want max performance.,all the reviews shows these just run hot at unlimited power which your motherboard probably defaults to if its z790.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes most 13th gens have a much lower voltage than this on the same motherboards at stock due to a better vid.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"every chip seems to be hitting 100c, even people with custom water loops are getting this.","the issue is too common to simply be user error, and if it is simply the motherboard's fault then its every motherboard brand and intel should be providing them with correct voltage / loadline specifications that the stock bioses should have.",i have contacted msi but its holiday season so i have to wait.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"maximum turbo power 181 w

this is nothing like or similar to amd cpus.,amd cpus lock to 95c and overclock automatically.,"intel cpus have a specified maximum clock and tdp, they are not specified the same way as amd chips to always run at 100c.",theres no reason at all why a 5.1 ghz 13600k needs to run over 1.4v and hit 100c just to maintain 5.1 ghz.,"if they were actually boosting higher than that automatically, that is what would be the same as amd.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i havenâ€™t noticed any difference but i heard someone say like it could be around 10% less fps,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
keep in mind my chip tj max is 100c so that is when you will see a decrease in performance and lifespan so itâ€™s not worth running stock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it will reduce multi core performance if you do what that guy said.,these 100c temps are under tjmax and within spec.,"the cpu will just automatically boost as high as it can in the available thermal headroom, its fine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i didn't realize that about enabling mce and setting cooler type.,good to know,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't think most people understand the high voltage requirement on the 13900k is from the boosting to 5.8 ghz on two cores.,"that 1.47v might sound like a lot, but you're also only using roughly 40a and it boosts within the defined thermal limit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

my mobo is asus z790 extreme.,i honestly started to worry that i need to change something but thanks for clarifying,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so you do realise the same thing also happens on b660s?,except on b660 you cant adjust loadline volts.,so a 13600k running on a b660 is always at 100c with no solution.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think the issue is mobos enabling unlimited power limits by default.,the default asus mce feature on my board sets unlimited pl1 and pl2 and causes my 13900k to hit 100c and 350w on a 360mm aio almost instantly on full load with only a very small performance uplift (39k to 41k on cinebench r23).,"disabling it to force the default pl1=pl2=253w configuration caps the max temp at 90c, so that's clearly where the issue lies.",the crazy thermal throttling isn't worth it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,those donâ€™t say that it will run at 5.1ghz at 181w.,power consumption is only indirectly connected to clock speed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea that tdp is more of a suggestion and basically all high end boards default to unlimited power.,so itâ€™ll behave more like amd cpus boosting as high as it can as long as it doesnâ€™t get over tjmax.,this is allowed by intel.,its fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you so much for clarifying.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

do not overtighten.,"you want firm, even pressure.",i know that sounds vague but it's important to maintain proper contact between the processor/paste/cooler.,bolt down method might be in your owners manual for your aio.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep i think on other brands they do the same thing.,which i think is great because previously they set unlimited power mce as default so if you had a shit air cooler youâ€™ll have a bad time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes exactly.,voltage also doesnâ€™t degrade chips.,its current.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think we're at the limits of heatpipe based cooling already.,if you want any semblance of good cooling on the new chips you really need watercooling.,high temperature in a small area is the worst for heatpipes as they can't spread the heat load over many heatpipes well so the heatpipes closest to the center where the die is will just absorb too much heat and dry out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have a strix z790-e, my 13900k has a sp score of 102, i got a cinebench r23 score of 38xxx running stock settings since i have it installed in a case with limited air flow, using ekwb aio cr360.","after some days of tuning, i now rest at ac ll 0.12, dc ll 1.02, octvb +2 boost, xmp enabled 6400 c32, i get a score of 403xx now running cinebench and max temp is around 85-88. full load voltage is around 1.164 to 1.175 with a power draw of 23xw, when boosting to 6ghz max i see was 1.339v, maybe you can start testing these settings too?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes ofcourse.,but its more prevalent on z boards with stronger vrms.,also i just know that tidbit about b660â€¦thatâ€™s stupidâ€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"its not the pl settings that are at fault, its ac_ll and dc_ll that are configured too high causing overvolting.",the pl limit and max stock boosts can be maintained by everyone when manually setting the load line values.,"afaik aibs follow intel specification for the load lines and such, and intel support have already told me that these figures have not even yet been released for 13th gen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well thats odd, given that they easily run 5.1 at way less than 181w without any issue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no it isnt fine and it isnt the same at all.,"i already tested setting the limit to 181w for my 13600kf, it causes the chip to run at 4.8 all core 1.25v to maintain 181w, yet the specification for the chip is 5.1 p core turbo at 181w.","so if 4.8 @ 1.25v is 180w, that means the stock voltage for 5.1 is actually meant to be even lower than that!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
make sure under full load in something like cinebench it is drawing over 250w package power in hwinfo.,otherwise if the power is low you actually do have cooling issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well without knowing too much about it, googling and coming across a few reddit posts where people say it provides no use except for case-by-case basis.",my temps are fine.,processor works fine.,i donâ€™t need it.,my gpu and cpu during gaming stay around 40c so iâ€™d say thatâ€™s pretty good for ultrawide 1440p gaming @ 160fps,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have the nh-d15 two fans in my fractal torrent with 4 140mm and 2 180mm case fans.,well i heard a little about the contact frame but afaik itâ€™s more helpful for amd maybe?,honestly iâ€™m not sure as iâ€™ve only seen a few mentions of it on reddit.,if it does work it only reduces temperatures by a very small amount.,nothing compared to some minor underclocking in the bios,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no maybe 1% bro,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which is terrible score,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just lower the offset by .01 until you don't get anymore errors.,"every chip is different, some can only undervolt .05, others can go to .15",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i got the thermalright , i used the thermal paste that they include with the contact frame (thermalright tf7).",used a x pattern of paste on the cpu.,"for comparison, when i first fired up the computer and ran the timespy extreme benchmark, the cpu would pretty quickly hit 100c and throttle during the cpu test.",i just ran it again and the max temp i saw was 58c.,i'm flabbergasted.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i would even recommend to mainly do it manually by hand if you've got strong hands, i actually broke the screws/bolts on my own h115i with a screwdriver cause i was like it has to be firm enough, but definitely not as tight as i expected it should be",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thats your overall sp based on the p and a e-cores, but what's your sp score on the p-cores only?","if you can run 6 ghz at 1.4v, you must have a very high sp score on your p-cores.",mine is sp 107 on the p-cores and i need at least 1.5v to boost to 6 ghz.,"ac llc at 0.22 and dc llc at 1.03 with asus llc at 4 worked pretty well for me and stable, but really only a marginal improvement of voltages for me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, it's part of the problem as well but i donâ€™t think the ac and dc llc being set too aggressive is the main issue.",i tweaked the ac and dc llc on my board with mixed results.,"lowering this to be stable slightly helped the voltage, but stability was more difficult to nail.","even setting my dc llc to 1.03 and ac llc at 0.22 was stable with pl at 253w, but this configuration at unlimited pl immediately crashed prime95.","eventually i kept the ac and dc llc as noted above, but enabled the default pl1 and pl2 to avoid the stability issues.","i have no idea if the asus mce feature changes the ac and dc llc since it's all set to auto by default, but it was my understanding that mce only changed the pl1, pl2, and iccmax.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
of course you can.,you could probably run at 5.1ghz at 30w if you wanted to because power consumption depends on what the chip is doing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
uh no.,5.1 is turbo as you said.,turbo is not meant to be always hit.,if you have a lighter all core workload itâ€™ll hit 5.1 within 181w but its not meant to always hit 5.1 at 181w.,its always been like this on all intel cpus since turbo was implemented.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i don't get it.,"everyone's 13900k runs 5.4 / 5.5 on early batches under load, from what i understand this is the 'all core' frequency under load.","the turboboost is the single / double core boost of up to 5.8.

i'm not entirely sure for 13600k but for 13900k there is absolutely no way it can run full boost at the spec maximum power with full load benchmark.,cinebench is nowhere near full load.,edit: just for clarification 100% utilization isn't full load.,you can create 100% utilization with the cpu still doing basically nothing.,each workload is different.,"intel only promises that even at full load at ""base clock"" it should not exceed the ""tdp"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea surprisingly a lot in r/intel that are confidently incorrect.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

at 4k the cpu doesn't matter that much because most of the load is on the gpu.,a 12400f would work well for you.,"12400kf does not exist, did you mean 12600kf?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the ryzen 5 5600 is slightly cheaper, iâ€™d get that one instead.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the kf just bc you have more controll of the cpu clock speed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its out of stock,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what about performance especially at 4k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
get the 5600x or wait a few days for the 13400 to be released.,13400 should be around 12600k levels in performance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with the kf if i got it right you can push it more than a non k model.,k model means that the clock speed is not locked and you can play with the speed (mhz per core/all core) i got i7-13700kf and without the kf i would not be able to push it to lets say 5.4 mhz vs the non k that only go to 5.1 and can push to mutch w so that the chip gets to hot.,so yes you can get some more fps by doing a oc with a kf and mby cooler temps than a non k model,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
windows smartly manages which processes go to which cores depending on the specific workload.,"https://www.anandtech.com/show/16959/intel-innovation-alder-lake-november-4th/3

> what makes windows 11 better than windows 10 in this regard is that windows 10 focuses more on the power of certain cores, whereas windows 11 expands that to efficiency as well.","while windows 10 considers the e-cores as lower performance than p-cores, it doesnâ€™t know how well each core does at a given frequency with a workload, whereas windows 11 does.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i will have to move to win11 with my next build, so im curious about this one too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i believe e cores are less power efficient than p cores for the same amount of work, theyâ€™re just more efficient in terms of performance for their area of silicon.",iâ€™m surprised the performance was the same across the 2 oses.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
updates to win10 has made it possible to use e-cores like win11.,iâ€™ve never liked win11 and donâ€™t understand why anyone would.,itâ€™s always a mess to me.,"stutters in games, weirdness/clunk feeling sometimes, etc.",went back to win10 with all updates and it works better with my setup (in my user flair).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cannot say i ever looked to be honest.,"i built a new rig and installed win 11, why would it not function properly?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
similar experience here.,"windows 11 is very good at handing most processes to available p cores, making the e-cores a sort of ""back up"" for if the p-cores are loaded down with other tasks.",idle i still have some e-core activity (maybe 3 cores).,but most of the e-cores are completely empty.,"in games it's all on the p-cores, and the e-cores start showing more activity running other applications.","imo this makes complete sense, so long as p-cores are free, i would rather have tasks be handed to & completed using them versus e-cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel thread director is implemented with windows 11 which allows the scheduler to know not just the per-core utilization, but also the per-core performance.","as such, p-cores are prioritized when available.","windows 10 doesn't have any knowledge of performance differences between cores, so it just throws the load at whatever cores are available.","that often leads to issues with high-load, foreground tasks  which could cause them to not perform as well as they otherwise would.",i wouldn't be concerned unless you're noticing some real issues.,"if you're trying to save power, you could play around with the power profiles.",there's also socket power limiting you can enforce.,i have my 12900k set to 150w max power because it still retains 90+% of stock performance for my workloads.,"when gaming though, it never pulls above 70w.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™m pretty sure someone told me before that windows 10 2h22 and windows 11 used the same task manager, so windows 10 can use the e cores properly.","still, thatâ€™s weird",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
windows 10 does this now.,"i can wait for windows 12, every other gen baby",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that article did a great job explaining it!,"thanks, i think i have a much better understanding on it now.","windows 11 takes into account efficiency and sometimes a task, even background task, is more efficient on the p cores even though e cores may more efficient at other tasks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep.,great answer buddy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s not causing any problems but it just goes against what people said which is interesting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">i believe e cores are less power efficient than p cores for the same amount of work

that's definitely wrong outside of maybe extremely avx-heavy loads where the e cores struggle.","rather what you're thinking of is that if you compare the e cores running at max clock (way past it's peak efficiency) to the p cores running at their most efficient point, then the p can be more efficient.",that's an unrealistic (and kind of stupid) comparison though since you'd never have the e cores at max boost while the p cores were down clocked.,if you do a fair comparison with both at max efficiency or both at max clock then the e cores will use significantly less energy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if i recall an article i read on this correctly, e-cores are more power efficient than p-cores at the low to middle-high range of their frequency, but at very top end frequencies the p-cores are actually more efficient for a set workload.","basically itâ€™s just an example of intel pushing e-cores a little too high for performance purposes, at the expense of efficiency.","kind of the same as p-cores, really.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have any article that says that?,i thought the whole idea for them was that they are more power efficient at the expense of not being as powerful.,and why are you surprised performance was the same?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>updates to win10 has made it possible to use e-cores like win11.,did they?,when?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i thought that too yet things still behaved differently.,i think i also notice a slight stutter in games now that i think about it.,kind of comes and goes.,i still do like windows 11 overall so far though and itâ€™ll get better with updates.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pc works just fine.,"just e core were used more in windows 10, for what seemed like background tasks, compared to them not being as used in windows 11.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and thatâ€™s the version of windows 10 i was running , bizarre.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you should also read the part about the power plan at the bottom.,any task not in focus is assigned to an e core automatically.,so if youâ€™re working on something that is going to take long and you do something else in the meanwhile then the original task will now move to an e core.,this behavior is apparently stopped when you set the power mode to high performance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"don't ""buddy"" me, buddy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
will the p cores running the background task count as active cores?,"because if so, then someone who uses active core based boost clocks (like me) will have lower clock speeds on the p cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i agree, i just think e cores shouldâ€™ve been branded differently because efficiency implies performance/power for most people.",i donâ€™t expect layman to consider die size when hearing the word efficiency.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"gotcha, i didnâ€™t realize they scaled up that poorly.",power efficiency is admittedly pretty low on the list of things iâ€™m looking when researching cpus.,worst case scenario for me in gaming is all my cores max out for a couple seconds when a game is preparing shaders or loading something so as long as it doesnâ€™t throttle i go for max clock speeds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, i mentioned theyâ€™re pushed past the point of efficiency in another comment.",p cores are probably designed to be pushed harder so they end up scaling better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1 cluster of 4 e cores takes about about the same amount of space on the die as 1 p core but have much better combined multi core performance and slightly higher power consumption.,"all of this was coming out about a year ago after alder lakeâ€™s release, i donâ€™t have a specific source (just google alder lake e core power efficiency or something) but i think the e cores were clicked past their efficiency point.",as far as the os is concerned the main selling point of windows 11 (aside from the ui which is a mixed bag) is a new thread scheduler that was supposedly designed with heterogeneous core architectures in mind.,again you can find a lot research on this from about a year ago when w11 and 12th gen both launched.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
strange.,iâ€™ve used win11 on a laptop with a 12900h/3080ti and it still wasnâ€™t a pleasant experience.,win11 still hasnâ€™t matured enough to be like win10 yet.,hopefully in another year itâ€™ll be better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the scheduler isn't optimised for windows 10.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i did know about that, but your comment got me thinking, maybe my power plan settings changed during the upgrade for some reason.",i was set to balance in windows 10 maybe for some reason it went to performance in windows 11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol i wasnâ€™t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i assume so?,iâ€™m no expert but even background takes make a core active.,it isnâ€™t â€œparkedâ€ like task manager would say if the core wasnâ€™t being used.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

power **plan** should stay on balanced and not high performance.,"to change the not-in-focus behavior, you need to change the windows 11 power **mode** to best performance.","yeah, totally not confusing!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"offset is the worst way, you should just adjust the load line calibration if the voltage is too high.","if you use a big offset like -0.150 it might be stable at high frequencies but once it clocks down, the voltage will be so low that it will likely crash.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you tried cpu lite load?,is that what you mean by 'll3'?,"if you've done that, just test it without the undervolt as lite load undervolts anyway.",if temps still lead to throttling then you could cap power at say 230w or thereabouts.,"in sff pcs, don't strive for arbitrarily low temps.",just aim to get the cpu performing well without thermal throttling.,sub 95c under all core load is fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes i'm at lite load 3. i also went and reset vcore settings to default, and went and lowered power to 200w.","much, much better.",vcore went 1.222 or so in cbench.,"vcore in idle is just above 1.3, which is a shame really...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

to be fair i just tested minecraft on my 6650 xt tonight and performance is just a hot mess on this game.,"it's very cpu/ram bottlenecked and it doesnt matter what gpu you use, it's gonna stutter when loading chunks.",the only real solution is to reduce the render distance so you load fewer chunks at a time.,i find 16 chunks to be a good balance on my 7700k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that's interesting.,thanks for the info.,i was actually picking between a750 and 6600 xt before i got the a750.,minecraft is a game i play a lot.,your info further drove away my regret of not getting the 6600 xt.,another interesting observation i had.,i was playing with vault hunters modpack and it had various sodium port optimizations.,no optifine.,i used complimentary shader.,i was getting just below 80% gpu utilization with complimentary shader set to vanilla preset.,same when i set it to medium or high.,"but when i set the shader preset to extreme, i got better gpu utilization at upwards 90% and weirdly enough, the frametime was more stable.",not as wild as when i was using the vanila shader preset.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well based on some other posts i still think arc is iffy but yeah i was considering trying minecraft rtx for the luls so i booted up the launcher and went into an older world i had.,i remember on my old 1060 having inconsistent performance too related to render distance but i think i had it relatively stable at 20 chunks.,if anything i go back on and i needed to turn it down to 16 to be stable.,"idk if it's just that it was always that bad on the 1060 (i suspect it was) and didnt care since i capped fps at 60 or something, but given the inconsistencies i just kept render distance at 16. after everything loaded i was getting a fairly stable 100-200 fps.",whereas i was stuttering like mad at 20 chunks.,i dont regret the 6650 xt at all.,it's a solid performer and i want something that performs fairly consistently and i know arc would've had issues with various games whereas with amd i know they'll likely just work.,to be transparent im running 100% vanilla mc here.,"gpu utilization was laughably low, with my cpu getting pegged at 100% and my gpu running at like 14%.",after lowering the render distance performance stabilized and i was using like 40-50% utilization or something.,but yeah thats the issue with mc.,it's an old game.,it was made to run on potatoes.,i remember running it on my hd 6520g igp like 10 years ago.,"so it's not super gpu intensive, but i remember it used to only use 1 gb ram (i think that's changed), and testing it tonight, it was definitely primarily cpu limited.",the more gpu it was using the more stable it was.,otherwise it was just trying to render more chunks.,"i mean, that's the big thing i notice.",it's render distance.,a radius of 1 chunk means it loads 9 chunks (the one you're on and 1 in each direction).,2 chunks is 25.,"3 chunks is 49, etc.","so as you can see the higher you set it, the more it's trying to render exponentially.","if you set it too high, it will just turn into stutterfest.",at 20 i'm literally rendering like 20 in each direction.,so 41x41= 1681?,yikes.,whereas turning that down to 16 is 33x33 or 1089. i also tried 12 but at that point i was annoyed at the visibly low render distance.,but yeah for reference that would be 25x25=625.,you get the idea.,eventually your cpu gets bogged down rendering all this stuff.,"and while the game will eventually load in and stabilize, if you move around causing more chunks to load you get stuttering again.",the best solution to minecraft performance is to just limit render distance to what your cpu can handle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's not worth it imho, you only get hyper threading and slightly higher frequency, but maybe if you manage to sell the 9700 for like 150 it could then be a good deal.","anyway since you have a z390 (even if the 9700 is locked) you can probably get the cpu to reach its maximum boost of 4.7 on all core workloads, and even go a bit more than that with bclk oc (103mhz should be where intel put the limit).",and of course undervolt to reduce power and temps.,also overclocking ram will improve cpu performance too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

iâ€™ll be a contrarian and say thatâ€™s a worthwhile upgrade for the board you have.,"you get double the threadsâ€¦ if you do anything like encoding videos or run vms or anything workstation-like, that would pay off for sure.",as for the priceâ€¦ i dunno.,they are selling for pretty cher on ebay these days.,i recently sold one in my country for a fair bit more than that.,"and, youâ€™ll be able to sell the 9700. anyone with a 6th gen board or later could use it.","but donâ€™t mind me, i like shiny new things.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
get an x570 mobo and 5900x cpu now they are cheap.,:),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel is horrible for upgrades on older sockets until they get really old tbh.,for the price of a 9900k your better off selling your 9700 and mobo local if you can and looking at a 12400/12600k and mobo or 13600k if you have the budget.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how much can you sell the 9700 for on ebay?,anything less than 170 after fees is not worth it.,keep the money for a future full upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"no need to swap from ddr4 to ddr5, most youtubers already said so.","but since recently, i see some ddr5 ram kits are quite cheap already, you can decide.","i lock my frame rate at constant 360 fps because i use a 360hz monitor and i only care about aiming accuracy, so i use 4000mhz 4x8gb ddr4 c16 to minimize latency.","but if you are not playing games with very high fps like me, then no need for high-end ddr4 or any ddr5 at all, just buy the cheap and nice 3200mhz ddr4 c16~c18 is more than enough!",your 32gb 3600mhz c16 rams are very good ðÿ‘,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
few things.,some memory may be used by the gpu as you said.,also the task manager doesn't list everything iirc so try downloading sysinternals and use procmon.,i think that shows more.,"also try rebooting, you may have some memory leaks",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">i realized when my ram is in 100 percent performance it is no where up to 16gb ram that is being used and my laptop is 16gb ram, when i check the performance list, it shows that all the ram is being used but when i check the processes list and calculate the sum of all the processes its nowhere near 16gb, infact its as much as half less.",that's probably normal.,"depending on which of the different memory statistics you're looking at, the total for all processes could be a lot more or a lot less than physical memory.",no reason to think it would sum up to physical memory.,>so please what do i do to fix this or is that just how it is?,the underlying problem would be solved by either using less ram or getting more ram.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™d go with a 6700xt over both.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
honestly it depends on why you want the a770 in the first place.,"i agree with what the other guys are saying, if you are simply after best value and performance go with amd/nvidia.","although, i have an a770 le and i am quite happy with it, the driver updates have definitely improved the performance and power efficiency of the card.","the games i play do not suffer so much from bad performance and i am using a 1080p monitor anyway, which means i can run the games on high quality settings while retaining high fps.",the main reason i bought the a770 is rather vain... i simply liked how the le card looked and wanted it.,in addition i am curious how good the cards can become after intel finishes improving their drivers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you are ready to deal with any remaining issues go ahead.,otherwise if you prefer fuss free then a 3060 might be a better experience overall.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"depends, i'm sure within another 12 months it will be very good.",i haven't has any issues myself though.,"but yeah, a 6700 xt or 3060 would likely be a better experience in the short term.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"short answer, no - not yet.",games performance is uneven and vr support is missing.,the best option may be to look for a 3060 ti or even a 6700 xt.,they are dropping in price (in the usa) and can be got for close to the same price as a a770.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

new cpu and motherboard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looks like the bottleneck is the core count.,if you wanted to save some money for an upgrade you could pick yourself up an i9-10850k/i9-10900k (new or used for even cheaper) for a quick upgrade.,also depending on the resolutions you're working with the 32gb of memory might be a bottleneck.,if you wanted to spend more for a bigger uplift you could definitely get yourself the i7-13700k + z790 you mentioned earlier.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what program are you using?,because that will change hardware recommendations.,da vinci resolve benefits much more from a gpu upgrade while every other program relies on not just more cpu cores but faster ones.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yup, perfectly good.",technically you might be okay with the 13600k as well if you are severely limited by budget.,the z790-a is also a good choice if not too much more.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you tried 24 hours p95 for stability?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the title says it is 12700k, but screenshots say it is 12900k, wtf?","custom loop and no temps on screen, eh?",stock 13700k can perform almost like that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"oooh damn, gotta reupload",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">i'm very satisfied by the 12600k performance

you have already answered you own question.",the 12600k is a fantastic cpu.,"while the 13600k is a little better, the differences are likely imperceptible in normal use.",you should definitely wait longer before upgrading something that already does everything you want.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,i'd at least wait for the raptor lake refresh coming next year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you watch those benchmarks comparing cpus with rtx 4090, then yes, there will be difference in performance.","but for normal gpus like 3070 or 3080 the difference will be minimal, especially at 1440p.",i wouldnt bother upgrading just for the sake of it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"12600k will last for years giving excellent performance, the next â€˜bigâ€™ cpu launch will happen before you realize.",buying the 13600k now is a waste if you have such a powerful cpu already.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
keep the 12600k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cpus dont need to be upgraded for several generations... what is with so many people throwing money at cpus all of a sudden?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don't bother.,i upgraded my 8700k ( 5.4ghz ) to a 13700k ( 5.6ghz ) i got 1 fps in tomb raider lol wt 3840x1600 res.,and the same fps in cyber punk ( 69 ) and 2 fps in strange brigade ( 197 )  you will see 0 difference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"overclock it to 5.1ghz, every 12600k can do it, and you have a 13600k with 4 less ecores, and you donâ€™t need ecores for gaming.",ðÿ‘ðÿ»,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this guy, i agree word is we are getting a raptor lake refresh and that is definitely a better direction for upgrade, i just got a 12600k and i paired it to an a770",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if op was trying to run 360hz or something or even 240 in some games i'd say sure  if they want to deal with reselling the 12600k but at 144 hz nah.,all the 4090 really does it let them be more cpu bound with higher settings you can achieve a similar cpu bottle neck if you're running lower settings trying to push crazy frame rates.,but it also largely depends on the game and settings in it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
any news/rumors about the raptor refresh socket?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lga1700.,probably the same as the 12th and 13th generations.,14th gen meteor lake processors will use lga 1851. at least that's what the leaks suggest.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel is known to stick to two gens on a chipset though so even tho physically they will be the same socket if i had to guess 14xxx series will need a new mobom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you using two offsets?,one in xtu and the other in bios?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i foind my only stable -0.1000 in bios, havent tried xtu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
check out cpu lite load in your bios settings.,i got much better thermals dropping the settings in there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
try monitoring vid and vcore in hwinfo.,"during cinebench, what do they look like with xtu's volt offset vs. stock?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nope just the bios.,i made sure the xtu settings were reset to default,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what was it called exactly i did see two offset options in the bios was a tad confused,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
interesting thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
-150 was about minus 110 off when monitoring using xtu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
global vcore or some shit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i heard lite load is a msi mobo only feature so u might not able to find it on your bio,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is the vcore in absolute value?,"for reference, my 13700kf vcore averages 1.138v when running cinebench, undervolted from something like 1.35v at stock.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i second this.,"while noctua is great, you're paying for a premium.",unless you're getting the nhd15/s it's not worth getting those single tower ones when you can get other ones that are pretty much just as good for much cheaper.,ak620 is a nice choice for dual tower/fan it also looks great.,i'm pretty sure an ak400 or hyper 212 is already enough for a 12400 and they're like $35,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would say around $50aud to around like $150?,and i would rather stay with air cooling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
an aio is extremely overkill for the 12400f,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so i had a look and a ak620 is around $100 for me and iâ€™m not sure if it comes with a lga1700 bracket but it has it as a extra to buy for $10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
honestly you don't need much as 70\* with the cooler you have is just fine.,the $60 cooler master hyper 212 is more than enough.,"&#x200b;

beyond that, if you want it to last another build that may use more heat in the future or just want to have overkill the noctua nh-u12a/ noctua nh-d15 are artic liquid freezer ii 240 are great around the $100-125",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why?,you only need a high quality 750-850w psu.,you don't even need more than the upper end for a 4090.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the system in this post takes about 27% more power to run at tdp than yours.,a 750w psu would be enough to run it and an 850w would leave enough headroom for overclocking both the cpu and gpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"damn, i had never looked at the power gap between the 12700 and 13700 until now.",itâ€™s pretty substantial.,your system would probably run on a 500w psu even.,"either way, the point i wanted to get at is thereâ€™s no gpu that requires more than an 850w, despite the reddit sentiment that 1000w+ is a new standard for high-end builds.",so you can still look forward to your current system getting a big gpu upgrade down the line without the psu being a major limiting factor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

13900k but it shouldnt matter since its the same 263watts.,the other smaller system i am building will use a 13700k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok that's not abnormal.,interesting.,i might have to pick up a u12a and play around with it with some high rpm fans.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's easier to cool the 13900k cause you have less watts per core even at same total wattage.,my 12900k was hitting 100c at around 270 to 280 watts with the same u12a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes i am aware that ks is typically purchased by overclockers.,it all depends on what youâ€™re going for.,if the ks can meet performance targets that are not all about all out maximum performance while running at lower temps then the ks price difference vs the cost difference of air cooling vs aio may not be that high.,ideally we would have the k vs the ks vf curves so we clearly see the different options with each processor.,this is something iâ€™d like to work on in the coming weeks once i get my ks setup.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good point but if typical usage isnâ€™t going to stress the system that much then maybe thatâ€™s too strict of a criteria in terms of limiting the undervolting unnecessarily.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what would you consider an extreme/impressive undervolt amount?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
those temps with that cooling?,something is wrong.,"a 360 aio is extremely capable of handling a 13700kf, under any load.",usual suspects.,"check mounting, check thermal paste, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what a waste of money.,just get the k at that point.,but hey its your money do with it what you want.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
totally valid point that itâ€™s an unrealistic workload.,"still, i have a real tough time knowing that any workload that doesnâ€™t crash stock, is somehow â€œokayâ€ if it crashes while undervolted.",i fear something random during normal use will trigger that same instability and cause my system to crash just when i donâ€™t want it to.,"and for a primary working system thatâ€™s not just for gaming, that feels like a bad risk.","so i only go prime 95 stable, which does strongly limit how much i can undervolt - although i would really like to try some llc stuff on my asus board next.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

seems a bit high to me.,i recently got a 13900k and in idle with my noctua nh-d15 i have around 30c - 35c.,room temperature around 20c.,and make sure all the c states are enabled in bios.,"in the beginning all the p cores were running almost continuously 5,5ghz and the e-cores also on max.",even after 25min of idle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mine was looking like yours with a h150i elite lcd cooler.,i took it off and reseated it which helped a good bit.,i changed my motherboard settings from liquid cooler to air-cooler (on msi z790) because it was running hot.,if yours doesn't have that look into lowering the voltage maybe.,it's around 55-65c while gaming now which is fine for me.,i do notice it spikes at times to 70-80 for a split second using core temp so it logs the max temp as high when i can see its not.,i don't know if it's normal i've upgraded from i7 3770k which wasnt nearly as hot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i see this question everyday regarding 13900k cpu temps.,the 13900k isnâ€™t a plug and play cpu anymore for the everyday consumer.,if youâ€™re looking for reasonable temps while gaming i highly suggest you undervolt the cpu or else youâ€™d have to look at a custom loop cooling option.,when i first installed my 13900k i averaged the same temperatures as youâ€™re describing with the thermalright contact frame.,i managed to drop temps quite significantly now my idle range is in the 30c and my gaming is 60c-70c.,i highly suggest undervolting if you have any question feel free to ask.,also make sure youâ€™re using the correct bracket for your cooling solution especially if youâ€™re using corsair.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's not unusual if stock settings have multicore enhancement enabled.,i'd suggest disabling it unless you're chasing benchmarks as the extra voltage and slightly higher clockspeeds are unlikely to result in real world performance gains.,"that said, the 13900k *is* a hot chip.","it taking all of the thermal headroom you give it and running itself up to 100c isn't unusual and contrary to some other comments, it running at 100c is *within spec*.","still, disabling multicore enhancement should tame it a bit.",you probably won't get it below 70c under gaming loads without a bigger aio or a custom loop.,"if the noise is tolerable to you, i'd suggest leaving it alone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

your idle temps (min temps) are rather high.,my 13700k will show between 22-26c for the lowest temps at idle.,and pushing upwards of 85-98c for only 58w power draw sounds like a bad cooler mount.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pretty normal temps  if your boosting otherwise not boosting should be in the lower 30's to high 20's,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what is the actual cpu voltage?,"my board was giving my cpu 1.4v on auto, make sure your cpu is not overvolted by your motherboard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"hi everyone, quick update.","i got the arctic freezer in same day shipping alongside some new thermal paste, and i applied a new paste job and replaced my old aio with the arctic freezer.","idle temps are much better now, the fans are very quiet but effective, and the gameplay temps donâ€™t reach 90c anymore, alongside with enabling c-states on the bios.","thereâ€™s no more large temperature variations between cores, so that has been fixed too.","it seemed to be a problem with either the paste job or the old aio, but now all is good and iâ€™m happy.",thanks to everyone for helping.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as a rule of thumb for me, anything above 80 celsius is dangerous for the machine.","get some new coolers, man, or idk go to a technician (it might be something else like dirt or mechanical errors or even thermal paste) and see what's happening.","if i'm not mistaken, reaching such temps often enough will shorten the span life of just about anything.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i havenâ€™t thought of that but that seems like itâ€™s an interesting idea.,"for further context, i had an i9-12900k before and the temps were very low with the bequiet pure loop 2 fx aio (240mm) then i changed to the i9-13900k and the temps got high, so then i got the lian li but nothing changed much.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ah, what are your temps on average if you donâ€™t mind me asking?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you.,i was used to my previous lower temps with the i9-12900k but was worried after seeing this with my new cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yup, no undervolt, stock.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30-37c are good idle temps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh wow that rule of thumb of yours is super outdated.,it was like that maybe 5-8 years ago.,these new chips (both amd and intel new gen) is rated for 100c for its entire lifetime without shortening it.,its just intel starts the cpu to throttle for temps at 100c but degredation doesnt even start until 115c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, i went to my local technicians and they said itâ€™s â€œnormalâ€ but i read otherwise.","iâ€™m thinking of getting the arctic liquid freezer 360 aio, i heard itâ€™s a good option for the i9-13900k, and itâ€™s within my price range.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, i'm surprised your temps were low with the 12900k and a 240mm radiator in the first place.",are you sure your cpu wasn't limited by something.,"anyway you need to check your bios and look if there is a sort of multithread enhancement option wich can usually push your card over intel tdp

i have the 13700k my thermals were okish using corsair 240mm radiators but for peace of mind a repaste my gpu using kryonaut extreme temps dropped

i used the thermalright contact frame in the first place to avoid cpu bending and temperature problems

after that i limited the cpu to 200w and also undervolted to -0.110 mv

when gaming the cpu hits 50 degrees

on a full load benchmarks hit 65/68 degrees while getting the same performance has stock

so quite happy about it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cstates let cores turn off when they are idle so it is very important for power efficiency.,also let's the whole chip enter a lower power state when no cores are active,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they are sleep states, op probably disabled them in the bios for technically better performance, but then the cpu never goes to sleep.","the cpu can sleep on a millisecond by millisecond basis, it reduces power usage (and therefore temps) when the cpu has a few thousand or million cycles it's waiting for work to do.","i think maybe the cpu can also use sleep states to control high temps, though maybe it just reduces clock speeds for that, i'm not sure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's a setting in your motherboard, you can enable them by going into the bios configuration.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i haven't looked into it too much but with liquid cooler and cinebench i got an instant 100c so i stopped.,with air cooler it was up in 80s after the 10 min test with a score of 38000ish and with box cooler it maxed temps at 66 with a cinebench score of 33000 so it must drop voltage a fair bit.,after my testing i've decided to leave it on air cooler because in games i only go to 65. i don't know what normal scores are but i'm happy with my system running as is.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel xtreme tuning utility and adjust slightly and run tests.,once you are happy with temps then adjust the settings in bios or that's what i got from researching it.,i didn't get around to doing it as it worked with changing the cooler option in my bios settings.,"it gave me the option of stock, air, or water.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you don't have to undervolt it if you run it at stock pl1 pl2.,"set the long duration power limit (pl1) to 125w, and the short duration power limit (pl2) to 253w and set the icc cpu current to auto or 307a (thats stock).",then make sure voltage is at auto.,you can leave everythign else on auto.... and pretty much that will be intel's stock settings.,"now when you do this, you won't see 5.5ghz p and 4.3ghz e all core performance when running cinebench or rendering etc because the cpu has a throttling curve that will try to keep it away from max temp at 253w.","if you have an aio 360 or bigger, you'll probably see 75c max temp under full load.",you will see higher frequencies under lighter loads like gaming and general computer use.,"but the chip has more potential, so people run pl1 pl2 at a higher number, in some cases unlimited.","this also takes a higher icc cpu current, which increases the voltage and current, which ammounts to more wattage and heat... as well as stress on the cpu which may degrade it some overtime if you're rendering constantly but no one knows if it will for sure.",intel certainly seems fine with an icc current of 400a and a max wattage of 300w for pl1 and pl2 along with a 2 core 6.0ghz and 8 core 5.6ghz oc... because that is what they ship the i9-13900ks with.,it can do that easily.,so should the 13900k.,both can easily hit those numbers without long term issues if you can cool it.,the ks can go even further and it's best for crazy overclockers because for daily use.. the chips get to hot to really run it any more than 2x6.0ghz cores and 5.6ghz 8 p cores + the 4.3 ghz e cores.,it just runs too hot and cooling becomes a challenge for every day use beyond 300w.,"so hopefully that helps and gives you an idea of what to play with to run the 13900k at stock... and if you want to overclock it a little, just set the pl1 and pl2 to 300w.","set the icc cpu current to 400a, and make sure everything else is auto.",check to make sure you're using a dynamic voltage because you should be.,"leave windows running ""balanced power mode"" and you'll have a nice overclock that at it's hottest will get 90c to 100c.",the chip will adjust frequencies as it approaches 300w to keep it cool.,one thing that is also useful for oc is the cpu lite load mode.,setting it to a lower mode can lower voltage under all core performance and keep temperatures down.,"it's the high current, voltage, and heat (wattage) that's going to possibly degrade the cpu at sustained all core loads over the years you own it... so it's best to try to keep those thins down.",cpu lite load modes can help do that.,"my msi defaults to mode 9. i can run it fine at mode 7, even mode 6 and the temps will come down significantly along with voltage at full load.",mode 6 is probably too extreme so mode 7 and even mode 8 would be a nice stable place to run 24-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah my first question is how much of a -offset did you manage to get while undervolting ?,also are you using corsair cooling solution ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, that's pretty typical for a 13900k and a 360mm aio.","like i said, i probably wouldn't bother trying to improve things unless you're willing to drop a decent amount of money for a custom loop.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ah, yeah got it.","iâ€™ll try doing that once i get home, thank you for your advice.",do you have any specific cpu benchmark youâ€™d recommend?,i have 3dmark.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"oh thatâ€™s great, iâ€™m guessing if iâ€™m peaking at 85-95c on some cores while playing graphically heavy 4k games thatâ€™s normal for the i9-13900k?",after enabling c states i now peak at around 78-82c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
go to another technician then if you can.,"as i said maybe the problem is not really the temperature and you might think you solved it with a fancy cooler, but then something else happens.","but nonetheless buy the cooler if you want to, it's always super nice to have new more efficient pieces :3",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i actually enabled all.,they were set to auto in the bios (gigabyte z790 aorus elite ax) but i monitored it in hwinfo and it barely used them after 25min.,"after setting them all to enable, hwinfo showed with no load it immediately switched to the ""lowest power"" ones.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

iâ€™m not sure about the offset but i changed the voltage to 1.23-1.19v and all of them gave me a blue screen.,iâ€™m using a lian li galahad cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3dmark will work, give it a shot.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thatâ€™s pretty high, i heard i9â€™s arenâ€™t recommended for air cooling but that might just be my technician, im not sure if thatâ€™s true.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™d say peak mid 80s is normal in super demanding games.,anything 90 or above is where youâ€™d start to worry since gaming isnâ€™t that heavy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"will do, thank you for your advice!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think you need to google it because every manufacturer will call the overclocking made by the card in a different way

for limiting the cpu should be called pl1 and pl2

i suggest you to start with intel maximum tdp for your cpu wich should be like the 13700k 253w

if intel xtu doesn't start is like that you need to enable those kind of softwares from the bios, again you need to google it because mine will probably be different than yours, i have the gigabyte ud ddr4",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"look for ""asus performance enhancement 3.0"" in the ai tweaker menu (you have to hit f7 for advanced options) which should be the same on prime and tuf 6xx mainboards.","per the asus description of the feature:

enabled = asus optimized cpu settings, unlocks power limits to increase cpu performance

disabled = intel default cpu settings for core frequency and power limits  


.. i also like contact frames, but the bios change is much simpler particularly if it an existing vs new build.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if i were you iâ€™d download intel extreme utility and undervolt using that.,lower the offset by small increments example -0.010v and run a stress test if stable lower is again this time -0.020v in increments of 10 and once you find it not stable dial is back by 10 until fully stable.,also you can look into getting the thermal right bracket for lga 1700 in my opinion itâ€™s a must purchase with any 1700 board since the cold plate on the coolers wonâ€™t make good contact with the original one on the motherboard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that's still a pretty large variation in core temps.,if i were you i'd do like i said before.,"if you dont have any laying around, buy new thermal paste before you start.","remove the aio pump, check your paste job and make sure it was uniform and completely covering the ihs.","then, wipe off the old paste and check if the ihs is bowed.","it should be mostly flat, but may not be totally flat.","if it's bowed in the middle you should be able to see it, but you can also get a small flat object to check.","if it's flat, then keep going.",inspect the aio pump plate and make sure there's nothing out of the ordinary.,apply thermal paste and reapply the aio pump.,use an alternating technique to gradually tighten it down and then plug everything back in.,run the benchmark again and see if your temps improved.,"if not, you may need to upgrade that aio.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ohhh, that makes sense",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

out of curiosity how much did your temps actually change?,"you were basically peaking out at 98c on two cores before making changes which is below the throttle point, so i'm curious at the objective difference with the setting change even if it's minor.","i would need to know the exact make/model of board to suggest power limit changes, if they are available.... i thought i saw a thread a couple days ago in which intel quit honoring voltage adjustments in the bios even if they were manually adjustable, which sucks for tuning raptor lake chips in particular.","i do agree with the other poster that indicates these results look like you may have some hot spots or inconsistent ihs contact issues... i'd pull the pump/coldplate assembly off the cpu and examine the thermal paste for thick spots in the ""fingerprint"" left behind.","simply replacing the cooler isn't going to fix contact issues with a bowed cpu, you swap it with a cooler that has a convex ihs that happens to fit better with your cpu's ihs.","a contact frame is a cheaper and less intrusive swap than a whole aio.... plus the galahad is a better looking cooler, imho.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"contact frames primarily assist with reducing temps by ""flattening"" the ihs so that cooler/heatsink contact achieves better coverage, which allows it to be cooled more adequately.","it also reduces and/or eliminates ""flexing"" of the cpu itself while in the socket.","as others have suggested, it may not necessarily be worth it for a non-k i5, but in my *personal* opinion, deformation of any kind on something soldered to a pcb should be addressed regardless -- even if not for an improvement in temps but for the sake of the longevity of the hardware in general.",the ~$20 contact frame from thermalright (which performed on par *and sometimes even better* than the thermal grizzly one per the gamers nexus review on the two) would be a sound investment.,"and say you do decide to get a 12600k/12700k/13600k or something even ""higher end"" down the line, the contact frames are compatible with both 12th & 13th gen so you'd already have one on hand in that case.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
get a contact frame and brush up on your google-fu.,you're gonna need it in this hobby.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, not justified.","just leave it as it is, it wont be causing any issues in the future.","if there was a serious problem, then intel would offer a contact frame in the package (or mobo vendors).",just put the cpu in socket and enjoy the damn thing!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends how cheap the frame is.,i got the thermalriggt one for $15 cad so was worth the piece of mind to me for that price.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's a $15 fix to just add the thermalright contact frame to eliminate a problem i've seen with better than half of the dozen or so s1700 mainboards i've worked with.,"it's easy to install at build time, less so after the fact.",i put one in every intel build because i don't care to roll the dice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on your cooler backplate.,if your cooler backplate isnt sturdy enough you could look into the thermal right contact frame just to be on the safe side,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have 12700k for a year now and no issues at all.,"30c on idle, 40-45c on gaming, cinebench was like \~85c.",kraken x63.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a contact frame makes sense on a 12700k and higher.,an i5 doesn't put out much heat.,and if you re still unsure derbauer made a video stretching a motherboard extreme and it still worked fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hi, yes buy the thermaltake contact frame it's cheap and it's easy to install, if you can find a 13th gen i5 13400f for only a couple bucks more than that would be my choice it's more future proof.","cpu bending on lga 1700 it's a real isue that makes the difference between  buying a 30 bucks cooler and one that costs more for your needs, buy the thermaltake contact frame i'm talking from experience.",ðÿ‘,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"short answer yes, 12th and 13th no difference the possibility is there.","&#x200b;

good news, steve from gn did testing and no matter which one you get if installed properly for the type you get, they all work.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i wouldn't worry about the bend, while using a contact frame can lower your temperatures by a few degrees, there's not a single report of a 12th or 13th gen cpu failing due to this.","i can also say having tested the thermalright contact frame, i'm convinced in some scenarios depending on your board, cpu and cooler, there are scenarios it won't apply enough pressure on the cpu and you can end up having situations were the memory won't post.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
getting a contact frame for a 12400f is not worth it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how bad has the bending been on the motherboards you've worked with and has it caused any issues other than temperatures?,also does it occur on the lower watt chips too?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yâ€™all wonâ€™t spend $50 more for a substantially better cpu but will waste $15 on a useless item that accomplishes nothing in opâ€™s case.,funny how that works,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"got a link, quickly scanned his channel and no video seems obvious.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i know its not needed for temperatures but what about preventing the mobo and cpu from warping?,that's something which is not just specific to the higher clocked intel cpus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's not the motherboard that's bending, as it's reinforced with a metal plate on the opposite side of the mounting bracket.","the cpu itself what is being is being bowed from the center based on the two ""wings"" being the primary pressure point when the stock mounting frame is locked down.","i have a small machinist square along with some thin feeler gauges i've used to check numerous cpu's when they are installed in the socket, and there are variances between how much deflection each socket creates on an installed cpu and the corresponding severity of the thermal or ram compatibility i've seen.",some coolers actually have convex contact surfaces to account for ihs bowing and may not manifest cooling issues as significantly as those with flat mounting surfaces.,"the model/wattage of the cpu has no impact on the issue, it's the metal mounting frame on the mainboard which is screwed into the metal backplate on the other side of the board so it'll screw up a 12100 just as badly as a 13900ks.","the two worst examples i found were on an asus strix b660i itx mainboard (ddr5) which was mostly just a ""thermals"" problem, and a gigabyte gaming-x ddr4 board that had severe ram compatibility issues with anything above jdec/2133 speeds until a thermalright frame was installed.","in order of importance i consider the value of the frame to be: improved memory timings/compatibility, thermals, and longevity + resale value of the chip.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wouldn't worry about the motherboard bending at all.,"if it is fully screwed down, there's little chance it will warp from using parts they're designed to handle.",the cpu bend is a different issue regarding certain coolers and how they rest of the cpu.,"i literally installed a contact frame on my cpu 2 days ago, it's easy, but likely not necessary.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
who said the op wouldn't spend $50 more on a different cpu?,they expressed specific concern with the ilm and bending/deflecting damage to the cpu in 3+ years as well as the thermal concerns.,for $15 they prevent the warping/bending issue (valid) and potentially pick-up some thermal improvements.,that $15 isn't enough to upgrade the cpu in a meaningful way so it's not like they are makin an either/or choice here.,are the thermal improvements important for a 12400 and a proper heatsink?,"not really, but it still addresses their specific concerns regarding warping/bending over time while also providing the improved thermals with whatever cpu they install now or in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmdmw4omd30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmdmw4omd30)  this one was my reference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the amount of warping is extremely small, you would need to hold a razer blade on top of the ihs and squint your eyes to see the gap from the ""bowing"" that occurs.",it really only matters when you are trying to overclock and you need to have the absolute best possible cooling potential.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you're worried about it, the investment is really minimal for some peace of mind.",they look kinda neat too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the explanation.,i was actually going to use a rog strix b660i itx mobo.,would you say the ilm issue is more pronounced on this board compared to others ?,and just to confirm even if a cooler has a convex surface it still wonâ€™t prevent the cpu from bending over time?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

iâ€™m gonna pitch in as a previous owner of 7700kâ€¦ that chip is undeniably super hot.,"if youâ€™re not delidding the cpu, you wonâ€™t see much overclock improvements without hitting 100c, even with a crazy cooling setup.","i was able to delid, add bit more voltage, and was able to go 5.0ghz all cores without much temperature issues (somewhere in 70-80 on load).","if youâ€™re not increasing voltage because of temperature issues, iâ€™d recommend you for a delid.","if thatâ€™s not the case, increasing voltage is fine to make sure it gets stable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why are we constraining the voltage?,they love voltage.,the chips will happily run at 1.5v and that is intelâ€™s stock voltage cap.,donâ€™t be scared of cranking the voltage and getting at 5.2ghz or better.,"i use to delied+liquid metal, bin and sell them off.",all of them would run 5.2ghz and a small handful could boot windows at 5.6ghz or better.,average was 5.3-5.4ghz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you have a 7700k.,that line of cpus cannot keep up with current games and really does not hold up.,intel cpus average lifespan are around 8-10 years.,770k is about 6 years old?,even if you oc i guarentee it will not make a big difference.,as to your question about degredation.,any voltage below 1.35 during all core workload is considered safe.,but again i want to point out that your cpu will probably be obsolete in 1-3 years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

performance at the very top end is a mix of cooler capacity but also silicon lottery.,the 13th have a self-reported voltage/frequency curve in the bios.,those that hit their top frequencies at lower voltages will get higher scores because they can sustain higher clocks within power/thermal limits.,so some variation is normal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
those all sound good.,my radiator is also at the top.,the only difference is i run the fans and pump at 'extreme'.,it isn't loud in my opinion.,i guess i did change the fans that came with the cooler to 120ll rgb fans so that might be different too.,sounds like your coolant is heating up which mean there shouldn't be a mounting issue.,overall sounds alright to me.,cooling isn't ever going to be exactly the same.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"when you run cinebench, the cpu clock will drop and you will have average core clock in task manager,

to what speed it drops?",you mind sharing some bios pictures of your settings for clocks?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just ran a 10-minute test and watched the cpu clock in task manager the whole time.,the readings ranged from the mid 4.5 ghz range to the low 4.7 ghz range.,"toward the end of the test, the clock mostly stayed in the mid 4.5 ghz range.",which bios settings would you like to see?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

gaming no editing yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"basically, no.","if you want to video edit, get the k, not the kf.","the f means no igpu, and that handles intel quicksync which can be a big bonus for some codecs and rendering processes.",the i7-13700k is already blazing fast in both gaming and video manipulation.,the i9 will be *marginally* faster but not $200 worth of faster.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you have 4080 why not an i9 , you already spent good amount of money",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just remember that any model with a â€œfâ€ has a â€œfailedâ€ igpu and a $20-30 price cut.,thatâ€™s the only difference.,"if you donâ€™t already know that the increased horsepower is going to be useful for you, then iâ€™m going to say a 13700k is already going to be huge overkill, and a very good cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,but get it anyway.,"why not, you're already building something at the bleeding edge of tech.",ðÿ‘,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i bought a 13700k first, then because iâ€™ve never had a top of the line pc, and i hadnâ€™t built a new pc of any kind  in 10+ years, i decided to return it and get the 13900k.","just thought it would be cool to, for a brief time, have top of the line tech.",the 3080 turned into a 4090 after i debated a 4080 for a while.,it all depends on what you can handle financially.,"if money is no issue, go for the bestâ€”probably not much difference between 13700k and 13900k in real world stuff, just benchmarking numbers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, spend the money on a mobo that can do higher speed ddr5 where you will actually see a performance gain.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i went from a i7 13700k to an i9 13900k for gaming and i only noticed roughly 8-12 fps more .,in reality it's only like.,2-4 percent increase.,it's up to you if you have the money for it.,i have a 4090 i9 13900k n love it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
video editing 13900k for sure thatll cut down on the video editing render time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13900k has higher clocks that will result in a better gaming experience.,i also have more e cores that will be handy for video editing/rendering.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
get the 13900k itâ€™s a beast,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"at 4k, you have no use case for a 13900k.",the kf is an overclockable cpu with no igpu.,the k is overclockable with an igpu.,integrated graphics are handy for troubleshooting gpu issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you already brought an overpriced 4080. just get a 13900k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you are planning to overclock, i7 will hit the same clock speeds on 2-3 core load that the i9, and this is what matters for gaming.",your gaming performance will depend on silicone lottery and good cooling (you need to keep the cpu at low 60-es to get maximum thermal velocity boost).,i have the i9 but saw people hit the same perf on iracing with an i7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you have heavily multi-threaded workloads, i9 is 25 to 30% better.",gaming 5% uplift on average is pointless imo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"personally it's always handy to have an igpu, since it will help with any gpu issues that *may* happen, you never know.","sometimes new drivers break stuff, or certain hardware doesn't play nice, etc.",it'll be better to have a way to get a display signal in case of such emergencies.,also they are really useful for certain encode/decode scenarios for video editing.,"while most of the time a dedicated gpu will easily handle that stuff, there are some formats/codecs that benefit more from quicksync.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for gaming you can just match the clocks of the 13900k on p-cores with a 13700k and they should perform nearly identically.,the only difference is going to be a tiny bit more l3 cache on the 13900k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for your purposes, you either get the 13600k as the best value-for-money chip, or the 13900ks as the best chip.","13700k and 13900k doesn't make any sense, as they are just compromises in-between.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
little functional difference between 13900 and 13700k.,but get the k as it will help you with troubleshooting the gpu down the line.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"canâ€™t be overstated to get the igpu, especially if you will ever work with 10bit compressed files like from a consumer video camera.","neither amd or nvidia gpus will decode that stuff in hardware,  it quicksync will handle it like butter, even with a discrete gpu doing all the rest.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"30k to 40k cinebench rendering score, is that a marginal difference?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"actually, that's not the only difference.","the ""f"" processors also lack ecc memory support.",i have no idea why intel does that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just wanted to say that the igpu is massively useful for encoding and decoding.,it can increase performance by up to 60% in some workloads.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i didn't buy one for years too.,went with a 8700k and fast  3200mhzb drr4 than.,was 200 euro the ram alone.,still good today.,"stocked from 16 to 32
the extra money paid off.",but 5 years later it gets you in a position where you want to upgrade but its still not worth the cost.,changed my 1080 to a 6900xt 2y ago.,buying top hardware at the time you build probably pays off.,maybe a good idea to save on gpu as its more easy to change it.,im waiting for x3d test and may buy one or 13700k.,if ddr5 and boards were cheaper i would buy the 13900k too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same.,went from i5 to i7 and on the day of ordering it i went with the i9.,"hard to admit to myself but i was also like: 
i want that box with the silver die",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"honest question, wouldnt the nvidia harware encoder work for that too?","i know how well it works for streaming, so i can only imagine that it's better for editing too?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, because the cpu isn't doing the rendering work for (almost all) video output.",the gpu and igpu are doing it.,"fwiw on my system, rendering 4k output, i went from 2mins /10 min of footage on a 12700k to like 1 min 50 on a i9-13900k.","a difference you'd never notice if you didn't measure it, and not one i consider spending $200 worthwhile for vs say more ssd space or ram.","system is totally useable whilst it's rendering, it's not like you can't get on with something else for that short wait time.",if it's a dedicated production machine and time is money... maybe.,"cinebench is a synthetic all core workload, it's not really representative of much except pure cpu rendering.","almost all rendering should be done on gpu where possible, it's an order of magnitude faster.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i was literally going to mention that, but then thoughtâ€¦ the op is 99.9% unlikely to need to know that, or give a crap about it.","hell, i used to run ecc memory back when it was more commonplace, and even iâ€™ve stopped caring unless iâ€™m dealing with a server build.",:),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at native there should be no bottleneck.,"if you're using dlss to bring up framerate or pulling graphics settings back to bring up framerate, then you will start to bottleneck.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"new reply, sorry thought it was different thread.","nvidia *decoders* donâ€™t work on 10 bit h264 or h265 files, only 8-bit and 12-bit for some reason.",quicksync will decode anything.,"it makes a big difference during editing and timeline playback, those compressed codecs use a lot of cpu cycles if not hardware accelerated",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am comparing only pure cpu performance.,"on your side, you put in this equation money and gpu.","you may refer to a sense of purchasing it for $200 more and using it as support for gpu rendering, but this has zero sense of pure cpu speeds, who is fast and who is not.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wish i could upvote like 10 times.,"so profoud, so useful answer!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's good to know, thank you.",is there any other usefull stuff the igpu can do?,"i'm running a 9600k with a 4070ti, right now i have the igpu disabled.","is there any benefit in enabling it, if i dont do any video editing?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the op used the term 'worth' which makes cost and value implicit.,"my answer is no, it's not worth it.",cinebench scores do not translate directly to performance gains in ops usage case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it has encoders too but the nvidia ones will probably suit your purpose.,"unless youâ€™re editing video shot in 10bit, the discrete gpu will be better at just about everything.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i put up a post a couple months ago, on how i indicated that upgrading from 10700k to my current 13600k, i saw at least 25 to 35% difference (depending on the games).","but, some users were doubting me.","10850k, is pretty close to 10700k, and even you saw a 45% difference with rt for this game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah thats about normal, in cpu bottlenecked games, i see on average 50-60% more performance going from the 10900k to 13700k with a 4090.

the 10900k seemed to settle around 70-80fps in really cpu demanding games, either rt games or games with lots of drawcalls.",while the 13700k sits around 110-120fps.,it seems to line up pretty well with the single core increase.,1400 v 2100 in cinebench 23 single core.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what games are you playing?,and what resolution?,im thinking of upgrading from 10850k to 13700k.,and also got an 3080,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rt causes more cpu bottlenecks than raster.,that's why it's so frustrating to see benchmarks of old games running at 400 fps instead of actually stressful games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
definitely not worth it yet.,iâ€™d revisit the idea somewhere around 15th gen if i were you.,i have a 10900k and this thing is going strong af still.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"honestly in rasterization i couldnâ€™t find any difference, only in ray tracing games and emulators there was a significant increase in performance",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you can watch [this](https://youtu.be/ixh_jul2sv8), it doesn't have your games, but similar.",and it at least directs the comparison of your cpu to 13700k.,btw acknowledge that the difference is only with 3060ti.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you can literally see the 4090 only at 78% utilization even with the 13600k so this is pretty clear,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
games are always more likely to be cpu bound at lower resolutions.,tbh not really sure 1440p warrants a 4090. you know it's only 60% of the pixel count of 4k?,i'd be far more interested to know what performance uplift you get at 4k resolution with cpu upgrades.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's not cpu bound it is memory bandwidth bound.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 8600k isnt a bad cpu it has the exact same ipc as the 10900k, the only problem is lots of newer games start choking it out because it lacks hyperthreading leading to lots of stutters, but when its not fully saturated it shouldn't perform more than like 10% lower than a 10900k especially overclocked",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is a great cpu for migrating old ddr4 => combo with a cheaper msi b660 pro ddr4 will be great.,"the moment max frames are needed, i'd still go the ddr5 route with even an i5 13500.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the i5 has historically dominated low to mid tier performance, and has at times went blow for blow with the best either side had to offer.",honestly not surprising in the least!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
makes sense.,the 13500 is using 12th gen arch.,"same l2 cache setup, same memory controller, same c0 revision/stepping.",their testing showed when it's not throttling the p cores boost to around 4.5ghz in all core loads which is what the 12600k does too.,main difference is 4 more e cores and the 4mb more l3 cache which is why at stock the 12600k falls behind by about 5% in games.,"the fact its so far from the 13600k and so close to the 12600k, and with all the specs i mentioned before, is enough to deduce that it's using golden cove (12th gen) p cores and is just deceiving being called 13th gen. with an overclock the 12600k will handily beat the 13500.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12400 is still the best minmax chip since e-cores don't help/sometimes hurt pure gaming.,"no point in getting a 13400 or 13500 and disabling e-cores when 12400 exists, cheap.","13600k is the first step up i'd consider, as it has the l2 cache that helps so much with gaming, even with e-cores enabled.","(but if you're chasing cache, 5800x3d all day)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wouldnâ€™t say almost since it was consistently better.,the 12600k is no longer relevant with this thing around.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[yes you can get 6400](https://i.imgur.com/cop6yg0.png) on a locked alder lake chip, even with a [bclk oc](https://i.imgur.com/nb43pfo.png), and you can even tighten the timings quite a bit, well i couldn't tighten the primaries, but those luckily don't matter as much on ddr5(might also not just be because of the vccsa as it's the cheapest m-die kit there is, the kingston 5600 36-38-38 one, so maybe it's just lower bin idk).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"afaik, high end ddr5 takes the lead over high end ddr4 so in any case, chasing the best possible performance will hurt your wallet.","anyways, i don't feel ddr5 is that expensive anymore.","i paid 285â‚¬ for my 6400cl32 and it did feel overpriced, but now that you could get that for \~200â‚¬, it wouldn't feel too bad.",and 6400cl32 feels like that balanced choice of good performance without being too expensive.,"now, i don't know if i would do that for this sort of ""budget"" cpu, though.",i'd say 13600k+ is the ddr5 territory.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it always make sense to pay a premium if youâ€™re looking to keep your right for several years.,"but if you canâ€™t hold the urge to have the latest architecture, it makes sense from a gaming standpoint to go mid-range or minmax your build because youâ€™re probably upgrading in no more than two years anyways.",if you spent a premium on top ddr4 you would obviously want to justify it and justify not jumping to ddr5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[https://youtu.be/77xdpmwh8s0?t=256](https://youtu.be/77xdpmwh8s0?t=256) they used ddr5-6400 for 12600k testing.,the cost comparison looks like a mistake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> but it does fall pretty short in gaming.,does it?,he's using a rtx4090 for benchmarking.,"if you can afford that, you probably aren't going to pair it with a 13500. any cpu from ryzen 5000 and intel 12th gen is good enough for gaming (6 cores and above) for 1080p and 1440p and will be for like 5 years in future, atleast at 1080p.",pair them with a mid tier gpu (since entry level offerings don't really exist) and the gap is minuscule.,"productivity benchmarks are far more interesting, but intel chips are really power hungry in comparison.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i like the performance for productivity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"fwiw 13600k + ddr4-3600 is faster than 12600k + ddr5-6400, and tied with 12700k+d5-6400:
https://www.techspot.com/review/2555-intel-core-i5-13600k/

that extra cache really helps",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12600k was better.,he tested the 12600k with ddr4 ram and in every benchmark the 12600k is better than 13500 with ddr4 ram.,it is only better with ddr5 ram in which case i believe the 12600k if used with ddr5 ram would be of course better.,you can find him answering some coment in the video saying the 12600k was tested with ddr4 ram.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks - though the chart at that link doesn't actually show a 12600k which further added to my confusion.,"it shows 13600k, and 13500.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fair enough.,this thing is probably identical to a ryzen 5 7600 in gaming if you use a 3080.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think if you wanted a cpu higher than 5600/12400f you should get either 13600kf or 7600 non x not 13500 or 13400f, especially if you are getting a 6950xt or higher.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 12600k has been reviewed with ddr5, not ddr4.",go back and watch his 7600x review where he tested the 12600k with both ddr4 and ddr5 and the results in this video match the ddr5 results from that video.,[proof](https://imgur.com/a/39a0vtf),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i thought it was using ddr4 as well, but if you go to their [older videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7-2ardyvfa&t=718s) the numbers of the 12600k match the ddr5 6400 numbers of those videos.","extra 2mb of l2, 4mb of l3, 4 extra e-cores(and maybe the cache is running faster idk couldn't quickly find info about it) and the clock speed difference isn't much as the 12600k stock is only 0.1ghz higher so kinda makes sense.",i mean sure  if they retested the 12600k it might gain some(not a lot but maybe measurable results) back if there have been patches or new drivers and such.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well how about that.,"i also thought it was using ddr4, but clearly not.",seems that 2mb of extra l2 and 4mb of l3 cache really does improve things by quite a bit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so if he lazily re-used those numbers, is he comparing the 12600k + 3090ti numbers vs a 13500 with 4090?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks - just wanted to verify.,"my wife has a i3-12100 and i'm looking at upgrading to 12600k/13400/13500 sometime in the future, so i wanted to see if the 13500 justified higher pricing or not.",this helps!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it is odd though that the 12600k lost to the 13500 in cs:go, which could not care less about cache as shown by the 5800x3d results and mostly prefers higher clock speed.",if there was one game where the 12600k should have scored higher it was this one but it loses even there despite its clock speed advantage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
of course not.,the gaming benchmarks have all been redone with the 4090 but there's no need to redo the productivity benchmarks with a different gpu so they have been reused from his previous testing.,either that or he also redid the productivity benchmarks and the scores were the same since the gpu does not matter for most of those tests.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is a bit of an odd one.,"maybe it only cares about l2 cache, but not l3 for some reason?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wondering why you didn't get the 13600k for $50 more especially considering you bought a 700 series motherboard instead of 600.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
64gb ram?,return that cpu if you can and at least get a 13600k with that high end board.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13600k is on par with 12900k in benchmarks right now just saying ..it will slap right in that z790,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no way you got a strix z790 mobo with only ddr4 support lol.,what a bad deal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"good upgrade, enjoy!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice mobo but z690 for an i5?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i went from a 4770k to a 12700k i had the 4770k for 10 years and still really didn't need to up grade except for high end games.,i will have this 12700k for another 5 to 10 years and never need to to upgrade.,it is amazing.,4770k only has 4 cores going from that to a 12 core cpu more than enough go get by for a long long time.,i could still upgrade to the 13700k but no need.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's a pretty nice upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is a z690 version of that board for a 12600k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that motherboard is gorgeous,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i did the same with a 12600k about a year ago.,super happy with it.,congrats!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just make sure you stay away from that armory crate from asus.,just a mess of bloatware.,also for a z790 board.,you may want to return that 12 and get a 13600k at least.,the 13600k far outperforms the the 12600kf and still for a amazing price per performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for people saying he wasted money on a z790 over a z690 - youâ€™re right.,"but, the people who say that the 13600k is way more worth it might be wrong as thr 12600k and kf are heavily discounted in some countries right now, like here in canada",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have the same board paired with my 13700k.,"primary use is gaming, so ddr5 did me no good.",enjoy!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"specs: 64gb g skill trident z 3600mhz cl14, asus rog strix rtx 3080 oc 12gb, asus z790-a d4, i5 12600kf",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"itâ€™s way better a z690 with a 13600k than this combo, it makes no senseâ€¦",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
stupid combo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 7700k was fine in my opinion but ok,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
def should return the cpu and get the 13600k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pro tip - when downloading chipset drivers from asus' website be sure to expand the box.,by default it only shows the latest one and doesn't show the intel drivers.,took me an hour to figure that out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great processor!,why cause iâ€™ve got same one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
should have gotten a 13600k with that mobo tbh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ngl lots of weird build choices.,"as long as you enjoy it, though.",that's all that matters.,but what was the thought behind buying an expensive $350 13th gen board that also supports ddr5 and then getting neither?,13600k is like maybe $50 bucks more.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"overpays for motherboard, underpays for cpu.",i did that for about 15 years until i learned to buy better.,z690/13700kf for me!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wtf guys you act like the 13600k is double the performance of 12600k, are you even serious?","if the 12600kf was seriously discounted, it's a better buy than 13600k.",lets not mention the cooling you need for 13600k and the many threads of people complaining aboit getting 80+ degrees in games.,"if you read this and can get a 12600k/f at â‚¬200, just grab it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to those questioning the board and cpu combo, maybe op just wanted a white mobo, and wasnâ€™t really concerned about which chipset and got what was available to them?",or maybe they expect to upgrade 3 years down the road to a 13700k from ebay or something?,"to me the keys are: can op afford it, did they do some research to ensure compatibility, and are they happy with their choices?","if so, then good for them!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice i just got a 12700k and upgraded from a 7700k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and you got an expensive motherboard instead of a better cpu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just retired my 6700k for a 13900k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wouldnâ€™t switch from a k variant to a non k variant.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

trying to sell the i7?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
happy for you mate.,:),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good upgrade but why not 13600k and a z690??,iâ€™m confused,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i donâ€™t understand that parts choice here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
please please please get a 13600k instead you will love it so much more,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah the 13600k is way better tbh, but hey how will intel ever sell out of old stock if everyone was an educated consumers?",lul,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
isn't the 12600k like half the tpd and half the temps of the 13600k?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how to kill his buzz ðÿ¤£,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
right!!!..,i'm just chilling with my i9 13900kf with my old 4090...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what gpu did you upgrade to?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same boat here.,was running an i7 4790 on a z97e-itx board until it died a couple days ago.,only upgrade i've done over the years (apart from ssds) was gtx 770 -> rtx 2080. amazing how well those 4 old cores hold up in modern workflows.,can't wait to feel the speed of newer cpus though.,currently debating if i should go for a i5 13500 or ryzen 5 7600(x).,"motherboard prices are horrible, but if i intend to keep my new cpu for nearly as long as that i7, i'm gonna have to go ddr5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that was my thought as well.,couldn't justify the extra cost for something that won't even be leveraged properly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why a z790 board if i can ask?,?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to clarify, this was a bundle deal, $689 cad for both.",i do plan on upgrading the cpu in the near-ish future.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yo man, i have a 12900k and z690 strix board.","the z690 is more than enough, especially with ddr4.","i actually had the z690 tuf originally which would be ideal for a 12600k or 12700k, i just went for strix because itâ€™s white, as would the msi a pro z690, both cost a lot less.","i know youâ€™re excited with the new gear, but it might be worth swapping for a cheaper motherboard and putting the difference into a 12700kf, will last a bit longer and be  better performance along the way?","if you canâ€™t be bothered/donâ€™t want to, at least youâ€™ve got a solid motherboard should you ever upgrade to a 13th gen chip at a later date",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i don't understand why some users spend soo much on an expensive mobo, and paired it with budget chip?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the use of ddr5?,maybe i dunno just guessing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes it does so long as the bios version supports it.,i have an asrock z690 board about to accept a 13600k next week :d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when it works it definitely works according to those that have used it.,but its also a major resource hog and it has been widely known to affect performance in games.,"granted i haven't used armory crate but i have seen many others use it and seen how much resources it takes on their screens, how buggy it is, negative performance with games, it being a absolute nightmare to uninstall.",i do alot of research on these company owned software because i want my new build to be as clean of bloatware as possible.,i seen and spoken to many owners of asus rog products and asus makes amazing hardware but has always suffered in the software department.,and this has been going on since 2018 apparently.,"when there is too many people saying the same thing, when there is too many people actually showing with video and screenshots of how much of a resource hog ac is.",i think ill believe that.,besides even if it does work fine with everything there is many other kinds of software that can handle rgb.,now it's entirely possible that everything can be fine for me but i do not want to even take that chance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah why the hell are you buying z790 board with ddr4 ram?,"i don't understand, most people get the z790 to run a 13th gen and run ddr5 since you can run up to 8000 mhz on it.",yet you choose to run 3600 mhz ram i had back in 2016. honestly go buy yourself a b660 mobo and save the money for future upgrades.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they were both on sale.,the board supports 12th and 13th gen with ddr4.,i didn't have the extra cash to splurge on ddr5 ram.,took the 12600k for now until i can pick up a 13900k that won't cost an arm and a leg.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

iirc the i7 8700k motherboards donâ€™t have the option for rebar in the bios.,i think 9th gen (z390 chipsets) was as far back as they went.,due to this i would not get an arc card as they are designed to use rebar and not having it obliterates the performance of the card.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
some z370 boards have beta or regular bios updates that enabled resizable bar.,you need to check with your motherboard manufacturer to see if thatâ€™s available.,if you cannot enable resizable bar then i wouldnâ€™t bother with arc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

don't think you're going to see u.2 or occulink on a typical board given how niche they are on desktop.,you can get boards with more pcie slots though.,asus did three x4 slots and 1 x16 slot on their recent boards.,"i've got one with a gpu, qsfp, 2x fpgas and a third fpga in the m.2 slot.",only thing really annoying these days is the rarity of real x8 slots imo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

seems about right for stock.,95c is a bit hot but as long as you donâ€™t reach 100c you will still be fine since cinabench load is very heavy and not representative of real world daily performance unless you do some heavy data processing work or rendering.,if you want more performance without having to increase the power limit of 253w you can set the thermal throttle limit of cpu to 100c instead of the stock 90c and see if that does anything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

- bios is on defaults.,- windows 10 was installed using the windows utility tool.,- windows 10 is not activated as of now (looking for one of those oem licences).,my only guess it's that either the cpu or the mobo should be rma but i need to know which one :(,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that is a problem then .even the 5.4ghz cpu speed thay its  turbo  only runs a couple cores that speed at a time under turbo.,if it is defaulted  (all cores)at 5.5ghz its way to oc and somethings wrong with factory default   .. adjust your settings accordingly or (get a new mobo).,anyways 4.3ghz is a decent (all core) speed if that's what you are doing and it works.,cheers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not  true, the true all core frequency is 5.5 but is limited to 5.4 without abt (adaptive boost technology) which is on by default.",turning that off would give the 5.4 all core.,abt is also not overclocking as it is a boost technology.,it will use the 5.5 boost until you hit 100c then it will downclock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

undervolting for 13th gen doesnâ€™t work properly on many b660 boards,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
msi z690-a pro ddr5.,pick the wifi option if you want it.,i run it with my 13600k and it's been solid.,it has usb bios flashing (which you'll need to boot a 13th-gen cpu).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
try to stick with z690 or z790 if you can squeeze it in.,"better vrms, way more lanes, better chance of pcie 5.0, double the bandwidth between chipset and cpu.",note that 700 series boards are a very minimal improvement over 600. all thatâ€™s changed is 4x pcie 3.0 chipset lanes have been changed to 4x 4.0 lanes.,nothing else of note.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"b660s are struggling with the correct voltage for 13th gens, people that have tried a b660 & 13600k combo are not posting positive results or comments.","they run 100c out of the box for everyone, and trying to undervolt on b660 causes them to lose performance.","i would also advise not to bother with b760 for the same reason, intel seem to have done something to make non z & k series work terribly to dissuade users from running that combo.","if you want to go the route of a b series board then pair it with a 13500, or 13600 non k when they release.",for a 13th gen k chip stick to a z series board.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you are right - people with a high sp value on either or both the p or e cores get a chip that requests normal voltage.,people with average p and e core bins get a chip that requests 1.4v+.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"anything thatâ€™s not msi will not have a problem, and even if you get an msi one with this problem then you can easily fix it by adjusting the lite load bios setting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, even low sp values will run ok if you have correct ac load line set in the bios.",afaik itâ€™s only the msi motherboards that sets their lite load much too high by default.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes but higher sp chips run lower voltage at the same loadline.,"i've wasted weeks between msi and intel support only to find msi are following intel spec, albeit setting the maximum ll values specified of 110 each.","furthermore intel do not provide minimum or typical values, only maximum.","so now i no longer think its because of the ll settings - msi boards this gen have much stronger vrms than the other brands, 80a on pro-a, 90a on tomahawk, while typically asus are 60-70a.",the higher vrm amps at the same ll settings = higher volts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also you are aware you can only configure ac / dc ll on z series boards right?,hence why b660s are struggling.,"msi b660s support ll adjustment, but everyone that has tried it have also reported that it isn't working well.","maybe with the vrms are too weak, or the chipset itself is the issue.",if you get a chip that runs 100c as stock you can't do anything about it on a b series board.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>	the higher vrm amps at the same ll settings = higher volts.,not true at all.,"the vrm â€œampsâ€ are only the maximum it is rated for, the cpu isnâ€™t going
to get more amps on a more powerful vrm just because it is rated for higher amps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ac and dc ll can be adjusted on most boards.,"even a h610 can do it, itâ€™s not limited to z series boards.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no thats exactly what happens, the watts you get is amps x volts.","higher amp vrms manage to run with lower volts, intel spec sheet says ll values have to be configured based on vrm power, someone dug them up and posted screenshots in the 13th gen ocnet thread.","intel however are doing a fine job keeping all the spec sheets fully hidden, i have no idea where they were found or where the screenshots came from, and intel support don't even know how to provide them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

your motherboard will dictate the max allowed frequency.,"your cpu imc can most likely handle it, since with 0.95 sa voltage im able to hit 7000 mhz

&#x200b;

if the motherboard qvl says 6200, then usually even hitting 6200  is hard.",only way to know its to try.,"frankly doesnt matter, get the 6400 kit and if it doesn't work, drop it to 6000 and tune the timings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if the motherboard says it only supports up to a certain speed, that's literally all they're guaranteeing.",you could very well squeeze out an overclock beyond that but they aren't making any promises that it'll work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hello.,i can't try it myself since i don't have the motherboard.,i'm asking before purchasing so i won't make a mistake,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that was on a z690 motherboard that has 6400mhz as supported on their page,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so i need the motherboard to say that is supports higher than 6400mhz to have a good chance of running 6400mhz?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the speed you can run isn't based on the imc?,let's say the imc can handle 8000mhz while the motherboard says 6200+(oc).,wouldn't i be able to easily enable xmp for 7000mhz for example?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it depends on the cpu's imc, no guarantee.","most non ks can do 6400 ddr5, but struggle with 3600 ddr4 due to the locked sa voltage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"most z690 and b660 will not easily support 6400, unless you go for 2dimm motherboards that are expensive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"bro i can't even give you a serious response with that name lmao ðÿ˜†

first one i didn't even look at your name.","now i feel dirty even talking to you haha



edit, real response, the imc may be able to handle higher, but its also board dependent.","it's not a ""one or the other"" situation.",if you get a better mobo you'll probably get your higher ram speeds.,"but even if you get the 6400 ram and still stick with that mobo, it'll still work, providing its on the qvl for that motherboard.","worst case scenario you might have to lower the speed down to 6200, but then you have more room to tighten the timings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so it's possible to use 6400mhz even though the motherboard only says 6200mhz?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what about b760?,will i be fine in this case with the i5 13500?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok thanks.,i guess i will have to go with b760 to be almost sure i'm gonna hit 6400mhz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
always has been.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"haven't checked b760 at all, but probably youll be fine.","check the qvl and see what memories they officially support, z790 usually go above 7200, if b760 is anywhere near that you are good to go.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

disable ia cep and then use ac load line to undervolt.,"it should've been done this way from the start, so there's a silver lining to this change lol.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"unfortunately, that's the new intel policy.",they decided to disable undervolting with the new microcode version (part of vendors' bios).,"yep, those guys don't have any other problems than customers trying to fix thermal issues and get more performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i played with llc a bit, but the results were so random.",i don't have enough knowledge about it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seems like a pretty big deal and until i stumbled on your thread i couldn't find anything about it.,"can they also change microcode via intel management engine driver, and block undervolting that way?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
llc sets the vdroop and ac ll sets the requested voltage before vdroop.,"you generally want llc at a medium level and then try ac ll set to 0.3mohm, 0.4mohm, 0.5mohm.",the motherboard stock ac ll is generally 1.10 or 0.70 depending on the vendor so this turns into a 50mv-150mv undervolt at full load depending on what value you started at and what value you settled into.,"you can check the stock ac ll using hwinfo under central processors -> 12700k -> ia domain loadline

i3 12100 / 13100 4c/8t would be an ok upgrade.,with 65% higher single thread and 43% higher multi thread performance in rendering.,"gaming won't show those levels of performance gains, especially if pairing with rtx 3070 or below class at 1080p ultra.","[outside of a few specific st games, i doubt see much higher average fps difference, though might see higher minimums leading to smoother experiences?","](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/intel-core-i3-12100f/16.html) 

though once vsync capped or gsync'd / freesync'd i don't think it would matter much.","i'd suggest aiming to buy a little higher on the cpu tier, such as i5 12400 6c/12t or the **highly anticipated upcoming i5 13400 10c/16t (6p/4e)**.","[there many online side by side videos and reviewers comparing performances across 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12th gens.",](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/intel-core-i3-12100f/),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"eh, i'd go for another i5 if you could.","it would likely be a boost, but the 9400f is literally on par with my 7700k roughly, and i'd personally want more than a 30% improvement for the price of a platform upgrade tbqh.",13500 in particular looks like it's gonna be just nice....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

for gaming ?,does it even matter ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"depends on the i5... the 12th gen i5s are faster, any i5 with only 4 cores will be slower.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wonder if having more cores (though slower and more power hungry) offers any sort of advantage?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is currently in our test system.,"we do have a 10400 in our studio gaming system, seems alright with the arc a770 tbh no issues so far.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a 3050 would be great for this cpu.,the 12100f performs better than a 9900k in some games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this plus a 3050 will have zero issue running gta5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they still get the e cores, dont they?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, this is just a stop gap while we decided on a bigger cpu for the test system.",others have recommended the 13600k so might go for that one.,thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, if you want ecores, the 12600k/13600k is the cheapest option - for now.","why not pair it with a good b660m board, if you don't need the oc capabilities?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"itâ€™s extremely hard and expensive to get a board that supports blck overclocking, so i doubt he has one",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is currently sitting in our testing rig until a bigger cpu is coming.,was looking at the 13600k though so might go that route while we play around with this one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"agree; why pay for a new board and cpu and possibly ddr5 ram, just to go from 6ct/6t to 4ct/8t?","if you can afford it, then an i5 would give you a much more noticeable uplift in performance, as even the lowest 12th gen i5 offers 6ct/12t.","and with the 13th gen coming out right now, prices will hopefully drop.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so that would be faster than my i5 8th gen?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
agrees on the performance part.,but not so on the pricing part.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"according to the gamers nexus review, this cpu performed well with a 3080.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"almost certainly not, iâ€™m pretty sure the 13400 uses alder lake silicon so itâ€™s more like a locked 12600k.",if you want an upgrade go with the 13500 which should be raptor lake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nope .... now listen though your mobo just needs a bios update and you should buy a 13th gen i5 13600k(not a i5 13400) on sale if ya can and sell your 12th gen on ebay or something .now the new i5 13600k or (kf) has the same performance as the 12th gen i9 just not as many cores and threads.,but it really wont be super noticeable if you are just gaming though you would get a few more fps nothing crazy drastic but benchmarking it would be faster by a bunch ..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but do you really want to upgrade this soon?,it has barely been a year since your chip even launched,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13500 seems to be alder too.,i think go for 13600k is raptor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"probably unrelated but i just had to rollback drivers/disable updates for an update for i225-v rev_03 released on 7/28/2022, it would lose connection and return blank pages after a couple of minutes ""device not started (e2fexpress)""

if the cooler is the problem i will invest in a new cooler for it and run it on turbo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"okay, so youâ€™ve kind of run head-first into one of the great problems of the post-ryzen cpu market - intelâ€™s â€œtdpâ€ is a lie.",youâ€™re guaranteed base clock at that tdp and nothing more - real power consumption is about 150-180w.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cooler is rated to 65-82w max.,install cpuz and press the stress cpu button and see what the power usage of the cpu is under load.,not sure if you need to install hwinfo also to see power consumption?,could be other issues.,cpu being utilized more by newer games?,how are the idle and light load temperatures?,you reset the mainboard bios recently or install any overclocking programs?,upgrade your gpu recently?,change any bios settings?,same cooler as before?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah that cooler is not enough to do 8700 under pl2 states get a better cooler if you can disabling turbo will make the cpu feel sluggish at times.,or apply a slight undervolt -50mv or so and go from there to see if it makes a difference,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"never dealt with the voltage im kinda scared to change any of that, i think iâ€™ll just disable turbo for now, weird to think that ive had turbo on all this time and maxxing out temps, how i havent killed my cpu is beyond me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 8700 is basically a 10500 give or take 100 mhz, should top out at 125w or so.",the cooler op is using might actually be worse than the stock cooler though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ok should i do this with turbo enabled or disabled, currently i have it disabled atm for temp regulation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
idle temps are hovering between 45-55 celsius,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"right, itâ€™s the 8700*k* that goes above 150w.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
enabled.,disabled it should stay at 65w or lower.,65w is at base clock speeds and not turbo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh weird it didnt show me the rest of the comment, upgraded my gpu 3 times first was the 1660 super and now i have a 3060 in there i did update the bios to support resizable bar a few months back.",i have not touched anything to do with ocâ€™ing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seems like they dropped to 33-32 as of now kinda scared to play anything with those temps,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ok so it looks like its maxxing at 112 watts on stress 

is that too high?","vie had this cooler for years, maybe its time to invest in a new cooler, cpu temps are hitting almost close to 100 degrees celsius under stress",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,"minimalist gains, you won't notice in real world/gaming.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
best upgrade would be 10700k or 11700k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,i7 at the least for an upgrade.,"at this point, i'd recommend just saving a bit and getting something in the 13th gen. 

$400-450 should get you the cpu and mobo and everything else should be compatible if you stick with ddr4.",get a upgraded cooler though.,the 13600k or above are some spicy chips.,edit: the 13400f is even $210 right now.,that would be a huge upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13500 is the best value with 14 cores 20 threads (6p core 8e core) and i believe you will feel more upgrades on this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
honestly upgrading your cpu **very** rarely provides any more than an incredibly minimal improvement in gaming unless your cpu is like 5+ years old or you had a mid to low end build and you upgraded to a top end gpu.,so just going 10400f to 11400f will likely result in negligible changes in gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nope.,"11th gen was basically a sidegrade from 10th, even jumping up to an 11700k wouldn't do a lot for you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nop, just go for the 12400f since the 13400 is about to lunch worldwide soon and the price will drop even more.","i always buy the 400 series but skipping one gen (8400, 10400, 12400, etc).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i just went from an i5 10400 to an i5 11400f, and i notice a difference.",pretty significant in cpu bound scenarios like escape from tarkov.,i also got a z590 motherboard instead of my b460m.,i mainly did the upgrade because i was having fps and stuttering issues in tarkov and they have all been resolved now.,"also, my motherboard and cpu didn't support anything higher than 2933mhz and 2666mhz ram respectively, whereas the new cpu supports 3200 and the motherboard upto 4888. i was able to sell my old stuff for only 3$ less than i paid for the new stuff, so if you're able to spend a very small amount upgrading i would definitely say it's worth it if you have a motherboard that can utilize it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nah.,10400f is a very capable cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"bet you could find an 11900k for cheap on the used market (widely considered worse than the 10900k, but depending on how much less money the 11900k is: its the better deal and will give you great performance for a couple year minimum).","if you end up getting a new build, i'd go ryzen over intel (am5 will be upgradable for years, 13th gen ending means the next intel cpus will also require a new mobo)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nah.,waste of sand that 11 series is.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™d go 11700k or 11900k.,at that point youâ€™re almost at 12600k level,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you can get it super cheap, sure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,12400f or 13400f would be a better upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that depends on if op has a z-series board to make use of the cpu overclocking.,and what cooler+psu they have.,there's just too much missing information from op.,"we don't even know if they are using an intel stock cooler, a $25 single tower cooler, or a 280mm aio.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i did this but better: 10700 to 11700k.,i'm never cutting corners getting a non-k cpu for my main desktop again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"first thing i've done with intel 12/13th gen builds is disable the manufacturer auto overclocking nonsense in the bios... asus multicore enhancement, etc..

"honestly, for just browsing chrome with multiple tabs, any laptop with a semi-recent cpu should be fine.",i'd look for an 8th-gen i3 or i5 laptop with at least 6-8gb of ram and a small ssd for the os.,"8th gen because intel finally provided hyperthreading even down to the i3 level, and an ssd to have everything run more responsively.","enough ram for multiple chrome tabs, and you don't need a dgpu just to run chrome.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"anything will do for this task, get something from the 8th generation intel or better.",that way your laptop will also be able to run windows 11 without the need for any hacks.,i'd focus more on memory since chrome can be a real memory hog with few tabs open and perhaps keep save some money to buy a ssd if the laptop doesn't have one already.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a tablet or smartphone does these tasks easily and any chromebook from last few years would be cheapest probably,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

with 12th and 13th gen its better to adjust ac/dc loadline values than applying manual offset anyways.,"i have 13600k with gigabyte b660 board, and with latest bios, which was released 1month ago, i can successfully undervolt by adjusting ac/dc loadline values in bios.",but older undervolt methods like negative offset do seem to be bugged or not working correctly.,"anyways, loadline adjustment is the way to go.","on default 13600k was using upto 200w, with lower ac/dc loadline values its using \~165w now with same performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

my favorite features on the amd side of things this generation is the ability to set a thermal target and let the cpu/motherboard sort out voltage and boost clocks accordingly to maximize performance up to that target temp even below the default target temp of 95c that amd sets by default.,"the concept is brilliantly simple assuming the execution is good... on my asus tuf b650 board + ryzen 9 7950x, rather than having to manually tinker with multiplies and voltages manually and then measuring the resulting temperature impact until satisfied, you just tell the motherboard your temp target and let it work backwards to that value and adjust boost/voltage values automagically rather than the other way around.","my asus strix b660 itx board + 12700k has options for intel adaptive boost technology (auto, enabled, disabled) and asus performance enhancement 3.0 but nothing that leverages a temperature target (preset or manually defined).","i did notice thermals improved greatly with the asus pe 3.0 disables with minimal impact on performance... same story on my 12700k + asus prime z690 ddr5 and the similar bios ""feature"" on the gigabyte gaming x z690/ddr4 setup.",does this have anything to do with the launch of their non-k / locked sku's  recently or is it a legit security/performance concern with intel?,i see the intel me / management engine updates have been paired up with the latest bios updates for the asus boards i've worked on.. any connection to this situation?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

> you cannot utilize the whole 40g bandwidth for one displayport connection.,"that will still be limited to the standard hbr3 limit of ~25.9gbit/s

thanks for the clarification.",i did not fully realize that the full 40 gbit/s of the thunderbolt 4 link could not be used for display (or at least not a single display).,"i think what confused me was [this video](https://youtu.be/qb9u4f0p6oy?t=1501) i watched which has a chart showing 4k120 *without* dsc for usb4/tb4, but looking back now i think he might just be referring to the *potential* of the bandwidth provided by a usb4/tb4 link (as opposed to it being usable today).","okay, so basically 4k120 over thunderbolt 4 means dp hbr3 + dsc, which i was not aware of.","and in fact i was just able to confirm right now using cable matter's firmware tool (which can also be used to get detailed information about the signal): yep, sure enough, it's hbr3+dsc.","it's a bit of a shame to be forced to use dsc on a cable that has the capacity to do away with it, but it doesn't really seem noticeable (definitely fooled me during my tests!)",so fair enough i guess.,another thing that confused me a bit: i keep reading that hbr3 can do 4k120 8bpc without dsc.,and [calculators claim](https://linustechtips.com/main/topic/729232-guide-to-display-cables-adapters-v2/?section=calc&h=3440&v=1440&f=120&calculations=show&formulas=show) that 4k120 8bpc is 25.82 gbit/s which is just within the hbr3 data rate limits.,"but clearly that's not happening here, so what's going on?","well here's the thing: at 4k120 8bpc, the firmware tool says i'm pushing 1188 mpixels/sec through the link.",but the calculators assume 1075 mpixels/sec for that mode.,"as it turns out, it's down to the timing format: the calculators assume cvt-rb2 which presumably makes sense for dp, but hdmi devices would use cta-861.","and sure enough, if i select cta-861 in the calculator, the data rate requirement jumps to 28.51 gbit/s which is clearly above hbr3 capacity.","okay so that makes sense, although it seems very silly that hbr3 can't do 4k120 when connected to a cta-861 device just for that reason.",but then that means that when connected to a cvt-rb2 device (i.e.,"a pc monitor), hbr3 can, in fact, do 4k120 without dsc, right?","jeez this stuff is subtle :( 

now i'm wondering if the reason why the lenovo and sabrent adapters are having issues is because maybe they don't support dsc.","i don't think that fully explains it though, because with intel gpu driver 30.0.101.1692 i could definitely get a picture at 4k120 rgb 4:4:4 and *even at 10-bit* - that's a whooping 35.64 gbit/s.","granted it was not completely stable, but if it was using hbr3 without dsc it seems like it would have been completely unable to switch into this mode in the first place, right?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so i decided that ultimately i want to power this optiplex ultra via usb-c pd... so i ordered a cable matters displayport to hdmi adapter and put that in play instead.,120hz is still working - so evidently as suspected dell's documentation is wrong and the displayport on the 3090 ultra does support hbr3 (which makes sense since it's dp 1.4)?,running happily at 120hz with dp-->hdmi and usb-c pd.,a little annoying to lose my sole usb-c port just for power but i suppose no way around that other than using a dock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> in fact, do 4k120 without dsc, right?",yep.,and you were far quicker than anybody else in picking up the relevance of video timings.,"just fyi, very similar problem with 2xhbr3 and 4k60 (with cea its above the available bandwidth of most usb-c hubs that only use half of a hbr3 connection).","so active dp to hdmi 2.0 adapters can change the video-timings on the fly so you can make do without dsc, but still have cea timings on the other side.","but the bandwidth that is saved, is there to support the various surround sound formats of hdmi, so that makes it very unreliable in which combinations you can still use uncompressed surround with those active dp to hdmi 2.0 adapters.","&#x200b;

>lenovo and sabrent adapters are having issues is because maybe they don't support dsc

at least the lenovo dock actively mentions dsc support and so far all adapters i have seen use that to achieve 8k60 etc.","i think this is just down to first generation, buggy chipsets, same with the avrs with hdmi 2.1 etc.","&#x200b;

maybe they will also get firmware fixes...

&#x200b;

>it's a bit of a shame to be forced to use dsc on a cable that has the capacity to do away with it

thunderbolt / usb4 is basically transparent to gpus and monitors.",it just acts like a displayport cable.,"(which gets really fun, when you go over the combinations of the 2 dp connections you can have).","so right now, on either end of the connection you have an actual, physical displayport signal that therefore would still be bandwidth limited, even if tb could maybe surpass those limits with just a firmware update.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

iâ€™ll answer your questions.,you are correct that short/long duration are the pl1 and pl2 limits.,it is very sensible to set these to intel specs.,"or even lower if you like, depending on your cooler abilities, and the degree to which you care about your computer doing sustained workloads a tiny bit faster.","by sustained workloads, i donâ€™t mean gaming.","i mean encoding a video in pure software (for some reason), or, more ethereally, doing synthetic benchmarks for the sake of.",i canâ€™t confirm enhanced turbo is mce but it looks right.,very common to disable this so as to keep the cpu doing things more predictably and not oc itself to 100 degrees whenever it wants.,another setting you might look for is the temp limit.,"if you donâ€™t like 100, lower it to 90 or even 80. i doubt you would see any difference in games.","again, will impact only those sustained workloads we talked about.",disclosure: i have a 13900k and have done detailed power scaling testing on it.,you can check my post history for recent details.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"here you go bro, https://youtu.be/h4bm0wr6oeq

"it doesn't matter what any of these tech channels say or how much knowledge these people have on previous gens, 13th gen is the first range from intel where ac_ll and dc_ll are being aggressively set beyond what they should be by mobo manufactures.","msi will straight up tell you this if you bother contacting them if experiencing overheating at stock on their boards - 'lite load is set to worst case scenario at stock, we expect all users to manually adjust this based on the quality of their chip'.",9/10 people that simply try to undervolt completely brick their boosts and stock performance because undervolt & stock ll values are not compatible.,"when setting a fixed manual voltage, ll settings are over ridden and forced to the minimum value instead which is what everyone should be be doing.","undervolting is for 12th gen and below, 13th gen does not work with undervolting vs adjusting ll values or forcing fixed voltge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"offset causes more instability than lite load on 13th gen, stop using obsolete and bad advice.",lower lite load on 13th gen not offset and stability test with cinebench.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which lite load mode should i use if i don't want to worry about stability?,"i don't want to set it to mode 1 and then wait to see if certain apps crash or whatever, i want to give it a buffer so i can just set it and forget it.",can i just drop it from 12 (default) to 5 or 6?,"with it set to mode 6, hwinfo says vcore is ~1.25v during cinebench r23 multi core.",is that a reasonable voltage for 13th gen?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

theres no set value!,each chip is different.,"this is basic ymmwv, you have to tune your chip yourself.","ideally stop bothering with anything, grow a pair and start using manual override for voltage, everything you try to do with negative offsets / lite load / ac_ll / dc_ll is 100% pointless and harder than just 'manual voltage 1.25, then manually tune up and down until you find the least that works.",13th gen k chips are not newbie friendly!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
right sorry.,setting pls to 181 also does not work.,been there tried it.,"the cpu will continue to 'overvolt', but run within the pl limit, so instead of running 5.1 all core, it will run 4.6-4.8 instead and never boost to its maximum specification.",you want stock speeds at stock pl right?,"you get that by lowering lite load, on my 13600kf, at lite load 1 stock voltage drops from 1.409v to 1.259v and it runs 5.1 all core at 150-160w.","other people have managed to get the stock all core boost on 13600ks and 13900ks to work as low as 1.1v and sit well under the rated tdp, even with pl limits left uncapped the chip never reaches 181w / 253w usage this way, and continues to run at maximum stock turbo boost.","no 13th gen chip appears to need its 'stock voltage' to run stock speeds, they are overspecified with aggressive vids, and running the stock voltages for too long is what leads to lower voltages becoming unstable from degradation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> 13th gen k chips are not newbie friendly!,i wish i had known that before i bought one!,where can i find the manual voltage setting in the msi bios?,"sorry for all the questions, in case it's not obvious i know very little about this stuff.",the most i've done in bios before this is enable xmp.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do not listen to what this guy is saying.,anyone who is on stock do not need to fear degradation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the explanation.,so i should leave everything at default except lite load?,including leaving enhanced turbo enabled?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you can't even find the cpu voltage setting i don't even know how to help you sorry.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just because you don't know anything doesn't make me wrong.,you are partially correct that you shouldn't get any degradation at stock.,the issue is that most motherboards are not running the auto voltages at what stock should be.,"on brand new / never ran at stock voltage chips, multiple ocnet users are able to run 5.1 all core on 13600k and 5.4 all core on 13900k at just 1.1v.",can you do that?,what about even 1.2v?,if not thats because your chip has already degraded with the motherboard's auto voltage.,auto voltage =/= stock.,the only people that cannot lower their voltages as such are the ones that have left their chips at auto voltages and went and ran days / weeks of stress tests and gaming already on auto overvolts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"with offset you change idle and any load voltage, with ac loadline you change voltage after scaling to power draw as a result of ac (in ohm) multiplied by amperage, so ac of 100 (1 mohm, mind the unit) under 140a power draw will bump your voltage by 0.001\*140=0.14v or 140mv, which will add 20w if it'd be a load under 1v originally.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"enhanced turbo is not stock, this isn't difficult.",you need to disable all motherboard trash overvolt settings.,"lite load is the main one, enchaced turbo / mce / 6.0 turbo etc are the other vendor specific ones.","the problem isn't the chip or the pl, its all the trash that mobo vendor twats keep adding to make it go even faster and more volts out of the box.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you donâ€™t have to help me but iâ€™d appreciate it if you wouldnâ€™t be so condescending.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this again?,iâ€™ve already had this with you.,over volting doesnâ€™t do any harm at stock clocks.,stop spreading this misinformation.,voltage can be as high as 1.45 as long as amperage/current is low ( hence gaming can be around 1.3-1.4v since itâ€™s low amperage) itâ€™s not just core voltage you need to look at its amperage/current.,this is what your not getting.,as long as core voltage is below 1.35 during an all core workload it is fine.,i have an asus board with power limits disabled and all core workload core voltage is around 1.28 which is more than safe.,with intel limits i get 1.21. stop spreading misinformation please.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel spec for 13900k is 253w.,"they are proven repeatedly on ocnet to require more and more voltage to stabilise minimum stable volts if pushed much past 253v, or over 1.35v sa in high end stress tests like y cruncher.","several users degraded their chips from simply playing chess using stockfish ai, which turns out to be a huge stress test now for cpus.","this isn't misinformation, people far more knowledge than anyone in this sub have proven it time and time again.","none of those people are running the stock volts, and even msi support have told me they expect users to manually configure lite load based on their chip quality.","the ac_ll / dc_ll settings need to be manually tuned per chip, they are set to 'worst case scenario' out of the box so the boards pump enough voltage to boot with any chip no matter its quality, except this is still far too aggressive on 13th gen for any chip at stock.",the actual cpu voltage you leave on auto.,pl can be left uncapped.,you adjust ll settings until it is working at the correct tdp and voltage.,"the reason these chips will continue to work is they are being overvolted beyond intel spec, which is 253w / 181w for the advertised boost speeds.","to run within intel spec means enforcing 253w / 181w and adjusting lite load until boost p core turbo boost is maintained, in the case of the 13900k and 13900ks, this is meant to be 5.4 all core not 5.5 / 5.6 that a bunch of them run at due to motherboards auto overclocking them.","now when overclocking these chips, you screen for the max clocks at least voltage they will run at 253w, thats what everyone with knowledge on this is doing.","running 300+w on these chips, they will very quickly no longer undervolt to intel spec, and just wait and see they will not last 3 years with daily use.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you have no idea what your talking about.,wattage limit has nothing to do with core voltage.,and its not proven on oc net.,"its people who are pushing their chip too much, i read that forum and i see nothing that currently says what your saying at all.",again i repeat.,5.5 is within current spec with abt which is enabled by default.,boosting technology made by intel.,to run the chip as fast as possible which is 5.5 p core and 4.3 e core.,and confirmed by intel.,and intel also confrimed any k version of cpu is pl1=pl2 so i have no idea where your pulling 181w limit from your ass.,this is the most ridiculous thing ive ever heard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>another important use case would be moving fewer large files to try to get as fast throughput as possible through multiple 10gbe or 25gbe network connections.,i think moving data through the network is a relatively straightforward cpu task and i was wondering if the little cores might be better than 55% as good for this.,this is the kind of thing you benchmark with your specific hardware/software configuration.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if 2 cores are hotter than most likely your heatsink is not getting full contact with your cpu.,you should get the thermalright contact frame to eliminate that as a possibility.,other than that you can try doing a voltage offset.,for some people there is no real effect here.,it all depends on how concave your cpu ihs is and how much contact it is making with your cooler heatsink.,"i personally didn't see any temperature improvements with the contact frame with an air cooler, but my temps were already extremely good with a 13700k and a 170w tdp limit, so i wasn't surprised.",but some people see a huge improvement.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it wouldnâ€™t hurt to just try the game out when it comes out.,"the 4790k is under the minimum spec for the game (steam page for it says r5 2600 or i5 8600 as minimum), but sometimes minimum spec is just a suggestion, rather than a hard requirement.","worst thing that could happen is youâ€™re not satisfied with the performance, so youâ€™ll have to go out and buy new parts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you should be able to play the remake but it may be a little choppy at times.,"the remake requirements say:  ryzen 5 2600 / i5-8600,  and a gtx 1070 for minimums.",also a ssd which i assume you have (and i see the 16gb).,iirc 4790k is pretty close to a 2600 in terms of gaming performance.,as long as the game doesnâ€™t force specific models of cpu you should be ok.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no and don't get fooled.,"severe fps drops, hitches and 1/0.1% fps staying very low, depending on how they do dead space it should suffice, but expect inconveniences.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it was, but even an older i3 10th gen destroys it.",i would highly suggest upgrading to a 13700k.,"you definitely got your money out of your cpu, but it's time to upgrade now especially if you want to play newer triple a titles.","it might run the remake fine at 30fps, maybe lower.",keep in mind it doesn't even meet the minimum requirements.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"one of my desktops still runs a core i7 4770. it is still decent, but i wouldn't use it for gaming.","games these days have gotten far better at using more cores and the older i7 cpus only have four physical cores, so they get maxed out quick by aaa-titles.",chances are your cpu is holding back your graphics card already.,i'd invest in a 13th gen i5 at minimum or a 13th gen i7 if your willing to spend a bit more.,that should be enough for years to come.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i don't have a 12th gen but i imagine that 3200mhz limit your seeing is actually referring to the gearing of the cpu.,if your at 3200mhz and under the cpu will run in gear 1 mode.,if over 3200mhz it will run in gear2 which will halve the speed of the memory controller on the cpu in favor of stability with faster ram kits.,just look up if the applications you use will run better in gear1 or gear2.,gear 1 is 1:1 controller speed to ram speed.,gear 2 is 1:2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ãƒ»when installing total memory of 4gb capacity or more, windows 32-bit operation system may only recognize less than 3gb.","hence, a total installed memory of less than 3gb is recommended.",*ãƒ»ddr5 speed may vary depending on the number of memory modules used.,"in general, ddr5 speed with 2 dimms will be faster than that with 4 dimms, and its actual speed will also vary depending on platform.",refer to your memory modules' specifications for more details.,*,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

interesting how a small undervolt of 0.003 v helps increase the boost enough to get fairly close to a 7950x in terms of total power consumed vs time to complete the handbrake test.",would have been interesting to see other undervolting and frequency adjustments to see what else is possible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks.,"my mc was 79.

been playing around with my sp107 chip cooled by a 420mm aio with great airflow in the case (11 fans total) and frankly i'm kind of disappointed so far.",i'm just an intermediate ocer and i don't know...i guess i was expecting a little bit more out of a top-binned ks chip.,it seems my pc is struggling to do a 5.8 all-core oc @ 320w power draw.,at that power and all-core load half of my p-cores are thermal-throttling and i can barely scratch the 40000 mark on cinebench r23 multi (usually around 39000).,"e-cores i can only oc up to 4.5-4.6 max, and forget about cache.",so far i haven't been able to oc cache over the default 4.5ghz without causing instability while i've seen many others have an easy time ocing it up to around 5ghz.,it's really wonky.,so far the sweet spot for my chip and cooling seems to be an all-core oc of 5.7 with maybe 2 or 3 cores doing up to 6.2 in light loads.,"relatively speaking these values are superb, but i think i'm just spoiled and underwhelmed by all the better binned chips out there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah i had the following:

p-sp: 116  
e-sp: 89

not that great?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm not sure either.,hopefully others can chip in with their scores so we can get a general idea of where our chip stands.,"however just by looking around at other forums and such 100-110 seems pretty average, if not on the lower side though.",i've seen people with 120+ but haven't seen anybody with something lower than 100 so...take that for whatever it's worth.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i just bought a binned 13900kf for less than a kf retail.,overall sp 105 w/ p 114 and e 88.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what settings do you use to run it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
huh that's interesting.,seems like these ks chips may have a pretty wide discrepancy between the p and e scores.,my chip has a difference of 27 and yours 32. perhaps they binned the p cores more on these chips...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok updated the summary to add your mc 79.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ok here are my results at stock settings.,note this is with asus z790 extreme + a corsair 420mm aio.,xmp was not enabled and ambient room temp was 20.5c.,i ran cinebench r23 for 1 min to try and closely match the duration of what you ran in your test.,"**test #1 ::: pl1=320w, pl2=unlimited**

so anyway, just going back to your original comment of:

>hmm.",my ks does 40.5k cb23 at 240w i think at the stock 5.6/4.3.,this was probably incorrect as i don't see how you can hit 40k+ at 240w.,at least on my chip i need to oc to something like 5.8 all-core to barely break 40k but even my 420mm aio can't sustain the heat for long and throttles at that kind of voltage.,edit - ran some more tests at higher frequencies (5.7 and 5.8).,"**test #3 ::: pl1=320w, pl2=unlimited, oc to 5.7 all-core**

these are simple p-core overclocks so i can break 40k with a little more tweaking (xmp, e-cores oc, a/f curves, tvb, aioc, etc) but overall i'm still a bit underwhelmed by the ks chip (at least with mine...which is just average at sp 107).",it just feels like everyone else easily hits 40k+ with a similar setup but i guess all the reviewers mostly have super high-bin samples to showcase their benchmarks and my results reflect the norm.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

its not because your cpu is obviously throttling.,your cooler choice is ridiculous.,why would anyone think that tiny 75w tdp cooler would be enough for cpu which consumes upto 200w?,"you can change whatever settings you want, you cant cool 13600k with this tiny thing without loosing half the performance",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"as far as i know (i donâ€™t own one so please feel free to correct), 5.2ghz is the correct all-core turbo speed for the 13900k.",5.4ghz is the less-than-all-core turbo speed.,"5.7ghz is the preferred 1/2 core (turbo max 3.0) turbo, and then thereâ€™s 100mhz on top of all of these if tvb is enabled and the cpu is below 65 degrees.","so, if everythingâ€™s enabled and stock and you monitor general system usage for like an hour, 2 cores should hit 5.8ghz and the rest 5.5ghz, just not all at the same time.",a run of r23 should stabilize at 5.2ghz without hitting any throttles.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mine is the same.,set optimised defaults and muticore enhancement turned off in bios.,cinebench score 37800. hwinfo says i'm pulling 253 watts.,"pcore goes to 5.2 all core and e cores at 4.1

would ne nice to score around 40s at the 253watt power limit like others.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you have stock settings (mce off and intel adaptive boost off) then it should start out at 5.5 p core and 4.3 e core.,after 5-10 seconds it goes to 5.1-2 p core and 4.1-2 e core.,if you have intel adaptive boost on which is usually default on motherboards it should be 5.5p core 4.3 e core unless thermal throttle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are hitting the power limit and throttling.,stop using fixed vcore.,set svid to typical or power saving.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, temps get to around 88c after long benchmarks.",i have done some more fiddling and can maintain almost 5.4 average p core and a bit over 4.2 average e core after applying a hefty offset.,core vids and vcore read about 1.20-1.21v with a -0.110v offset in xtu.,"seems that i should have been getting the full 5.5 before the offset though, since i wasn't throttling?","i throttle with unlimited power, getting to 99-100c.","although i do recall sometimes where hwinfo throttle flag is 'yes', but the max temps never broke like 87c, so maybe i am throttling?",i just figured the sensor was getting erroneous data.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
perhaps my temps instantly shoot past the threshold.,i figured as long as there was enough voltage/power and the cpu wasn't throttling these speeds were attainable.,i can score around 39.2-39.3k with my 1.2v fixed vcore and -0.100v offset at 240w pl1 and pl2.,just seems strange that going to higher voltage hurts my performance so much that all cores downclock 300-400mhz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks.,"perhaps everything is normal then, and people i have seen saying they got stable 5.5ghz all core at 253w were actually unlimited?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> (i donâ€™t own one so please feel free to correct)

this is incorrect.",all-core turbo ratio is 55x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you using a fixed or adaptive vcore and what voltage?,maybe our chips just don't tolerate much voltage.,seems so weird as most of the overclocking guides i see are running 1.35-1.45v on the 13900k.,performance is much worse for me at those voltages.,at 1.45v windows is buggy and i can't drag windows around.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
somebody else suggested it only boosts to those speeds if you have thermal headroom.,i would think i do since my max temps in these scenarios are about 88c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"right, i can hit 5.5 all core with more power, but it seems a lot of people can do it with 253w, so i was thinking maybe it was voltage or something else.",perhaps my chip just needs more power than others.,is svid the same as sa vid?,"not sure i have seen svid in bios, but i will look.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
technically speaking you should get 5.5 with stock setup and mce off.,have you tried with sync all core 5.5 without the offset?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"then intel needs to work on their specs, since ark shows 5.4 as max p-core turbo, tvb should only apply at less than 65 degrees, and if every core is getting a 3.0 boost then wtf is the point of specifying it separately.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
speed only throttles at 100c.,if you arenâ€™t hitting that tinge.,you have thermal headroom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why in the world are you spending so much on decade old hardware?,just get it used off ebay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why are you looking for such old parts?,$500 for a 780ti is ridiculous.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

wait did you mean to buy a 3770k?,i assumed you bought a 9th gen chip and got a 3770k.,are you doing a throw back build with the old cpu and gpu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
$275 for a 3770k?,i just bought a xeon e3-1240 v2 for $20 and it's essentially the same without the overclocking.,think for a second.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what's fake about it?,i legitly can't understand why people don't just install it and check for themselves.,you will know if it's fake pretty quick.,also you are insane for buying those parts for that much money.,780 ti for $500 is so goofy i can't even tell if this is a troll.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
500 for a 2013 card?,how and why!,?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well that does seem to be the right processor but in the wrong box.,that said your honestly wasting a stupid amount of money trying to buy hardware that old which is also likely to go bad fairly quickly.,if you want to run an xp machine for something just use a vm.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if you are not trying to get specifically new parts you should be able to find a 3770k and other parts for much cheaper.,the cpu is probably a legit one in the picture they just used the box of the cpu they probably upgraded to at the time.,which if you bought it as new would definitely point to it not being that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"13600, 13700, 13900 depends on a budget",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you'll see more performance the higher you go obviously, but at the cost of diminishing returns.","plus at higher resolutions, your cpu choice will matter less and less, and your performance will tend to depend more on your gpu instead.","for strictly gaming, i believe that a 13600 would be a good value proposition, while a 13700 may be better if you have some extra money to blow.","the 13900 would be better, but only marginally, and for a disproportionate amount of money relative to the performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nothing less than a 9th gen, and that's being generous.",the newer the better for the 4000 series.,may i ask what you have now?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you think i5-13400f would work as well with no bottlenecks on 2k 60+?,i am planning to buy a build pairing the rtx 4070 ti with the i5-13400f and i dont think i can go any higher because im on a budget.,and i prioritized on a 1440p 240hz monitor which is the samsung g7 the 27 inch.,so do you think this build would work really well for intense 2k gaming 60+ fps?.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the correct answer is 12th or 13th genâ€¦anything older is not worth the money today.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have  i5 8500 and rtx 2060,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most performing and cheap for high fps will be  i7-13600kf + ddr5 (prices on 21jan).,"13400f is old silicon (on intel ark site check ddr5 speed is 4800, not 5600 for new silicon).","my personal view here not buy â€œnewâ€ chip, maybe go with 12400f or something used",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all thatâ€™s changed chipset-wise is b760 replaces 4x chipset-based pcie 3.0 lanes with 4.0 lanes.,thatâ€™s literally it.,"motherboard designs may have differences, like less crappy vrms or more pcie 5.0 support, but thatâ€™s not due specifically to anything chipset-related, and is more market-related.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can try seeing if xtu lets you turn down the power limits.,"i faced a similar issue, my laptop would always instantly thermal throttle and turn into a jet engine when i launched any game, till i turned the power limit down from 85w.","that was with 11th gen, not sure if 12th makes a difference.","for me, i just took both the short term and long term power limits to the 65-45 range.","if you want it in p-series range, youâ€™d want to put it 45~ long term, 30~ short term.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if u dont what you're talking about just dont write anything,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"looking at that, youâ€™re hitting package power limit, meaning your cpu wants to use more than 265 watts.",you might be able to help with this by trying to undervolt a bit.,"i also note that when you took the screenshot, power usage was lower than 265 watts, frequency was down, and â€œia limit reasonsâ€ indicated yes - you might want to expand that to see what the reason is.","also, check to see if you have windows power mode set to best performance.",this can help with not-in-focus window performance issues.,"https://imgur.com/a/ubiogvt

not at all pointless...case or no case you can only cool a cpu to ambient.,this is moving the hot air away from the cpu and therefore serving its function.,personally i'd have it set across the bottom to move the heat from the gpu before it radiates up but that's my only qualm with it tbh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there is a whole thread about problems with the kit in r/ewkb a year ago started by  u/polski03.,i don't know where or when you got the kit.,but ekwb is out of stock and doesn't expect any until march.,i have my ek aio 360 installed on lga1151 and just ordered the kit from newegg for a future build.,read through the thread.,some people got it working using the backplate from the kit and the old hardware from the 1151 kit.,also reach out to ewkb help.,they have been extremely responsive but with a 8-10 hour time difference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
something is definitely wrong i have same cpu and cooler and my temps when gaming are 60-70,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i know this seems like a stupid answer but check and see if your cooler had a plastic peel on the cold plate, and see if your thermal paste spread adequately covers the cpu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is your pump running at 100% speed?,i got the problem that my pump only runs at 800rpm untill my pc if fully booted and the software is loaded even tho the pump is set to 100% in bios.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is the actual power draw during the game?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"check list if your data is good:

what tool are you using to monitor temps?",have you compared through multiple tools?,ran any benchmarks to check if it's really thermal throttling?,"if your data is ok, then:
check if pump and fans are running ok, try to tweak their curves

repaste with good quality thermal compound.",make sure to cover the whole plate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
check if you have your aio pump working properly.,you can also try limiting the power draw from bios and that would help keep the processor cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i bought a prebuilt pc with a 13700k recently with similar temps.,turned out they hadn't plugged the aio pump in on both motherboard sockets.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you using the thermalright contact frame?,watch gamers nexus video about how little of your heatsink actually make contact without it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a 13700kf@5.5 all p cores/4.4 all e cores and 4.8 ring and i have never seen it go above 40% usage in gaming.,im usung an ek 360 aio cooler.,"85c max cinebench r23 10 minutes (32k+)

check if you removed lil plastic cover over the heat sink that touches the cpu.,if you removed it already get a refund or return it under warranty and don't mess about with a broken product.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
make sure you have the water block mounted correctly onto the cpu and that your pump is running.,"if you are not sure, check with a monitoring software like hwinfo64 and make sure you plugged the pump into the right header on your mobo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ur liquid cooler is not sufficient to cool your cpu.,i went through this exact same thing with my 5950x.,"upgraded from an old 240mm to a new 360mm, dropped 30 degrees while gaming.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bummer.,i think iâ€™ll try reapplying thermal paste.,was wondering if the cooler wasnâ€™t enough so thatâ€™s a relief,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that or the aio pump.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hm, ill try that right now.",i just reapplied thermal paste and will try this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to add to this, some power connectors are meant for a generic fan, and sometimes donâ€™t play nice with a pump so you are stuck running at a low rpm.",you could try a different plug if thatâ€™s the case,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i havenâ€™t checked power draws (sorry), but my usage was low, like around 10-20% if that sounds normal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so i reapplied thermal compoud.,similar temps.,i suspect it may be the pump - how would i know if that is running correctly or not?,"the fans on the aio are running, but bios doesn't show me rpm for the cpu pump...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thanks for this.,will reapply thermal paste for a third time but use this method - probably way way too tight the first 2 times whoops,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do not listen to this guy - i would expect a stock 13700kf with a 360mm aio to hit mid 60s to mid 70s during gaming depending on the workload.,there is no way in hell your chip is under 40c while gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lie,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you think at minimum i need a 360mm?,or can i get a more reputable 240mm?,a 360mm would mean having to change the whole case :(,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
true but i hope a brand new pump wouldnâ€™t be broken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how did you get it to run 100%?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
none of those really matter.,the only thing that causes heat is power draw.,focus on getting that number will give you the direct answer.,your cooler can handle 250w.,but if it is drawing any more than that you are going to go really close to 90c regardless.,check your power draw.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
read the manual and see if there is a connector specifically for aio pump and use that header,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you plug your aioâ€™s pump cable to the motherboardâ€™s aio pump header?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

dude 30 degrees for idle is normal.,it's not bad for your computer at all and will make zero difference.,your cpu could go up to 90/95 c under load and be fine.,don't freak out over 30 c idle.,just run some benchmarks to put it under load and if it isn't going over 100 c you're fine.,temps don't matter as much as you think.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"75c during all core load is actually a great result, stop worrying about things you do not understand and just go have fun with your system.",idle temps are not really affected by undervolting and just because a youtuber got a better result doesn't mean something's wrong with your setup.,"my 10900k used to idle at 26c during winter and 34c during summer, that's a difference of almost 10c which depends on factors you cannot control.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hey op: please donâ€™t ask for advice and then push back on *everyone* saying this is normal.,"if you want lower temps, great!",but itâ€™s going to make 0 difference and if you donâ€™t know how to do it on your own you shouldnâ€™t be messing with voltages and clock speeds; itâ€™s obvious you donâ€™t know enough about computers to do that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the cpu are insanely efficent, in idle the come down to 2w of power consumption, but like all the new cpus they are hot, your temperature are completely fine, you canâ€™t go lower than your ambient temperatureâ€¦assuming you cpu fan is spinning slow in a close case something like 6/7 degrees delta is normalâ€¦cpu generates heat even if you are doing nothingâ€¦",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seems pretty normal i run about 25-35 idle depending on whatâ€™s open.,with full load on cinebench i max out around 78 after a full run.,so this seems pretty normal.,maybe limit your power limit to 250 also.,btw iâ€™m custom water cooled with 2x360 rad and a d5 pump.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27-31 is basically ambient temperature.,it's literally colder than your internal body temperature (37 c).,"going any lower than that is very difficult, and you'll only see any temperature difference when you've got enough of a workload for the difference in wattage the cpu pulls to affect your cooler's ability to keep temps down.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s really surprising that as an video editor you were taking the video with a super shaking phone camera.,why not record the screen?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20c is 66 degrees f. that is probably colder than your room.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in that video, the white build had idle temps around 35-37c, itâ€™s perfectly normal.","idk why that black build had temps in the teens, that is actually not normal considering the cooling set up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"youâ€™re complaining about idle temps, which donâ€™t matter.",like at all.,"the only important thing is your temps under load, which are not shown.","if you really want this â€œ27 câ€ idle temp (which is completely useless btw), then its a hardware/cooling issue and not something you can solve with software.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no way people are reaching 27c under a normal condition.,you would need a custom loop with multiple rads and on top of that you need to keep the room at a fairly chilly temperature at below 70f or 21c to hit those temps at idle.,35c is actually a really good in a normal temperature room in a case.,i am not sure if your air cooling or using water either.,generally to get any lower than that you would need to look at going with a custom loop though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

put your power profile to balanced and see if it's lower.,also you don't know this guy's ambient room temperature.,idle really doesn't matter at all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is no way he is getting those kind of idle temps unless he has an ac pointed directly at the front of the case.,you would need the room to be at or below 60f to get those kinds of temps.,most people keep the ambient temperature in the room higher than that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it wonâ€™t get damaged by a 30c idle.,also for some people they optimize for noise rather than temp for idle.,even 50c idle is ok if you have the fans set low as long as it will kick in when load is applied to hit good boost clocks.,i tune for less noise.,one of my systems idles at 42c but never goes above 65c at full load on a ryzen 3950x.,my intel 11900k box idles around 30c and it is quiet.,both at 70f ambient.,these two systems are in the same room and i leave the intel box on all the time.,intel is air cooled with a noctua and amd box is water cooled with custom loop.,intel chips are very efficient when idling.,focus on tuning temps under sustained load and making the system quiet when idle.,donâ€™t worry about idle temps as long as they are in rated spec.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"in other words, your temps are great, and a difference of 5-6 deg in the 70â€™s is insignificant",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and for the 7000 series ryzen and 13 gen intel the temps can get even higher than that, i'm pretty sure ryzen 7000 series is actually meant to go up to 95â°c as much as possible for maximum performance and only starts throttling at some 100â°+ temps, it's similar with the 13 gen but even then if you're getting around 70-80â°c under load on a new gen cpu you're doing fine",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

at 5.5 and 4.3 with unlimited power limits and 512 current.,i see 1.25v to 1.3v cinebench r23 multi core.,it maintains those frequencies without throttling or stability issues.,runs about 90c with 420 aio.,the trick is cpu lite mode.,on my msi z790 carbon it defaults to mode 9. i can run it at mode 6 stable and get those numbers.,"i score 40,200.

"i did undervolt by -10 but done nothing and the overclock i had was stable, but i recently upped it slightly too 5.9 3xcore on xtu, wasn't crashing but cinebench crashed so took the slight undervolt off and stability was regained.","but even completely stock profile it still pulls 1.45v all core and 340-350w all corse temps are good, 90 degrees all core after 5 mins peaks at 94-95. degrees.",just those watts and voltage stock got me a bit mind blown..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
somone told about this before but i encountered stability issues and performance loss.,but if it helps the longevity of the cpu i might just have to lower it.,thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it doesn't sit there for a long time no, the peak of the spikes re at 1.45v i have changed the lite load in bios to level 7 from level 9 and without stability loss or performance has brought it down to a peak of 1.37, so i think it's this setting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wow okay guess i'll just have to adapt, thanks for the reply.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can you share your offset setting?,and did you manually adjust the vcore?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is your pl1 and 2 set to?,is your iccmax the stock bios setting of 512 amps?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ye for stock settings you can definitely undervolt.,also some motherboards just tend to overvolt for no reason,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"of course you will have performance loss, but there is little performance gain from unlocked power limits.",you're talking maybe a 5% performance gain but using nearly 100w more with far more heat.,no 360mm aio can cool >300w.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is normal behavior.,"if you were truly running 1.45v for all-core load, you would immediately thermal throttle.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so i have an msi z90 carbon motherboard.,i think cpu lite load mode is a bios feature on msi boards that simplifies some of the voltage settings.,you can see an explanation of it [here](https://youtu.be/d9xef79c67w?t=3220) and a demo of the 13900k using cpu lite mode 6 instead of the default mode 9. btw there is a lot of good information in that video about overclocking the 13900k and you can see examples of what to expect.,"here is some more information about it but it's from 9th gen.

"a guy before and a commenter here suggest load line, and lowering it, it does lower watts but i lost performance and stability with oc using it before.",its a trade off really.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i see.,do you disable enhanced turbo?,i also wonder if thats the same thing as the cpu boost in the top left of the bios screen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you had to combine load line settings along with offset in order to keep things stable.,once it become unstable pump the voltage up a bit and test again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i leave enhanced turbo on auto.,do you mean the msi cpu game boost?,thatâ€™s different.,that will set voltages and different core speed offsets.,itâ€™s an auto overclocking feature.,itâ€™s not bad actually,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

get 13700k.,you can easily change its tdp (pl1&pl2) in bios and make it consume however much you like or you can oc it should you ever want it.,it will also have a better resale value - no brainer for a cheaper price now.,by default it will consume more and will be hotter though.,at idle they both will downclock to much lower than the base frequency and will consume about the same power.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and...  a z board will usually have more m.2 slots.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no do not get a 13700k, stop listening to shit advice.","you cannot adjust the necessary settings as per my flair on non z boards, you will be stuck at 100c and nothing you can do about it with a 13th gen k chip on a b series board.",then you will come back and post 'help why is my cpu running at 100c stock' like everyone else is already doing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">l

oops you are right!,just a regular pentium mmx.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just built a 13700k using air cooling and the noctua nh-u12a.,it's overclocked and not hitting max temps.,"fractal torrent compact case, 2 fractal 180mm intakes, 2 noctua 140mm intakes, 1 noctua 120mm exhaust.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"do yourself a favor, don't even try air cooling a 13700k unless you plan to power limit the hell out of it.",you're just throwing away money if you buy that chip with an insufficient cooling solution.,your case needs to accommodate at least a 240mm aio.,the only 240mm option that can handle it without power limits is the deepcool ls520.,if you have room for a 360mm then you have options.,if your case can't handle a 240mm aio and you're not willing to buy a new case then just get the 13600k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm not much of a gamer - this pc will be used mostly for photo editing.,"yea i know the 13700k is overkill for that task, but i upgrade once every 6-8 years and get the best i can afford.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
~~no.,"a 120 aio is nowhere near enough, not by a long shot.",air cooling would be much better than that.~~ you really need a 280 to 360 for a 13700k if you want semi-open power limits and donâ€™t want to throttle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
awesome!,what temps do you see during load?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for the info.,i was looking at arctic liquid freezer ii 280.  how does that compare?,and what's the preferred orientation to mount the aio?,vertically (with pipes coming out the bottom) along the front or side of the case?,or horizontally along the top of the case?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's not an aio.,it's one of the best air coolers from back in the days.,check out the link.,thanks for the info on the aio needed though!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"cinebench r23 with ram set to 5333 mhz, p cores averaged  79-88 c, highest temp was 98 c on a single core, idled about 35 c",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that cooler is extremely good.,you need to find out what aio's your case can accept and where it can be mounted.,that will pretty much be the deciding factor.,most gaming cases your options are going to be 240-360 front mounted or 240-280 top mounted.,"front mount is going to heat up your case, because the cpu is the first thing that's cooled.","all that heat is then passed into the rest of the case, bringing temps up for everything else.","personally, i don't think that's a good idea, so i went with the biggest top mount, which for my case was a 240/280.","i probably could have fit a 280mm but i was concerned about the ram clearance and the ls520 is a beast that can handle the 13700k at 240mm, so that's the direction i went and i'm extremely happy with it.",it's also relatively inexpensive and comes with rgb fans.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh, my mistake!","however, based on the age iâ€™m still going to say no, and there may not be a proper lga1700 bracket for it.","basically you need the absolute best quality air cooling for the 13700k (and even then there will be throttling with fully open power limits) and unless your cooler compares favorably with the noctua d15 (or coolers that in turn are alternates for the d15), itâ€™s probably not going to cut it.","but, if you can find a bracket and donâ€™t mind wasting some thermal paste, there no reason you canâ€™t try and sees what happens!","edit: and if youâ€™re wondering whyâ€¦ note that the 2500k was a 95w tdp cpu and uses maybe 100-110 watts while under full load (reviews back then were measuring full system power), while the 13700k can use 253w officially by itself.",thatâ€™s a lot more heat to dissipate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the added info.,i'll start searching for a suitable aio,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i play racing sims in vr.,upgraded from 8700k -> 11900k -> 13900k and saw significant improvements with both upgrades.,"now, sims are cpu heavy to begin with, and vr is similar to high fps 4k gaming, so it is a special case.",i have a 4090 and i am still cpu bound.,best to check the games you are playing.,capframex will show you cpu vs gpu load.,"look at max cpu thread, not total cpu.",getting close to the 90% while gpu is below that is the sign for cpu bottleneck.,the 3080 is still tippy-top compared to what most people are running.,i would only replace it if you have specific games that need it.,"would be surprised if that is the case for 1080p (vr is differentâ€¦)

as for 13700k vs 13900k: when both are overclocked, for gaming load (few active cores), it is more up to the silicone lottery than the sku.","true that 13900k is higher bin so better chances at a good unit, but e.g.",i ended up with a below average 13900k.,"anyhow, the difference will be 6 ghz vs 5.9 ghz on 2-3 core load.",newer system will have other advantages besides raw cpu speed.,"faster nvme is a big deal for gaming (lose those sata ssds, lol).","my z390 system didnâ€™t support s5 sleep state, i am still amazed at getting my full system back in a second.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

trident z rgb ram looks so beautiful.,i just recently upgraded to a 32gb kit from a 16gb crucial ballistix one that was also rgb.,"both are nice, but g.skill makes some of the best designed ram dimms out there in my opinion.","the 8700k is still quite capable (especially when oc'ed), but you could always go for a 13600k if you don't *need* 24 cores.","any 13th gen k-sku will *certainly* improve fps with your 3080, mostly at 1080p although 1440p/4k will be a lot smoother overall as well.",but if cost is of no consequence then definitely go all out.,i've been thinking about getting a 13600k personally but i'm happy with what i've got for now.,plus i'd also have to get a much faster gpu to get the most out of making the jump to raptor lake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
unfortunately canâ€™t say if you should upgrade or not.,i currently have a similar build and may upgrade it a 13700k or 13900k and would highly appreciate a review on the 13900k if you do upgrade to know what i can look for as a performance boost.,"from the research iâ€™ve done on it tho, the ram isnâ€™t a huge deal on the ddr5 level just get something that is trustworthy and that you like.","also will say that what i was told when asking others about the similar upgrade is that if you have problems with stuttering currently, the new cpu will help fix that a ton, but to get big bumps in fps youâ€™ll likely need a 4080 or 4090, which imo is a gigantic waste if you have a 3080 right now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"lots of people have had issues with trying to undervolt on b660, so far no one can tell why it doesn't work as well as on z series boards.",13th gen k chips on a b660 is just a huge mistake that too many people keep making.,"i've tried warning about this plenty, people reply with 'msi b660s have lite load so its fine'.",then they still have issues.,"whatever it is that intels doing with the stock voltages on these 13th gen chips, no one know.","theres also a possibility that anyone that's ran the stock volts for too long might have already degraded their chip, so it will no longer stabilize at lower volts.","some people have managed to get the 5.1 all core on 13600ks, and even 5.4 all core on 13900ks to work at just 1.1v when tuning them right out of the box and never running the stock volts.","based on my max overclock results, my 13600kf looks like a terrible bin, but it still does 5.4 all core at 1.25v on a z790.","so basically the two issues that need to be addressed with running 13th gen k chips:

"look around for some deals on older z690 boards that have bios flashback so you can update the bios without needing a 12th gen cpu, it should be much better value than getting a z790 board right now",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mate intel sent me their specification for the loadlines and msi had set them correctly.,"intels specsheet states maximum 110 for dc_ll, and for ac_ll 'same as dc_ll'.",guess what msi sets them to at default?,110 on both.,"there is also no minimum or typical values specified, only the maximum, which is being abided to.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> standart behaviour with cep enabled.,"and he is not undervolting, he is using liteload mode, which adjusts ac loadline values, which change boost voltages

i get the same behaviour as op even when i have cep disabled in the bios.",also the same behaviour whether i undervolt with an offset or adjust ac/dc loadline values.,there is literally no way to undervolt without getting a performance lost (i.e.,"clock stretching, instead of crashing) in those motherboards.",that is a problem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> it doesnt undervolt, it lowers how much boost voltage you get

the boost voltage is meant to counter vdroop.","if you don't have enough boost voltage, you get too much vdroop so you can end up effectively undervolting your chip.",adjusting ac loadline can give you the same results under load compared to just adjusting manual offsets.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"alright, thanks a bunch!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
youâ€™re not understanding what the lite load settings does.,they basically act like modifiers for the ac loadline values.,if you set the ac loadline to 110 but you also set a very aggressive setting for the *loadline calibration* (which is the same as â€œlite loadâ€) then you will be overvolting your chip.,the motherboard sets the loadline calibration/lite load setting too aggressive out of the box.,thatâ€™s not intelâ€™s fault and it also has nothing to do with â€œstock voltsâ€.,"again, just look at the vid if you want to see what voltage the chip actually wants to receive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so im guessing you are using b660 board aswell.,"well, everything i said stands, because even if you have ""disable undervolt protection"" or similar option on your board, its not doing anything.","b660 boards have cep that cannot be disabled, and its acting exactly as it should act with cep enabled, it wont let your system crash, instead performance tanks",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, never said otherwise.","but its not undervolting, its adjusting boost voltage.","you are not impacting voltage any way when cpu is idle, or doing light tasks, so efect is similar, but not the same as undervolt when you adjust whole v/f curve.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

erm that is what i said.,"the stock lite load is 12, expanding the option shows in grey that both ll settings are set to 110, which i thought must be too high.","intel sent me their spec sheet for it after ages and it says they should be 110.

"that is what iâ€™ve been guessing as well, that the â€œcepâ€ option in the bios is not actually changing anything.","when i run a benchmark in intel xtu and go to the details on the results page, i can see that undervolt protection is enabled, and i couldnâ€™t find any way to change this.",i guess intel has decided that undervolting is now a part of â€œoverclocking capabilitiesâ€ that is limited to z series boards.,or maybe the bios is just programmed incorrectly and the cep option isnâ€™t changing what itâ€™s supposed to change.,i donâ€™t have much confidence in it after finding a few spelling mistakes in the explanations of some options.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you are still not understanding, i said that the lite load effectively acts like a modifier for what the ac loadline is doing.","so if you set a ""good"" ac loadline such as 110, you can still end up overvolting if you set lite load to a setting that's too high.","lite load doesn't change the ac loadline values, you can check this in hwinfo.","no matter what setting you choose for ""lite load"", the ""ac loadline"" stays exactly the same as what is set in the bios.",">as for 'just look at the vid, i don't even know where that option would be.",it's a value you can see in hwinfo.,vid is the voltage that the cpu requests.,it does not get affected by lite load/loadline calibration/ac loadline.,"that's why i said you need to look at this if you want to know what intel's ""stock volts"" are.",this is the part that intel is responsible for.,the other stuff is the motherboard manufacturer's responsibility.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> expanding the option shows in grey that both ll settings are set to 110, which i thought must be too high.",i'm not sure why you think this.,"a higher ac loadline will give you *less* voltage, which should be exactly what you want since you have a problem with overvolting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"non-k bclk overclocking was killed, non-k i5 and i3 13th gen is still alder lake which it's crappy memory controller and 13600k has also much more cache, which makes it tons better cpu.","this is intel's new scummy upselling, as you need to know raptor lake tables about this and there's little voice about system agent (memory controller) voltage lock on locked cpus, which basically renders you unable to go higher than 3600mhz ddr4 (most of the time even that doesn't work) in gear 1 or above 6200mhz on ddr5 in gear 2.

the recent 4070ti review comes to mind.,steve has a nvidia bias despite the channels history with issues with nvidia.,so he will make an argument that rt is good enough on new amd gpus but also claim that you should only buy nvidia for rt.,similarly he will make claims about dlss being the only option despite good fsr reviews on their channel.,in one recent video he admitted that he is mad at amd but doesnâ€™t know why.,i like tim but steve is often quick to a wise crack about a company or product even if the data doesnâ€™t back it.,there are valid reasons to buy either amd or nvidia gpus depend on your budget and what features you use.,in some cases an arc makes sense too.,a review site should be able to see other peopleâ€™s reasons not just their personal preference.,tim can see where people are coming from but steve struggles.,"in general, some reviewers get so caught up in the highest performing cards that they canâ€™t remember most people donâ€™t have unlimited money.",both amd and nvidia overpriced the new generation.,intelâ€™s next gen arc cards canâ€™t come soon enough.,iâ€™d love to see more competition to get prices down.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"that title lol you ask like it was released in 2014 or somethin

anyways i'm joking but yes it's a fine card for the right price, though you will have to be aware of comparable cards and the limitations of intel graphics cards, like apis n such",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i view the arc a770 as somewhat of an investment because theyâ€™re more than likely going to be collectorâ€™s pieces in 5-10 years.,especially the 16gb model.,"other than that, i think itâ€™s a safe purchase if youâ€™re patient.","intel supports their products for a long time, unlike amd that has dropped support for gpus after only ~5 years (rip fury x, rip r9 390).",performance and vram amount is pretty good at the $350 the 16gb model is currently priced at.,"this is coming from someone than ran amd gpus from 2011-2017 though, so iâ€™m more used to dealing with dog shit drivers and other bugs lol.",remember to take care of yourself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's a good card, i have one in an older system, intel 9900ks (undervolted) z370 mb, one that supports resizable bar and it works just fine.","i use it mostly for picture and video editing, topaz video ai and handbrake/makemkv, and it also doubles up as a plex server but i have gamed on it.",it gets about 75ish% the performance of my amd 5800x3d/nvidia 3080 system.,'\*edit.,"based on 3dmark score and not actual gameplay\*'

there's a few quirks though that i hope will be sorted in the future, it idles at 48â° and draws 35 watts which compared to nvidia cards is probably double the temp and power draw, for idle at least.",msi afterburner doesn't support it yet so i hope that changes in the near future too.,"on a plus side running 3dmark timespy it never exceeds 71â° and while gaming it's usually much lower, it's also a pity you have the 'f' skew of the 12400 processor as the arc utilises the cpu gpu in some scenarios.",overall i am very happy with the arc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a770 preforms pretty well imo, obviously far off from high-end nvidia/amd but yea; i play in 4k and most games are 60+ fps at mid-high settings, including mw2



i got it like 1-2 months ago iirc, drivers have (seemingly) improved substantially in that period, went from super buggy for me to rarely encountering a driver issue",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a770 is a good gpu that is slowly getting better over time.,however either get a 6650xt/6700/xt for better performance and drivers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i replaced my 1080ti that i had bought new as a nvidia fe preorder that was dying slowly with an a770 16gb.,itâ€™s more than enough for 1440 gaming (a bit quicker than a 1080ti) for me and the only game i have had real issues with is darktide where it basically just doesnâ€™t work.,drivers have come a long way since launch so the real question is if you are ok with itâ€™s level of performance with maybe some bugs here and there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you could do worse for the price.,"it's terrible with older titles (dx10 or under), but does okay with dx11 and dx12.","drivers are still quite unfinished, so the card is very much still a work in progress.","some stuff will run fine, other things will run like ass, or have lot of graphical glitches or issues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

compared to the competition?,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a770 plays really well on games with dx12 and vulkan from what i read.,"like, 50% increased fps over a 3060. however, on dx11 and lower there's a fps penalty.",buy from a place that'll let you return it if you don't like it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on what youâ€™re trying to do with it.,my dad bought one to replace his rtx 2060 (rtx 2060 is now a hand me down part) and with davinci resolve it didnâ€™t want to render properly.,it rendered â€œproperlyâ€ but was constantly flickering and would give someone a seizure iâ€™m sure.,"could be fixed with a driver update and most likely will, but who knows how long or short of a wait that could be.",but gaming performance was amazing.,so it depends on what youâ€™re using it for.,"may have some other hitches as well, being the first public gpu intel has released.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a lot of the major deal breaking issues are gone now, so itâ€™s not as bad of a pick as it was at launch.","the being said, itâ€™s performance per dollar ratio still is lacking compared to the 6600xt and 6650xt.","so unless youâ€™re willing to put up with the caveats with the hope that it might reach 3070 like performance in the future, probably go amd.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you run aaa titles on dx12 or vulkan, itâ€™ll be a really good card (equivalent to 3060 ti in raster & 3070 in rt performance).","if you run a lot of older or niche titles that run dx9, dx10 or dx11 youâ€™re not going to have a great experience.","also a cpu that supports rebar is basically a requirement, without that donâ€™t bother.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"itâ€™s an interesting product, but itâ€™s unfinished and so underperforms.","just get an rx 6650 xt, youâ€™ll get better performance across the board, peaking at 15-20% in 1080p and declining as resolution increases.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

battlemage is rumored to be coming in 2023...so my answer is no assuming the rumors are true.,"i think it's fine for 1080p gaming, but you'll want to wait for battlemage for proper 1440 from intel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it is serviceable but if you are wanting absolute best for the money at that price, the 6650xt is the way to go.",i am using one and it has done ok in most titles but have had titles it does worse than a gtx 970(mostly older stuff),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
of cource not,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"itll be a sweet card, but as its fairly new so dont expect very game to work perfectly.",this will be fixed in driver updates and performance will also improve to varying degrees throughout the driver updates.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would go with a rx 6650 xt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think its a fantastic little gpu.,i would buy it again if i had to shop for another build.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i will personally add that intel arc is pretty lit if you use it on linux thanks to that it's the same driver as in the integrated graphics which is open source, so community adds to the efforts of patching it (plus what has been patched in the past already).",i haven't played many games on it (a770) yet as what i play is mainly risk of rain 2. worked better than on rx580 for me personally.,"on the older side of stuff i played a few levels in painkiller, no problems either.",i leave this here just so you know it's an option though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the hardware is good, especially the 16gb vram.","for gaming only, performance is solid and it's good value, apart from some crashes still.","however for any sort of professional work, arc is unusable.","driver bugs make it crash all the time in opencl workloads, taking the entire pc and unsaved files down with it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

maybe card is good ... but there are some problems with games as card is new.,some games crashes.,i assume we need to wait some time until game developers will test this card.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for what i've seen it performs really good in a handful of new games, while exponentially worse in older games.","if you only play dx12 titles i wouldn't be too worried, however if you wanted more consistentcy a 6600xt/6650xt would probably be a better pick",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

usually these come later as intel doesnâ€™t always seed these â€˜interimâ€™ chips to reviewers.,unfortunately.,at some point weâ€™ll see them from the big tubers and sites after they run slow on content or discover others reviewing them and getting clicks :).,iâ€™m really curious how 12400 â€”> 13400 â€”> 13500 â€”> 13600 (non-k) scaling goes with respect to apps and games.,"slowly increasing cache, clock speeds, and more e-cores should be interesting..   iâ€™d also like to see these all compared to 12600k.",wouldnâ€™t mind a 12700/f for reference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because there were no review samples.,there are some reviews out there of people with retail units.,"13400f is a very good value choice, its just a slightly lower clocked 12600k.","13400 and 13500 is only like 10-20$ difference but most people wouldnt really make use of the extra 4 e-cores, either option is a good pick.",13600 is kinda pointless.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

they are all shit and intel quietly released them with no review samples.,they suck and you shouldn't buy any of them really.,the best of the 13th gen non k chips are just 12th gen chips with a few mhz higher clocks.,the worst have cache sizes so small they will suck for gaming.,plus a lot of them are just alder lake anyways.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

read my post again.,"obviously the 12600k and 13400 get almost the same result, they are  the same chip.",the issue is that the 13400 can't even remotely justify the 40% price difference compared to the 12400 by its meager performance increase.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is normal.,at stock the 13900k needs at least 290w to reach 40k+ scores in cb23 on my gigabyte board with very mild llc auto defaults.,at this point single cores start to throttle due to hitting the 100â°c limit.,using a 253w power limit results in cb23 scores around 36-37k with an otherwise stock cpu/bios.,you need to undervolt to lower power and temps.,"cb23 is stable down to about 230w for my cpu, but due to other load situations my current daily is about 240-245w for 40k+ while using a 253w power limit to keep unrealistic prime95 load in check/stable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most likely thermal throttling even with mce off.,the cpu prob down clock at 90c while with mce on the cpu downclock at 100c so you got a bit more performance but not much.,i would suggest going into bios to do a quick negative voltage offset of 0.09-0.1v so your pc could stay under thermal throttle limit and therefore sustain higher clock/performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gonna need a lot more info on your setup.,"like the other guy said, you're probably throttling due to an insufficient cooling solution.",that ends up being the reason like 95% of the time.,that chip runs hot so you need a beast of an aio to tame it if you aren't setting power limits.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

reverse the fans on the radiator to pull cool air in from the front and exhaust warm air out the back.,currently you have air blowing out the front and the back so not a lot of fresh air coming in.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
biggest problem is that it seems like your pump is the highest point in the system.,"this means air is going to be trapped in the pump, significantly decreasing cooling efficiency.","ideally you would mount the radiator on top, or if it has to stay on the front, move it higher.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thank you all for the replies!,i was able to lower my temps tremendously by reversing the fans on my radiator!,"had a feeling i did it wrong, so nice of you guys to confirm it haha.","i also moved the radiator up a bit, but didnâ€™t seem to change temps that much.",but my currents temps while gaming are great compared to how they used to be.,seems to hover at 55c while gaming now as to before which was around 98c ish.,thanks again!,will be looking at getting a better case where i could fit my radiator on top and has more airflow.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
u/modest_wraith i would also flip your rad 180 degrees if you can so the hoses are on the bottom.,not necessary just better arguably.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gotcha!,i thought i had installed it incorrectly.,should i remove the front black piece to get more air as well or would that do harm since no filter would be there?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, this.",the best orientation of your aio in the case you have to maximize cooling potential is top mounted as exhaust.,you want to have air moving through the case in one direction.,since you have a mid-size case there will be less room for all the components and heat will build up so you want to get the heat out.,best way is through the top and rear.,that way you're drawing cool air into the case from the front and pushing all the hot air from the radiator and graphics card out the top and top/back.,you'll have to add one or two more fans in the front.,"if you can't afford more fans, get a screwdriver and turn the radiator fans around so they're pulling air into the case.","as someone else mentioned, right now your airflow is schizophrenic",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hey!,do you mean mount the radiator on top of the case or something else?,sorry haha,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
leave the front on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no keep it in the same spot but have the hoses on the bottom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"mounting the radiator on the top is the best possible position, you want the pump to be the lowest element in the cooling system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i don't know what specific case this is but if there is a spot at the top to mount the radiator, putting it there with the fans exhausting air would be a better choice not just for radiator/tubes/pump orientation but also because the front panel here doesn't have great airflow.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is a bad advice.,he has it installed the correct way.,"op, something is off.",check if the pump is working.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i wish i could, but it would be blocked by some of the mother board and the cpu, but i did turn the fans around as suggested and it decreased my temperature tremendously, it went from 90-98 to 55-65 while playing games",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lmao what are you talking about?,you want to keep the air away from the hoses so by having them at the top the air will naturally rise to the top and air will pass through the block when the hoses are like that.,if you have them at the bottom the natural air in the loop stays in the rad and out of the loop easier so that only liquid flows across the block.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are mistaken.,"the way it is oriented here can lead to air making its way to the pump which can shorten the pump lifespan, reduce cooling performance, and cause ""gurgling"" sounds.","with the tubes at the top, air that rises to the top of the radiator can get into the tubes.","ideally, you'd want the radiator at the top of the case.","if it can't, you'd want to flip the radiator here so the tubes are at the bottom, so air builds up at the non-tube end of the radiator.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just because you see brands advertising it in the incorrect orientation doesnâ€™t mean that you have to be a dummy too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hose coming from the radiator has to be in higher position than the pump/block.,please stop with your nonsense.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your right !,i did that mistake too and bubles!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that literally doesnâ€™t even make sense.,the pump can move liquid regardless of the position of the hoses and regardless of the orientation it will always be harder to move it on one side of the loop.,the only thing you do by having the hoses how op has it right now is allowing air to move through the loop and onto the block making the cooler less efficient.,hereâ€™s a link so you can understand why weâ€™re saying this.,https://youtu.be/bbgomv195sk,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the video agrees what i'm saying lmao.,jayz2 cents also explains this.,the block should always be below where the hoses come from the radiator.,"i think u got things mixed up, get it together.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
he literally says the best two best orientations would be top mounted or front mounted with hoses at the bottom.,you have to be trolling at this point or you didnâ€™t watch the whole video ðÿ˜‚ iâ€™m not gonna argue with you when the visualized tests show exactly what iâ€™m telling you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
- 12100 is 1658/8443 r23.,"- 13100 is 1716/8812

not really.,"for example in gaming, the 12600k outperforms the 10900k in pretty much everything despite having lower multicore performance.","even when all the cores are being utilized, the higher per core performance still beats the more weaker cores performance.","same happens with 12100 vs 11400, i'll see if i can find any reviews / benchmarks to confirm that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the 12400/12100 is ran with ddr5 of various speeds.",so it really depends on the game.,mount and blade 2 and cp2077 are the games i've recently played that scale really well with cores at least up to 8/16.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"reviews have the 13100 beating the 11400 in single-core performance as to be expected, but in multi core scenarios the 11400 takes the a win.",between each their wins are negligible and results in about a \~5% difference - which would be unnoticeable imo.,"11400 is the better chip overall, but i'd still recommend the 13100 because of its upgrade path.",you'd be able to move into ddr5 and upgrading to a 13400/500 would see a very large boost in performance especially when it falls under $200.,price/performance ratio is key in this debate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5.6ghz all pcores at 1.35 is actually pretty good.,its just a very hot cpu.,turn it down to 5.5ghz 1.3 or something and leave it alone.,these arnt your grandads pcores.,these are very quick at 5.5. what i have done is i limit my cpu to 90 degrees.,"that way, when i'm gaming im always at 5.5ghz and when some random thing happens to hit my cpu hard for some reason its at 5ghz or something

long gone are the days of 1000mhz overclocks.,5.7 all core on p cores is pretty much the limit on the 13700k.,but honestly there's very little need to overclock it anyway since it's an incredibly powerful chip.,a couple days ago i set a top 500 world record (at least for now) on mine at 5.65/4.4.,"despite my aio being able to handle it while keeping the temps below 90â°c, i have no plans on leaving it there because i have no need to.","especially if you're throttling, you need to undervolt and set a power limit.",or get a better aio.,or maybe all of the above.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
look at the cpu power draw.,if you are hitting over 250w there is no aio or custom loop with room temperature water that can keep it from hitting 100c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yah you pretty much can barely overclock these on aio coolers now.,you might get 200-300mhz out of them but you'll be sitting right at the thermal limit.,i opted to keep my 13700k at stock clocks and undervolt it.,i'd rather have lower power draw & thermals than trying to get it to 5.6ghz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"just a heads up, for anyone using raptor lake experiencing the ""inaccessible\_boot\_device"" bsod this can easily be resolved by removing the driver .inf

when the automatic repair menu comes up after 3 reboots go to troubleshoot-advanced options-command prompt

find your windows drive by typing

c: (enter)

dir (enter)

keep trying different drive letters until you find your drive e.g

d: (enter)

dir (enter)

once you've found your windows drive letter (in my case it was c) type the following

dism /image:(your windows drive letter):\\ /get-drivers /format:table (enter)

in the list you will find a driver with

published name: oem(a number).inf

original file name: raptorlakesystem.inf

take note of the published name.","in my case it was oem40.inf

then scroll back to the bottom and type, substituting your drive letter and driver name

dism /image:c:\\ /remove-driver /driver:oem40.inf (enter) exit (enter)

then hit ""exit and continue to windows 10/11"" button

once back in windows, proceed to uninstall the chipset driver and reinstall the last working version (v10.1.19222.8341) until they apply a fix",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is there any way to restore the first nvme slot?,it really sucks only have two dimms slots and one of them is bricked at the moment.,i just got a new z790 apex board and naturally installed the newest drivers for everything and then fell victim to this.... currently i have my samsung nvme in the second lane.,it would be nice to put it back under the better cooled nvme slot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so i tested in bf2042.,and before i used to get anywhere from 170-200w on the cpu package during gameplay.,"&#x200b;

after chipset drivers i was getting anywhere from 175-201w.",with 201w being the highest it reached.,so it looks like its the same to me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s possible.,let me do some testing in hwinfo and iâ€™ll get back to you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah, with multi-threaded loads newer cpus use a lot of power, including zen 4 as well.","* first of all, make sure the cooler is properly seated and screwed in.",* make sure you have enough intake airflow and atleast one proper exhaust.,"liquid cooling radiators tend to block airflow, so exhaust may be a problem.","remember that if you have a dgpu, that also needs sufficient intake airflow.","so, if your case supports 3 fans at the front for example, populating all 3 with fans is a good idea and will help with idle and highest load temps.",* consider the use of liquid metal tim.,"risky, but with this kind of hot stuff, might have to become the norm.","depends a lot on your cooler though, do some research before you go down this route.","* you may live in a place with higher ambient temps like i do, so in that case your cooling needs to be beefier.","more intake air, cooler air (like running the ac) and probably better liquid cooling/air cooling with high performance thermal paste may be required to deal with hotter temps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes it is unfortunately.,"intel upped the threshold for their cpus with the 12th gen to 100c, not that you want it to stay there long.",lots of stories about the cpu warping.,"i have a custom loop with 2 360mm radiators and during extreme workloads and continuous use, it runs at a cool 80 c and up.",i've never seen it go past 85 c but they are hot mommas.,"using the ""enhanced multicore"" state is also very hard on it.","gigabyte has an ""instant 6ghz"" setting that cranks up the best 2 p-cores to 60 while throttling the others and i think it disables the e-cores.",but if enable it it doesn't take long before im cracking the case open and putting a fan on it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the nh d15 can probably keep the 13600k below throttling but just be aware that you're cutting off any future upgrade path.,it's a good cooler but it's still an air cooler.,if i were you i'd just send the h100i back and get a deepcool ls520.,amazing performance and value.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have some firsthand experience.,"in the last week built two systems, one with a 13700k, one with a 13700kf.",in both cases i saw a 5-8 degree difference.,"both used kpx thermal paste, both used a z690 strix e wifi motherboard.",both on 360mm aios as well.,"the kf got a derbauer contact frame, and the k got a thermalright one, no difference between the two that i noticed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's the same socket and ilm.,"same issues are present with even mounting pressure on the 13th gen as were present on 12th gen.

if you think you need more thermal headroom, buy one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
must have.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got a strix -e z790 with 13900k and temp has no difference with the contact frame installed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i haven't heard of the ilm being an issue this gen. me thinks they probably fixed it, or maybe the chip is too new for the bowing to start rearing its face.",either way i would see what your temps look like before installing it.,theres a decent chance you won't need it.,99% of the overheating people are experiencing is from insufficient cooling solutions.,"i have a 13700k, don't have the contact frame and my temps are very good (relatively so, for this gen).",i also re-pasted my aio pump to make sure it had total contact from the plate to the cpu and i found no bowing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the answer - my parts are arriving in a week so i guess i'll buy contact frame and test it for myself.,"maybe i'll drop a youtube video for others, since there are literally zero videos on it...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that much i know, and your comment brings nothing more than just theory.","that's why i wanted a reliable source since people say different things about the 13th gen. some say its the same huge difference, and some say it is not.",that's why only people who actually have them can be of any use.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the bowing issue wasn't with the cpu, it's with the motherboard...  perhaps if basic manufacturing tolerances were in-play intel was able to quietly help some mainboard manufacturers adjust things for the z790 boards it could be a stealth fix to the newer boards.","however, it's not like they magically went back and fixed all of the z690/b660 boards that were already produced that people are still buying and using with their raptor lake cpu's.","it's easy to check with a simple straight edge, i could see the flex by eye with an asus b660 itx board, while i had two tuf z690 boards that were perfectly flat after installing the cpu.",my gigabyte gaming x z690 ddr4 board had such screwy pressure issues before the mounting frame it had ram issues with anything running above jdec timings.,mounting frame completely corrected that issue in addition to some benefit on the cooling side.,"imho - any s1700 build should get one of the $13 thermalright mounting frames, it's a 5 minute install that may save you hours of regular or intermittent issues down the road, plus it's a cheap and easy way to improve thermals.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have a 13900kf and saw a 7 degree drop on an ek aio 360, from 98 down to 91 (when power limits are disabled).","and if you are interested, it was drawing 295 watts sustained on the cinebench multi core 30 min test.","imo it's worth it, i originally got the kf so that i saved â£30 which i invested in a contact frame",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how is it theory?,"it is literally the same socket, with the same ilm, using the same mounting, with a processor that is the same dimensions?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the issue that the contact frame solved was the unequal pressure from the ilm.,it's the same ilm.,"some say yes, some say no.",just like the 12th gen. because things vary.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm aware the bowing was caused by the motherboards, maybe that wasn't clear.",i did submit that reply half asleep.,"anyway, the reason i said try without it is because removing the ilm voids the warranty and it's potentially not even needed.",if he's okay with that then by all means go for it.,"motherboards aren't cheap anymore, so i chose to go the route that i suggested before.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not everyone agreed that it solved an issue with the 12000 series, but a meaningful enough number did.. plus reliable hardware review sites like gamers nexus put the concept to the test with positive results.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i don't see how an aib partner would have any idea that a mounting frame was used, it involves no modification to the mainboard (it uses the same screws + backplate included with the original mount) and is installed with the cpu installed in the socket, so it's fully protective of the socket pins.",the frame itself has pads on the bottom side to prevent any sort of damage to the motherboard's finish.,"my assumption is that if you did have a warranty claim on the board, you would just remove the frame and screw the two sides of the original mounting bracket in place before sending it in.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the question isnt whether you or i could do it, that im not concerned about.... but you're encouraging someone with a lesser degree of computer building skills to remove a part from the motherboard and not screw something up.","then, keep it in pristine condition and then put it back to exactly stock condition and not screw something up.","if it does go to rma, they're going to be looking for any sign of modification or neglect so they can deny it.",op should be aware of that and measure whether or not he's okay with that risk for something that will most likely have little to no impact.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you ever installed a heatsink on an am4 or am5 motherboard?,guess what you have to do?,remove 4 screws and 2 cpu cooler retention brackets (parts of the motherboard!),"before replacing the screws with mounting studs/crossbars, and then tighten them back down evenly.",i've never heard of amd or mainboard manufacturers denying warranty coverage even when boards come back missing backplates or the cooler mounting hooks.,what does the s1700 frame require?,"removing 4 screws, placing the retention bracket on the board and then screwing them right back in evenly...  there's a giant arrow on the corner of the bracket that lines up with the arrow on the cpu and no crazy combinations of hardware to sort through, unlike most cpu cooling mounting solutions.","if you can install a heatsink or aio block on an amd or intel cpu the retention bracket is of trivial difficulty, so a new builder should not find it difficult.",what data are you using to indicate that the mounting frame will likely have little to no impact?,gamers nexus is a well regarded review source and their data along with igor's lab + der8auer indicate that normalizing cpu mounting contact pressure with s1700 mainboards has a measurable impact on average and peak thermals based on 12th gen cpu testing.,"the frame is a far easier/safer method than the washer mod (or warranty killers like lapping or delidding) and in my own experience it can also improve memory compatibility/performance by normalizing contact pressure with the mainboard socket pins (this was cited in der8auer's video review of his thermal grizzly frame as well):

sounds like you might have something like multicore enhancement / game boost enabled in bios.,a 13600k that's *actually* stock won't go to 240w.,they settle around 160-180w in stress tests like that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not at all, it only uses 160w to 180w when running normal benchmarks.",you just donâ€™t understand how much power is needed for prime95 small ffts when you donâ€™t set power limits that force the cpu to clock down during that.,have you tried running it yourself?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not on a 13600k.,i have tried on my 12600k and saw around 150w at stock with pl1 and 2 at 4095w (so basically all unlocked).,"other benchmarks like ycruncher and linpack pushed it only to like 135w so i'm well aware of how stressful prime95 small ftt can be

but since i don't have a 13600k i'll have to take your word for it for now",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"maybe it's the 4 extra e cores on the 13600k, and maybe a different avx offset setting as well?","i've noticed that it doesn't clock down at all during avx workloads, it stays at 51x all core (39x for e-cores).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they're probably just disabled in the bios or through windows' advanced boot options (msconfig -> boot tab -> advanced options).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
check pins on the cpu.,if they somehow got damaged the would do it.,"if not, try a full windows factory reset, and test to see what the bios has to say about it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the cores are unlikely to have died._x000d_  
won't they be disabled?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's a setting in multiple places.,"things to check:

 **in bios**:

   * check thoroughly for an option to toggle them.",there may be several ways to do this and every bios might call it something different.,"* in a overclocking or turbo configuration menu (don't save anything, only looking for existence of options) switch it to manual mode with  individual per core overclocking/turbo configuration.","how many turbo multipliers, each corresponding to an individual core, does it allow you to set?","**in windows** (modern windows makes accessing the legacy cpl dialogs very difficult, use the run dialog (win+r) and type in exactly to access) :   

  * check `msconfig.cpl`.",there's a way to toggle cores i think in boot configuration.,* check `devmgmt.cpl` (the device manager).,"i'm not sure if it actually lists individual cores (on phone can't check myself), but if it lists even one make assumptions from there.","-  make sure no cores are ""uninstalled"" or ""disabled"".","- if there's an ""unknown devices"" dropdown with a yellow question mark, that's particularly of interest.",- right click each & go to properties.,the properties dialog has a textbox with a status message.,"it should say something like:  ""working normally"", ""failed to start"" & possibly a reason, or something else .",* download/check hwinfo64.,"- on the sensors screen, are the sensors for the other cores reporting speed & temperatures?",are any of the warning sensors red?,- on the main info screen drill into the cpu section and look it over.,"**use linux:**  
verify its a windows problem by downloading a linux live cd (ubuntu should work) to a usb device, boot it (don't install!!!","), then check it's device manager equivalent for the number of cores


**using google**:  

  * search powershell and the ways it can be used to configure aspects like this.","whatever commands it tells you about, with `powershell_ise.exe` running as admin, use the `get-whatever` equivalents to verify yours is configured correctly.","- protip, to see everything & all details available on an object, assign the output of a command to a variable, then dot into it & inspect the psobject.",it should also offer up a list of auto complete suggestions when you dot into an object.,"ex:  
         `$value = get-whatever property; `   
         `$value.psobject | fl -verbose;`  #note: fl after the pipe |  is optional but may give further insight 
  * search the registry keys that control cores & verify your registry doesn't have a fucky configuration.","- download registry-finder (not a gift registry website, you know what, i'll just link it https://registry-finder.com/).",makes it a lot easier and has a persistent changelog/edit history so you can see everything you've ever changed as well as undo specific changes - i can go back to see/undo changes i made back in 2018.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m not sure i would trust geek squad.,i would try to find someplace else if you arenâ€™t able to figure it out on your own.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
idk - pc is at best buy rn.,"geek squad said they ""died.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they said 7 cores died?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that sounds like they're scamming you to be honest.,you can easily disable cores in the bios.,if cores had physically died you wouldn't be able to load the computer period,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they booted up the pc in front of me and the only thing they did was open task manager.,only one core was active.,"even if they are scamming me, i need to upgrade anyways.","the performance has been shit for the last half year, and i didn't disable the cores myself.",could they have been automatically disabled?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no they could not, but it's literally impossible for a cpu to function with dead cores.","if anything i'd say you probably are having thermal issues, especially if your performance issues only happened within the last 6 months",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i checked the temps and they were fine.,"1 core was active, though; do all 8 need to be running for the pc to run?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, it's just astronomically unlikely that only 7 cores will die and leave 1 working.","as other commenters have said, geek squad is likely trying to defraud you by disabling cores in the bios.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what kind of cooler do you have?,if you don't want unlimited power you can turn it off by going to bios and i believe its under enhanced turbo or something along the lines of that.,youll probably lose 10-15% if you do though (not that it matters anyway.,beast of a cpu lineup this gen),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
setting cpu lite load to 5 would be a good start.,then it wonâ€™t thermal throttle and youâ€™ll get basically the same score.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
start with cpu load lite.,"i went through the weeds with an undervolt, getting maybe ~3-4 degrees off.",i knocked the cpu load lite down from 9 to 8 and immediately shaved 10 degrees off.,no longer thermally throttle on intensive tests.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
disable e-cores and disable hyperthreading.,will allow you to drop voltage significantly and reach higher clock speeds on the p-cores.,most games run better this way anyway.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as mentioned in the title, i use an ak-620.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"how much performance is this costing you in games, any idea?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what sources have you seen that prove disabling cores and ht are better for gaming?,i would love to take a look and maybe try this on my 13900kf.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ah never heard of that cooler but yeah if you want unlocked power limits id say a 240-280aio minimum for a 13600k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
none that i can detect.,my cinebench r23 score is within 100 of where it was before adjusting cpu load lite.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why the 13900 now and not the 13900k when you bought the 13700k?,but â€œis it worth itâ€?,"without any context about how the 13700k is working out for you, thatâ€™s a big â€œnoâ€!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i made a 13700k upgrade to 13900k .,i notice no difference .,2-3% increase and roughly 3-6 more fps +/- if you have money to throw away do it and sell the 13700k but if money is a factor it's not worth it imo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
from a programming stand point you'll be hard pressed to benefit any differently going from the 13700k to a 13900k.,"when it comes to running virutal machines, extra cores always help and making sure you have loads of system memory to compliment those cores is important.",it really just depends how much you plan on doing.,i am a hybrid productivity and content media creation user myself and i opt'ed for the 13700k paired with 64gigs memory and it does really well for me.,i say stick with the i7.,good luck!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
only if you need the extra cores for encoding etc.,and it will run a lot hotter than gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you are cpu bottlenecked and using the machine to make money in a way that the extra performance increases your billable output,  it might be worth it...  though have you maxed out other performance impacting areas of your machine first?if you don't have a fair bit of excess cooling capacity plan on upgrading that as well, the jump in thermal output from the 13700k to the 13900k is not trivial.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i having using the i7 for the past month and is running pretty well but i was thinking about 13900k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pretty sure he said for programming and virtual machines.......he didn't ask for gaming stats.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that would be a gigantic waste of money but if you don't mind wasting money then go for it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"he also asked if it's worth it or not, so i gave him my opinion if it was worth it not.","maybe try reading the full text rather than reading one segment of it and trolling

 i should keep the i7.,thank you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe it would be worth it if you read that he wants to to know if its worth it for programming and running virtual machines......not worth it for gaming and fps gains like you responded with.,that has nothing to do with programming and running virtual machines.,so how about you re-read what he was actually asking for......not everyone asks for gaming performance stats or recommendations.,"the right way to answer his question would be to say,"" from a programming stand point you probably wouldn't notice any performance gains but when it comes to running virtual servers/machines the additional cores the 13900k provides might help net some good gains in that area"".","that's the problem with people these days, they don't half read a damn thing and then try to justify their lopsided answer......",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>does it reach higher clocks than 13600k under long-term all-core loads?,"looking at the clocks alone will not tell very much, i'm sure the extra 2 p-cores should outweigh any small decrease in clockspeed for multithread tasks",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it depends on your workload but ive done some messing around with the 13600k myself and compared comprehensivley against 13700k (and some non k) numbers.,"if you need the extra multithreaded performance either of the i7s will be nice, but otherwise the 13600k is a cooler, more fun package.",the 13700 draws aout 219w under full load compared to only 181w on the 13600k at stock settings.,if you overclock the 13600k with a large voltage increase it can quicky reach about 230w draw.,"however, with my 13600k with no power settings or core voltage change i achieved an overclock to 5.4 ghz p-core and 4.0 ghz e core, giving better single core performance than the 5.2ghz on the 13700 non k (with no little to no meaningful temp increase).","( i did nothing more than change the max turbo ratios in the bios, this overclcok was also tested with linpack for 1.5 hours and passed)

it comes down to what makes a bigger difference for you, single thread oriented workloads like gaming that would benefit from being able to push higher clocks on the 13600k or multithreaded workloads that would benefit from 2 extra multithreaded cores.","to aid in your decision, with my current stock power overclock my cinebench r23 multithreaded scores are around 25500 +-200 points

do keep in mind that more multithreaded performance could be had by ocing the e cores higher but since i dont run many programs that need that many threads i kep them at 4.0 ghz to keep temps down",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well 12700k has 2 extra p cores over 13600k, yet it loses in both gaming and productivity..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 13600k has double the amount of e-cores, which gives it a huge boost in multithread performance.",not to mention that you are comparing it to an older gen cpu.,op's posts is only about raptor lake cpus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
go with kingston renegade.,that 980 pro is extremely overpriced.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i vote for the kingston also.,you can check out this review that also has the 980 pro as a comparison.,https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/kingston-fury-renegade/3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"get the kingston, both have a 5 year warranty, kingston is a reputable brand, it has more bandwidth and is rated for more lifetime writes(1000 vs 600), on top of it being cheaper.",this is a case of the seller hoping the samsung name will sell when there are better options.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
renegade is better than the samsung 980 even if the costs were the same.,same speed but better endurance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i haven't got the kingston fury renegade 2tb gen4x4, but i do have the samsung 980 pro 2tb gen4x4b and it is solid and now they have just brought out the 990 pro what up to 7,450 / 6,900 mb/s sequential read/write speed gen4x4, so i got that as well and they are both brilliant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"differences are minor, get the cheaper one.","heck, even a gen 3 tlc + dram ssd will be plenty fast.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you should also consider dram cache and controller the better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i bought two samsung 512gb 850 pro series for the 10 year warranty and what it could do compared to the competition despite the cost.,they were the best at the time.,still works with no issues.,whatever you choose be sure to back up your data.,gen5 is around the corner and so is directstorage api implementation.,"as with most tech, the challenge is to get the most out of them before they are hopelessly obsolete.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i recently bought my 980 pro 2tb with heatsink for $197 usd on amazon.,caught a sale.,surprised it is that much more expensive in your country.,"as for brand, samsung has never let me down in over 10 years of using the drives in my builds.",never used kingston.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
expansiver more better go buy 980 pro !,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">kingston is a reputable brand

the 2000 tbw is insane,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you canâ€™t look at the max column to determine the minimum.,"youâ€™re showing 1.20v minimumâ€¦ which, yes, is way too high.",my 12900k has recorded a minimum vcore of 0.364v when idling (like with screens off and literally nothing happening).,are you in high performance power plan or something?,"did you mess around disabling bios settings, or voltage, or run an auto overclock?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am also seeing high idle voltage...haven't touched anything just booted up.,in bios my core voltage is 1.474...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hi, i am having high idle vid too and i haven't even done any oc or changed anything as far as i know... any advise?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, high perf plan in windows.","and no, manual oc + negative voltage offset.","p-cores are stock, e-cores are overclocked by 200mhz.","all i adjusted in the bios is lowering turbo pwr limits to 310w, adjust the ecore speed and applying a negative voltage offset.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you ever figure out whatâ€™s causing the high idle voltage ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"donâ€™t use high performance, go to balanced.",it does nothing except force your cpu to needlessly burn excess power.,thereâ€™s no useful performance boost.,"after doing that, check your voltages.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, windows was changing it's performance to an ultra high performance mode (created in the first place by asus softwareðÿ¤¦â€â™‚ï¸)  once in balanced the idle voltages and power consumption is super low, like 0.8 v and 9 watts or so",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i would leave it on raid unless you really need ahci for some reason.,"if you do, a repair install is usually the easiest way to reconfigure windows.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah the array is shown as one drive, and i can successfully restore the drive image to it using acronis true image.",booting into windows is where i keep hitting the blue screen roadblock.,"for some reason, injecting the dell raid drivers during bootup is not working.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what benefits are you hoping to gain with raid?,i'm pretty sure you need to manually install the raid driver in windows.,the boot drivers are just for installation.,since you couldn't boot into windows there's no way to do it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"$800 for between 3090 and 3090 ti performance is not bad, plus it's actually available for $800.",people are upset because they wanted it to be cheaper.,"the alternative for $800 or less is the 6950 xt, which you can get for $700, but i'd rather have the 4070 ti which beats it all resolutions at raster, before you even get to ray tracing, dlss, and does it while consuming much less power.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"while it is practically the only option at $800, itâ€™s just plain not worth it to even spend that much on a gpu right now.",if you buy high end youâ€™re going to be shafted whichever way you go.,hold off or get an interim gpu would be my advice.,something like a rx 6600 should be around a quarter of the cost of a 4070 ti and performs decently.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

sure if you got a golden chip and spent a week tweeking and tuning.,and amd was actually hitting 5.0 on boost on their 9590 by shoving a fuck ton of voltage and power into their chips.,didn't mean i thought any of it was actually realistic to eventually end up in normal rigs.,we were stuck at the 4.0-4.5ghz range for a really long time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a 13900k as well.,i donâ€™t really know that the high power on the architectures are intentional.,"the smaller dies can rake more power, so why would intel brick them by limiting it?","itâ€™s an implementation choice to have them run hot at stock settings, but every flagship processor of the forever has let users give it as much power/heat as the silicon can handle for diminishing returns.","as for why one would get a ks and then run it at lower powerâ€¦ well i donâ€™t know a compelling reason to get a ks at all, but it would run faster at 90w than a lower sp 13900k would at the same power.","but if efficiency was my only consideration, i probably would have got a cheaper rocket lake die.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no argument from me about that.,i think it's clear intel is selling these as premium binning for overclocking.,most 13900k can easily hit 6 ghz without much modifying of the stock vf curve.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thatâ€™s a pleasant side effect of an undesirable limitation.,"if amd could do 5.7 ghz on the cache die ccd too, they absolutely would.",because then youâ€™d have both the cache *and* the higher clocks together.,and then tdp wouldnâ€™t be lower.,(and they might well get there with through-silicon-vias: you can put the cache die under the main die and run the connections through it with tsvs.,"since the logic die is on top, you can push clocks back up.)",itâ€™s like saying that hitting yield limitations on larger chips is a good thing because smaller chips have lower tdp.,"sure, but at the end of the day people mostly want faster chips and donâ€™t really care all that much about tdp, and itâ€™s only happening because of a side effect of a problem that everyone wishes would go away.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the 7950x3d is completely different from the p/e core approach from intel.,managing chips with cores with different levels of performance is easy.,"but zen4 3d is a completely different approach, the cores in both ccx are the same, but in one ccx they have higher frequency and in the other more cache.",determining if a task requires more cache or more frequency before running it is almost impossible and then you need to group tasks so you minimise inter ccx communication on top of that.,amd/microsoft didn't even manage to achieve the second step in the last 5 years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you again!,not too worried about paying for unused silicon in this specific case.,"i think iâ€™ve settled on the 13900ks giving highest clock speed out of the gate, and therefor still be highest performing option with power scaling, regardless of any futzing with disabling /locking cores.","(any tweaking here would yield more power savings, not necessarily more performance).","but odds high iâ€™ve got this all wrong ðÿ¤ª

>1.,"i've heard that with intel cpus (as opposed to amd) no memory training on boot is needed for ddr4/ddr5

that's wrong, any motherboard has to do some amount of memory training otherwise the system can't start, but it does that automatically, usually only on the first boot or when you change settings.",from what i know it's a particularly slow process on ryzen with ddr5 so maybe that's where you took this from.,"all you have to do is enable the automatic overclock profile (xmp) to run the ram at the advertised speed (5600 in your case), otherwise it will run at the default jdec defined speed (probably 4800).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

whether you can run your ram at 5600mt/s depends on your cpu / board.,it's likely you can since that's a fairly low speed but it's something to be aware of.,"i5 13600k (and better) can run 'up to 5600mt/s', but an i5 13500 won't.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gear isn't commands per clock.,"""gear 1 will allow the memory controller to operate at the same frequency as the system's memory (known as a 1:1 ratio), allowing for the lowest latency possible.","gear 2, on the other hand, will cut the memory controller's speed in half (2:1 ratio), compared to the system's memory frequency allowing the memory controller to operate significantly higher frequency ram.""","1t and 2t is command rate with the default being 2t as you mentioned, but 1t/2t is how many clocks the memory controller spends sending a given command to the ram.","2t means it sends it for two clock cycles, which is half rate not double rate.","basically gear 2 + 2t is halving a bunch of low level bus work, but the speed compensates for that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"got it, thank you!","you're right -  i've heard this on amd forums: they said boot time was a nightmare, and someone mentioned intel doesn't have such a problem, so i decided to double-check here.","however, as for the ""memory training"" *term as such*, i understood it (possibly incorrectly!)","not as an **integral** part of the boot process (e.g., like ignition is needed to start the engine), but rather as a **complementary/optional** process which aims to improve speeds of data exchange between ram and cpu.","looks like i was mistaken - this process runs *by itself* and nothing can be done to achieve better results (overclocking is a *different* thing of course, so - beyond the topic of this post).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

from what i understand the training is needed because the motherboard has to find a bunch of settings that can't be specified in the memory because they are also motherboard dependent (for example the rtl/iol settings).,some motherboards also go beyond that and overwrite or ignore the xmp settings for the subtimings in order to get better performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the approaches are slightly different but have the same end-goal and mostly the same performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

get the msi z790 mag tomahawk wifi ddr4.,it's a better motherboard.,i really like msi boards right now.,i've worked with the z790 edge and z790 carbon.,they are great boards.,msi gives you better components for the price.,the vrm power delivery is better on the tomahawk.,it's the standard 16 vrm design but msi is using 90a power stages and gigabyte are using 60a.,does this make a real world difference?,a little but both boards meet intel's required power delivery for operating at intel specs.,however the msi board will have the slight edge here when it comes to better power delivery.,"another quality difference is the msi z790 tomahawk has an intel network chip for wired lan, and an intel wifi chip.",the gigabyte has a realtek network chip for wired lan and an intel wifi chip.,this is again gigabyte cutting corners.,msi is giving you better components for your money.,msi is pretty good at this right now when you compare even their more expensive boards.,which is why i went with the z790 carbon rather than the asus price equivalent board.,the vrm is better on the msi.,msi is just giving you better components.,i cant speak for the $1000+ board range.,i'm sure asus does a fantastic job in that range but anything $500 and below... msi is the better buy i think.,typically i've owned gigabyte and asus boards.,the msi z790 carbon is actually my first msi board and i'm very impressed.,motherboards have gotten ridiculously overpriced and overbuilt and msi seems to giving you just a bit more for your money right now.,i mentioned i used a z790 edge as well as the carbon.,"originally i had bought the edge ddr4 version and planned to use my ddr4 ram, but i decided i would get ddr5 so i returned the board and bought the msi z790 carbon ddr5 because i liked the edge so much.",the edge is a $350 board.,the carbon is a $480.,so i ended up spending more and felt the msi was worth it.,they make nice stuff.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
expensive ddr5 wtf?,32gb kit of ddr4 costs 100$ and ddr5 costs 150$.,go buy 12400f if you're limited like that.,"at the time of february, shops might have plenty of 4070ti.",i'd suggest you stop overthinking and just save money for feb. then you might do research again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
doesn't tuf z690 come with better vrms?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is completely false.,best ddr4 setup (4133-4400mhz in gear 1) is equal in performance compared to ~7400mhz ddr5.,you would need 7600mhz and higher to beat ddr4 and this is only possible on super expensive 2 dimm motherboards.,"regular ddr5 builds with 6000-6400mhz dimms are nowhere near in terms of performance, compared to a best ddr4 build.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hey bruh, are you an msi sales [manager](https://i.gyazo.com/eb9ac39863de9b7d9bad1e5e012b1c90.png)?",i got an overdose of msi/better words.,lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
msis only drawback is they absolutely neuter the back panel io.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
vrm absolutely doesn't matter and a pro already had top class vrm.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is the biggest bull ive ever seen.,please give me your data and source because if your talking about gaming.,it depends on the game engine able to take advantage of ddr5.,if your talking about production then absolutely bullshit and the difference is big.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>msis only drawback is they absolutely neuter the back panel io.,i don't agree with this.,the gigabyte is actually pretty bad.,here's are the features of both.,"**msi z790 tomahawk** [back panel picture](https://storage-asset.msi.com/global/picture/images/mb/io/msi-mag_z790_tomahawk_wifi_ddr4-io-text.png)

* 4x usb 3.2 gen1 type a (rear)
* 4x usb 3.2 gen2 type a (rear)
* 1x usb 3.2 gen2 type c (rear)
* 1x usb 3.2 gen2x2 type c (rear)
* hdmi 2.1
* display port 1.4
* 5 audio jacks, surround sound, sub, line in, line out, mic in
* optical audio
* wi-fi / bluetooth antenna
* 2.5g lan port (intel lan)

**gigabyte z790 aorus elite.","** [back panel picture](https://www.gigabyte.com/fileupload/global/keyfeature/2204/innergigabyteimages/connectivity.jpg)

* 1 x usb type-câ® port, with usb 3.2 gen 2x2 support
* 2 x usb 3.2 gen 2 type-a ports (red)
* 3 x usb 3.2 gen 1 ports
* ***4 x*** **usb 2.0/1.1 ports**

* 1 x rj-45 port
* 1 x optical s/pdif out connector
* 2 x audio jacks
* optical audio
* wi-fi / bluetooth antenna
* 2.5g lan port (realtek lan)

so the differences are in the favor of the msi.","all of the rear usb ports on the msi are usb 3.2 even the type a ports where as 4 of the type a ports on the gigabyte are usb 2.0. also the msi has 2 usb-c ports, gigabyte has 1.

beyond that the msi has display port (v1.4) and hdmi (v2.1) video outs.",the gigabyte only has hdmi (2.0).,"the gigabyte also has only 2 audio jacks, one for mic and line out.",both have optical audio.,i think msi has the better io panel.,msi is giving you more for your money (if they are similarly priced.),it's the better board of the two.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"looks like they stepped it up with the z790 chipsets, i did a few builds with the z690 edge wifi and that thing only had like 5 usb 3.x type a ports and still had usb2 on the back panel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there you go!","thanks for the fast response, i have not overclocked the cpu yet.","i was just going to see how it performed without the overclock, but surely it doesnt need it to achieve no stutters right?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it looks like it works at x16.,ram is in the correct slots?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep i have them both at slot 1-2 which is what was suggested for dual dimm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"that sounded wrong, and it is.","manual for the z790 classified page 26 says slots 2 and 4, just like every other 12th/13th gen board.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dota 2 was the game where i noticed it a ton.,but i did benchmarks on red dead 2 last night as i completed the build and there was no stuttering to be had.,it was beyond gorgeous and sat at 60 fps the entire time (i locked it there just to test),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh!!!,i misunderstood the quick guide!!,thank you so much!,i was fucking up the ramming times,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you may try to lock fps in dota2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ahhh  are you thinking itâ€™s possibly caching the game too quickly so itâ€™s almost like a force slow down?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sort of, i was just about to say hey it fixed it, and i think it did fix the stuttering issues \~ maybe.","but as i was trying it on a more action packed first person game, r6 (don't judge, i need my daily dose of salt or i wither away).","every once in a while it would stutter there, so as i was playing i bsod'ed.","looked up the error code it lead to a slew of things, but one was to ddu the drivers for the graphics card and do a fresh install.","so while i was at it, i did the same for all of the major drivers on the pc.",put the ram in the correct orientation.... doh... and now im off to try again,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"they did mention that itâ€™s faster than the 
â€œmost popular intel chipâ€ which means nothing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love how they decided to name the y axis relative performance between 0 up to 400 like that means anything to anyone.,last time i saw one of their graphs the axises didn't even have names so i guess it's an improvement,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think what apple anyway is going for with their m series of cpu's is power efficiency over performance at all costs, so it kinda makes sense that they'd cherry pick benchmarks that would suit that narrative.",i think apple m series cpu's are quite fantastic in the innovation and performance they display with the arm instruction set and it kinda makes sense why any manufacturer in the position of apple would end up cherry picking their benchmarks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

relatively speaking this data is bullshit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the already vague graph isnâ€™t even accurate.,the right side of the blue line is at 60 watts.,the top of the blue line corresponds to a point of the grey line that is at about 137 watts.,"so isnâ€™t that 77 watts less, not 100?","and i have no idea what the dotted line is supposed to mean, because itâ€™s indicating a power level on the grey line at about 152 watts, with a performance level the m1 max is unable to achieve.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rotten apple.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the only reason apple silicon had a massive lead over intel in power efficiency was because they had a 2 node advantage over it.,now because of tsmc's stumbles that lead has been cut in half.,they can only talk about the power efficiency metric because they know for a fact intel's chips scale very well with additional power.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

most popular intel chip is probably a 6 generations old i3 plugged in into a dusty old office laptop used for microsoft word and solitaire.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
on the website for the macbook air is a comparison against intel mentioning a dual core i5.,15 times more performance with the m2 (in video editing).,not sure if that's the one from the chart but shows how ridiculous their comparison is.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just like the gtx1650 is nvidias most popular video card.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"relative to what btw

i only get 250 performance.,can i play minecraft?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this.,arm is under developed at this point and not as capable as x86 simply because itâ€™s not as wide spread.,but with apple using it and selling it (which people will ignore lower performance because brand name) it gives it the chance to develop and my guess is eventually surpass.,edit: guess i should have specified in high performance cpu settings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it is funny because the main risk of self development is trailing the market as some point due to market scale and r&d budgets.,it is going to be interesting to see if apple can follow/stay ahead of intel and amd in the long run.,history would say that it is unlikely.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

try updating intel management engine.,it helps on some z690 motherboards.,"also, since current / edp limit throttling is set to yes, you may want to check if you have current limitations in the bios vrm settings.",it may also help to update your bios since your voltage is quite high for 5ghz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

unless i turned it up enough that it was at 450 tdp that part always turned red,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i get there is changes that can be made, i'm more wondering why it's not performing stock like others.",i'm sure it could be overclocked and get there but i wanted to see if i was missing something like a bios setting first,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you know what edp throttling mean?,temperature is low 75c but always i see red colour on edp.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i didn't know that was a thing i'll take a look,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
had the same issues.,bought a i9 12900k.,was having issues with it on windows 10 and upgraded to 11 and it fixed the issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i've had zero issues with 12th gen on w10.,but i guess it depends on how people are using thier system,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's enabled and the bios had to be updated to current to run the chip,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wrong, you dont have a clue what ur talking about, these cpus work great on w10",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just for stability with vr stuff i've had issues with 11 in the past.,"also everything else is updated, i may try windows 11 again to see though!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"my initial comment got lost but i started this post because i was getting only 35,000 in cinebench",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
waste of time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel management engine updated?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you running the same cinebench version as whatever benchmark you're using for reference and did you set the xmp profile in the bios for your ram?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
try raising the current limit from intel's default 280a to 512a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the very high scores are achieved with unlimited power.,232w is fairly conservative.,that chip can go up to ~300w.,i would just ignore it.,the situations where your performance is affected even a little by this are almost nonexistent.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is there an 85c thermal limit in the bios you can increase to 100c?,it shouldnâ€™t flatten at exactly 85c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s wild these hit 85+c with a 360mm aio.,i had to go i5 for 13th gen because iâ€™m in sff and it would just thermal throttle otherwise.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's staying at 85c because it's locked to 4.9ghz.,you'd definitely be close to 98-100c if it was at 5 8ghz stock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you only need one 8pin, the second one is usually for ln2/extreme o/c.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah hard chip to not throttle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"most people have a oc on or often mobo will auto oc stock slightly to make there products look better , most moboâ€™s oc with crazy bolts to ensure stability but still not the best",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the three common reasons for power limit throttling: processor power limits pl1/pl2 is set too low in intelâ® xtu.,core voltage limit is set too low in xtu.,system doesn't have sufficient cooling and power delivery.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"it isn't a thought, 12th and 13th gen were designed/optimized for the schedular in win 11.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"don't rely on this data, it is flawed.",he left core isolation enabled on w11 and off on win 10. core isolation is known to reduce gaming performance a noticeable amount.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for gaming, it usually provides the best performance and stability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
okay i noticed that your max boost speed is locked to 50x hence the 4.94 ghz go into bios and set the all core to 55x to test.,check if it is on auto and change this to 55x.,"i had 2 bios available when i flashed the z690 motherboard i took the very latest one but there was another one which allowed the 13900k to run on the z690 but older do re check just in case


if you are using the intel xtu you can change the p cores there",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"12900ks owner here, installed on windows 10, performance was shit.",upgraded to windows 11 and the itâ€™s been nothing but gains and stability.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh yeah?,wow you must really know your stuff!,so thereâ€™s a thread director in windows 10 too?,no.,yeah it sucks.,it doesnâ€™t use right cores and causes high latency.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
happy to report the vr issues are fixed in win11 as of a few updates ago :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the cpu was designed to be used with windows 11. i'm pretty sure windows 10 can't even use the p cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ah, makes sense, i think windows 11 would help as well as selecting unlimited power and letting the motherboard auto oc the motherboard, mine got almost 41k with xmp and mce on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep one of the first things i checked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm running cinebench 23 which is what others are using.,the ram is running at xmp 6400 no issues,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm getting ~38k in cinebench with 232w pl.,i turned off mce (which was causing throttling) and have -0.060 core voltage offset.,360mm be quiet pure loop 2 fx and get around 87-92c at load.,13900k and rog strix z690-f gaming,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it goes over if i adjust some settings was just holding solid ish around there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"good to know i'll make the switch today, was only sticking with 11 because i do vr content creation and other friends have had huge issues with windows 11 compatability",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"that is why your score is low, you need to mess with settings to get the highest possible steady clocks at like 99c, not 85c.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is patently false.,the new scheduler which supports p and e core scheduling only exists in extremely limited form in windows 10. win10 straight up performs worse with 12th/13th gen... and the statement around security being worse is total hogwash.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
k. because all you said was they worked with it...without any tangible results...but its been proven that windows 11 is not required for 12th/13th gen to function at its peak capabilities.,i've not seen any thing to say otherwise.,"long story short, win 10 or 11 will work fine on 12th/13th, and is not the root cause of what the op is going through, besides we already know it is the power limit he has on his cpu thats preventing it from going beyond",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

after getting satisfied with ac i should be finding the proper value for dc loadline for actual reported voltage and power consumption, the reason why we need to find proper dc loadline value is to prevent cpu hitting power or voltage limits on the boost even though it is not receiving that voltage.","finally, to be able to find the proper value for dc i need to do trial error and try to match vid = vcore.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">system for ryzen 7000 series float around 70~80w while some results showed they can go as high as 100w during idle, whereas intel alder lake and raptor lake system could go as low as 60w.",you're probably looking at systems with a dgpu that is dominating power consumption.,i measured wall plug power consumption on the 12700k of less than 10w at the windows desktop using igpu.,"the parasitic power draw of my power supply is ~2w, so the actual active power draw of the whole system was about 6w or 7w.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i dont think thats always the case.,"atleast with b660 gigabyte and asrock i know personally, that its kinda bugged or intentionally fucked lol.","i mean, you can adjust offset values, select static, dynamic voltage, but settings often get ignored and have no effect.","i think some kind of undervoltage protection is kicking in, and there is no setting to disable it.","only way to actually lower voltages was through llc and loadline settings, but even those, on gigabyte b660 only have 5 preconfigured settings you can choose from, and cannot enter a number manually, so its far from ideal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"huananzhi b660 d4, converting to us dollars, its 83$ which is such a good value imo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i find the 13400f to be a nice sweet spot between having the extra cores and some more cache and saving the extra (60â‚¬ here) bucks to the 13500 who runs on the same main cores and just adds more small cores (who do nothing in gaming as of now)...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ahhh, i used spider man as an example for poor cpu performance you see?","thatâ€™s not the entire reason why im changing my cpu, but i get what youâ€™re trying to say",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i appreciate the feedback, another guy in this thread told the 13500 is very similar to the 12600kf, which is a â€œ?â€ to me considering it has more cores and threads.","i also kinda want 16 threads as well, must be nice for multithreaded tasks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you're doing video editing then yes, those extra cores would be a benefit.","however since those small cores are far behind ""actual"" cores, can't do hyperthreading, and have low single-core power, they're useless for 90% of tasks outside of said video editing or similar...

the 12400 offers great gaming and single-core performance for ""average"" use at a super competitive price.","the 12600k was the unlocked, higher-clocked version of the 12400 and also packs 4 ""small cores"" which meant better productivity but less pure gaming ""value""

both the 13500 and 13400 trail behind the 12600k since they're running the same core architecture and the 12600k is unlocked, clocks higher and runs with more power...

the 13400 will give you a slightly better single-core performance, than the 12400 as well as a little bit more cache for gaming and  4 of those ""small"" cores to get that multithreaded boost for productivity.",it's also not that much more expensive (over here).,"it's most comparable to a 12600k and only falls short by a bit in gaming, so regional pricing decides which chip is better value.",the 13500 runs the same main cores as the 13400f and just gets 4mb more cache (slight performance boost in some games) and another 4 small cores for a total of 8. this puts the 13500 above the 13400 in multithreaded productivity work but it's mostly useless in gaming and average tasks.,"it's also more expensive than the 13400 and a lot more expensive than the 12400 for not that much better raw gaming performance

the 12600k and 12700k get recommended because they're running the same main cores as 13400 and 13500, are usually higher clocked, and come often at reduced prices (varies regionally) for a sometimes better value.","so pure gaming value: 12400

budget value, but you really want some extra cores: 13400 or 12600k

the 13500 is at an odd place, since it's slightly better than the 13400 in gaming, but not by a lot and those extra cores are useless for most people, whilst costing closer to a 13600k, which is a true next-gen chip

again, the small cores sound nice on paper, and for productivity they can be great.","but for the average user or people who mostly game, they are not yet showing a significant benefit.",they are simply not getting addressed by games a lot since their single-core performance is too weak.,"and whilst higher numbers are more fun, even traditional  6 core cpu's like the 12400 are still going strong and won't bottleneck even some higher-end gpu's.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you realize that 13500 also has more l3 cache as well as more e cores to offload other tasks right?,both of which affects gaming performance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
literally mentioned both.,specifically when comparing it to the 13400f.,the extra e cores do absolutely nothing for gaming and even multitasking as background tasks usually are ram dependant and barely touch the cpu.,the extra cache can lead to some extra gaming performance in cpu heavy titles.,the slight difference in gaming performance mostly comes from the little bit of cache and the 200mhz higher clock.,now if that's worth over 50â‚¬ difference (where i live) for you is something only you can know.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

really?,did intel ever manage to disappoint in the past decade?,what makes you think they can stick to their timeline down to a quarter and not just allow one partner to release one batch of product just to claim they made it on time?,"i bet you anything if intel4 is launching mobile only in q4, you won't be able to buy any intel4 products anywhere but maybe one model in one or two east asian regions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which is why appleâ€™s bionic chips are so good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are the soc tile cores really meant to be used for browsing or video watching?,"rumours say it's only a dual-core config, and who knows how crappy those cores will go performance wise.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have been advocating for years that amd should put a ccx on the io die to so the ccds could be completely off unless needed.,"would drop idle power 15w easily, but either requires hardware instruction redirection (which i prefer) or really well written kernel scheduler (which microsoft will not do for amd).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fully understand!,:),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">when intel says ""based on x architecture"" it means only minor tweaks and ipc uplift <5%.","when has intel explicitly said ""based on x architecture"" for any recent core?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so basically no intel4 in 2023, in very limited availability at best just to claim the timing as usual intel practice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why do you think that i'm sure that they can stick to their timeline?,i just said that it's way too early to make any conclusions on this topic since we are just 2 weeks in to 2023,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"afaik node is different between compute and io dies, normally using a larger, less expensive node for the io.","building another compute block on an older technology would offset the power savings, as the older node would be more power hungry.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
who said any of that?,as far as intel is saying and what the leaks are saying it's going to be a mobile release on the new node.,akin to the tiger lake release before adl came out.,i don't remember tiger lake being in limited availability at all.,"it probably makes sense to do this since their mobile efficiency isn't the greatest and they can work out the kinks on intel 4. but we will see, i'm hopeful.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, but the cores on the io die don't need to be able to keep up with the ones in the ccd(s), they're just for low power usage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its not impossible but its no guarantee that your ram will work at the rated speed.,i've heard from tech reviewers that 6000 is the absolute limit and not able to go higher.,the only way is to check and see and if it doesnt boot go down to 5800mhz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
check if nzxt has a database of memory compatibility,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you will probably have to run jedec speeds for 4 sticks which means a lot of performance lost,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4 sticks is bad news.,64gb is better as 2 x 32gb modules.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"definitely not impossible, they just don't clock very well so you'll probably have to run it much lower then rated speed",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

good luck",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think this is more of an issue on new ryzen chips, 13th gen intel has a really good memory controller and according to outlets like ""hardware unboxed"" and ""gamers nexus"", it's not hard to run 4x sticks at rated speeds.","honestly, the only benefit of 13th gen intel over amd ryzan 7000 is memory stability + speed (even 12th gen was bad at that stuff on average with ddr5)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"try to get 2x32 gb sticks instead of 4. it's more expensive, but the premium you pay guarantees stability.","you will have no problem running ddr5 6000 with two sticks, but four sticks might work with a z790 chipset and 13th gen intel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they wouldn't have four slots on the motherboard if it was impossible.,"since you already have the hardware, the least you can do is try it out for yourself and see how stable the system is.",this was a bigger problem on the 12th gen than it is on the 13th gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this.,2 sticks is the ideal.,"some high end gaming motherboards only have 2 slots, so you can't even use 4 sticks.",they tend to slow you ram down.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
isn't that jedec speed?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for my z690 the jedec speed is 4800.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh right yea.,but i mean jedec goes up to 5600. the 13900k and z790 now supports 5600 officially.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sure.,but my z690 didn't.,and i doubt you'll find many that will do that well with 4 chips.,we need better quad-chip support with ddr5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you'd notice a big change going to a 13600k for sure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"in addition to the negative vcore offset, look for ac/dc loadline settings in the mobo.",try ac=35 (0.35mohm) and dc=100 (1.00mohm) for starter.,these settings lowered my steady-state vcore in cb23 to 1.13v and 75c peak temperature.,still get 30k score (13700kf).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no i literally have 1 case fan on the bottom of the case.,this thing only supports the two rad fans and one case fan.,iâ€™d like to stick with this cooler as long as possible mainly cause i donâ€™t wanna spend another $150+ on a new cooler.,i was considering just saying fuck it and buying an arctic liquid freezer ii 280mm.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

watch the gamer nexus or linus videos on this (they have the actual numbers).,the performance that nvidia claimed is nonsense.,"real world benchmarks showed that it isnâ€™t that much better then the 3080 (10-15%), even on 1440p.",4k was basically within 5%.,btw this is with rt both off and on.,also tbh who actually plays games with rt?,i played doom eternal with it on and off and doom looked better with it off but thatâ€™s just me.,power wise and core speed sure itâ€™s better but it didnâ€™t really translate to much (in some productivity benchmarks 3080 beat it especially on ones the memory bus came into play).,btw temps hit 80 pretty fast here too.,"so i will not be spending $1400 cad (double what i paid) on a 4070ti when itâ€™s not 2x as good as the 3080. im glad you got a good deal on yours, seems like you really like it!","wish you all the best with it, and enjoy!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ohhh ok sorry for misunderstanding

for that cpu, i'd give it at least (if possible) intake - 3x 120mm or 2x 280 - front and/or bottom, and then place radiator on the top, the 2 radiator fans being exhaust

with my 12700k i have 3x 140 on the front and (radiator) 3x 120 on the top, but it's a bit overkill for my cpu (however it's pretty quiet, so i don't regret)

"i agree that the marketing was nonsense, but to be fully jaded, it always is... just like the predictable outrage bandwagon that follows.","i didn't get a ""good"" deal on the 4070ti, i paid msrp at $799, but since it was only a $100 investment to sell my 3080ti and upgrade to the 4070ti i figured the performance and energy improvements merited the fairly small upgrade cost.",lets put this in a different context.,"compare the value prop of a prior gen and current intel cpu:

the intel i5/13600k is somewhere between 1 and 10% faster (mostly weighted on far cry 6 benches) than the i7/12700k, which was a ""tier"" higher  a generation ago.",they have essentially the same heat/power characteristics they currently have a similar street price (micro center) though the 12700k was $450-$500 at launch.,i have not yet seen pitchforks or torches regarding these prices.,"now, consider the geforce 4070ti vs the 3080ti...

the 4070ti is also 1-10%+ faster in all gaming benchmarks up to 1440p, where it's within margin of error of parity compared to the 3080ti @ 4k with or without rt enabled.","on average it's also faster than the 3090ti even with rt enabled up to 1440p, though it is a bit slower (5% average) at 4k and is only 2% off of the 2-tier higher card in rt gaming performance.","the 13600k does not fare so well compared to the 12900k, a prior gen cpu that is 2 tiers higher at a launch price double the 13600k (much like the 3090ti which was double the 4070ti's launch price).","using the linus tt data you cited, across all productivity tests averaged, the 4070ti is 3% overall faster than a 30**90**ti.","it does have a single productivity outlier in which the 3080 was faster, davinci resolve encoding performance, though oddly this was not mirrored in the adobe or topaz encoding/rendering tests that are also video/photo encoding tasks.","it uses 130w less power than a 3080ti to achieve those results, which means it runs at least 25-30% cooler using a similar hsf assembly.","the msrp of the 4070ti is $800 vs $1200 for the 3080ti at launch.... at retail the 3080ti is typically still more expensive than the 4070ti, though if you look at used examples you might get the 3080ti for around $100 less... which is why i've encouraged people sitting on 3080ti's to bail, soon.","there are arguments in favor of the 3090's greater vram compliment for some productivity and 4k gaming tasks when mods/texture packs are in play, but this doesn't fly with the 10-12gb equipped 3080 cards.","the current trend of basing current card msrp's on inflated mining/covid shortage numbers sucks but it's also a game like any ""asking"" price, and it's knowingly set high to protect the value of older cards still in the retail channel.","the 4070ti is not a bad card to do what i expect it was designed for which is 1440p high framerate gaming with or without rt along with decent productivity and decent 4k/rt performance.... it's terribly priced at $800 but when it inevitably creeps down to $699 and, perhaps, the msrp of the overpriced 3070ti at $599 where it should be i'd argue it actually offers a better relative value than the prior generation xx70 tier card and makes all flavors of 3080 irrelevant.","gpu pricing is a game right now, sales are at a 20 year low and will only get lower from here.. nvidia is dragging it's feet on dropping 30xx flagship card prices unlike intel who quickly adjusted it's 12xxx series cpu prices to line up with the value prop that the prior gen products offered.","it will just take time... people need to get their emotions in check and quit taking it personally, this is the retail game... if you don't want to play, sit on your wallet.",i just wouldn't sit on a 3080ti card longer than necessary right now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yup!,the case fan im using is a noctua fan and i bought some new corsair fans to replace the ones that come with cooler master (also practically doubles the cfm).,"i tried switching the rad fans to exhaust and the case fan to intake (boy was that a mistake, temps got worse).",worst case iâ€™ll probably upgrade to a nicer 280mm.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"wait, but why don't you just use 3 intake + 2 exhaust if you already have 5 fans?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sheâ€™s complicated but i love her ðÿ¥°ðÿ¥°,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the case canâ€™t support it lol.,i wish i could.,it get just has space for the rad (two fans for that) and the bottom case fan.,"yeah i chose looks over functionalityâ€¦

btw case is the lian li q58",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh.,"for such small cases, i think that heavy custom watercooling is almost a must if you want to have strong hardware and not have it overheating.","if that is not more complicated for you and just it's the looks, tbh i'd buy a bigger case, not very big, just big enough to fit at least 5 120mm fans.","i don't think another aio will fix it, it's an airflow problem.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah the plan was to custom watercool it.,"yeah if reinstalling the cooler doesnâ€™t solve it, iâ€™ll probably think about going to a fractal design torrent compact, nano, or a lian li o11d mini.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i would be surprised if the latest bioses for most boards wouldnâ€™t already support the cpu.,"although if you get crazy high sp ratings on an asus board, that would indicate it doesnâ€™t yet have official support :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think you'll be alright but check all of the logs under each new bios file and maybe check reddit for your motherboard model and others who upgraded.,"for me (12600k to 13900k on z690) asus's boards had this strange thing where you needed to update using one file before using the newest file, if you tried to just update the bios without it your first m.2 slot would become inactive and ram wouldn't run at rated speeds.","someone laid out a fix on reddit thankfully and i'm pretty positive it was just asus boards, but it's something to look into first.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you still need a bios update for different skus.,the 12900ks needed one as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah, itâ€™s not on the listâ€¦.",ahhhh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it wonâ€™t boot unless you contact msi and get a beta bios for the 13900ks.,this is what msi support told me after looking my into it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just watched the review for this as well.. it's not worth hundreds more for the tiny percent of perf you get.,"i mean.. i guess there is value of seeing the number 6 but otherwise, i would have just gotten the step down k cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

temps and package power peak in cb23 multi.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in worst case get a derbauer contact frame from thermal grizzly.,it puts proper tension so the cooler has better ihs contact,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ks is higher bin so should run at higher frequencies/lower voltages,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"+200 mhz base frequency, +400 mhz boost frequency, +2% - +10% performance on benchmarks for +28% more money",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it won't.,that's the point of the bios update.,op said elsewhere in the thread as well that he had to get the beta bios from msi to get the cpu working.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good deal.,thank you!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i am wondering the same thing....  i have a z790 carbon and the 13900ks shows up under supported cpu's for my board on msi's website.,i am still waiting on ram to arrive so i have not checked to see if it works yet or not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the ks model is different than the rest and just came out and needs a custom bios.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same exact cooler :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i have the 13900k and today is the last day i can return it so i was wondering if i should get the ks just for the hell for it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"is gotten bad reviews, where they also criticize the regular 13900k maybe i just got lucky on the silicone lottery but who knows",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m guessing if you already have an i9-13900k and even one that performs as well as the one i have is not worth upgrading.,the are selling for over 700 at amazon.,or even if you have a choice between the k and the ks i would think is not worth the extra money,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well msi themselves has sent me conflicting information.,"the support rep told me only the beta bios would work but today across the board they updated the support cpu list, but didnâ€™t release a new bios.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well your probably fine if you have a recent bios.,they updated the site today and managed to confused me yesterday with that beta bios.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

weâ€™ll stock all core for 13900k is 5.5 and i think itâ€™s the same for the ks actually,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"for $50, it might be worthwhile, yea.",it could take you from consistently below 60fps to near or at 60fps in a number of more demanding games that really just want more than 4 threads these days.,"it's obviously not a long term solution because of the still lackluster single thread performance and lack of more full cores, but could help tide you over for longer.","as for those games in particular, i wouldn't expect dead space to be *too* cpu intensive, though stalker probably will be.","i'm on a 3570k and 1070 myself, so just a small step behind you.",i get the pain....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i would say that you will gain some performance, especially in 1% lows, but from my experience, i gained like 20% with the rx580 and the 4670k with overclocking memory from 1600 to 2133mhz.",so try this route.,or sell your cpu + mb + ram while you can get a reasonable amount of money for it and spend 250$ for a 12100f + b660 + 2x8gb 3200 cl16 ram,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i ran this on a rtx 2060 and it gives about 4-5gb/s bandwidth.,rtx 3080 gave about 8gb/s.,i used intel optane 900p gen3 x4 and 980 pro gen4x4 and it didn't seem to make any difference.,those numbers are really so much higher.,i don't know if something is wrong on my end or these new gpus are that much better than even ampere at gpu decompression.,cpu is 12700k with ddr5 6000 and it really works.,cpu does nothing when running the test so that's good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what a useful benchmark for all... zero?,games we have that use this technology?,feel like we've been hearing about it for years but nothing is moving with it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"bulkloaddemo is one of the sample applications from the directstorage 1.1 sdk, it is not a benchmark by compusemble.","the screenshot in the article is also comparing a zlib result to gdeflate, the latter being nvidia's new compression format.","the results speed up as the demo runs through it's cycles, 13 gb/s for a while then 17 and 19.5gb/s all within a minute watching the test on a 4090. they say they took 5 results then averaged them, but did not say if it was the first five or if they let it run for a while first, the results i get tend to be higher after it's run 10 times, some caching going on i expect.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it shows me arc has more to offer if decompression is that good as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
though they're comparing the 7900xt to the 4080. would be fairer to compare the xt to the 4070ti or the xtx to the 4080.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there's no mention of neither what was the compression ratio or what was the ssd utilization

are you using the 1.1 benchmark?,could be a vram limitation.,everything they tested is 16 gb+.,"i ran it with a 3090 and sn850x, got 17.2 gb/s.",afterburner shows 19 gb vram usage but those numbers tend to be estimates.,https://i.imgur.com/fpr4lxg.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

can you share the download link for 1.1 pls?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just set up my 4090 and i get about same now and there is like 2x uplift going from optane 900p to 980 pro.,also looks like there is not much difference between nvme drives connected to the cpu and chipset which is good.,"so yeah its probably vram, makes sense.",right.,when i get my hands on a gen5 nvme i am going to test if running the gpu at x8 is worthwhile for using a gen5 ssd or you are better off just sticking to gen4.,hopefully somebody tests that.,that is one advantage x670e platform has.,i like to see if the storage is limiting or is it the card.,looks like it's storage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it is bloody amazing

theres no loading screens in games, like spider-man, demons souls etc.",you click start game and youre in.,"(both booting up from menu and fast travel)

but a game like rachet and clank uses the tech to instantly load a new dimension.","digital foundry made a video on it... not possible at all, on the ps4.",not all games have utilized the ssd speed though.,elden ring still has a 7 sec loading screen when you die.,(but its like twice as fast as the ps4 version iirc),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think the ps5 is just using p2p?,also they use like gnm and gnmx in the ps5 with unified memory they should be able to load faster without it anyways.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was also puzzled how so many games are so much smaller on ps5 by seemingly having better compression only on that platform.,"but i think i found my answer: they apparently handle the compression transparently for the developer as part of their ""integrated io"" api.",see: https://youtu.be/cjkx-olglzo?t=225 .,this also explains how otherwise incompetent developers like eg.,"subnautica's which is extremely bloated as they store assets and world data in tens of thousand of tiny uncompressed files, same with save files.., are so much smaller on ps5; effectively reaching the size if you were to zip the game folder.","seemingly sony put more effort into their ssd, beyond the overkill 12 channel custom controller, you also have better or easier to use software, which evidently was the right decision with all of these developers that don't know what they are doing or don't care about file size.","and besides, ps5 also has kraken which has higher ratio than zlib on xbox.","gdeflate on pc is also just disappointing in ratio and also isn't even hardware-accelerated, but only executed on shaders right now.",especially on pc that whole directstorage is too little too late and just so much wasted potential for being a new tech introduced in 2020s and the format choice likely having an impact for a long time..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
someone posted that they've been in stock for 20 mins at best buy online so it seems like scalper days are coming to an end if they've stopped their bots.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks amigo.,fingers crossed games start using this crap already.,i'm sick of waiting for slow cpu decompression bogging down load times.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it could simply be something with the design of arc similar to how arc is much more sensitive to having resizable bar enabled compared to offerings from nvidia or amd.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ps5 has custom decompression hardware sitting between the ssd and the cpu/gpu.,it normally achieves better results than directstorage...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that should keep stuttering at bay.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
stuttering on pc is not caused by loading stuff usually.,games can load stuff pretty effectively from slow storage.,itâ€™s the on-the-fly shader compilation thatâ€™s done too late in the graphics pipeline.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

turbo boost timed out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with all specs you give us we assume nothing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel processors have two speeds: the base clock, and the boost clock.","(this is a simplification but good enough to understand what's going on)

task manager says that the maximum speed of your processor is 1.1ghz - this is the base speed.","the processor is guaranteed to be able to run at the base speed forever (as long as it's cooled properly)

the 2.3ghz you saw was probably the boost speed, which is the absolute maximum speed of the processor on a single core, and is usually not achievable when at 100% cpu load.","generally, when at 100% usage the cpu will settle somewhere between base and boost speeds.","(you can check the base and boost speeds by just looking up your processor model number)

the boost speed can usually only be maintained for short periods of time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how are the temperatures?,"also, check power settings and make sure its on ""high performance"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what power profile do you use?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to clarify the advertised speed of intel cpus is usually the turbo boost frequency not the base clock.,it will boost at turbo for only a short amount of time then settle back to the base clock.,you may be able to adjust this behavior in your bios.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i use power high performance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, this is wrong.",the 13900ks is the best for overclocking.,the reason the 13900kf is higher than the 13900k is that the best 13900k cpus have been held back by intel and rebranded ks.,"a kf cpu, no matter how good an overclocker, cannot become a 13900ks, therefore some unicorn level kfs can be out there that happen to be on par with a 13900ks",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
now lets just hope they improve their gpus and we can have intel-only components.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"while the data might be true, i contend that it is irrelevant.",the margins are narrower than ever before.,"unless you are a hardcore ln2 overclocker, your 13900k\kf\ks is going to hit 5.9 or 6.0 - no matter what variant you have.",i haven't seen a single case of anyone running 6.1 daily.,"i also haven't seen any conclusion that a 13900k\kf can't hit +100hz from stock to hit 5.9, provided temps are in check.","if you want a guaranteed 6.0ghz out of the box with 0 tweaking, then the ks will do that.",everything else is within a 100mhz margin.,the fan speed and noise profiles are not worth it.,the power consumption is not worth it.,do you want 40% fan speed and 100watts or do you want 100% fan speed and 350 watts?,because that can literally be the difference between 5.8 and 6.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea this is the same with the 12900kf and 9900kf before it too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ironically 130 watts these days is not that crazy, but at the time, especially for the amount of performance you get in return, and lack of good cooling solutions, intel were even doubting that the placement in the atx standard itself could even handle that much thermal output so they made btx (or maybe it was just a cash grab).","at the time they thought that they could just keep throwing more mhz at the problem to make things faster, but they could never quite get it up to 4ghz, then when amd came out with athlon 64 which wiped the floor with very low clock speeds, they abandoned netburst entirely, and to core core duo they went back to pentium m to build off - which was more closely a derivative of of pentium iii, rather than building off pentium 4. some instruction sets had to be re-implemented.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the turbo did the opposite.,pressing turbo made it drop to the slower speed and was necessary because xt software would often be programmed and locked to processor clock speed.,basically if you ran an older xt game it could run 5x faster than it should so pressing the button would clock your processor down to run the software properly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what you could eventually do is schedule the next calculation of x + 5 for a possible next iteration while the x + 5 before is being calculated, but then you might get synchronization issues which require sync techniques like locking (mutex, semaphore, etc...) that are super expensive and will hit your multithreaded performance a lot.",there is a lot of stuff that can be ran in paralel but because of the need to synchronize memory you end up having worse performance than running the same code in a single threaded way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

id say just get the 13600k.,its a solid cpu and you just cant go wrong with it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with content creation and 3d modeling you really should spend $90 more for the 13700kf.,33% more performance cores (6 vs 8) and significantly better multicore performance than the 13600kf.,and for what you paid for the dark rock 4 you could have a deepcool ls520 aio to keep that 13700kf cool.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i would personally choose a 13600k over the 13500 or a 7700/x a budget tier down... though with access to a micro center nearby, the 12700k for $300-305 bundled with an asus z690 board for just $50 saves another $100-$150 vs the 13600k build using the same components with the same power/thermal characteristics, which probably means you can step up a gpu tier with the 12700k making it a potentially much faster gaming and/or gpu accelerated rendering station (blender, etc..)

even factoring in $150ish for a quality ddr5/6000/cl36 - 32 gb ram kit vs a slightly cheaper ddr4/3600/cl16 kit of the same capacity and brand, it's a solid foundation for an all purpose build that can also get away with inexpensive air cooling leaving more budget for gpu, storage or fun led visual elements / a premium hyte y60, lian li o11 or fractal north case, etc.","i do find the new ryzen 9 7900x an interesting option that's priced $40 higher than the 13700k, but can equal or slightly outperform it in most productivity and 1440p gaming tasks while still cutting power and heat by 1/3.","again, this cuts your cooling + power supply costs and is better suited to high performance small form factor applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i can't really afford the i7-13700kf.,and i think i can manage heavy tasks with the i5-13600kf too which i just bought.,and i already own that cpu cooler and got the lga 1700 mounting kit for free.,definitely would buy something beefier now if i was buying a new cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

â‚¬490 is actually pretty decent.,now iâ€™d just get a 13600k and be off to the races - your cooler should be more than enough for it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i like 420's over 360's just for the fact you can run quieter for the same amount of cooling.,"if a 360mm radiator is 100% area,  a 280mm is almost as big - 90.7% of the same area.",(280\*140 vs 360\*120).,a 420mm is 136.1% of the area of a 360mm.,"that's a lot more surface area to dissipate heat, and 140mm fans are usually quieter than 120mm on top of that even at the same flow.",a 420mm will be quieter at the same performance level.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"base frequency doesnâ€™t matter, itâ€™s not an actual speed the cpu will ever run (well, unless you disable boost that is, but you should never do that).",base frequency is a reference number for the minimum clock speed the cpu can do under maximum load at the tdp power.,with lower tdp the base clock has to be lower.,all power limits should be configurable so 125w or 65w doesnâ€™t matter either.,the only speed that really matters is the max speed.,and you can calculate that effect easily yourself as its effect is basically linear.,"cache is more difficult, it depends on the workload.",in general games like more cache though.,edit: there are some possible hidden differences between k and non k processors in terms of configurability of certain voltages.,this might affect practical memory speed limits.,but we donâ€™t know about that yet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

changing the power limits is explicitly not overclocking by intels definition.,basically it wonâ€™t really change your cpus behavior but it will throttle less.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
umm.. no.,explaining how the boost works is a bit complicated.,"you have three main parameters, these are in intel technical documentation called pl1, pl2 and tau.",pl1 should in standard configuration correspond to the tdp.,it is in effect the actual maximum thermal output of the cpu over time.,how it works is that the cpu can use up to pl2 amount of power as long as the average power consumption is under pl1.,when the average reaches pl1 the cpu gets limited to pl1.,this ensures the average can never go over pl1.,the average is computed using a simple ewma filter.,the decay of the filter is controlled by the time constant parameter tau.,so you can control boost length by setting longer tau but also higher pl1 or lower pl2 might make the boost longer but it depends on the workload.,clock speed is another question because different workloads use different amount of power.,in many cases the cpu can run at full boost speed while consuming less than pl1 power.,in that case it can run as fast indefinitely.,clock speeds are only limited so that the average power consumption stays under pl1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">it wonâ€™t really change your cpus behavior but it will throttle less

which makes sense - when?",specifically with turbo boost 3.0 on board.,"in games, which are not core-demanding, tb 3.0 will rise the frequency of 1-2 cores to their maximum; in multitasking *all* cores will work faster (but all - *lower* than max possible).",so where is power limit here?,"and is there a good rule of a thumb of defining its resonable borders (e.g., +10-20% from stock w)?",thank you!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what an amazing explanation - thank you mate!,"finally, this pl1 which everyone mentions, started to have total sense to me.",":-)) 

let me paraphrase what you've wrote so that i'm sure i understood everything correctly:

* o/c cpu and power boost are *different* processes, but they are connected in the sense that o/clocked cpu consumes more power \[when task itself *requires* those extra clocks of course\, so boosting o/clocked cpu's power will make it more stable
* non-o/clocked cpus can be power-boosted as well, which will **extend the time** within which execution of power-consuming tasks will be possible.",speed of execution (ghz) will stay within the factory-set limits.,"if the above is correct, could you please kindly comment on the following:

1.","*what* are (typically) those power-sucking tasks: low with data, but frequent/fast (i.e., games), or big amounts of data to be processed (i.e., converting, rendering), or smth.",different at all?,"2. does power consumption have any connection with the *number* of cores in action (i.e., single-core / multi-core tasks)?","if yes - can power boost somehow affect the work of turbo boost 3.0, and are they ""compatible"" at all?","3. is there any good rule of a thumb regarding the ""sweet spot"" of power boost (e.g., +x% on top of factory-set defaults)?",thank you!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the pl will most likely kick in when all cores are working.,the rule of thumb is basically look at what your cpu cooler can handle.,"increase by 10-20, run all core workload, check temps.",if they hit 100c go back the last 10w.,if they are not increase by 10 again,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,the cpu has a target clock which is the maximum boost clock.,it will run as close to the target speed as the power limit (and some other factors) allows.,the target clock remains the same but power limit can change with the boost algorithm.,1. heaviest are vectorized floating point tasks that are â€œembarrassingly parallelâ€.,rendering tasks such as cinebench or blender are like this but they arenâ€™t perfectly vectorized and use some time got data access.,if you want an actual maximum â€œpower virusâ€ an example would be the lucas lehmer algorithm using fft to find prime numbers (an application called prime95).,"games are relatively light on power consumption, largely because so much of the processing time is used for waiting data from memory.",you are unlikely to exceed 100w in most games.,2. each core uses power mostly independently so more cores means more power.,intel divides â€œpackage powerâ€ to â€œcore powerâ€ and â€œuncore powerâ€.,clock domains are also divided to core clocks and uncore clock.,"each core is clocked independently (mostly, the number of active cores can affect maximum boost clock) and uses power independently.","uncore is shared between cores, this includes l3 cache and the data bus handling data distribution to and from the cores.",3. not really.,intel used to use 25% years ago but that is fairly small.,most diy people put maximum possible power consumption to pl2 but most diy people also have a very big cooler.,you should test with your own cooling solution so that the cpu never overheats.,i personally have 240w pl2 and 200w pl1 in my system.,the length of tau also affects how much total heat the cooler has to dissipate in boost.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"got it, thank you a lot!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
brilliant explanation - respect!,"to finalize with power boost, am i right, that since you didn't say anything about turbo boost 3.0, i shouldn't worry about it - i just leave it on, increase my cpu power (wizely, of course - step-by-step and with proper cooling) and turbo boost 3.0 will *automatically* adapt itself to my new tdp settings?","as for the benefits of increased power, if i buy a 65w 13700, which i plan to use for office tasks and gaming, with only occasional conversion/video-rendering, makes sense to rise its power to not more than \~85-95w, as games mostly won't benefit from that, while my occasional multitasking will probably run faster.",hope this logic/plan is correct..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
turbo boost 3 adds some extra situations when the cpu can run slightly faster but in general you don't need to worry about it.,just leave it on.,i would set the power limits as high as the cooling comfortably allows.,the 13700 has a sweet spot of multithreaded efficiency somewhere around 100w.,after that it gains performance but the gains are smaller than the power increase.,so set 100w and see how hot it gets in cinebench.,you can increase power limit until you start hitting 90c.,of course unless the fan noise bothers you earlier than that.,increasing the power limit doesn't increase power consumption in gaming or office tasks so it doesn't matter in general use.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i use a h150i.,"i have done all the voltage tweaks and undervolt by -0.08. did the load lite, system agent, core voltage offset, ac\_ll and dc\_ll.","use a contact frame all these little tweaks let me run cb r23 for 10 mins, 30  mins etc for max cpu package temp of 81-82c",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah so i guess my response was because i know there's a problem and i don't want to bandate it with undervolting.,i swapped out the paste and reattach the pump more firmly and it still didn't get the job done.,i added more fans and only really see a three degree temperature change on the package.,i don't know what to do other than swap out the cooler.,what kind of motherboard are you using?,if you don't mind me asking,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ðÿ¤¯

wow.",lol.,thank you.,"crazy, if you go on youtube a lot of people are saying the same thing; especially the experts, which is you have to undervolt this chip which effectively makes it an i12900k.","if you have the ability to super cool it, then you can hit these 6 gigahertz and above numbers",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is so freaking helpful.,i just ordered artic's mx-6 thermal paste after doing research.,i'm thinking i also switch out my liquid cooler and go with an arctic freezer.,either way that forces me to open up my case and try to physically check everything.,i have tons of fans and even took high powered fans from miners (that went bankrupt and left our data center) and used those.,really only made a 3â° difference.,i plan on almost strictly playing cod on this.,have you oc'ed your ram?,mine is at a happy healthy 6800,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you couldn't be anymore wrong regarding the 13900k.,thing can draw 300 watts; thermodynamics can easily show the btu/calorie,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think you are giving bad advice here :(

@op:
most mobos try to overclock cpus even on default settings.",my board for example letâ€™s the 13900k draw 355w in default settings.,intel recommends a power limit of 253w!,"the problem that comes with that is, that you most certainly run into thermal throttling.",even with a big 420 aio or custom loop.,try to set the board to default settings and turn off all ai (over)clocking and check your temps under idle and load.,should be a lot better.,"if that doesnâ€™t help, set the power limit under load to 300w if you donâ€™t want to undervolt.",then go to back to default again and start tweaking the cpu.,iâ€™ll post my setup and process a little later when iâ€™m back at the pc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in my post i specifically said no undervolting.,the frame is tight as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that makes sense, i agree you should stay at default settings until you sort this out.","i agree with the other commenter as well to see if you can confirm your pump speed in icue, these aios should basically be running 100% pump speed at all times.","at the risk of asking a silly question, are you sure you're using the right lga 1700 mounting bracket for the cpu block?","as for my motherboard, i'm using a z790 maximus hero but i wouldn't expect that to make any meaningful differences to your temps.","are you sure your pc is actually at idle with those temps, or might there be some background processes using up cpu?",asus armoury crate was a big offender for me and was causing my cpu to get hot.,i uninstalled it entirely and had no further issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what speed setting are you using in icue and in your bios?,is icue show your pump speed when you check it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's not how that works.,undervolting doesn't make it an 12900k.,"you need voltage for stability, but if it's stable you should see no loss in performance, in fact you might see a gain from extra thermal headroom.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not every cpu has the same undervolting potential so my undervolt -offset would likely not work on your particular chipset.,undervolting takes a bit of trial and error if youâ€™d like i can guide you on how to undervolt your cpu.,also i donâ€™t mind sending you a screenshot of my settings.,iâ€™m currently not at home right now tho and will upload an imagine once iâ€™m at my computer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i only know corsairs kit not sure about arctic, they prob have one somewhere",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, just super simple vcore and multiplier tweaking here.","i'm sure i could get better results if i'd involve tvb, llc, a fixed vcore, different voltage offsets for individual cores (i have 1 core that runs hotter than the rest), and with better cooling and more testing and tweaking...   
i might be able to get get all cores stable to 58 and under 100c, but i'm happy (for the few hours i spend testing and) with 4 cores @ 58 for gaming and 56 on all cores is fast enough for everything i'm doing right now.","also i never started to play around with the e-cores, yet.",since they don't give me any benefit (yet?),and there's probably also some more upside if i'd raise the ring clock.,actually in the beginning i was happy enough to get the temperature down without overclocking.,my initial goal was only to reduce the temperature as much as possible (or at least under 80c @ 100% load)... the rest was just a bonus after i started tinkering.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"awesome, yah if i did this over again i'd go with the artic mx-6, that's some damned good paste, my shop just didn't have any at the time.","yes, my ram is oc'd xmp profile.","when running 2 sticks i am stable at 7200, with 4 sticks at 64gb i run them stable at 6600. i ended up having to use my new pc for work as well as gaming so i had to get the extra ram but if just gaming, i would have stuck with 2 dimms.",2 dimms will be much easier on cod/wz as well fyi and of course a lil faster.,i just wanted anyone else that plays cod to know the risks with some of this stuff.,you'll run into less probs with 2 dimms than 4 with what i stated above.,"in my case i had to stick with 4 for work, and had 4 stable before all this nonsense and was not willing to go backwards so i did what i did.",no regrets.... see you in al mahzra brotha!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how is that bad advice?,"i told him it has to be his ai overclock, or not putting the contact frame on correctly.",i'm idling in the 20s.,he's clearly doing something wrong and based on his replies i'm gonna stick with that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"everything cpu related should just be ""hand"" tight.",not tool tight.,too much pressure can slightly bend the cpu or motherboard resulting in weaker cooling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's what i'm saying you don't need to undervolt.,contact frame might not be proper with the correct torque,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so the pump says it's running full speed and so are the fans.,when i closed out of armory crate i was able to get into the 50s.,i'm on windows 11. i'm definitely at ai optimized using asus bios tweaking so maybe i should just limit it to intel's recommendations.,i know that will undervolt it.,i'm thinking about grabbing an arctic freezer.,i should have mentioned that i do a lot of photoshop light room and also hit film and davinci 4k video post.,when i render the videos and export them that's when i am redlining the ram and cpu so those extra bits of speed help significantly when processing renders.,the corsair cooler only came with an amd and a intel brackets.,i got it on there as tight as possible without making it impossible to loosen and take off lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pump is 2100,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">you don't need to undervolt

is bad advice because undervolting is a big plus on modern cpus.","they run cooler and you won't have thermal throttling which usually means the cpu is also faster...

cooler components also mean they last longer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think we all are agreeing; it is a paradox.,"how could i possible want to undervolt the newest/latest intel chip which, when at full speed/power is the fastest out?","yet... if you have ""traditional"" liquid coolers, even an artic freezer, you still need to tweak the chip out of the box in bios or utx and by undervolting you actually **gain** performance... wtf lol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what cooler are you using?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so you don't want people to tell you to undervolt, yet you're letting your motherboard overvolt it already?",how are we supposed to help when you don't want help?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you played around with xtu at all yet with your 13900k ?,i seen a screenshot post of someoneâ€™s xtu settings with his 13900k that managed lower temps with an overclock.,personally i didnâ€™t overclock my 13900k because i was looking for the best cooling performance and also the 13900k stock does more than what i need it to do on stock ghz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s called the lga 1700 retrofit kit on their website,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there is a faster one on the qvl, g.skill and team group 7800/cl 36 x 2 dimm if i remember correctly.",there is a 7600 cl 36 as well from both.,i just went with corsair due to my familiarity with that kit from existing and previous builds and the lower latency.,g.skill recently announced a 8000mhz which will likely be supported by those boards if not later by bios update hopefully.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no the reason i said that he doesn't need to undervolt is that he was getting upset at ppl recommending this so all i said was if you absolutely don't want to, you don't need to.",it's simple there may be some benefits in wine use cases to undervolt but it isn't necessary 100% of the time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2 simple reasons: modern mainboards run the cpus ""out of spec"" (kind of overclocked) already.",as i mentioned before my cpu was consuming 355w right out the box in turbo.,"intel's spec: ""the 13900k is rated at 125 watt tdp base power (pl1) and 253 watt turbo power (pl2)"".",more consumed power = more produced heat.,modern processors (and boards) all have a fail safe.,so the processor just doesn't die a heat related death.,"meaning: they reduce power when a certain temperature (in this case 100c) is reached, to reduce heat (thermal throttling).","and keep the die from melting... 

thermal throttling = reduced power = reduced heat = reduced speed.","&#x200b;

goal: find the sweet spot between stability and power consumption and heat production.",it's kind of like the red line limiter in your car.,"always redlining it in 1st gear (2nd, 3rd, etc) doesn't mean it's the fastest...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hmm... maybe just maybe the bast functioning 13900k grade silicon is being moved to 13900ks bin while the 13900kf silicon is all the 13900k grade silicon that has a failed igp.,i can't think of any other reason (there is no 13900ksf).,just my 2 cents.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

tell that to my 1390kf that won't even boost to 5.8ghz stock unless it wants to pull 1.5v,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i thought this was fairly common knowledge among enthusiasts / overclockers?,it's a known fact among the overclocking community at least that the kf series cpus often have the best silicon bins and hence why they're so coveted in that community over standard k series cpus for record breaking.,it's not something terribly relevant to people who aren't extreme overclockers who are trying to break world records though.,i think the largest benefit to regular users who have this knowledge is knowing that you can achieve stock clocks or higher with a better sp score while applying a rather heavy undervolt to reduce temperatures at the same time.,"this information also isn't universal though, you could go out and buy a kf cpu and wind up with lower scores than a k series cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm guessing that ***if*** the result is true at all though, that the 13900ks would only take away the best bins of the 13900k because it has an igpu, this means that the average silicon quality would be lowered for the 13900k but not the 13900kf.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what's your stock vf curve at 5800 ghz?,"mine is 1.43v at 5.8 ghz, and my p-core sp is 107. if yours can do 5.8 ghz lower than 1.43v, your sp score is higher.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the 13900ks is already posting ambient cooling results that's above what any 13900k has managed.,"unless you have an excessively well-binned 13900k(f) capable of benching cinebench r23 at 6 ghz p-cores, a new 13900ks will beat it all the time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">yes, most likely.","amd does it with their chiplets, so some unicorn ryzen 5800x have two ccds - likely just failed 5900/5950x.",my point is slightly different.. core performance between 13900k and 13900kf should be the same (f=failed integrated graphics).,the best 13900k dies are skimmed off to sell as 13900ks.,the best 13900kf dies will still be 13900kf dies as there is no 13900kfs.,so while paying 13900kf price you may get a die that is capable of 13900ks speed.. but never made it to that bin due to failed internal graphics.. so (at least for me) it's clear that when paying for 13900k grade silicon there may be some out-performing dies in the 13900kf bin that won't be there in 13900k (moved to 13900ks bin) - so maybe this explains the difference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah to be fair, i did swap the ml rgb fans out for some phanteks t30 fans.",i just pegged my bottom and top fans to 100% and it looks like it dropped my max temperatures about 10 degrees.,i expect that it could be more with a change to the fans on my radiator as well.,however of course this is with my pc deafeningly loud lol.,maybe i will just swap all the fans out for t30 fans because they are significantly quieter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

we're starting to enter the era where everything will be overkill for a while.,"the current gen is way faster than 10th gen, but most people don't realize they won't really see any noticeable difference in most cases, unless they're doing rendering or high-end gaming.",there isn't really much that can actually make use of what's currently out there.,"10th gen and up should last years at this point, so i agree.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"here is an explanation of clock stretching (copied from my own comment on one youtube video):

___

when talking about a processing unit, tasks are done by one or many instructions carried out during a clock cycle (hz).","at a very high overview level, the time of a process dictates clock speed (1/t of c).","one ghz is 1 billion hz, or 1 billion clock cycles.","clock stretching means the time to complete a cycle does not change, so your clock speed stays as is.","however, the â€œwaitâ€ signal is mixed in between and thus an effective clock speed is much lower than usual.","for example, with 3 hz, you can perform the following tasks at each hz: start the computer, log in to os, and open the browser.","with clock stretching, the sequence becomes: open the computer, â€œwaitâ€ (donâ€™t do anything), login to os.","therefore, you could not open the browser.","at the hardware level, the processing unit frequency is the same as reported by sensors, but with the â€œwaitâ€ signal from firmware, it is effectively 33% slower than reported.","with the same analogy (but not really about clock stretching), we have a 3600 â€œmhzâ€ dual data rate (ddr) ram stick, which is in fact 3600 mt/s.","meanwhile, the actual frequency is only 1800 mhz.","ddr makes 1800 effectively become 3600 using a multiplication of 2. 



there are reasons for clock stretching.","it will be different depending on contexts (e.g., software vs hardware), but here, it is for system stability.","from an engineer's perspective, any form of protection (e.g., throttling) is better than straight-up hard crashing the system.","when my 13700k clock was overstretched during an undervolting trial, even though i can run the cinebench r23 loop for the whole day, and possibly 24/7, i lost almost 10k points.",linpack was also stable up until 200+ loops but took longer time per loop.,"prime 95 errored out in the first 2 seconds for 2-3 workers, while the rest stayed strong.","in other words, my system actually became â€œfairly stableâ€ under unstable settings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a 10700k runs way cooler than a 12900k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"one hole is not, could not get it to sit completely flush",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"try resetting your bios settings, and instead apply the undervolt via intel's xtu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah that is the problem.,it was my issue before.,you can get it flush.,you have to unmount everything and flip the bracket a few times.,then apply even pressure on all 4 corners until you can mount the 4 holding screws into place.,do a 4 cross pattern.,it should slide in.,it is a tight fight but i managed.,the silicon around the mounting holes can be chipped off with no issue to the motherboard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
impossible to get all 4 of them flush by itself.,maybe i could tighten the extenders until it gets flush?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i looked for the one that wasn't fitted and got that in first.,then i screwed that in 1/4 way in.,moved onto the diagonal did it 1/4 and so on.,"if another popped out, i just redid them until i got all 4 flush.",last resort is to find maybe a nail file and work on enlarge the hole.,or you can heat the metal bracket with a hair dryer (expands the metal a bit) get all 4 in before the metal contracts (by cooling).,see if that works.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i guess i will have to remount then.,thanks.,"i will remount when i can and test again, i \*should\* be sub 90 without undervolt with that cooler.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have the same cpu except with a 4090 and just tested this at 1080p and get a 47% cpu bottleneck in plague tale.,youâ€™re going to have unstable lows when youâ€™re cpu bottlenecked like that.,increasing the resolution to 1440p dropped my bottleneck to just 4-5%.,4k eliminated it completely.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why are you playing then in 1080p when itâ€™s clearly visible that you underutilize your gpu and overuse your cpu for something both components are not made for?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i guess op can just wait forever for some board to materialize when he can just pay a little more for something today.,how much savings would he actually have for these specific high end b660 boards vs. a lower end or even mid-tier z690 anyway?,"it's a waste, if you ask me -- an effort in making things harder for no reason.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"k cpu has unlocked vccsa and pll voltages, and a slightly higher boost frequency.",performance and power draw at iso frequency should be the same.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no meaningful difference, and the idle power draw on the 12th gen is insanely low.","with ddr4, i think i managed to get the entire system power draw on the windows desktop down to 7 or 8 watts on the 12700k.",the parasitic draw of your psu is probably a much bigger factor in idle power than the exact cpu model.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you can boost those clocks for 5930k.,i used 5930k for years and switched it only to 9900k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would never suggest anyone look at the 1x ryzen series.,they are sickeningly slow at games.,even with that budget.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the reason stacked cache didnt go into alder or raptor was because these generations were already in production way before amd released the 5800x3d.,theres a theory going on that the newly announced raptor lake refresh will include more cache to compete but idk how credible that is.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
them boys gonna be hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yep, it will have hundreds of mb of l3 cache",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"adl and rpl were unlikely to come with 3dstacked cache using foveros because the base tiles (since they don't have foveros omni) would have to be basically the same size as the regular die, which would have essentially doubled the die area and increased cost drastically.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"foveros is an interposer, a technology that lets you put two chips side by side while running a lot of wires between them.","chip stacking doesn't put chips side by side, it stacks them vertically with wires directly connecting between chips.",saying you're going to stack chips with foveros is kind of like saying you're going to water cool by using a fan to blow air at a heatsink you put on the cpu.,it isn't quite understanding the concept.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"how would stack cache affect the clock speed, surely it has an effect on heat dissipation which would reduce the max boost available?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there's been a few rumours, i think from different sources, that meteor lake is cancelled.",at least for desktop.,apparently too many issues that they now think are unfixable.,"https://www.techspot.com/news/97082-intel-may-have-cancelled-meteor-lake-desktop-cpus.html

https://www.extremetech.com/computing/341788-intel-rumored-to-cancel-meteor-lake-desktop-cpus-in-favor-of-raptor-lake-refresh",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
foveros is suitable for that.,"infact, ponte vechio uses two intel 7 base tiles with foveros that incorporates cache as well as communication fabrics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
considering intel has plans to change the chipset architecture as well as their work on foveros omni and foveros direct the probability of seeing some implementation of foveros along with the stacked cache seen in lakefield to meteor lakes arent as low as it may seem.,seems theyre also working with it on their seperate die mission.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
never saw that rumor.,the closest to that rumor i saw was that emr would include more cache (l2 or l3) but not for rpl-r.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol i think next gen is gonna have to have its own enthusiast section.,"really hope meteor lake isnt ""cancelled"" not even sure what intel would replace it with",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
foveros is 3d stacking.,what you are talking about is emib.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if intel has extra cache with mtl, it would be in the base tile under the cpu tile.",it would be better for thermals than how amd puts their extra cache on top.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i assume theyd follow with wherever they put it on lakefield.,like @geddagod said hopefully it is on bottom.,hopefully a new architecture brings better thermals.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah ive heard.,rumors are rumors but i really hope thst one isnt true,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is different kind of cache and different kind of stacking.,they are stacking separate cache tile on top of a base routing tile.,that on cpu would be like l4 cache which hasn't really been considered useful for a while.,what cpus need is large very fast cache.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
foveros direct is what could be used for stacking cache.,that isn't  supposed to be coming to products for a while.,"lakefield didn't have stacked cache, it had ram on top of the cpu.",that's entirely different.,i don't see how intel changing chipset has anything to do with anything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"like i said i donâ€™t know if it has any credibility, but the reason some people thing that is because raptor lake refresh was never on the roadmap until after the x3d variants for ryzen 7000 came out",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
me neither.,a raptor lake refresh doesn't sound like it's going to be able to compete with neither zen 4x3d nor zen 5x3d next year.,but at least they'll still be competitive in mobile.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ponte vechio base cache is l3, as is the ""rambo cache"" tiles stacked on top of it.",they both are the same cache type.,"but even if it is an l4, the reason intel hasn't implemented a l4 in a while since broadwell or haswell (i forget which one was latest lol) is because they had to add the edram off the main die.",that adds a bunch of latency.,"the edram latency on broadwell is actually similar to tuned ddr4 memory latency, while also having worse bandwidth.","however if you have l4 right below the compute tile, you eliminate a bunch of that additional latency.","also also, intel had edram on skylake mobile cpus for the igpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's likely because mtl-s is delayed of cancelled,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ponte vecchio doesn't have l3 at all.,the compute tiles have l1 and then there are the separate l2 tiles.,base tile doesn't have cache and no cache is stacked.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
like i said itâ€™s just a rumor.,itâ€™s just speculation at this point,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i suggest you look at [this diagram](https://www.techpowerup.com/292250/intel-details-ponte-vecchio-accelerator-63-tiles-600-watt-tdp-and-lots-of-bandwidth) .,"they call it l3, but they call it l2 elsewhere so you might be right, could be l2.",also the base tile does have additional l2 cache.,the rambo cache does not contain all the l2 cache.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well what do you know there really is some cache on the base tile.,but the point is that the cache in ponte vecchio is implemented much more like intelâ€™s l4 cache was.,regardless of if it is on the base tile or on the rambo tiles it is on a separate chip with a slower interconnect.,"intel cannot do that with cpu l3, especially not in mobile where they have to mind power consumption.",they canâ€™t route the core interconnect bus through separate chips.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel l4 is off the die for skylake/haswell/broadwell.,on pontevechio the cache on the base tile is connected to the rambo cache tiles via foveros.,"they both are off the ""die"" but the difference is that foveros is way better at connecting two ""dies"" than whatever intel used to connect the edram to main die previously.",also intel is already running the interconnect through different tiles.,"the interconnect has to run through 3 different tiles, soc compute and graphics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"pretty much depends on what type of games you wanna play but most modern aaa titles wont be able to bottleneck 9400f with 3060 even at 4k, so you should be good for at least next 3-4 years.","the only time i noticed my 3060 getting bottleneck was while playing ms flight simulator when flying through thick forest and densely packed cities at an altitude less than 1000 feet, you can always tweak the settings and resolution in such scenarios without upgrading hardware.","you should upgrade to 13400 if and only if you wanna have the most powerful system that you can afford now else stick to 12400 which is pretty healthy cpu upgrade in itself with higher clock speed, you only get more e cores and 2000 mhz more clock speed with 13400f.","the whole intel hybrid architecture is still in nascent phase, you would have to upgrade to windows 11 to make it work as windows 10 is not meant for this new hybrid architecture, more on this :

thank you very much.,as much as i think about it i will probably just a new system built around either 12400f (very good price now) or 13400f for more performance.,i will probably drop the rtx 3060 and move straight to rtx 3060ti (or i can wait a bit more next gen).,also do you think i can use the stock cooler?,win 11 fur sure.,i dont need staying on win 10 anymore.,thank you for feedback.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i have same cpu and same aio, i also have thermal grizzly contact frame and premium thermal paste... i idle at 35-50c, so seems about right.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also turn off enhanced turbo in bios.,that will help a little to lower temps.,you can also put power limits on the pl1 and pl2 settings.,i set both of mine at 253w and i idle around 35c if my room isnâ€™t too hot (itâ€™s summer here right now) and around 60-65c in game.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a 13900k cpu paired with the corsair h150i elite lcd and use the thermal grizzly kryonaut paste.,"the cpu temps are 55-60â€™c in all aaa games under heavy load, and when using the cpu benchmark tools, they reach around 80-85â€™c.","before, i was using the noctua nt-h2 thermal paste, and temps were relatively high, touching 70â€™c in aaa games, and in benchmarking, they shoot to 100â€™c within seconds.",i hope it helps!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

understandable mine seems to stabilize at around 41c and in a demanding title such as bf2042 where cpu util is relatively high it only goes to 72c max with an average of 65c so im guessing its alright,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
will that not stop it from going to 5.8 ghz which will greatly reduce performance?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it does help a ton, thank you so much!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have a mag z790 tomahawk and ive checked online and it could be because some motherboards overclock the cpu as default?,should i try going in the bios first and checking voltage and stuff?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you do not have to use r23.,cpu under full load with an allowance of the motherboard will push itself as max as possible till it reaches thermal or voltage limits.,you may lower power limits so that r23 won't reach 100c which you run only a few times and then forget about it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

- results will vary, to a degree, based on silicon quality.","mine is a fairly modest sp97 chip, and i have not tuned its vf curve to itâ€™s most efficient offsets.","but, as my test cases with undervolting show, the performance and energy consumption curves just shift up or down, the geometry and position along the x-axis doesn't change much.","- my chip is air-cooled by a noctua nh-d15s, which is an excellent and highly performant air-cooler, but it has its limits.","there is some thermal throttling in cinebench at 253w, so the highest power points on my graph are less reliable.","for the h265 encode, i had to impute a performance value based on my much shorter cibebench runs.",- one factor that i could not isolate for is the effect of the system idle power (or the other power draws in the system other than the cpu).,the â€œplateau of peak efficiencyâ€ for your system likely shifts left or right depending on the system idle power.,"the 100w peak efficiency, for my system, is specific to it, with its high idle power.",big draws in my system come from a 4090 gpu and a mellanox 10g ethernet nic.,"- a point to note regarding undervolts; if you do power limit your chip, then you are effectively truncating the vf curve.","depending how low you go, you could undervolt more aggressively than at the high-power end of the vf curve.","(if you go very low, though, you might find the opposite for the low vf points).",i did not do this analysis with an â€œidealâ€ vf curve for every power point.,- i did this testing with ddr5 ram.,"i mention this because ddr4 ram power usage works out a bit differently, with the ~~memory controllers~~ pmic embedded in the ~~cpu~~ motherboard rather than the ram sticks.","on my ryzen system, the 3900x uses almost 20w more power when  xmp is enabled on ddr4 3200mhz ram, and that just eats away at the overall power-limited performance.",just about every all-core sustained workload you could think of would be better off giving that 20w to the cpu cores and running the ram at jedec speeds.,"with ddr5, there was almost no noticeable difference in performance or total system power usage between xmp enabled or disabled for an h265 encode.",(edit: i would need to test again using static clocks to see how xmp alters total system power and/or package power.,"but for these tests, system power was barely a few watts more for less than a 1% gain in performance which was in the noise...)
- lastly, the â€œplateau of peak efficiencyâ€ is a fairly limited and impractical use case.","very few people would use a computer like this, turning it on only do perform some long sustained workload and then turning it off when itâ€™s done.","i use my ryzen 3900x a bit like that, to do long h265 encodes at really low power... but itâ€™s super niche.",i wouldnâ€™t recommend shelling out for a 13900k and then running it at 100w in your daily driver.,although itâ€™s totally worth giving it a go and seeing if it limits your fps much in games!,most people who run their systems all day or 24/7 will prefer to chose a balance between efficiency and performance.,"where that sweet spot is depends on your workloads, priorities, and cooler capacity.","i know for me, iâ€™m probably looking at 150-180w tops, maybe even lower.",but i want to do more testing and see what actual loads i get during video editing.,"**second conclusion**  

the 13900k can achieve significant performance even if you force it to sip power, and can do even more with some undervolting.",the fact that it runs very hot at stock settings is likely a simple matter of the fact that: it can.,"if you were intel and built a chip that can take 300w to eke out a few extra percent performacne with adequate cooling, what business reason would you have for not allowing customers to do that?","and if you are a motherboard company trying to sell your motherboard, what incentive would you have to gimp intel's chip at default settings?",none.,"but the consumer buying an unlocked k-chip does have choice, as long as they are comfortable messing with the bios.","i enjoyed doing this test, and having the nice visual graph for the power/performance curve, and having a definitive answer on what the best efficiency possible is for a specific workload.","i think it's a useful tool to choose my own personal ""sweet spot"" for all-core sustained workloads.","i hope some of you find it useful too, and/or enjoyed the read.",edited: corrected a factual error regarding ddr5 ram memory controllers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wait since when did ddr5 have memory controllers on the sticks?,they only have built in vrms not memory controllers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'd love to have one of these for handbrake, seems like 100-150w would be the sweet spot",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"looks like there isn't much point in running these above 100-125w, which is the same finding i had with my 12700k",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"with the -0.100mv offset, 275w pl1/2 limit, i get 39,6xx cbr23 w/o going over 80c.","i can get to 40,xxx with a -0.075mv offset, no power limit.","peaks at 315w, and gets high 80c, maybe 91c.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my ""only good"" sample is undervolted to 240-245w for the maximum possible cinebench 23 score of 40-41k.","cb23 would be stable down to about 230w for the same score, but stability of single/low core load suffers then.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
interesting stuff.,just need to find a 13700k version of this haha.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in your first graph, is the cpu hitting the pl limit or exceeding or?","also, can i use the data in your first graph to plot an efficiency curve another way (for example, ppw vs w which is basically the same info as last plot but its intuitive for visually highlighting were in the pl spectrum the chip is most efficient)?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it appears leaving the 13900 completely stock is worth the effort (...).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks for this, i misspoke.",will try to edit.,"it is in fact the pmic that is integrated, so i can't be sure what accounts for the difference in behavior i saw from ryzen ddr4 to intel ddr5.","what i didn't try on my mobo was running a static clock with/without xmp to measure the package power and system power difference, and i should.",the jedec/xmp was the last thing i got to this week so it may have been a bit of a rush job.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice.,what cooler?,"i can only go so high, the noctua saturates and builds heat at much lower power levels.",i keep a 90 thermal limit for now that i will likely lower furtherâ€¦ even though intel says 100 is fine in this chip.,bah.,it will never get that high with 150w lol.,my board also triggers the over current limit all the time although i havenâ€™t noticed it causing a throttle.,"thereâ€™s speculation over in overclockers.net forum that there could be a bug on edp current limits, or at least that they donâ€™t behave the way wekd expect.",a lot of mobo have it disabled by default.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you use a global offset or tweak the vf curve points?,or the ac/dc loadline method that some people are using since 12th gen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
numbers will be different but i suspect very similar shape for the graphs over its power band.,"but yeah i would love to see this sort of thing become standard in review sites, even if silicon lottery shifts the curves up or down a bit, itâ€™s easy enough to make inferences about a particular sku that consumers can make informed decisions about without needing to do all their own testing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
chip was hitting the set limit or within 5 watts for each of the measured points in all the graphs.,not sure i understand what plot you are envisioning.,the â€œmost efficientâ€ spot for the chip depends on the rest of the system powering it - what my last graph shows.,"if you disregard everything but the package power, then the chip is most efficient at minuscule watts, below 30. i couldnâ€™t rest reliably that low.","i did a run at 20w, system power draw has a half watt above the idle averageâ€¦ in the margin of error",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
amdâ€™s memory controller is synced with the fabric speed.,if you use a higher mem clock the whole fabric goes faster with it which uses a lot more power.,fabric is like intelâ€™s ring bus sort of where intelâ€™s ring has its own seperate clock.,thatâ€™s what causes the power consumption increase on amd.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"gigabyte board: ac/dc load-line lowest (default/auto is 2nd lowest), cpu llc 3rd lowest (default/auto is lowest), offset -0.082v.","ad/dc is a simplified combined setting/presets with human readable settings like ""power saving"".","no vf curve, because it didn't behave the way i expected and in the end it didn't seem necessary.","at first i was afraid of idle/low load instabilities, but nothing negative showed up yet.","i might look into it again for some more per core oc (priority after undervolting), but since it's frequency based i don't expect improvements, instead my per core oc tried to find the highest possible per clock ratios within my undervoltage limits.",setting power limit is an important part of this.,"you want low power for realistic/realworld load, which cb23 belongs to.","at the same time you want full stability for unrealistic power-virus load like prime 95, but you have to lower the power limit to get that at low voltages.","the power limits will not affect your real load, because nothing is ever going to hit them anyway.","at my settings i use the ""default"" power limit of 253w for pl1 and pl2 (higher vcore = higher allowed limit for p95 and the like).","i would have to lower that for lower voltages, but since it turns out that i am already close to becoming single/low core unstable this seems like a good balance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"from what i am seeing, if you take the cb score and divide it by the ppw and then plot it against ppw, i would expect there to be a peak around the ppw that corresponds to 80w system power (around 3rd or 4th data point).",does that make sense?,"on that note, do you have ppw numbers?","alternatively, you can plot cb score/sp vs sp where sp is system power.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks, i thought this might be the case.",for my ryzen system i would need to see how the 20w in package power from the xmp impacts temps.,the other constraint i was fighting in there was a diminutive cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i donâ€™t know what i am doing wrong.,"with load line adjustments i can score 40502 at 248w, max temp is 90c, ambient 25c.","however i canâ€™t find a working global negative offset setting for my rig, crashes near the end of r23 test no matter how i set it.",i want to know which is better.,i have turbo boost set to 6ghz as well.,"runs fine when under load line settings, crashes when adjusting offset, even a -0.002 offset can make it unstable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"cb being a very synthetic workload and a very short one at that, i used a 5min 4k h265 video encode as a workload to compute performance per watt.","if ppw means performance per watt, then the cb and h265 graphs show that, sorta.",there is no universal unit of â€œperformanceâ€.,so in the one case performance = cb score.,in the other itâ€™s the inverse function of the number of seconds it takes to do the encode.,"either way, the point of these graphs was to show, as much as is possible, ebay the most efficient spot is.",graph 3 demonstrates that it depends on your total system power draw.,"for my system, 100w package power is the ideal for efficiency.",the system power was 250w ish.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it doesnâ€™t really impact temps much in my experience since the part that increases in power the most is the io die which uses very little power in comparison to the ccd.,but it does eat into your power budget still.,thatâ€™s why zen 3 epyc cpus which has higher power io die can sometimes lose or just match in performance to zen 2 epyc that has a lower power consumption io die.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is that 6ghz for single core or all pcores?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at stock my 13900k needs 290w to reach 40-41k cb23.,"others report higher wattage (330w), which may be attributed to my gigabyte bios default to lowest llc and 2nd lowest ac/dc (other boards likely push these unnecessarily)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">if ppw means performance per watt, then the cb and h265 graphs show that, **sorta.","**

exactly, it does sorta show it, but plotting performance per watt where performance is some performance metric (cb, h265 encode/decode etc) against the watts consumed by cpu to get the performance, then the peak becomes very distinguished.",>graph 3 demonstrates that it depends on your total system power draw.,"for my system, 100w package power is the ideal for efficiency.",the system power was 250w ish.,i would assume performance would primarily depend on ppw no?,did you vary system draw independently of package draw.,"now i am having trouble understanding

the sp value for your chip will also influence that.,the stock voltage for 5.4g on my chip is 1.324v and up to 1.444 for 5.8g.,my asus board gives the default voltages for my chip at its 11 vf points in the offsets page.,these are self-reported by the cpu to the motherboard and are the main input value to the formula for the sp values,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

then find ""cpu lite load""

**cpu**: undervolt -0.05v, cpu lite load lv4 (low), load line calibration lv2 (high), 260w power limit (28500 points in r23).","the thermal you see is a result of prime95 small fft, which includes avx iirc, hence the temp is explainable.","in r23 though, it sits around 90*c. i can have a power limit of 220w and drop max temp to 70s, but well, 90 degrees is fine for me though.","at 220w, the r23 score is around 27700, compared to 28500 at the moment.","at an unlimited power cap, the cpu pulls a 333w peak and yields 30000 in r23.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
an incredible cpu indeed.,"it perfectly fits my varied workload (dev, gaming, video editing, etc.)","the card though, indeed i never heard about it before.","i saw it at $400 during black friday on newegg, and with a [review from gamer nexus on this brand 6700xt model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt-ysg1kkiq), i decided to pull the trigger.",worth every penny so far.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a small correction though, the boost clock on all core workloads is limited to 5.3ghz on b660, and 4.2ghz for e core.","from my observation, the 13700k all-core boost clock scales with a power limit and voltage.","it reaches 5+ ghz at 300w and above, but also reaches 100 average degrees on all cores (all red).","with a stock bios setting, cpu package power can reach 333w and result in 30000 r23 points.","here, i'm undervolting and set pl1/2 to 260w.","this is a b660, so i have no control over the clock, hence the lower number that you are seeing.","the t limit of throttling is 100 degrees, which has not been reached on average, so there is no throttling here.","that said though, i'm not certain why the cpu package and ia core temps reach 104 at maximum in this run.",i'm also making a video regarding this observation and the power scale of 13700k.,"you can always take it with a grain of sale because that is what i observed, but i do not have a concrete explanation for now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"also, i'm not certain about the intended behavior of the core thermal throttling report in hwinfo64.","sometimes, it shows as throttle even at as low as 80 degrees, which should not be the case as far as i know.","that said, the clock seems to be consistent during an interval of measurement.",it might be possible that the sensor reports a very quick and not measurable spike.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ahhh gotcha nice i'm sorry i missed that.,the throttling because of cpu lite load was so strange to me when i bought this.,"yeah 90 is fine at a load like that, plus prime95 is always kinda heavy.",nice scores tho!,i'm happy i can maybe squeeze out a tiny more performance outta my chip as the max power draw is like 185w.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you gotta change the cpu lite load under advanced cpu configuration.,intel apparently recommends mode 9 i've seen.,try mode 9 and redo your tests if your undervolting you really should be having it be cooler.,cpu lite load on these msi boards do really weird shit.,lemme know if you got any questions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"at 160w, my r23 is only 25100. i'm not certain if it is due to the boost clock algorithm, but my clock is nerfed really badly at that point.","my guess is, it can do better with a z690 or z790 where i can manually control the clock, but well, there is no decent z690 or z790 matx on the market at the moment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"cinebench is nothing, it is more of a benchmark, rather than a stress test.",you can try reducing vcore by 0.01v per step until you see the score dramatically drop in r23.,the limit is 0.05v in msi b660 motherboards.,increase 0.005 to 0.01v at that point.,"then, reduce the lite load level by 1 as it controls the vcore across frequency.","reduce it until you cannot boot, or bios becomes laggy, then increase it by 1. try r23 at that point, and if the score is still in line, then try changing load line calibration following the same procedure.","when you find a sweet spot, that is the time to stress test and make adjustments accordingly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

â€œway too longâ€ implies that it does eventually work.,is that correct?,are you hooking up all necessary power connectors?,what is your psu?,have you verified that your old card is running at x16?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"everything is connected,with old card,comp turns on in 15 sec,with new one it needs 5 min,and when i try to enter bios,it's like i turned off keybord,nothing is reacting.","tryed taking off batery to lose power on motherboard,nothing changed,someone suggested me that problem might be at old bios,but i dont know how to install new one",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

so only thing i can do is to buy new motherboard?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i donâ€™t really know whatâ€™s happening there.,"you may be able to find a bios update via third party sites or some of the intel ftp backups that were uploaded to archive.org, however thereâ€™s no guarantee itâ€™s going to do anything.",it could simply be an incompatibility between that card and an older system.,"with that said, a search does seem to show a history of bios gpu issues with that board, so updating the bios would be my first choice.",what bios version is on it now?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
windows 10 will work fine.,"windows 11 will work better, in that there will be fewer core selection errors.","windows 11 knows how a core type will perform for a specific workload at a specific frequency (sometimes a p-core is better for a low level task, and sometimes an e-core is better for a higher level task), while all windows 10 knows is that e-cores are lower performance.",whether the difference is meaningful or even noticeable depends on your specific workloads.,"still, if youâ€™re using a hybrid cpu and installing fresh, i would go with windows 11. if you end up hating the ui changes, third party utilities can fix everything for like $5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

running windows 10 13700k z790-e no issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"can only speak for win11: my 1255u (x1 carbon) gets way hotter than my t490 (8th gen i7), so it is very underwhelming.",likely it will take some time (years?),before windows makes good use of the e-cores.,"i'll go as far to label the 15w alderlake-u's as ""the lost cpu generation"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you talking 13400 vs 13700k, or 13600k vs 13700?",there a pretty big difference in the i5 range.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""i know in gaming there isnâ€™t a difference, but in basic tasks like internet browsing or opening apps, or simply turning on your pc, is it any faster?""",gaming is a lot more intensive than those other tasks you listed.,you will not see any difference between the cpus on those tasks.,you would need to put a lot more intensive (hugely more intensive) tasks for your computer to notice the difference between 13600k vs 13700k (for example).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"basic tasks no, heavy productivity tasks yes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> but in basic tasks like internet browsing or opening apps, or simply turning on your pc, is it any faster?","lol, no.",not even the g7400 feels slow to use for that stuff.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have the 13600k paired with a 4090 and in gaming at 3840 x 1600 @144 hz, the cpu never goes over 50% usage while the gpu goes up to 100% depending on the game.",so i am sure even if i had the 13900k it would make no difference in gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not really a massive difference.,same with gaming.,if your doing something like video editing or editing in general than there maybe a difference,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sorry, 13600k and 13700k",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes it does.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah but i know there almost the same in games,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so if i just edit video's as a hobby do you think an i7 is worth it?,"it's not going to be crazy at all, no cgi or rendering, just adding clips together with effects.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there are also productivity focused bechmarks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you sure your not using the gpu for video editing?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in the long term, i7 is going to be more useful to you.",it's 4 extra e-cores.,i will say the jump between the 13600k and 13700k is not as big as the jump from the 13700k to the 13900k.,"if you're doing any video editing, i'd absolutely go with the i7, even if it's just for fun.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
get the i7 sir,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah but i don't know much about video editing specs and software yet, other than i want to get into it, so i don't think i'll really understand the benchmarks.","i'm currently using a basic software, but that, combined with my slow pc, isn't enough to make the video's i want to make, so i plan to learn more when i get a new pc",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

wellâ€¦ typically thatâ€™s related to a bad cable (even if it works fine with other devices) or it simply doesnâ€™t like the device at the other side of the connection - whatever that is (switch or router).,some people have had success with changing the device the intel nic connects to (like inserting or getting a different switch).,thereâ€™s no guarantee that wherever you switch to wonâ€™t have the same issue.,"i experienced no issues with a netgear gs108, and iâ€™m currently connected to a hp 48-port managed switch that also plays nice.",iâ€™m suspicious that aggressive â€œeco modeâ€ shifting in other devices triggers these problems.,"the only issue i have with my i225-v is the notorious â€œdevice cannot start (code 10)â€ after reboots or being in the bios, however it hasnâ€™t happened in a good 5 or 6 months for me (granted my pc is on 24x7).","iâ€™m also running very new me firmware with a very old bios, which i learned after the fact is not recommended, but it seems to be working.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

oh so the bios update actually did increase your cpu temp.,"then it's definitely allowing the cpu to draw more power than the previous one, thereby increasing the case ambient temperature and power draw from the psu, which in turn also effects your gpu.","as i already suggested, likely removing the frontpanel of your case might do the trick.","if not, it could be a problem with the increased powerdraw.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

nice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are those humongous dies actually functional as cpus or are they just decoration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your gran is 1337 bro..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice to see.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
after the disaster of  intel 820 chipset which used rdram.,intel was in a real pickle.,forced to backtrack on its plans release the intel 810/815 chipsets that supported sdram.,the intel 815em would have been a laptop chipset for mobile celeron and mobile pentium iii cpu's.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ah, the good old times...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is really awesome!,"my very first build that i did back in 2000 used the 810e chipset, the one prior to the one shown here.",i think if i remember right it was one of the first or very early chipsets/motherboards that supported integrated audio and video.,the 815 and it's variations was the next iteration and stepping.,so cool she took part in its development.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you have such a cool grandma,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm going into computer engineering at uf, hopefully i end up working for a company like intel furthering the advancement of computer hardware.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's awesome man!,she had some kick ass achievements!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ohh that's cool, xeon phi was derived from the cancelled cpu/gpu hybrid intel larrabee.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
amazing!!!,!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i probably worked with your grandmother, if she was on the original 815 too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
haha i donâ€™t get super secret parts but my first pc was built by her.,it was made from parts that they were going to throw away.,"also got some monitors and other random pc peripherals over the years like keyboards, mice, speakers, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you do dig them out keep posting!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fun!,"i just started my career at intel about a month ago, i came from the aerospace industry and so far i am loving intel.",great company to work for.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i told her she should hang up all of her awards!,"iâ€™ll help her with that eventually 

thank you for the article, iâ€™ll definitely check it out when i have time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"because of her, iâ€™m aspiring to be a hardware or software engineer at intel.",at a very young age iâ€™ve always been exposed to computers and loved them.,iâ€™ve watched my grandmother build many at home and seen countless parts laying around.,i know itâ€™ll be a tough journey but iâ€™m willing to take it.,i also want to be able to provide back to her and my parents.,in a year or two iâ€™ll be able to do my internship.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most of my graduate school classmates (ee phd) who went to intel didn't last more than 3-5 years before leaving for something better.,"work life balance is pretty poor in general, cutthroat corporate culture, and if you work in a fab location your entire life can get flipped upside-down for weeks at a time if there's a major production issue, even ruining long planned vacations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sure, i would like to see them!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
haha yeah me too.,altho i love the soc keychains we got from time to time the most.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you referring to constructing the plaque itself?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm going to assume you're not very old or have never had a real/serious job because team morale is absolutely a priority that'll benefit a company.,you're talking about $10 plaques that probably took 2-3 hours to design from premade graphics that were used elsewhere.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you talking about the first one with the 2 big ones on the top?,no but there are actual chips below them and a cpu on the second one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"dude, this is a piece of art and should be displayed as one.",you are one lucky fellow.,ðÿ™œðÿ¼,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i will!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m going to follow her footsteps and become a hardware or software engineer at intel.,she said sheâ€™d help me land an internship :) thatâ€™s good to hear,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if i may ask, what division/departmwnt do you work kn?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was too.,"went for electrical/computer engineering, and applied there for internships several times.","instead, i ended up getting picked up by a small electronics company, and the dream slowly faded, _because i realized i was already living it._",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i paid $400 to have it written so not exactly stoked to share it for free.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that makes me the same age as your parents.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was almost certain that your grandma was around my parents age.,i would have those on display in my office-please post more,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"on the other hand, if you don't have to work in the fab, it can be pretty sweet.",it really all depends on the group you work in.,i hear yield and defect analysis is pretty chill.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what university course does your grandma suggest for hardware engineering?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
glad to hear!,honestly it doesnâ€™t have to be intel exactly but i would like to.,not the end of the world if i donâ€™t but iâ€™m aiming for it.,as long as i get to contribute to technology iâ€™ll be happy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can you share any details?,how is it running java?,what kind of performance are you getting?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah working with intel is a dream coming true 
and helping in making these amazing tech chips  
is a lot of fun",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your comment is interesting to me.,"i don't understand the ""in the context of capitalism"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i donâ€™t believe they are; i think itâ€™s just printed.,but i can ask,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the top ones are blown up photographs of the packaged dies below them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"haha i only knew what this meant, because my big brother gave me a manga with all sorts of leetspeak in it.",it's like he passed the torch down to me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hereâ€™s what i know.,the cards act as independent load balancers and run minecraft in kind of a virtual machine.,the 7120p is set to combine four of its physical cores to form one single virtual core.,each vcpu has four cores and four threads with performance in java very similar to a xeon e3-1270v2.,the 16gb of onboard memeory is split into 2gb â€œchannelsâ€ and 4gb total is allocated to each of them.,itâ€™s currently set so each card has three vcpus on it with 4gb of ram per â€œvmâ€ and the additional handles communication between the xeon e3-1270v0 in the serverâ€™s motherboard.,thereâ€™s three cards per chassis plus a 10gb network card.,in terms of server performance tps in game never drops below 20 and one â€œvmâ€ is capable of hosting 32 clients before performance issues start happening but i limit it to 24 clients to save on memeory bandwidth.,each card draws 230w under load due to them not being fully loaded.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
op is saying saying that the company spent money on something that wouldn't benefit them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that xeon phi doesnâ€™t have virtualization support though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you donâ€™t need virtualization support for it to work.,you do lose hardware acceleration for anything that needs graphics but considering itâ€™s all cli acceleration doesnâ€™t matter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"lemme guess, 750w psu?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
check your cpu power limit settings in your bios and whether your cpu is being limited to a certain wattage.,"if you disable those limits, you very well may gain back that lost performance.",you should also see temperatures go up due to the extra power draw during the burst workload of the benchmark.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
windows 11 22h2 scores low on cpu.,"was getting like 19000-20000 on 13900k and downgraded to 21h2 and iâ€™m getting 24000-25000 now

what's your 4090's power draw?,"is it undervolted, overclocked, etc.",theres a very real chance your 850w psu is insufficient.,the 12900ks can draw ~260w and your gpu draws anywhere from 450w to 600w.,that's not including anything else in your system.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"fyi unless the op has done some serious overclocking, the 450w-600w range was never true and stemmed from misinformed rumors before launch.",the 4090 often draws less than 400w in gaming workloads.,i'd be more inclined to believe it's a cpu power limit issue.,"if the psu was insufficient, i don't think the system would be stable at all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"gpu is slightly undervolted, drawing around 320-400w in benchmarks 240-340 in games.",powermeter at the wall registered 598w peak consumption in occt power test.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the stock rating for the 4090 is 450w from what ive read, not including any overclock.",admittedly the 600w max is probably too high.,"either way, it's still going to pull a huge amount of power.","450w + 260w is 710w... and that's just the cpu and gpu, not including everything else.","the safe continuous rating on an 850w is 80%, or 680w.","so you see, while it's enough to power it, he's still regularly encroaching on the 20% reserved for spikes and to avoid running the psu into the ground prematurely.","that is unless he puts power limits in place, which would be the only way it would be okay.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh good, you did check the draw from the wall.","was 598w while benchmarking, or gaming?","you said peak so im assuming benchmarking, but just making sure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it looks like op confirmed their 4090 is operating nominally below 400w.,i'm actually genuinely interested in learning more about safe continuous operating ratings for psus.,can you please share your source so i can read up on it?,i had assumed that opp was there for a reason to provide headroom above the max rating for those sorts of spikes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep.,occt power test.,"loads everything at max

games mostly floating in 300-400w area

games like dota barely break 200's 

it's a good psu, 80+ titanium, massive component base, i'am sure it's not about it, cuz i removed 4090, tested 3dmark with intel uhd and had even lower results (15980 cpu score)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah your psu is fine with those numbers.,"as far as the last part, that checks out.",igpu uses the ram memory bandwidth so it will lower your score slightly.,you definitely have a conundrum on your hands.,it looks like you're hitting max turbo boost frequency so unless it's throttling or you're running other stuff in the background i can't think of anything that would cause a drop like that.,you said the bios was at stock settings except enabling xmp?,"i'll ponder on it and get back to you later, right now i'm sick and tired (literally lol) so i need sleep.","edit, if you have intel xtu installed it'll tell you if you're throttling.","run that to monitor the cpu, then rerun the benchmark.","afterwards, check xtu to see if you throttled for any reason.","edit again, did you plug in all the eps cables?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
turboing between 5.2 all core to 5.5 on 1-2 core ocassionaly.,"expected on a b660 board (good one though tomahawk with 2 8pin cpu power)

background is not bloated, win is 2 days old

xtu showed up all reasons to throttle ""no""

esp cables you mean cpu 8 pin?","yep, both, separate cables, not daisy chain.","anyway get well mate, health go first, always.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ok, all of that is good.",what's your cpu utilization look like during the benchmark?,staying in the high 90s or does it dip?,is the wattage used by the cpu at 260w or close to?,"searching the web suggested disabling the e cores might help, but honestly, i don't think it's gonna make that big of a difference.","it's worth a try, though.",someone else suggested resetting the cmos.,another suggested a windows 11 glitch.,"honestly, that's the limit of my expertise so if none of that fixes it then i'm out of ideas.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"close to a 100% load at cpu test part and barely 20% load at the gpu test part

disabling ecores not really an option on a b660 i think, bios is very limited for such options.","it has a compatible with old games mode though, disable ecores by pressing scroll lock.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"update: tried win 10 21h1 , getting 18200 cpu score.","pretty much an improvement over 16400.

"ax200 is wifi 6, ax210 is newer wifi 6e.",theyâ€™re both pcie interface.,"ignore the ax201 and ax211 as those are cnvio2 and basically rely on the cpu/chipset to do everything, and itâ€™s not worth saving a buck.","note that your motherboard has an appropriate key-e slot for a wifi m.2 card, however you will need to buy and put antennas somewhere.",and theyâ€™ll need to be outside of the case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"edit:

i remembered the wrong module name.","ax 201 is ax 200 with cnvi + crf module, while ax211 is ax210 with cnvi + crf module.","if you see killer wifi cards, they are basically intel but rebranded.","you should use either ax201 or ax211 as your motherboard key-e slot requires cnvi, do remember to buy 2x2 antennas along with it.","i would go with ax211 as it is newer, but it practically does not matter unless you have an infrastructure to support its features.",[you can learn more about intel cnvi and crf here.,"](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000054819/wireless.html)

~~they are the same, just built differently.",your motherboard works with the ax210 as it requires cnvi-compatible wireless module.,"when you buy a wireless module, do remember to buy 2x2 antennas along with it.",the total cost should be under $50 assuming you are in the us.~~,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not worth it continue to save money and upgrade the whole thing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no!,you won't see meaningful improvements in frametimes.,those are what matter lately for modern games.,if you have very little money: buy a used a-series mobo and used amd 3000 series.,that's very cheap and frametimes are less than half.,every 4000 series is starting to really age over the last few years.,\*one note: an exception to this can be those with a 4770k that's overclocked or better [gaming on a modern gpu at 1440p and above](https://youtu.be/gogzbvpqfvg).,but that's a k-series.,you will regret this upgrade.,spending 50-100 on a base tier cpu that old is a *bad* idea.,that's a lot of money for a sidegrade you'll barely notice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i did this exact swap 2 years ago.,no regrets.,"extra cores are useful for the other things i do on the machine, but it did smooth out some stuttering i had in some games.","i didnâ€™t want to fork out for new motherboard, ram and cpu so as a drop in replacement it made a lot of sense.","i suspect the higher frequency helped more than the threads, but never actually validated it.",would i do it today?,probably.,i want to get another 2-3 years out of this machine before i replace it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i donâ€™t know if you specifically meant the non-k or the k versions, but hereâ€™s some gb5 performance numbers:

- 4690: 917/2913
- 4690k: 988/2912
- 4790: 944/3471
- 4790k: 1073/4001

thereâ€™s a definite multicore performance boost, but single core improvement is pretty low.","i doubt there would be much of a noticeable improvement in gaming performance, unless you went right to the 4790k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you can find one for under $100 or something, go for it.",i did the same thing a few years ago before moving to amd.,"saw modest improvements, especially in open world games like watch dogs or assassin's creed.",last i checked haswell was still relatively expensive because of people doing the same thing you are.,"if it's not your main machine though, why spend the extra money?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i didn't have issues with that gen4 till this year with any games.,it lasted soooo long lol was a great investment in 2014..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i did this with a 2500k to a 2600k back when the best on the market was a 7700k.,that means 4 cores was still the leading cpu.,a 2600k overclocked were fine and gave me the extra headroom for a few more years.,today with amd causing competiotion improvement are too big.,and you say this is a second build.,if itâ€™s gaming even the newest i3 will dominate and if itâ€™s a bedroom server it might make more sense to get a low power amd for the power saving over time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

oh i have !i have a 13th gen i7 build this is a old pc i have,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
right !,!i thought so.. i have a new 13th gen intel i was just wondering if extra threads could help bit with 8 threads in all but your right spending any extra on this old one seems redundant you're totally right in my hindsight.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you should not be using windows 10 with that old machine.,"lol

intel, nvidia or amd?","you should not forget, there are two other players in the game.",the both igpus.,"i guess a lot of buyers from low-midrange gpu cards buy these cards, because they had always a gpu card or something else, but not because of they really need one.","i am also sure that most users haven't hardware problems with their cards, nvidia, amd or intel, no, it's software and drivers.",i not really understand why all 3 companies have problems here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

> is it worth to try to undervolt instead of limiting the power?,undervolting will potentially allow you to limit both your temps and wattage while not losing any performance.,that cooler should be more than adequate of handling a 13600k so i would say it's worthwhile.,"> also changing settings through intel xte doesn't seem to change anything in the bios

this is normal.",the settings in xte are only applied while the software is active.,if you find something stable you will have to manually dial them into your bios to no longer rely on the software.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
both.,you should power limit in any case so that the temperatures always stay at whatever you find comfortable.,then you can additionally try undervolting to increase performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

absolutely otherwise youâ€™ll just be throttled.,if your going to get a intel cpu iâ€™d say a 13900k or maybe a 13700k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

your temps are way too high.,iâ€™m seeing 55-65c while gaming in mw2 on my i9 13900k.,cooler is corsair h115i capellix.,i do have the thermal right frame as well.,mw2 doesnâ€™t seem to stress it out at all.,so if youâ€™re hitting 90c youâ€™ve got cooler issues.,what cooler are you using?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hitting 90c.... while gaming?,something is wrong.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what resolution do you play at?,the cpu just spike up to that temp quickly?,% cpu utilization when the temperature hits 90c?,case have ok cooling?,gpu temperature?,gpu air flow go over the cpu?,changing the fan curves help?,90s still ok but likely able to make it cooler without changing hardware.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is why i bought a 13600k i can just air cool the thing and it doesn't get much worse frames,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
enter cooler master evo 212â€¦.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when i tried mw2 dmz mode my average was 55c.,for both teh cpu and gpu.,there are a few things you can do to help with temps of the 13900k.,i use a thermalright contact frame.,you don;t necessarily need it but it may help a little.,so due to the ilm on z690 at least it exerts an enormous amount of pressure on the cpu.,"this causes it to bend and therefore the contact with the air cooler, aio copper plate is not that great.",what the contact frame does is just secures the cpu in place without the pressure of the ilm.,this cause a more even surface for best possible contact.,some people report big temp drops but in my own experience it only dropped mine like 2-3 degrees.,it could be more for you or less i can;t say for sure.,i run a -0.09v voltage offset on the cpu.,i limit the performance core ratio to 55 all of them.,i also change the loadline calibration to llc4 (this on an asus motherboard).,because i only game i set both pl1 and pl2 to 90 w. you can set it higher like 120 or 253w.,whatever you feel comfortable with.,i run a -0.09v voltage offset on the cpu.,i limit the performance core ratio to 55 all of them.,i also change the loadline calibration to llc4 (this on an asus motherboard).,"in the top left corner of your mother =board you should see a 8 pin pci-e socket, labeled cpu how many do you have.",i do believe most modern motherboards especially those aimed at overclocking have 2. plug both in.,up until recently i only ever plugged one in and apparently it drops temps if you have two plugged in.,and it worked how much it drops i guess varies.,hope this helps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mine doesnâ€™t even hit 75c in blenderâ€¦ take the plastic off your cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what cooling are you using?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 90c is most likely hit during loading screens when the cpu actually has to work hard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it aint too bad if you are on air, but if aio - something is wrong.",maybe settings in bios?,some auto oc on?,(so it clocks way too high and might even have bad vf curve for the cpu.),i would suggest you going through the bios and setting maybe intel limits on?,and auto clocks etc.,"mostly defaults but be aware some motheboards have unlimited power on by default and you maybe do not want that ;/

how is the thermal paste applied?",how is the cooler contact?,pressure?,all triple checked?,maybe opt for a contact frame?,undervolting the cpu?,i am on a custom'ish loop (ryujin2 + some extra bananas) and with close to default clocks in mw2 my cpu pulls around 120w and temps are 20 degrees above water temperature.,"water is at 35 and cpu is below 60. 

on a full load my cpu pulls easily over 300w and temps stay below 100.

when i have 6,2p & 4,6e oc on i pull 200w on mw2 and temps are at 65 ish.",\[well i do currently also have that oc on but not on heavy loads just because there is no need for it.,heavy loads goes close to stock speeds atm\],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my 13700k reaches max 81c in mw2 on p core # 4. all other cores are 10 degrees lower than #4. is something wrong here?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
90 c is fine the cpu is designed to run up to 100 c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hey man!,i have the same frame and cooler.. do you mind sharing your cpu fan curve and case fan curve?,would be awesome.. thx!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
90c while gaming????,gaming pulls like 90-150w of power.,not even the full 253w its rated for.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for a 13900k you should be using 360mm aio atleast to cool... buying a 1300k i presume your overclocking because you got the k version...240mm won't be enough to cool the beast,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm not even setting any fan curve.,"right now just been using icue and setting the aio to its medium setting which is ""balanced.""",the case fans are running stock with no curve set.,i am idling at 30c on cpu right now (a few cores are even cooler at 29- 28 and 27) and 35c on 3090ti.,i have a plus of having my office in my basement which has a naturally cool ambient temp year round.,but i am pleasantly surprised on how cool this rig has been running.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can pull over 180w while gaming.,depends on the game and settings.,the 90c might also just be a random less than a second spike vs a steady temperature.,might just be bad case cooling or some other thing.,could be a variety things.,need more info.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have u found a fix?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13700k is better.,easily worth $12 more.,it is probably the best option for $400 right now.,there are upcoming zen4 3d  cpus that could be better but likely cost more with more costly motherboards and it won't make much of a difference at 4k anyway.,you have the option of paying less and get a 13600k and it is still going to be good for video editing but definitely worse.,"if you want to save money, go this route instead of 12900k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i checked the exact video where he compared the throttling behavior of 13900k vs 7950x.,"after the 10-minute run, 13900k sees p core boost dropping from 5.1-5.2ghz to 4.9-5.0ghz, and core power dropping from \~245w to \~225w.",7950x sees the frequency limit dropping from 5.05ghz to 4.95ghz (where is the per-core clock?,"), and power dropping from \~192w to \~176w.",and that's with him saying 13900k drops from 5.2ghz to 4.8ghz and 7950x from 5.1ghz to 5.0ghz in the background.,both see power and clock speed drop from hitting the thermal limit.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p40gp\_djk5e&t=1293s,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah they're both after 10 minutes, i think you must be thinking of the other testing he does to look at frequency/temperatures.","but even if he did it differently back then it doesn't really matter, all that matters is he used the same method for all cpus in the benchmark.",i don't see how you can say it's not apples to apples.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it may be drivers or settings issue but your cpu is from from 100% usage so for sure it's not cpu bottlenecking.,are you on single or dual channel memory?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it may be because of cpu, ram, ssd, or even some gpu issues.",cpu is the reason more often.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would need to see the rest of the system to know for sure.,maybe you are thermal throttling on the cpu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if i cap the fps at 120 my fps 0.1% goes to 105, that made me think itâ€™s a cpu bottleneck.","( my specs are, 7900xtx, 13900k, gskill trident rgb 6000mhz + xmp, darkpower 12 titanium, z79 a wifi,) temps stay below 70c as you can see",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

z690 is perfectly fine for 13900k.,you just need to update the bios for 13th gen. you will see zero performance increase going to z790 you can look that up online.,go with z690 as you can get nicer boards for cheaper than z790.,i am currently running a 13700k on a mai z690 edge ddr4 with zero issues and it works great.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is the question?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"first off, for 7600mhz ddr5 you **need** unify-x, apex or dark, then you need to actually know what you're doing, else you either gonna be stuck at like 7000mhz or will run at 7600mhz but on voltages so high, you will end up degrading memory controller quite quickly.","then comes the need of tweaking timings anyway, as ddr5 xmp is garbage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

13th gen takes full advantage of ddr5 more than ddr4.,"its not that you will ""lose"" performance by going ddr4 but games that take advantage of ddr5 will gain over ddr4.",it   depends on the game but i highly suggest just upgrading to ddr5 now.,its better future upgradability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

none what so ever.,i run a asus z690-a d4 and an asus z690 formula.,got the bios which updated it for 13th gen and me firmware update then did the one in windows and have been happy gaming ever since.,if you want high frequency ram 7000+ mhz ddr5 then the z790 is for you.,but i was happy enough with 6400mhz so didn;t see the need for it.,i guess if i wanted to play with high frequency ram i would get something like the z790 apex.,but most of the time i just want to play games and that's pretty much it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"> i'm using dp1.4 to hdmi2.1

link to what you're using?",i'm going to wager that this is the problem.,the first one i pulled up on amazon specifies that it only does pcm audio.,"generally if you output a codec you need to pay license fees, even if its the identical data a device received.","yeah, its really really dumb.","yeah, some randomletter chinese vendors will sell products that do questionable things.",i'm guessing yours follows the rules.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"setting the display resolution to 8k is likely eating up all the bandwidth on the dp port, leaving little to none for the audio.","even if you watch 4k content, it is still sending the 4k video inside an 8k 60hz container to the display.",if you are not watching native 8k content then you should just switch to outputting in 4k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seems like an oversight by intel to release a dp1.4 port instead of hdmi2.1.,i suspect it's bandwidth issues rather than license issue.,it also appears your dubious cable stating pcm audio only is more honest than any western brands,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
base clock is absolutely meaningless unless youâ€™re trying to enforce the 125w vs 65w pl1 values.,no one on a properly specâ€™d desktop should be needlessly enforcing low power limits like that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what i've noticed about the motherboards... which may be relevant... is that the more expensive ones have more gen 4 m.2 slots.,"so a cheapish z690 like the asus p ... has 3 slots, while an expensive z790 will have up to 5.

so regardless of ddr5 support, vrm quality, and heat sinks, other features may be relevant to you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"well, stock would be to enforce the power limits - but most motherboards open them up automatically depending on what cooler type you select, and you can always customize or disable them completely.",note that a k series cpu on a z790 would allow you to undervolt to further tame power usage / heat output.,"this is not possible on a non-k cpu, and also may not be possible on b760 (not sure iâ€™ve heard either way, but it doesnâ€™t work currently on b660).","also, a z690 board with bios flashback would also be a fine choice, and some may be similar in price to a b760 and overall better specâ€™d.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok cool!,is there a specific setting that i should look for in the motherboard bios to open up power limits?,if it helps i'm building a mini itx build in the nzxt h1 v2 with its included cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on the motherboard.,but there is often a â€œcooler typeâ€ (ie.,"stock, tower, aio) to set a value, or enable mce to disable it entirely.","and then the general setting would be pl1 (the long term limit, ie 125 or 65w) and pl2 (short term turbo, ie 219w).","you can set these to whatever your cooling can handle, or 4095 watts to disable them.","intel cpus, even non-k models, can take as much power as youâ€™re capable of cooling for as long as you want.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

any info on price?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"noted, since the time when i said it is ddr4 only the z790m-plus only had ddr4-only slots back then.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
none as of yet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you may still be correct.,i was trying to buy the ddr5 version and no one i've checked yet seems to carry it.,so it may as well not exist for the time being...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13th gen won't fit on your z590 mobo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a 10400 shouldn't be that much of a bottleneck for a 3070. but if you want to upgrade without changing boards you could get an 11600k or 11700k and overclock.,however they are very power hungry so you need a good psu and cooler.,"with the upper limit of your budget tho you could buy a 13600k and a modest z690 board that has bios flashback, such as the z690 aorus elite, pro a, gaming x, steel legend, asrock extreme - all ddr4 versions ofc.",they're all around or below $200 with good vrms capable of running a 13600k.,"i'd personally get the aorus elite ax ddr4; it has lots of usb, safeboot button which is a massive time saver when overclocking, override voltage mode which is amazing for stable vcore, robust vrm, and it just looks the best of the bunch imo

 what speed ddr4 do you have?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i came from a 4770 to 13600k and you're rocking a 10400 and looking to upgrade lol.,your cpu still has its training wheels on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
raise power limits in bios to 125w.,should give you a 10-15% boost for free.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why upgrade?,"it is still decent, especially for 1440p.","but if you still want to upgrade, best decision would be a 10700k/11700k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"like the other dude said, the motherboard doesn't support 13th gen.

if you want to maximize then look for a i7-12700k, it doesn't cost that much over the 12600k anymore.","i9's are not worth it for gaming value wise, so it's your best bet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
never heard of a msi z560 pro wifi so you likely mean b560.,and i suspect that it will not be able to keep the i7 @ max boost clocks for longer periods.,and old test with the i7-11700k was: msi b560m pro was the worst at just 2890 mhz.,msi used to have it's own tables for the b460.,were you could see the max sustained boost clock and the sweet point was the i5-10600.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so the best i can get is an 11th gen is that even worth it?,or do i look into new motherboards?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's not unlocked...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"his motherboard doesn't support 12th gen either

alder lake and raptor lake use the same socket (lga1700).",his board is lga1200 so only works with 10th and 11th gen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you can find a reasonable price for 11700k - you might go for it (it will suit 3070 well).,"otherwise, you might look at new gen cpu/mobo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the b560 pro enforces intels arbitrary 65w limit by default but by disabling this, you can gain quite a bit of performance as the cpu can actually use double the power.",stock cooler might get toasty though.,https://www.techspot.com/article/2252-intel-b560-disaster/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ah yeah, my bad.",new motherboard + i5 13600k is the smart choice then if he wants to get to the latest gen within budget.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"woo, the mythical q670 chipset.",basically a h670 withâ€¦ umâ€¦ more usb ports.,but no ecc supportâ€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice boards.,"although a bit late, asrock updated just now the bios for their existing w680 boards to add support for 13th gen raptorlake cpus.",e.g.,"https://www.asrockind.com/en-gb/imb-x1712 
supermicro was the fastest in adding 13th gen support in bios updates.","~~yet i am stuck here with a gigabyte w680 board (mw34-sp0) with issues and no support for 13th gen~~

man some of the questions on this sub are just the best.,which pin?,a cpu socket pin?,a fan header pin?,an led header pin..?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on which pin you bend.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it depends on which pin was bent.,"also if you have a small enough tool, you can just bend the pin back to its normal position (carefully).",the current motherboard i'm using had previously bent pins.,works fine now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if your lucky you bend a pin that won't hurt you and you'll be on your way.,if your unlucky you'll bend a pin that will completely stop you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
one pin ans i fucked up a 700 euros z390 aorus xtreme,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as others have stated, it completely depends on the pin.","bend a memory or pcie or other important pin, and youâ€™re screwed.","bend a ground or a redundant power pin, and you should be fine.","bend a power pin such that it shorts out to ground or a data pin, and youâ€™ll let out some magic smoke.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"cpu socket pin, it looks like a bent a pin but everything is working properly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"maybe you got lucky, maybe one of your sticks of ram no longer works or a hundred other things that maybe youndon'tbeven care about

you can carefully bend it back if you feel brave",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then i wouldn't worry about it.,could be a ground or unused pin.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the killer wifi is the same as the intel wifi you listed.,the killer wifi just has an accompanying software that allows you to set limits to network speed for certain software or prioritise the traffic from certain program like games over others.,"in practice windows already does a fairly decent job at managing network traffic and rarely causes issues that would make you wanna go "" hmm, ik what i need, a software to exactly control how much bandwidth and priority which program gets, manually.""",vpro is part of their professional suite and allows certain remote management functionalities which are useful for organisations but not so much for traditional users.,i hope this clears your doubts!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i believe the difference is the thermal velocity boost:

i thought that was what you were asking (difference between tb3 and maximum turbo).,what is your question then?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah he explained it that if i reach a temp threshold it will go to boost 3.0 instead of tvb,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whats the difference.,why do i never get to 5.7?.,its only 5.8 or 5.5 on the rest of the cores,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you increase your cpu temperature enough you should fall back to the tb3 max.,if you're cooling well enough you shouldn't see it.,"it is also possible your motherboard is simply ignoring the tvb guidelines and running 5.8 as maximum boost all the time, in which case you will never see 5.7.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why are you comparing the 10900 price with the 13900?,the 13900 is three generations newer and much faster than the 10900 even if they were both clocked the same at 5.2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the f variants are cheaper because they don't have an igpu.,the k variants are more expensive because they allow overclocking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not sure why you are comparing it with an old cpu.,"but if you don't want to overclock, and you already have a dedicated graphics card, then no, you don't need the k model.","i bought the k model, always fall for it just in case i want to overclock, but i never do, so it's time i learned that lesson.","(having said that, they were actually within about â£15 of each other when i bought it).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

do not go with an f sku if youâ€™re planning on streaming.,your igpu can be used to stream with and save resources from your cpu and gpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is not worth mentioning at all.,"he will use nvenc to encode and obs will use cpu for all of those scenes, scripts and sources.",there is no place for that igpu as a stream resource.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, this is basically my doubt.",i read that nvenc performance better than quicksync for this porpouses.,is there any advantage of igpu that i'm ignoring besides hardware encoding?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you have a graphics card then your igpu will be doing nothing.,itâ€™s extra performance by using it to stream.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for a simple gamer who will stream his games occasionally - no.,edit.,you may use igpu if your gpu is dead for the time when a new gpu will arrive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"how exactly, can you explain, please?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
igpu offloads all the compute tasks so that your gpu isnâ€™t working on encoding and rendering your game at the same time.,with a high end gpu you probably wouldnâ€™t notice a difference.,"but because igpu is doing nothing, might as well use it to free up resources.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"some people say its great others say they had no difference, ive never used one, but have had no temp issues since i had it, prob depends also on what block/cooler you use as well",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what cooler are you using?,if youâ€™re using like an ekwb it doesnâ€™t make much difference as they have a solid backplate and good mounting.,aios and air coolers might benefit most.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
only if you have bad contact seen after placing paste and removing the block,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i refuse to use one.,"there is no way to confirm that you didn't under or overtighten it, and that can lead to inadequate cpu contact with the socket pins, which can cause all kinds of issues, like the pc not booting, poor ram overclocking, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not worth it in my case as it only made the temp drop 3c or so with air cooling.,"i was also afraid of a poor install of the screws but after having done it, not much of a real issue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i went with thermalright for my 13600k and i went from 97c full load to 85c.,it seems to even out the inconsistencies that everyone is experiencing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this apparently heavily depends on what cooler you have, the shape of the contact surface and the installation pressure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i bought the thermalright one.,my own personal experience is that it dropped the temps ever so slightly at idle and at load like maybe 2-3 degrees so not a substantial drop at all.,but thats not why i bought it.,short of someone changing their setup every year for the sake of â£13-15 so thatâ€™s like $13-15 i expect my setup to last quite a few years so in that regard it was just peace of mind in regards to the bending of the cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

bad bot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so since the 12th gen the mechanism which holds the cpu in place better know as the ilm or intel locking mechanism has found to exert a lot of pressure.,"this in effect 'bends' the cpu so is not even on the heatspreader which makes poor contact with whatever your choice of cooling solution be whether it be air, aio or custom .",now this in turn makes an already hot running cpu even hotter.,what the contact frame is suppose to do is just hold the cpu in place but without the kind of pressure that the ilm exerted.,so that means in theory that your cpu heatspreader will be flush to the cooling solution of your choice.,making better contact.,"now some people have found it made no difference, some say marginal and some say substantial.",i got like 2-3  degrees.,you could get 0 difference or big difference i can't say as it varies from user to user.,there are two main ones that people use.,there is the one from thermal grizzle and that's about $50 or 50 euros.,or the other main alternative is the thermalright version both do the same thing and that is $15 or 15 euro.,i got both of mine off amazon.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"that's an example of an adjustable backplate, designed to fit either lga1200 (10th/11th-gen) or lga1700 (12th/13th-gen) motherboards.",it ensures broad compatibility for coolers.,"some asus lga1700 motherboards did include both mounting patterns, which made the transition a bit easier when 12th gen cpus first launched, but virtually all new air cooled heatsinks or water cooling systems include brackets for lga1700 at this point.","as far as searching for better temperatures, what you're likely thinking of is what's commonly referred to as an [lga1700 contact frame](https://www.thermal-grizzly.com/en/products/523-cpu-contact-frame-for-12th-gen-intel-by-der8auer-en).","it physically replaces the typical upper bracket and lever of the original lga1700 socket with a single rigid, metal piece that is then clamped over the cpu, holding it firmly in place.","by clamping it together in this way, it avoids potential warping of the motherboard or bending of the ihs tabs due to the uneven pressure the stock lock mechanism places on the edges of the cpu's ihs (the little ""wings"" on the sides).","theoretically, providing a flatter ihs allows some heatsinks to achieve more uniform contact, and thus more effective heat transfer across the whole surface of the chip.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no youre way off.,try google thermalright contact frame and youâ€™ll have your answer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the problem with this bracket (corsair uses a similar style) and an asus motherboard is that both holes are on the motherboard.,"then that adjustable bracket can ""slide"" back and forth between the two holes instead of staying put if only one motherboard hole existed or if they had used a single use bracket.",i am using an msi lga 1700 bracket with a corsair aio for my asus board because of such difficulties.,with the msi bracket it's completely compatible with corsair lga 1700 standoff screws and makes proper contact without sliding around on the board because the bracket isn't adjustable.,sorry if thats confusing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

your cheapest and more pressing upgrades would be another stick of 8gb 2666 ram for dual channel and an ssd if need be but otherwise the cpu imo is not worth upgrading.,your board is very likely a b360 chipset that limits your ram speed and probably has barebones vrm.,not worth over paying for an 8700 or 9900 just because of that.,i'd look at maybe getting a cheap r5 5600 or i5 12400 build and upgrade your gpu down the line.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

technically a r5 5600 or 12400f would be your best upgrade.,but its not going to happen with that case.,it doesnt use matx/atx so your standard diy components isnt going to fit.,i dont even know if acer uses the standard pins for cpu power.,your prebuilt most likely has a garbage stock or worse than stock cooler so u aint really throwing a i7 there either.,your biggest upgrade is probably another 8gb stick of ram and maybe a ssd.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

turn rebar on.,install latest drivers.,(be sure to run ddu old drivers if your system used to use either amd or nvidia previously).,beyond that you're kinda just out of luck.,intel is a poor choice if you're not very tech savvy and actually want to play games without issues.,i like my a770.,"while the most recent drivers have helped a bit, it still has issues on lots of games.",especially older games.,my nvidia and amd cards game much better and get much more consistant framerates.,"i'm sorry to say, but outside of waiting for quite a while for drivers keep rolling out, (assuming rebar is already turned on) there likely isn't a solution for your stuttering issues.",but in the event rebar isnt turned on on your bios you absolutely need to turn it on.,stuttering is much much worse without rebar turned on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you bought arc expecting a problem free experience out of the box, you made a mistake.","intel is new to making dedicated gpu's, and their platform is still being built up.",their drivers are not caught up with nvidia's and amd's and it'll take quite a bit of time before they do.,games aren't optimized for arc since the userbase is comparatively tiny.,then there's the question of whether intel will continue spending money on the arc division while the company is in rough waters financially and is trying to cut back expenses.,"optane was cut a while back too, there's a reasonable chance arc will be cut too or at least will be put on the back burner.",add to that that the a380 is simply a weak card and you basically got a card that shouldn't really be used as a daily driver for gaming.,"i'm all for a 3rd player in the market, but arc just doesn't compete at this point in time.","making gpu's is hard and requires time to compete with the established brands, so no critique of the state of the arc lineup.",but marketing managed to trick people into thinking it's more than it really is.,"maybe there's a fix, and i hope for you there is, but otherwise you might be better off switching to nvidia or amd for a daily driver.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
return it and get a 6600.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well return it, intel gpus are very unstable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
buy a real gpu instead?,:d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thatâ€™s the fun part, you donâ€™t ðÿ¤“",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can i ask how % performance wise does re size bar make a difference for intel gpus.,on my 3070 the difference is very very marginal like 2-5 fps,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel drivers are problematic and have severe issues.,either you reolace it with nvidia or amd gpu or just bear with the issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i fixed the stuttering of my arc 770 by enabling a frame cap via rtss (the msi afterburner overlay software) cause the vsync of the card did not remove the stuttering.,i still highly recommend to enable rebar though like the other comments suggest.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do people not read reviews or what intel even says themselves?,you guys are literally beta testing intel gpus.,"drivers have been horrendous, issues all over the place.",intel gpu software sucks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i found a new problem with my gpu i see these random burning like things on my screen and my screen flickers.,after i turned on rebar.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rebar is a must for those cards they work like shit without it i would recommend returning that and getting an amd card considering prices are low and they slightly perform better in raster than nvidia.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have adaptive sync on but not rebar on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there's literally no suggestion of a fix here and all this comment is is just hate against intel.,it's not helpful to the poster at all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i turned it on before i turned it on it was averaging about 200fps when i turned it on it was about 280 fps on valorant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
an rx 6600 is 100 dollars more than how much i bought the arc a380 so i don't think that's a great idea.,but thanks for the suggestion.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"or just use intel for integrated, itâ€™ll run minecraft and valorant!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"what can i replace it for within the same price range and better performance, because i do know that the performance of the intel arc a380 is seriously underwhelming because of the horrendous drivers limiting the power draw from the gpu.",i think it's about more than 50% is locked prefromance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't think it's returnable now since in my country retailers are real picky.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there's not typically a massive difference in average fps between rebar on and off, but there can be incredibly bad stuttering.",to the point of literally being unplayable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you oc?,"if so, undo it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i somewhat fixed it by enabling rebar but now my screen is showing some kind of bug like it's burning the screen or something...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i couldn't really do anything since in my country it's the only gpu near it's msrp price.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
does your motherboard support rebar?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
give it a test with any more demanding games?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel gpus need that rebar bad.,so crazy.,easy fix though!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that isn't hateful against intel, it's factual, fair, and even defends intel

if you want a problem free experience, intel is not the gpu to buy.","if you enjoy tinkering, intel *is* the gpu to buy.","in a roundabout way, parent telling op to buy a different brand *is* a problem solve.",the only other alternative is to wait 6-12 months for intel drivers to mature,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's the cheapest decent card on the market, anything cheaper is not really worth it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"then try to get re-bar turned on, also full driver reinstall using ddu to remove them.","intel gpus lose about 40% performance without re-bar

also what you can do is setting game graphics to lowest, or not playing games that are too demanding but you probably already thought of that.",what game is stuttering?,"arc a380 only has barely enough performance to run cyberpunk 1080p lowest setting at 40-50fps, with re-bar on.",without re-bar unplayable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on what you intend to use for the gpu.,"if you are a content creator, maybe a rtx 3060 12gb or radeon 6600/6650 would do just fine.",also these are acceptable for 1080p gaming.,i do not have these cards but i do have a 3080ti upgrade from my 980ti.,just google the internet for gpu reviews.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"do you have a black screen with an ""_"" ?",i had that on my system and fixed that by disabling the arc gpu in the bios so the bios can boot without the black screen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a msi b520 pro vh?,so i think it does.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i will try once i get my 1tb hdd i bought.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but you're wrong to say that.,the poster did not ask about your opinion about intel products.,he was looking for help.,essentially telling him he should buy something else or that he wasted his money is not help,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i turned on rebar earlier and now the stuttering stopped a bit but now there's a different problem these burn like marks that expands when you're in google, facebook, almost all sites, can you tell me what the problem is?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't really play much triple a games only esports titles so i don't really see a much need for anything much better than a 1650 super,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would oc do good too?,like upping the power draw since i get about 45 watts max on power draw without oc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes a520 motherboards do support rebar according to msi.,"[https://www.msi.com/blog/improve-performance-with-resizable-bar-now-available-for-msi-geforce-rtx-30-series-graphics-cards](https://www.msi.com/blog/improve-performance-with-resizable-bar-now-available-for-msi-geforce-rtx-30-series-graphics-cards)

intel gpus absolutely need rebar to be turned on in order to perform as intended.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no it was like random burns or dots that look like burns kept appearing in my screen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"nice, good luck with everything.","remember, though you are paying the early adopter tax, most of the issues, and performance in general should get better over time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you have a solution for op?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if he wants a hassle free gpu buying something else is his only option.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, that or a used gtx 1070 would be the best option around that price range.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sounds like artifacts you get by overclocking, you can check if the clocks of the card are higher than base, and you may want to check the pcie and power connectors.","if this is all ok you can try to change the pcie gen manually to pcie 3 or 4 (in bios) and see if that fixes it, otherwise i don't think i can help you with that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
without re-bar on it won't help much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would oc it also be good?,since i get a maximum of 45 power draw not even close to the max 75 watts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh sorry it's a520m pro.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how do i access the bios menu on a msi b520m pro vh tho?,f5?,or del,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

do i set the pci_e2 lanes configuration or the pci_e2 gen switch to gen 3?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it lessened the artifacting but is still artifacting on opera gx,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes it should.,from what i know you will get more performance on the a380  by increasing the power limit rather than the gpu clock speed [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbepsi1jdra&t=296s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbepsi1jdra&t=296s),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok cool.,"so like pat said, you can flash the bios from the msi website for your board if need be and enable rebar.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
does anyone?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
usually del or f2 on boot up before windows starts to load.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, i boot my card with gen 3 but if you can, try setting it to gen 4 first as it has some performance gains if it works for you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,the fix was to turn rebar on.,"https://www.reddit.com/r/intel/comments/z9n6la/how_do_i_stop_my_intel_arc_a380_from_stuttering/iyhjy0e/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3

"tldr:
while nvidia users have been enjoying hardware ray-tracing with the blender 3d modelling software for years, the ray-tracing support for amd radeon and intel arc graphics is still coming together.","amd expects to post a patch for early design review soon, but it's not clear yet if it will be ready for blender 3.5 or end up being pushed back further.","on the intel oneapi ray-tracing front, intel engineers are planning to have their ray-tracing support ready for blender 3.6.   

blender 3.4 is expected to be released next week on 7 december while blender 3.5 is expected for release on 15 march.",blender 3.6 meanwhile should be out next summer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i love blender and all the features they have, but this really needs to come sooner.","i donâ€™t know if itâ€™s the blender developersâ€™ faults or amdâ€™s fault, but itâ€™s not a good look for amd.",they also really need to add the basic feature of light linking.,itâ€™s a necessity for any serious work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ugh.,this wouldnâ€™t an issue if every one just could get along and use the same api.,"but no, there is forever a battle between nvidia, amd, intel and now even arm and apple too.","we have metal, vulkan, directx, opengl fighting for rendering apis, we have cuda, opencl, oneapi, hip, directcompute fighting over compute apis.",and the end result is software and drivers that are fragmented as shit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can anyone explain what exactly hardware rt is (to someone who has intermediate computer knowledge)?,"i understand optix, hip, oneapi are all ways manufacturers have decided to implement the processing it takes to render a ray-traced scene, what do those apis do differently than, say, cpu rendering?","i can technically render a rt scene on my cpu, it just takes longer.",i know itâ€™s a broad question but iâ€™d love to understand hardware applications better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"any thoughts, or you're here just to copy/paste links?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this is to leverage raytracing hardware that is present on modern graphics cards, which will be much faster than using more general purpose processing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i honestly donâ€™t know what exactly rt hardware is, but i assume that it is simply a special dedicated blocks for operations which are most frequently used in raytracing.","for example, it could be a block which checks whether a ray intersects a triangle or not.",those apis you mentioned are likely able to detect that special hw presence and use it instead of doing the same thing regular way (which is slower),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"85-95 celsius is not an unusual temperature for an i7-10700k, especially when taking into account intel's turbo boost.",that is expected during the boost phase.,"however, your motherboard could also have the cpu power limits unlocked, causing a prolonged cpu boost that causes those temperatures.",you may want to try to disable it.,"i think asus calls it ""multi core enhancement"" in bios.","another thing you could try would be to repaste the cpu/cooler, with a high quality paste, like the noctua nh1 or nh2.",also make sure your case airflow is good.,what's the temperature of the rest of the components ?,"now, is that ok ?","well, it's not ""recommended"" for the cpu to stay above 90-95 celsius for prolonged hours, as that degrades the chip longterm, but it's not catastrophic.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's abnormal for gaming.,what i can see that the case has a very old design and no top fan.,it's possible that the rear fan can't exhaust enough hot air from the cpu and gpu as the both dissipate approximately 350w during playing games.,what you can do to check it - open the case and put it on the right side and have a look at temps then.,"also use hwinfo instead of msi so you can see max voltage, temps, and clocks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thats high for gaming.,i would repaste and make sure you've got good mounting pressure on your cooler.,i have a 10700k 5.2 all core and my temps are no where near that.,also check motherboard settings auto voltages can be excessive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
update: i realised that the rear fan (the one right behind the cpu and gpu was on the wrong side so i repasted the cpu fan and flipped the fan now the cpu temps are 70-80c and gpu 75-80c.,thank you all for helping!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would it possibly get better if i added more fans?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it does seem abnormal in gaming load though.,even with unlocked power limits on a nd d15 hitting 95c in a game seems warm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

getting trapped in upgrades on the same platform is one of the biggest pit falls of intel's tik tok.,"you would gain more in gaming by selling your current mobo and cpu,and  switching to a 12400 and new motherboard or even a 13600k for a little more.",unless you need the extra pcie lanes and such found on the x299 platform,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

really depends on either the games you play or what you do with your computer.,do you see your cpu usage pegged at a 100% when your gpu usage isn't?,then you might be bottlenecked by your cpu.,do you multitask a lot of cpu intensive applications?,then more cores will be beneficial.,"if you play a game that's single-threaded, you probably won't see much gain.",i think your 7800x is probably going to be fast enough for most games for the next few years.,i'd probably save the money you would spend on a cpu upgrade for your current platform and put it towards an upgrade to a 13th or 14th gen motherboard and cpu in a few years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what are good new gen budget friendly motherboards you or others highly recommend?,thanks for all the help.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no.,chips are not damaged by high temperatures.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there's nothing wrong here.,"look at your core clocks, they are boosting up to 5.9ghz.",what you are looking at is effective clock speed.,i'm not too well versed in this but see the link below for the explanation on the difference.,https://www.hwinfo.com/forum/threads/effective-clock-vs-instant-discrete-clock.5958/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nah you fucked something up cuz i see that your highest p core clock was 5.9. stock is 5.8. clear cmos.,or try to reflash the bios,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you set avx offset to zero?,"if yes, then set it back to -1, it's how it's bugged in 13th gen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all components brand new - wondering what could be the issue here?,"this happened at stock bios, tried changing other settings here and there, not much different.",any clues as to what's going on here?,bios showed the correct 55 and 58 clock speeds for the pcores.,no voltage changes or modifications.,"right before this, i had a 13600k in there that did 5.6ghz so i'm not sure what could be the case.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sorry, should've mentioned this is clock speeds after cinebench run, where your clock speed will hit max.",you want your effective to match your clock.,they are way off here.,"i got it close to 5.4 using xtu aito tune, surprisingly.",i'm going to reflash bios and reinstall windows.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you have a z690 board.,did you install updated intel management engine firmware?,this is not part of the bios update process.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't see this as an option in msi bios?,i reflashed bios and same issue as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this still wouldn't guarantee that the effective clock will always show the max.,the polling rate of hwinfo will take the average of all clock states across a given interval and if anything happens within that interval it can affect your shown effective clock.,"to quote martin at hwinfo:

""steady 100% utilization doesn't guarantee that.","the maximum clock reached depends on several factors (power, current, silicon fitness limits, temperature).","so when either of those limits are hit, the clock will be reduced and this might fluctuate so frequently that it's not captured by the instant clocks.""",your cb23 score is pretty much within the margin of error for a 13900k.,were you running the application in exclusive mode to get some extra points?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just installed it - doesn't make a difference?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m replacing my 12700k with a 13900k next week but keeping my msi z690 edge board.,"aside from flashing my bios, what do i need to do before i make the hardware upgrade?",is the me update something i need to download from intelâ€™s website?,or is just checking for updates and optional updates in the windows settings enough to catch it?,my boot drive is on my m.2_cpu slot so iâ€™m hoping to not bork it and have to move the ssd around.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you need to set oc explore mode to expert.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, it won't, which is an issue.","clock stretching, throttling, etc will cause it to not match.",but you want it to match.,"common misconception is when people look at core clocks thinking they overclocked properly, when their effective clocks won't even reach that high.",cb will push it to the max.,"you should always hit it, from an overclocker's perspective.",i'm just coming from ryzen so i wasn't sure if i needed to do something on intel.,"that's not margin of error either, 3k points is huge.","like i said, xtu ""fixed"" it where i hit 40k points, hit 93 degrees, and reached 5.4/4.4.",so i know something funky is going on,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a while back these posts were all the rage with the management engine.,i donâ€™t have one but they were saying there were two me updates.,you have to go to them and hit â€œsee moreâ€ or similar and it will show you the other you need.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thereâ€™s both windows drivers and firmware.,typically a mysteriously underperforming 13th gen cpu on a 12th gen motherboard is related to old me firmware.,i think using certain xtu versions can have an issue (something about configuring power limits also reducing maximum attainable frequency).,"perhaps since the op did have another model cpu installed for a time, a full cmos clear might be worthwhile.",beyond that i have no idea.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's on expert.,there isn't any avx offset option,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there needs to be, 1:48 https://youtu.be/igjr9xmncjw",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"right before this, i had a 13600k that i mildly oc'd to 5.6ghz just fine... so i don't think that could be it?",but i'll look for that as well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
found out after updating bios on asus z690m prime for 13th gen support without me firmware update resulted in nvme not being recognized and xmp profile not working.,only after i updated the me firmware was it fixed.,so yes me firmware is very important when doing bios updates.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yup, potential symptoms of using 12th gen me firmware with a 13th gen cpu include:

- unexplained performance deficit (no limits being reached)
- broken xmp profiles
- cpu connected nvme slots may not work
- issues with igpu (particularly using in conjunction with dgpu)
- missing bios features/options

i think which issues hit which people depends on just how old the me firmware is.","itâ€™s updated rather regularly, even though most people in the past have never updated it.","even if they knew about such a possibility, itâ€™s the old â€œdonâ€™t fix what ainâ€™t brokeâ€ philosophy.","however with frequent security updates and whatâ€™s gone on with alder/raptor lake (which i think is the first time this scenario has occurred), iâ€™m starting to think me should be updated whenever the bios is, assuming an update is available.","i know for asus boards, the me firmware is shared by all 600/700 models.","bioses are written with a particular major me firmware version in mind; for example asus recommends using me 16.0.x for all older alder lake-only bioses, and 16.1.x for raptor lake supporting bioses.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ah, cpu ratio offset when running avx?",set that -1?,iâ€™ll give it a shot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
correct.,"also, for given frequency your vddq is awfully high.","like, reaaally.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
msi does their me firmware through bios updates,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">me firmware 

where do you get me then?",i thought bios was all i needed to be up to date...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this thread has everything.,"people telling you itâ€™s ok

people telling you it doesnâ€™t matter

people telling you itâ€™s too low

and of course the people telling you you shouldnâ€™t upgrade from a 12900k

grats on the new toy.",have fun.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i purchased mine retail.,got a 110/83 :) :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you mustve won the lottery being able to afford a 13900k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am not even sure what mine is but oc to 5.7p and 4.5 e with 1.29 v,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13900k below 100 doesn't seem good from what i've seen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if you have good cooling you just enabled mce for remove the power limits and it will stay at 5.5 ghz tell me its not enough.....",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,1.443v is too high for raptor lake.,usually the chip runs at <1.3â€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

can anybody explain to me what sp is?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nope, average.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is bullshit that my msi force wifi board doesnt have any function like this.,but.,based on my undervolt.,"i think i got a decent chip, i can at least run it with no power limits and +1 on all the p cores and wont thermal throttle with a 280mm nzxt z63 aio cooler.",it did require quite the undervolt to tame this beast on a 280mm aio but i did manage it with a slight oc as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"depends on how well it overclocked, not on the sp score really.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you should still upgrade twice a day for y2k ðÿ¤“ðÿ¤¦â€â™‚ï¸ðÿ¤£,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, you just spent a bunch of cash.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my 12900k is sp 97 and cooler is 175â€¦.,"but oc the 8 raptor cove cores individually (ex:6,6,5.8,5.8,5.7,5.7,5.6,5.6) and 16 gracemonts from 4.6-4.2 (trust me i was running everything at 5.3&4.3-obviously the coolest running cores-the higher frequencies)

you are in golden territory though!",!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what so is an upgrade worth it from 12900k to 13900k if you sell 12900k?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you have an average chip based on overclockers forum- my total sp is 107 with p cores 115 and e cores 91- golden is 110+ sp,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how did you get it so cheap?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i see your running an asus board i canâ€™t figure out how to get to bios what method did you use to get there?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mine is 115 sp and iâ€™ve hit 6.1 with it easily.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can you get this data without booting to the uefi bios?,can you use a utility to get it in windows?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my p core sp is 114.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m pushing it for o 6 ghz when lightly loaded up to 2 cores.,5.7 on up to 4 cores.,and then 5.5 on all cores.,i probably could push it to 5.6 all core but i donâ€™t need to.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i believe sp is based on how low the temperature is on ur cpu is at boot up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what do those numbers mean?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you!,yeah i got it for $350 so not a bad upgrade.,$300 off  lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean they are right 12900k is fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
damn you lucky mf lol.,nice my 12900k was 78 but this one is 96 i was shocked lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same... bought on release date and got 110/88.,i assume after a while intel starts holding back good chips for the ks variants.,so maybe it's the advantage of buying early.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you new to reddit ?,?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

damnnnnn nice dude,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
asus' intel boards have the ability to readout and display the voltage/frequency curve as programmed into the cpu by intel at the factory.,"it's interesting because every individual cpu has their own unique v/f for every p-core, e-core cluster, cache/ring and even the integrated memory controller.",the predicted overclockability of the cpu is condensed into a single rating known as the sp which serves 2 purposes: as an input for the ai oc autoaoverclocking feature and for extreme overclockers to be able to bin cpus quickly and accurately.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mine is 116/85,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s a maximus ai ocing approximation based on your cpu cooler and cpu performanceâ€¦my 10700k was a 72 lmao,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
haha yeah i work pretty hard and have no expenses.,thanks lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
damn you probably have a 100+ sp with that voltage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably not safe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
umm well right now i have to break the thermal paste in so she runs a little hot.,but i see a max of 81c playing warzone,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
f12 with a usb stick plugged in takes a screenshot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a better sp will request less voltage and run cooler.,the really good chips present vids of 1.35v or so.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> tell me its not enough.....

when will you guys learn.","there is no such thing as ""enough.""",only justifications for not spending more/already having the best available at the current moment in time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean stock speeds is 5.5 anyway no overclocked needed 5.5 all core 5.8    2 core,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
silicon prediction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
estimation of chip quality based on how low the vid is.,it kinda predicts overclocking potential.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nope got it on a discount lol $300 off baby,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and it was pocket change so it didnâ€™t matter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
got my 12900k for free sold it for $300 and used it to buy the 13900k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i noticed a difference between the two.,1% lows are better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
f2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not bad, i'm pretty close.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"asus has an exclusive algorithm that calculates how good your silicon quality in your chip is which translates to how well it can overclock 

70-80 =shit 
80-90= alright but below average
90-100= average 
100 -110= great 
110+= golden chip 

the p cores and e cores have different scores since they are different ccds.",e cores will always be lower than p cores,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
â€¦.what?,did you reply to the wrong comment?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not if itâ€™s $300 off lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hahahah i am lol you know what im happy with this score my 12900k was 78. ill take this nice upgrade lool,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you use your analrapist degree for this insight?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you know if that readout is exclusive to asus boards?,is it possible to check it via another method in non asus boards?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"quick question about memory, whats the optimal speed and latency.",i tried reading and ended up a rabbit hole of 2 vs 4 dimms and different opinions on it.,i like 4 cause of the look but  people say its wrong.,i got a gift card from bb so i will most likely purchase everything from them if that matters.,could do another vendor for memory if needed be.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i suppose that isnâ€™t terrible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thats what im saying you dont need manual overlocl because the cpu already coming with a insane factory overclock that doing 5.5 ghz all.cores.,so sp predictions is not so important anymore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well you are right but i oc my with 1.29v at 5.7 p and 4.5 e cores.,temps are just fine under cinabench r23 87c max.,i have to say my multiscore is 41550,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you need to reset your sp and you're not going to like this one bit.,"your sp gets glitched if you install a cpu with an old management engine (me) firmware on z690
first, upgrade your me firmware with the patcher.","if you have dual bios you need to do this on both bios chips

https://rog.asus.com/forum/showthread.php?126385-firmware-intel-me-(h610-b660-h670-z690-b760-h770-z790)

then, flash your bios to the latest version for your board.","not sure if it's on the asus support site, the motherboard forum section here or rog forums or not.",make sure you flash both bios chips (you can use usb flashback to avoid annoyances).,"the current me version should be kept, if it's not , check the bios boot screen for the version after upgrading.",now you need to remove the cpu.,"first, before you remove the cpu, power off the system, unplug/switch off the psu and then clear the cmos by either the onboard jumper or the clr rtc/jumper blocks (you can use a spare ln2 board jumper if there's one available or a screwdriver if there is no back button).",hold the clear cmos down for 30 seconds.,then immediately remove the cpu completely.,then clear cmos again with the cpu removed.,"now, attempt to power on the system with the cpu removed.","of course nothing will happen, but this is to make sure everything is cleared.","then re-insert the cpu, clear cmos again 30 seconds.","then finally, re-do the thermal paste, install the cooler, plug in the psu and boot the system.",the sp should now be reported correctly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you kind sir,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wdym,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just curious why did you upgrade from a 12900k to 13900k?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
where did he get that degree at?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's exclusive to asus.,msi has a far more primitive version called cpu force 2 on their motherboards which scores cpus based on their voltage and temperature in bios while at stock clocks/voltages.,"in that scoring system, a typical 13900k scores 150 points (according to sug0ilover who binned many chips) with above average chips scoring lower - 140, 130, 120, 107 (sug0i's golden sample) etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s exclusive to rog maximus afaik-not just asus itself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
haha nah not a baller just manage my money well lol.,yeah true.,also does your 13900k run at a all core 5.5 on the p cores?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, should get better over time.",plus my room was already hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no problem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to be fair, he already has the mobo for it, so itâ€™s a strait swap, and you can still sell a 12900k for about 75% of the value of a 13900k

even if it is silly for someone to spend so much on a used 12900k, here we are.","so the actual upgrade cost is really quite cheap, and the increase in performance is quite significant",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got my 12900k for free and decided to sell it for $300 so i that profit to the 13900k and got it for $350,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
got my 12900k for free sold it for $300,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the explanation!,i assume i have no way to get this information on an asrock board?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not quite.,it there on my strix and formula.,not sure where you got that information from but it's wrong.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no one buys 12900ks second hand for that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how did you get a free 12900k?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12900k is still only $60 cheaper than 13900k in western canada.,a little cheaper for black friday sales.,people see an i9 and see 600 instead of 800 prices.,add to that they are available used.,yes there is definitely a substantial market of people who will purchase them for 75% of the cost.,not understanding that 13700 and even 13500 in some cases would be just as good.,they just see i9 unlocked.,"factor in release 12900k that didnâ€™t have avx disabled on chip,  there are even informed people with certain needs that would leap at a og 12900k at 25% cheaper than a 13900k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in my experience with my asus prime z170-a (didnâ€™t feature it, also was much more bland uefi-but otherwise very similar) maximus rog hero z490, & z690â€¦.and afaik is an acronym for as far as i know-but now i know that the rog strix mobos also feature it!",thank you!,iâ€™m guessing itâ€™s an rog feature then?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
friend bought it for me as a birthday gift when it came out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not sure.,i wonder if the z690 prime guys have it.,i only have the rog strix and rog formula so i wouldnâ€™t know about other models in the range,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it would take some research on asusâ€™ website that i will put in laterâ€¦.,i wanna play some cp2077 lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
donâ€™t think itâ€™s quite that clear cut.,intel has had 2 generations in the span of amdâ€™s one.,"- 2020 5950x - 2022 7700x: 3 points spread
- 2019 3950x - 2022 7700x: 19

- 2021 12900k - 2022 13900k: 1
- 2021 11900k - 2022 13900k: 12
- 2020 10900k - 2022 13900k: 23

(someone else can do the math on actual percentage increase if they want, but the relative difference isnâ€™t going to change).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm not comparing amd and intel, both were pretty low but not surprising considering how far these architectures have already come.",but there's threads talking about 15% ipc gains and i think ppl must be confusing performance with factory clockspeeds,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your percentages are wrong.,the 10900k is 77% the performance of the 13900k.,this means that the 13900k is 30% faster than the 10900k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cinebench is a really poor benchmark for measuring gains from added l2/l3 caches.,"cb15 especially completely ignores cache and is only measuring raw math performance, which is not the whole picture of a cpu's performance gains gen over gen.

a cb15 run is only good at telling you how fast a cpu can run cb15.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you miss the point,  all architectures keep up with the status quo for 50 years, if one company was way off would be weird, nobody cares if a release schedule is a few months this way or that.","they are always similar ipc

"yes and no, with alder lake premiere even i7 got completely obsolete and a waste of money and i5s value became questionable, as they lost to even 12100f.",so it became a better idea to just sell whatever you had and jump on 12th gen anyway.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you want to use the system for a long time, say 5+ years, definitely spend extra for the 13600k.","it's a good increase in performance over the 12600k, and if you want to upgrade your gpu in the future you don't have to worry about any cpu bottleneck.","if you do anything that relies on multi-threaded performance, the 13600k is also easily worth it as it improved a lot in that area.","if you buy a new system every 2-3 years, you might as well just save the money.",you're probably going to be gpu bound (if you're using it for games) in most cases meaning the cpu won't give a huge boost.,"also the 12600k should definitely last you this time, probably even longer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it depends on various factors, but i'd go ddr5 for future proofing alone.",ram has a long lifespan and can go through several builds.,"for example, i preordered the i7-6700k and built my first ddr4 system using a 16gb kit (2x 8gb) pc3200 ram.","i added another 32gb kit in 2019 and carried that memory over to my ryzen 5800x system in 2020. i normally wouldn't wait as long as i did between the 6700k & 5800x, but life happened so i skipped a build.","as far as performance goes, if you compare a high performance ddr4 kit to a low performance ddr5 kit, sure, they'll be around the same performance.","however, just like when i built my 6700k, i could have went with 2133/2400 ddr4 memory but i spent the extra to get 3200. just like if i were to go with ddr5 now, i'd go with a 64gb kit (2x 32gb) at no less than 6000 with a cas of 30 or 32. 

just remember ddr4 is end-of-life and you have no path forward with it, so if you decide to go with ddr4, i wouldn't put much money into a fancy rgb kit or anything.",i'd just go with a kit of 3600 and call it done.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

indeed.,i have a feeling these 11700k's aren't going to last as long as our 4790k's did.,"i still have a few users who ""refuse"" to let go of their 4790k even though i have a 11700k sitting here waiting for them.","i hate these 11700k systems, tried to build them on a budget so non-modular psu's, h570 instead of z570 mainboards, sata m.2 instead of nvme, etc.","for what they are used for, they are painfully slow, mainly due to the shitty m.2 drives.",the software we use will eat up 32gb like it's nothing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 13600k (and remember the â€œkâ€ part is important to mention) is somewhat better than the 12700k.,"the 13600k is 6p8e and the 12700k is 8p4e, however performance is similar, but unless the 12700k is markedly cheaper than the 13600k, the 13600k is the better buy.","the 12600k (6p4e)will basically be somewhat faster than a 13400 (also 6p4e), but possibly not as fast as a 13500 or 13600 (6p8e, but none of those 3 are out yet).",itâ€™s also important to note that only 13600k and higher are true raptor lake parts with the generational improvements.,"all models below that are tweaked alder laker silicon, and while theyâ€™re markedly better than the comparable 12th gen models, there is a benefit to getting the 13600k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the thing is that amd at least has an edge in the gaming market.,"the 5800x3d is still very capable and performant â€“ and fits on dirt-cheap, old boards with ddr4 memory.","it's a no-brainer upgrade for all amd users and even when buying new, it's a good value choice because you can literally take the cheapest board and ddr4 ram you can find without any performance impact.",the release of the new 7000 series x3d cpus are already scheduled for next year.,"if they are anything like the 5800x3d, then intel is absolutely under pressure, as there is nothing in the intel pipeline that can match those cpus in gaming.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ddr4 support is the one competitive advantage intel has right now.,"for anyone  that upgrades every five years or so and is coming from a build that already has ddr4, raptor lake is an excellent choice.","for those that upgrade more often, say, every 1-3 years, then buying into am5 now and making the jump to zen6 in 2025 or 2026 is a much wiser investment.","upgrade path aside, am5 is just flat out a better platform than lga1700 given the additional pcie 5.0 support.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel are financially shaky at the moment, amd is not.","intel are probably smarter in this respect, knowing gamer's who already have ddr4 can buy new motherboards.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"especially since current mobo/ram memory controllers probably wonâ€™t even support those speeds so am5 people will have to upgrade as well, seeing that the 7950x is already struggling to get 7000+ on ddr5",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'd say the reason productivity has taken a backseat is due to the performance in general.,all but the absolute slowest cpus take care of most productivity tasks fast enough that unless you're doing it professionally it's just not worth getting a higher end cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the increased cache and lack of infinity fabric style arch seems to result in intel still seeing near ddr5 (base speeds) performance with ddr4 kits.,"so for budget builds, it really is an advantage.","people can reuse their 3200/3600 ddr 4 kits, and save $250 in ddr5/motherboard costs and get very similar performance out of a chip like the 13400. which will beat the entire zen 3 lineup aside from 5800x3d.",for cheap.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s the real tradeoff involved with long support for a socket: youâ€™re tied to the choices you made at the start.,"so amd had to rip the ddr5 bandaid off with am5, since they plan to support that socket for 5+ years like they did with am4.","on the other hand, since intel switches sockets every other year, they can afford to support ddr4 & ddr5 simultaneously on their current socket, and delay ripping that bandaid off until 14th gen when the ddr5 market is more mature.",the upside for the intel strategy is that you can target more price points with the same platform.,the upside to the amd strategy is that it makes it possible for users to upgrade their systems down the line for a much lower price.,"on the whole, i think the optimal target is probably somewhere in the middle, likely on the order of 3-4 generations, instead of 2 or 5+.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the whole 3d v-cache situation is super interesting to me.,intel at least had the capacity of doing the same thing.,they added edram to the i7 5770c back in the day pretty much just because it would have been a pos without it.,so i'm surprised that they just let amd eat their lunch on that front.,"but amd, by releasing the 5800x3d kinda cannibalized their own 7000 series chips.","it seems to me like everybody has the ability to add these huge cache systems, and knows it's pretty much the silver bullet for gaming, but really don't want to release products that have it unless they feel like they have to.",and when they do neither company seems very good at assessing it's market position.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cheapest boards won't run 5800x3d at its full capacity.,let's not misinform people.,5800x3d requires decent to high end mobo too just like intel counter parts.,x3d variant is expensive compared to 12600k and 13600k.,"they perform similar in gaming, x3d is faster in some and around 30%-50% slow in multicore/production tasks.",given pricing of x3d and 13600k you are always better off buying 13600k even for gaming.,edit : well am done explaining this.,"everybody is just guessing and claiming.. no source, just parroting what someone said.",there is one source from amd unboxed and am not surprised that its the only source.,thank you everyone for participating in the game of *no actual proof*.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for gaming yes overall 5800xd is useless  even zen4 xd will not be able to beat raptor lake with high memory speeds or highly tunned ram and just need another zen moment intel is even planning lunch a raptor lake refresh and push meteor lake to 2024 since amd will not be able to match with raptor lake performance at gaming and overall,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i donâ€™t think it has anything to do with intelâ€™s finances.,ddr2 and ddr3 where both supported by amd and intel during the transition period.,ddr4 support was first added by intel on haswell hedt where price sensitivity was not a problem.,consumer skylake released after that still supports ddr3 memory.,"without hedt/server leading the adoption of ddr5, it is a sensible move by intel to both support ddr4 and ddr5 and it probably paid back, when ddr5 was barely available at launch.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

as much as 13% is good from gen to gen. the price just isn't good at all.,"the cpu is $50 increase across the board, the motherboards are another $50 - 100. and ontop of that, they only support ddr5, which is another $50 - 100 across the board.","piles it all together, they are $150 more expensive for similar performance compared to intel's platform.",how do you expect 13% to be enough?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"zen 4 isn't a bad improvement gen-on-gen, but amd's priced it out of competitiveness thanks to hugely expensive motherboards.",the mediocre io-die situation is also pretty appalling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no joke... where was this guy when intel only progressed 5% in 4 years across 4 generations and changed the socket 3 times in the process.,skylake to comet lake was nothing more than more cores and a few instruction sets.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

does it though?","you already can't overclock, so if the vrm holds fine at stock, then that's it.","cheap amd mobos support fast ddr4 ram anyway, so the high end option is more about io with a 5800x3d.","sure, check if the mobo you are getting has good vrm, but that's pretty much it with 5800x3d",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not really.,"cheap boards are doing fine, same as cheap ram.",especially when you look at real-world performance.,"the beauty of the 5800x3d is that the overall system costs less than a 12600k or 13600k system, as they require more expensive ram and more expensive mainboards to perform well.","people upgrading often need to buy only a new cpu, while upgrading to an alder or raptor lake system also requires at least a new mainboard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
