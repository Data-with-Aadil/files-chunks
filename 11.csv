good luck guys.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do we have any idea how they will compare to existing gpus yet?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel shouldâ€™ve been very clear about the release timeline.,i think they still can be transparent about it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the lack of vram makes me sad, though i'm not sure what i should've expected from the bus widths.",wish 8-12gb was standard because 4gb is proving not to be enough and 6gb is next,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iirc the high end is supposed to be up around 3080 tier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
existing in may 2022 or april 2024 when they are actually available?,ðÿ¤£,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this century.,stay tuned.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they already went transparent with it.,they told that early summer desktop gpus will be launched as oem only in china.,then in late summer launch oem only worldwide.,"then ""later"" launch as standalone gpus.","(so one could expect october/november for this)

overall it seems like they really really want to have most of the driver issues sorted out before releasing standalone gpus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no way.,it's 3070 level hardware with unpolished drivers.,expect 3060ti real-world performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you expect the first iteration of gpu to meet the halo products of established gpu manufacturers such as amd/nvidia?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and i honestly agree with their way of going right now.,why do people care so much that it only gets released in china.,"makes no difference if they release it worldwide now, or later.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
those were likely early laptop performance leaks at reduced clocks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,it has enough transistors at like 22 billion and already has rt performance better than nvidia or amd.,"it's tier 4 vs tier 3, and tier 2 for amd.",if you include the games where it crashes due to drivers to drag down averages it'll be like 3060ti levels.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's because raja koduri promised stuff.,"he promised the gpus will be ready early, in q1 2022. 
turned out to be a lie.",then he promised gpus in the hand of gamers for cheap - again a lie because they prioritize oem.,"people say intel gpu will be irrelevant if they launch after nvidia launches rtx 4000 and amd rx 7000. 
i don't think so because all the nvidia and amd products from new gen are gonna be 600$+(real price, not msrp).",intel's best gpu is supposed to be under 500$.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there are low end gpu out there, it is just the value is so bad that people ignore it.","with possible bad driver due to first launch, it will be irrelevant",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">he promised the gpus will be ready early, in q1 2022

he actually said that?",when?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't know for sure if it was him but there were messages from intel that arc gpu lineup will roll out in q1 2022.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

still could be hardware related.,so you have already done control panel e.t.c.,"uninstall the drivers, restart pc?.",you could also try driverstoreexplorer from github & delete the wifi drivers that way to remove older corrupt drivers.,personally it sounds like that random issue known to affect the motherboard io devices usb/wifi e.t.c.,: device manager > network adapter find the wifi device right click > property's > power management tab & uncheck the allow device to turn off to save power.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
had the same problem and randomly came across a post that told me to try the windows button + l. it logs you out of your account and sometimes can fix the wifi.,"worked instantly for me when nothing else worked, including reinstalling the drivers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you ever find a permanent solution?,iâ€™ve seen myself and many others online with the same problem with this wifi card.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this happened to me when i updated to windows 11. i used an ethernet cable to access the internet and i went to intel's website [https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/intel-driver-support-assistant.html](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/intel-driver-support-assistant.html) and installed both updates rebooted my computer then went to change adapter settings in network & sharing center; right-click the wi-fi and click connect and it worked finally.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i took my laptop's back cover off and physically unplugged the wifi adapter card from the motherboard and plugged it back in.,works fine now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i also have an asus tuf gaming laptop and i have been facing the same issue repeatedly to the point where i now just use a lan cable to connect.,yet to find a permanent solution.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the driverstoreexplorer didn't help me, but i messed around in the regedit and now the wifi is working.",i have to test whether the problem arises again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's a known software problem and frustrating!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nope.,a few days after posting this it stopped happening for sometime.,"i thought a windows update must have fixed it, but it came back last week.","i later experimented on this and found out that the wifi driver starts malfunctioning when an intensive process runs, taking up more memory and ram than usual, like games and youtube and stuff.",the problem stopped from occuring since yesterday idk how.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
making me nuts.,working a side gig on sundays on my own laptop and it just keeps recurring despite uninstalling and reinstalling drivers.,known microsoft problem.,grrrrr!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is not a good sign.,i used to do a full windows clean install when reg issues appear.,now i fix the issue & cmd prompt admin: gpupdate = sfc /scannow = dism /online /cleanup-image /checkhealth = dism /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth (ignore the = just a way to break it up without reddit messing up txt).,"doesn't fix them, just fixes the o/s part that causes them.... usually.",also if the last one runs into errors then use this one: dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth if no errors don't use it & close out of cmd prompt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">msi mode irq numbers

"hey, not sure if it works for everyone, but my friend and i were having this problem and eventually someone said â€œjust use an external wifi adapterâ€ so we both bought one (the kind that plugs into your usb port) and we stopped having this problem entirely.",the card is probably still malfunctional but (correct me if iâ€™m wrong) i believe it isnâ€™t used with an external adapter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh i don't know if it is a bad sign.,"yesterday i was network resetting and rebooting every 10 minutes, and earlier today i was totally lost as wifi was not working in the laptop.",but till now after i did the regedit i hadn't faced any issues.,i'll check whether this regedit change will help me in the long run and take steps accordingly.,"edit: nvm, it happened again, but only when i opened a game.",i got concerned with this issue when wifi started disconnecting when i started playing an online game in the first place.,"this happened with apex legends, valorant and osu, but nothing happened when i played cs:go.","i had uninstalled apex and valorant, thinking that either easy anticheat or riot vanguard was causing this issue, but it turns out to be the wifi driver itself.","i'm currently doing the sfc /scannow and network reset, hoping for the best",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

google as in chrome?,"oof man, in my experience it is subjectively the worst browser in terms of hogging system resources and even overall performance i've used, and i've used many more than most people have.",i would recommend trying a different browser.,just copy-paste the tabs from chrome to the other one and see how it goes.,personally i find vivaldi the easiest to recommend.,supports chromium extensions and is pretty flexible with lots of options.,currently i'm using waterfox as my main and have no complaints so far.,opera is pretty decent too and has a variant called opera gx that lets you manually set the limits of how much system resources it's is allowed to use.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[my x299 system](https://i.imgur.com/atipccr.jpg) is still chugging along.,think i'm probably going to jump into whatever is out there for intel or amd come late next year.,started this out with a silicon lottery 7820x that i snatched up for $500 back when.,"when the cascade lake-x processors dropped i figured i could get at least as much all core out of it that i had on the 7820x, so i snapped up a 10940x just because.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there is a small performance difference even when you open the power limits on 12700. take the k-series if you intend to overclock on the current i7.,on the i5 the k-series is just plain better this gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ah.,yes it could very well be true that some of those non-enthusiast boards cannot get to very high ram speeds.,"in the topic you linked they stated for example this: ""*if you meant system agent voltage, then we can manually change it on non k cpu alder lake with h670 mobos.","but h670, especially asus still have big problems with ram overclocking and even boot with xmp profiles like 4133 cl19*"" .",that is far above the 3400 mhz gear 1 score though.,still fast ram does not work on all boards.,"the board in question on that thread, in the official page, stated though that it should be supporting: 

""*dram overclocking performance*_x000d_  
***ddr4 oc 5333***_x000d_  
*improvements to trace routing design provide the latest intel processors with enhanced access to memory bandwidth.","asus optimem ii technology carefully maps memory signal pathways across different pcb layers to reduce path distance, and it adds shielding zones that significantly reduce crosstalk.","""*

correct.,in the link i posted above the i9-12900k with a 5.2ghz(p) \\ 4.2ghz(e) - ring @ 4.0ghz + ddr5-5600mhz shows the i9-12900k beating the 2990wx by 205 points.,that's really good considering the price difference and the fact that the amd 2990wx  has double the cores and more threads than the 12900k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

don't have anything custom like that just an h170i and to get 5.1 stable i had to put the vcore at 1.365 so i can't really push it more to get 5.2 i also had to put llc at level 5 to stop bsod,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

okay.,i didnâ€™t have to touch my voltages at all although when it set it to 5.2 all core i disable all turbo and boost setting so that it stays at 5.2 and 4.0 i have one core that will do 5.6 but itâ€™s not worth pushing just one core that high especially when iâ€™m stable at 5.2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"no shit it's silent, it's a passive cooler.",that's what passive means.,no fans so it's silent.,"the problem is that they tested it on an i3 7300t and the cpu ran hotter than the stock intel cooler, so this passive cooler is worse than the stock intel cooler at cooling an i3 7300t which is a 25w tdp cpu.","you are talking about using it with a 12400f which can run up to 120w in turbo boost mode, and you are talking about overclocking which doesn't even work on a 12400f, you'd need a 12600k.",an overclocked 12600k can easily push 150w peak consumption and there is absolutely zero chance you'll be able to cool that with a passive cooler.,"your best cost effective option will be a high end aio, 280mm (because 140mm fans are quieter than 120s found on a 360mm rad) but it won't be ""silent"".",you'll still have fan noise and maybe some small pump whine.,"the quietest cooling you can possible get is custom water cooling, but that gets awful expensive.","youd need to do your gpu as well, because gpu air coolers are noisy when running full load as well.","so unless you wanna drop 1k usd on a custom water cooling setup, i would stop being so picky about ""silent"" and get something that actually cools, not some passive cooler that can hardly keep an i3 7300t from overheating.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the numbers on pcpartpicker are uttterly meaningless, you need to look at decent third party reviews for things like noise level.","if you want silence at any price, get noctua.","if you want cheaper silence, bequiet.","getting that twin fan arctic is a good idea though, you can test it at 100% cpu with both on and then again with the rear one removed and go with the quietest setup.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thanks.,the second name i have proposed is the tuf gaming z690m-plus wifi d4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i liked the sabertooth model naming and design concept.,still have an x99 sabertooth.,that thing was a lot higher end then most of the current tuf boards.,and came with all those little plugs to close off unused slots / ports.,nice attention to detail.,"totally forgot it even had a gen3 m.2 slot - in 2015 m.2 wasnâ€™t particularly practical from a cost/size perspective, but suddenly realizing i could upgrade a 2015 pc to 3.8gb/sec storage?",priceless!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"gets complicated trying to do that especially if you want to maintain pcie gen 5 signaling, in this respect on the top would be gen 5 and the other would have to be fed from the chipset.",also based on the lane allocation it is not possible to do 8x from the chipset your limit would be 4x.,although depends on how you want to utilize the m.2 on the board ( as remember you only have 4 guaranteed from the cpu ).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i like it!,#teamtufgaming,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was waiting for asus tuf z690m d4 but since they didn't release it went for prime z690m d4.,could have got a better board coz its a matx build and option are so low.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and i thought it can be done simply because the z690 chipset has 12 pcie 4.0 lanes (16 for 3.0 revision).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
indeed.,what do you think of the pcie layout?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it all depends on where the lanes are going keep in mind those lanes can be used for a range of items like m.2 to io if you are going to pull that much then you are going to compromise on supporting other pcie enabled devices.,the bigger question is why do you feel you need this configuration?,also once you start to have more high speed pcie and multiple slots you have to account for more onboard circuity which increases cost and complexity ( like quick switches etc ),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"interesting but generally has limited value as the reality is most cards now are between 2 to 3 slots so still leave the really only the bottom slot available and it does not need to be electrical x16 as most would only install something like a capture card, sound card, or some type of networking or io which will be generally between 1x to 4x.",although if it supports pcie bifurcation you could do something like adding our hyper m.2 add-in card and have 4 m.2 ssds.,you also add safe slot design to all the slots which again would not really occur in this segment ( although it looks good ).,"on the strix board, you will see we favored a different design as what we find is users are wanting more m.2 even though it has minimal benefit compared to sata for general use, there is a preference for the ease of installation, no cables and trend of just faster pcie based storage.",what was your logic in this type of layout?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when the user wishes to add an x8 card at its x8 speed with the use of pch gen4 lanes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 2nd x16 slot fed x8 from the pch can be used for hyper m.2 card use as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the first and third x16 layout are fed by the cpu, while the second x16 slot is from the pch.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i do not see any user wanting to install an 8x card outside of a gpu which is nonexistent currently as there are essentially no multi gpu configurations anymore outside of something like a 3090 with nvlink and to support this would require bios support for a very niche configuration.,there are some professional add in card like raid controllers or specialized pcie storage but this is very niche and not sure it aligns the audience of tuf gaming.,i get what you were going after similar to some board i worked on with our ws team years ago but overall the use case is not strong - https://www.asus.com/us/commercial-servers-workstations/x99m\_ws/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

a very simple solution i found is that you have to connect controller before launching intel gaming access app.,first of all close the app completely.,even close the overwolf app from system tray.,then connect controller and after then launch the app and then launch the game.,it will track your gaming hours after that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yes, it can be used with any non-noctua too.",it is basically a resistor in series on voltage line to reduce the actual voltage to fan.,"fan speed may be controlled through pwm signals, but it ensures fan doesn't run at its maximum speed (12v fan may get max 11v for example).",in general it is not required for noctua fans.,"if your system really requires cpu fan to run at 100% speed (with 100% voltage) at any time, it might have not been cooled properly in pc case and ambient as per my experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah?,all the multithreaded loads in that review show similar performance deltas.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most overclocking is safe until you start pumping too much voltage into it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"don't know what ""level 1 core overclocking"" means.",is it some kind of pre-set specific to your board?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you think level two would be safe?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i donâ€™t know.,"i go into bios, advanced, performance option, and itâ€™s there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you have the proper cooling then yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
only thing i can think of with levels is the load line calibration settings.,how many other levels are there?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you need to mod your bios with the correct microcode to get avx512 back (in case of asus boards).,flashing an older bios wonâ€™t downgrade the microcode sadly.,"check the link in this comment:

â€¦so what are your thermals like?,voltages?,cpu power consumption?,cooling?,how old is the system?,"were you benchmarking the hour before the update, or just checking it out afterwards, and itâ€™s actually been a while?",what happens if you remove all overclocks - does the system work as expected?,what throttling reasons are being shown?,"and if nothing obvious, maybe post a full screenshot of hwinfo during a stress test demonstrating the issue.","i know youâ€™re blaming a windows update, but what youâ€™re seeing is not exactly a common issue to 21h2, and thereâ€™s not much info to go on otherwise.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had uploaded the hwinfo64 video of the effective core frequency dropping under full load to reddit with this post but i guess it didn't go through.,"the thermals, voltage and power consumption were fine, it even happened at stock stocks.","there were no throttling reasons, i also downloaded throttlestop in addition to checking hwinfo64 to see if/what the throttling reasons were.","no limit reasons were listed but when i would put the cpu under full load whether it be cinebench or a stress test, effective core frequency would drop and never reach the set multiplier, even at stock multipliers.",i've had this build since november/december 2021.  it worked fine for the first few days and then everything went downhill after i posted a screenshot of some memory oc results on reddit/overclock.net.,"after i posted screenshots, any time i tried to oc my ram to any other timings or frequency that was not xmp and stress test it while connected to the internet, ruxim/db install application and taskhost would pop up in task manager while testing and would cause an error.","when i deleted ruxim/db install application(nvidia related file) and taskhost files from the pc and re-ran the tests offline, they passed.",didn't have that issue before posting results.,then i upgraded to 21h2 because someone on reddit said 1903/1909/20h2 were eol and when i did the update to 21h2 that's when i started getting the effective core frequency issues.,"i restarted a bunch of times, different things kept showing up in task manager each re-boot such as rundll32, extra runtime brokers etc.",issue still occurred.,"i noticed that when the effective core frequency was dropping, i looked in task manager and each time while the cpu was under load, anti-malware executable was also using 3%-5% of cpu resources while under load(cinebench, stress tests etc).",i then disabled the anti-malware executable and restarted.,effective core frequency returned back to normal but then the cpu and ram kept failing stress tests(even though it previously passed all those tests without any errors at all).,"when i re-ran the tests and opened up task manager while testing, things like ruxim/taskhost/db install application would pop up again.",oobe broker would also pop up randomly from time.,"i also installed turbo vcore(asus software) and when i tried to raise cpu multipliers, it only let me raise multipliers for 8 out of the 10 cores(10850k).",the last 2 cores were greyed out and locked at 3.6ghz.,"if anyone is curious, my hardware was a z490 apex xii, i9-10850k, gskill ripjaws 2x16gb 4400mhz 17-18-18-38 1.5v ram kit.",cpu and gpu were both under liquid.,"the ram kit did the following frequencies with tuned subs:

edit: and in case any of the memory oc engineers here were wondering, yes i had compatibility telemetry disabled as recommended by overclockers when ocing memory.",whatever engineer on the other end pulling knobs while i was ocing kept reverting my registry changes and kept re-enabling telemetry to go off when connected to the internet.,"after having a day to reflect on this entire experience, it feels as though i was being artificially segmented when it came to oc performance and that my machine was not under my control.","never again, never again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

probably the best one you can use is 9900k.,"if you have z370 board, might have to do bios update, if z390 it should work out of box.",edit: but 9900k can be more expensive to buy than something like 12400 with b660 board.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"staying on the same board, either a 9700k or a 9900k.",both should be an improvement over a 8600k with the 9900k offering the biggest improvement.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think it is better to upgrade both to be honest, the board and the cpu, selling them should not be an issue and move into 12th generation is the wise thing to do , i had the same setup as you but i upgraded to 9900k while it was cheap and it was having several offers per month, and back then my 8600 was also worth some money, but now looking into the prices it is not wise to go for expensive 9900k while you can get 12th gene cpu with decent ram at the same price, with much better performance than the 9900k , if you could find 9700f maybe it is worth it to have 2 extra cores but you wonâ€™t have hyper threading if you need it for computing but for gaming it should be alright â€¦ but yeah changing cpu now is not totally worth as price to performance wise",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would defo just upgrade your motherboard and go 12th gen even a lower end i5 k or non k will be a massive jump on performance that'll probably last you 4-5 more years.,i wouldn't keep an 8th gen or go to 9 if you'll just end up paying close to the same price.,plus there are ddr4 boards still so you don't need to get ddr5 ram and keep what you already have.,i went from an i7 8086k to a i9 12900k and it's literally it biggest performance jump i've had after not upgrading in 5 years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that is true different software = different temps with the 12th gen vs prior & amd which are more in line with each other.,at least in my experience.,but you will find the difference is due to how often those programs update & if they take the temp from a core or the package.,"so in short while different they are accurate & ""the same"".",if 1 program is far from another then download hwmonitor it updates more often its like 4 (updates) = 1 update on nzxt cam (horrible software but needed for nzxt aio - does package temp) temp on package.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you mean 30.0.101.1960 ?,"it was released on 1st may and isn't public yet, it's an internal release.",the latest public release is 30.0.101.1660 which was released about a month back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what i see form hwmonitor is that the package and p cores are getting hot.","e cores stay at 50-60 no matter what i do (starting programs, running games, idle) the p cores go up to 80 ish and stay there for most of the time, thats still 5-10â° more than it used to be but it doesnt spike up to 100 anymore (maybe the msi driver i installed actually did smth after all).",meanwhile the utilization on idle and on startups of programs and games is never more than ~18% and ingame caps at 30%.,i dunno if its normal for the e cores to never get hot.,its all so weird for me cause the util is so low.,"update:
im not having any high load program open rn only a few apps like browser, discord, lol client.",and packaga and p cores are at 100 and e cores are on 80. meanwhile the air from my rad is not even hot.,fans are ramping tho,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have msi one.,i will do reinstall probably tommorow so i will let u know.,"and the newest version of driver isnt legacy?, so u cant really go back.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"unlikely the driver did anything unless it directly interacts with sensors?, you generally need bios/v-bios e.t.c.",to make performance changes that will affect temps.,"this said.... there is a case if the driver caused a program/system part to ""hang"" which in turn would cause it to use more cpu resources while running, which in turn more heat e.t.c.",you get the point.,"if you seriously think that might be the case download driverstoreexplorer from github, run > select old drivers > delete.",will stop that old faulty driver from being used again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean i just went of what the website said.,it just seems awfully suspicious that my rig and my friends with very similar setups experience this issue at the same time.,as i said the pc was having no issues at all before.,maybe the auto update only triggered on 10th even tho it was available for manual install before that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
might be an msi board issue maybe then?,yeah thats what i thought,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yea, but definitly its not physical damage or thing like that, if there are more people with similar issue.","im 100% sure it came with windows update, but yea uninstalling ""packages"" didn't work.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

nice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that die seems to be a chip with 8 cores arranged into two banks of four (would that mean the bus is also two interconnected rings?).,there seems to be a lot of cache in the middle that is separate from the cores.,so something more like what apple does with m1?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"it's meant to be a 1h 2023 launch, so volume production needs to start end of the year ~ early 2023. not that far off unless it gets delayed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"maybe their die are ready for mass production, but they still need to work on packaging ?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
generally there is a big gap (often a year for cpus) between power on (they loaded windows a couple weeks ago) and actual volume production.,"this is required to do things like developing in the production process (can we get performance increase by tweaking parameters), validation, catch silicon bugs, and microcode improvements.",this is a normal timeline,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cpu chiplet was powered on in late 2021. maybe that'll change the timeline for production,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, that was something different like ""tape-in"".",tape out is the normal terminology and it takes usually a year before it's available on the shelves.,"saying things like tape-in is like saying ""look at me i'm not irrelevant!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, cpu tile tape in happened even earlier, in q2 2021. it taped out in q3 and they announced cpu tile power on.",recently they powered on the entire soc i guess,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yea, i remember them announcing tigerlake 3 times before it was actually available.",it's a marketing tactic.,just say tape-out and that's it like how it used to be.,"if it's using tiles, then only acceptable one is when the whole chip is taped out.",us consumers aren't buying tiles and packaging them together.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not worth it.,the 10980xe is still a capable chip and in 4k you will see 0 difference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nope, wait for 14th gen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you struggling with performance in a particular game?,"if so, download [msi afterburner](https://www.guru3d.com/files-details/msi-afterburner-beta-download.html), open it, and keep it running in the background while playing your game.","after you've finished playing, press the detach button on the lowest icon of the left side of msi afterburner, and find the *gpu usage* graph.","if gpu usage was flat at 99%, you are gpu-limited, if it wasn't then you're either hitting a framerate cap in the game or a cpu bottleneck.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you still have long way to go with that chip.,"use every bit of it, it's comparable to 3950x r9, so it's plenty capable.",as current technology still doesn't have any serious nor noticeable performance uplift.,overall today still a wonderful machine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i am glad to not hear about the 12900ks

depends on the game but i don't think you'll have more than 2-3% increase across 1000 games generalized since at 4k you will almost always be gpu bottlenecked.",if you are playing something like microsoft flight simulator going from 40fps to 41fps maybe and some games like city simulators can be super unoptimized.,"cough battlefield cough

e sports and more competitive and some cinematic games might be better.",best watch benchmarks with the 3090 ti and see how much lower your fps are.,it can still offer a nice performance boost outside of games like work stuff.,with 13th gen coming out in less than a year it might be worth waiting for that.,also you would probably get 95% of the performance of a 12900k with a 12700k.,or situationally 99% with a 5800x3d for much cheaper.,food for thought.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at 4k i don't think it will be worth it unless all you play is league or csgo or something lol.,10980xe is still a capable gaming  cpu and at 4k you'll be gpu bottlenecked in most games even with a 3090ti,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what are your temps at at the 4.5oc?,i have a beefy cooling set up on my rig and can run this chip at 4.8 all core oc with temps hitting under 80c.,a higher oc might squeeze out some extra performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thank you very much for your help.,it is exactly what i wanted to find out.,so i will wait for now because i love my 10980xe and i donâ€™t want to deal with a lot of trouble when changing the platform for 2-3 more fps gain.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i see, thanks a lot for your advice!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"good to know, thanks!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"btw don't mind me asking, did you need a 10980xe due to the sheer amount of cores or for the ecc memory for some specific programs?",a 10900k would have been cheaper back then and it would also be slightly faster in gaming.,"the extra 8 cores of the 10980xe compared to a 10900k don't make a difference in 99% of games, but the extra frequency and superior st performance of the 10900k do.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

people have stated that they get up to 70-80â°c temps while gaming with highend air coolers (noctua nh-d15 and bequiet dark rock pro 4 to be precise).,"therefore if you want an air cooler, you should go with a highend one.",f.e.,":

-noctue nh-d15

-be quiet dark rock pro 4

-deepcool assassin 3

-cryorig r1 ultimate or universal

-zalman cnp s20x

make sure to check out if they come with the mounting kit for intel socket 1700 or if the manufacturer will send you a free one.","if you want to go with an all in one water cooler (closed loop liquid cooler), you could look at:

-arctic liquid freezer 2 (great performance, great price but looks rather ugly, available with rgb lighting)

-ek aio (great performance and available with and without rgb lighting)

these are the best when it comes to noise and performance.","other brands i would recommend looking into are nzxt, fractal, bequiet (silent loop 2), corsair, alpenfã¶hn, phanteks and lian li.",a 240 aio arctic or ek aio should be enough for the 12700kf.,280 or 360 would be better though and will allow you to reduce the noise output or go for overclocks in the future.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i would say if you want air cooling and don't mind spending a few bucks go with a noctua nh-u12a.,my son has one of those on a 12600k and it does a nice job.,"also i would check out some of the other options like scythe mugen 5 or fuma 2, or be quiet dark rock 4. the noctua u12a does come with the lga1700 brackets.",with some of the coolers you may need to order a separate mounting kit for lga1700.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"fwiw the 280 version works well for me on a 12900k, but then i can't fit anything bigger in my case.",you're right though never hurts to have the bigger rad.,worth noting if the smaller rad is for a itx case or something like that op should also check the mobo compatability chart.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not necessary.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seems a little overkill but i suppose if you're doing ludicrous overclocking,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the lump can make additional noises (although arctic aios are pretty much not audible at lower pump speeds) and there is always a very small chance of leaking.,"also air coolers are slightly easier to install, especially if rgb is involved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
largest disadvantage of aios is that air coolers are on average more durable.,"also, arctic freezer ii series have thick radiator.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes , if ur pump fails it's hard to even know it failed in aios which doesnt happen in air cooler and air cooler give similar performance and some of them straight up destroy em .",id recommend you to go with a noctua nh d15 (there's a black version too) cuz it dosent get any better then this unless you custom loop ur pc .,well aesthetic wise aios are cooler imo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"aio has a few disadvantages, case placement could be an issue, depending on the case you have.",never have the pump above the rad.,itâ€™ll cause increased failure rates way quicker then if you put the rad above.,air naturally rises and a little air in the rad doesnâ€™t hurt.,"aios have better coolin, on a 12700k a 240 should be plenty.",check out jayz2cents for aio advice.,heâ€™s probably the best down to the point youtuber for his content.,check out the the bracket on the cooler and make sure itâ€™s lga1700.,i bought a corsair h150 cap 360mm for my 12900k and had to buy the lga1700 adapter.,only 5.99 or so but still a extra item to buy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thermaltake rarely puts out an actually good product, the rest of it is mind boggling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what about deepcool as500+ and that too for 12700k?,"my idle/normal usage temperatures(30-40c) and gaming temperatures(60-65c) seem normal, its just that during stress test the temperatures easily go above 95 in my case.",could room temperature also be a factor?,it's quite hot here (35+c) and i don't have any ac ðÿ¥²,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i just meant if you plan on overclocking with a 280 you'll hit a temp ceiling and wont be able to get the most outta of you're oc ever since the i9 9900k the these cpus just run hotter and hotter.,but it would be fine if you don't plan on tweaking much.,i mean even stock your cpu still very powerful.,dont understand the point of liquid cooling an unlocked cpu and then never even go onto the bios.,like buying a 100k car or having a a sick custom sleeper and never even going over 60 mph,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not if he wants to overclock it.,buying an unlocked processor and not touching is unnecessary just like responding to me with out reading any further and no shit you can run it on an air cooler and be fine but why get an unlocked cpu meant for ocing and then use liquid cooling which furthers your temp ceiling so you can push for higher frequencies?,not necessary lol foh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the thick radiator is actually a sought after feature thatâ€™s more typical of custom loops.,"i created my first true sff build this month using the freezer ii 280, and while tricky to install is no harder than any other aio, and the thicker rad dissipates heat a bit faster than others.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i used one of their power supplies and it never caused an issue for all the years i used it, but otherwise i agree.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as500 plus is also very good by deepcool.,not as bulky so more room for ram compability.,tests have shown that it's similar performance to dh15 as well.,i think deepcool coming close/beating dh15 at lower price and size is why the new noctua d15 keeps getting pushed back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"im ocing my 12900k on a u12a, managed 30k cbr23 score",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you are completely right, thickness is one of the reasons it's one of top coolers in gn reviews in both temperatures and loudness, especially at that price it's almost without faults.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i agree with you, from what i've see intel was trying to be to gpus as mediatek is to cpus - low end but an ever increasing threat to competitors.",the problem intel has is that the low end cards would have commanded a much higher price 4 months ago.,"i don't think intel predicted that market shift, and i'm thinking intel is going to lose a bunch of money when these things actually launch.",i'm actually very confused on how this launch got messed up so bad.,"intel makes great igpus, and i would have thought that would have made it easy to make the transition to also making discrete gpus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

interesting that newer laptop comes with 1 year warranty.,might be a tactic to push the other one.,"in general, as long as hardware worked right the 1st day, week, month, it would be fine with basic maintenance, and proactive measures like extra cooling when needed.",i'd go with whichever one you were more comfortable with.,"if you think the 2 year warranty would give you peace of mind, that's probably the way to go.","11th gen probably runs cooler, and will give a bit more performance, but you can tweak things a bit if needed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

high 80s to 90 100s sounds bout right for 360 aio (depends on the voltage on full load).,70s is possible if you undervolt and disbale ecores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my 12900ks at 5ghz p cores and 4 ghz e cores with cache at 40x runs about 60-65c in cb23 on a 10 minute loop with my 420mm aio.,that is with a fully stable undervolt and the chip only doing about 186w and 28.5k on the score.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in my experience, especially for unlocked cpu , you can keep the same clock speed while undervoltingâ€¦",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i undervolted and used washer mod to get temps where i wanted them.,it took some tinkering but definitely worth it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
turn off multicore enhancement if asus.,for msi its enhanced turbo.,with that setting off my temps went to 69 from 80.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 5000d build is way too high, can't speak on air coolers but even high 90s sounds a bit much.",i wouldn't account anything being because of fan orientation.,"first thing i'd check is that your power limit is set to 241 which is stock, some bios may set it to unlimited leading to high watts and temps.",besides that the contact between the cpu ihs and cooling block may be off.,you may need to try reapplying thermal paste a few times to see if things get better.,and besides that the 12900k is hugely overvolted to guarantee stability.,you could defo knock off temperature just by forcing a lower constant voltage.,1.2v is a good place to start for stock.,stability test that etc.,i only get 20 wats over stock with 5.1 all core 3.9 all e-cores 3.9 cache @ 1.27v.,and a max of 91c with a arctic 360mm aio.,"just for reference, you should probably get better performance at those voltages with your cooling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the 12900k imo is a bloated, hot and inefficient processor.","if you need all the cores for editing/rending fine, but when you see what the 5800x3d can do in gaming for half the power draw, it makes you wonder why people are still buying them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
got the same cooler with an 12700k and it will indeed touch way over 90c when the cpu is allowed to boost how high it wants.,especially with only 8c it can almost touch 100c when the p-cores are allowed to boost how they want in very cpu demanding situations.,with e-core active my sys actually dont go that high temp wise as with only p-cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that actually (at least on the 12900k) highly depends on the sp.,a 86 chip needs around 50-80mv more than a 95-100+ chip.,my 12700k is a 94 and its vid is around 1.27v in r23.,i had another 12700k (86) and it ran at 1.34v and over 10â°c hotter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i don't have a 12900k but i see a lot flying by with high temps and concave ihs.,some people don't know that some motherboards brands have cpu voltage boosters on by default.,they can go up to 1.5volts!,"and indeed 1.20v - 1.30v is the best range to run the 12th gen intel cpus, best heat/power/performance ratio.",and the nylon washer mod for the cpu socket is an easy and fast one to win 5c to 10c back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the top part of the radiator is still higher than the pump so air will tend to stay there and the tubes are pointing upwards so they won't create a local high point at the pump anyway,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
jayztwocents did a simplified video of the gn video as well.,"i love the depth of gn videos, but sometimes it's overwhelming.","op's rad position is fine and not gonna cause problems, but it's not optimal either as far as i remember from those videos.",basically as long as the barbs of the rad (i.e.,the part where the two tubes/pipes go in and out of the rad) are higher than the top of the circle of the heatsink/pump (i.e.,"the part of the circle closest to the top of the case), then the pump is gonna make less noise and not be working overtime to force a bunch of bubbles through the system.","in short, op's set up is fine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my pump/block is the highest position, but i have 3years before my ""warranty is over"" so i dont care :p

atx mobo in the lian li dynamic mini, will probably do a mod to get the rad up top but right now i dont really have the mental strength to touch my pc in that way :p",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you just threw a key piece of information out there.,although the pc gives you the temperature it is at it's not really the key thing for knowing how well the cooling is functioning (although it does tell you if it is suffient for your environment...) its the temperature difference between under load and ambient that tells you how well the cooling is functioning.,"and well, you're in florida.",it's hot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

in that instance.,i can't imagine that's always the case.,1% lows are probably not great.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is absolutely not true at least in my experience lol.,"i was running a 2600k , 16gb ddr3 and a gtx1070 and thought i had no reason to upgrade because gpu usage was maxed and cpu usage wasnâ€™t.","i ended up upgrading to a 5800x ,16gb ddr4 but stayed on the same gtx1070 and my frame rates in most games were close to double or triple of my previous system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

how will the gpu at 100% utilization produce twice as many frames?,do you expect to run it at 200% utilization?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what gpu were you using with the 5950x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, this will happen because, even if the 5950x is using minimal resources, it's because even at lower clock speeds the new cpu is most likely doing more than what an older cpu (especially one that came out a decade before) is capable of.","check out this video showing an i7 of similar vintage of yours vs. a i3 12100f:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s36udjqzyxg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well then you answered your own question.,if it was much smoother and responsive on current gen and you want that experience then upgrade.,if you dont then you can wait a bit more,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you could have better minimum fps with a newer cpu.,"in some games, you might find that you have better minimum fps on linux in part thanks to valveâ€™s shader precaching.",you could try dual booting to see how it works for you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do a bit better analysis than task manager on the fps breakdown.,"what are the 1% and 0,1% lows that you are getting.",just looking at the task manager we see that your current setup is able to fully saturate your gpu and that probably will show that even with a different cpu your average fps would not go much up.,that is not to say that you would not see difference in some microstuttering perhaps.,that gpu utlization line is remarkably flat though.,spirit117's question is valid though: what gpu were you using on that 5950x system?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i mean a 5950x is significantly better than a 2600k in every possible metric, so you'd absolutely notice a difference.",your cpu is over a decade old at this point.,anything modern will be a night and day upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have heard from many places now that 2600k is much more of a stutterer than even 4th gen haswells(both overclocked too).,old benchmarks from 2013 show them neck and neck but i guess 4th gen aged better.,"maybe it's the better cache, avx2 support, better memory oc, or vulnerability mitigations hitting older tech more who knows.","pointing this out because i was one of those lucky 4th gen users who was not believing friends with older gens blaming the cpu for stutters, it probably is the cpu!",get a modern 6core at the least.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why are you asking this question when you already have a 5950x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's because the cpu usage graph is a poor way to look at usage and won't show stuff like .1% lows which create stutters.,use a tool like capframex.,your 2600k despite only being at 50% usage is definitely holding you back.,"even a $100 12100f would be a large upgrade in terms of smoothness, though the 12400f is more recommendable for long term use.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is because the percentile figures where probably much better on the newer processor.,"if you can i would suggest you to wait for 13th gen and better ddr5 ram

till than you can increase the resolution(use dsr if display is max 1080p) of the game so that the workload moves from cpu to gpu 1080 is still plenty powerful",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

bet it isnâ€™t.,"90% of people who use 24 gb have 3 rams, the initials 2 then a minor upgrade done in a second moment.",the remaining 9% have 16+8.,"assuming he use dual channel so 4 sticks there is always a slight change in timings and/or speed between different capacity, especially between 4 and 8. sure 100% there arenâ€™t any ram on hearth from same brand (you canâ€™t deny that mixing brand and having the exact same speeds and timings is not something that one who ask on reddit would be able to do), that have exactly the same speed and timings (all 4 timings, it doesnâ€™t exist only the cas latency) between 4 and 8 gb model.",we have to remember that ram is deeply tied to cpu.,the more ram sticks are used the more usage has the cpu (reasons why apart from aesthetics purpose 2 sticks are better than 4).,"his cpu is almost a decade old, he would have a bit worse performance even with 4 sticks exactly the same.",with different sticks even worse.,his cpu single core canâ€™t comfortably handle 4 sticks completely different.,he has sure less performance than with 16 gb 2x8 of exactly the same.,of course in tasks that uses more than 13/14 gb the 24 total will be a benefit but is not the case on for the majority of games and productivity program.,plus programs that benefits from more than 16 gb needs a better cpu.,"so op surely isnâ€™t using these kinds of program

there is also enough evidence like these videos https://youtu.be/7iaycbc_yeq that 24 gb that 24 gb is wore by  3-8 fps than 16, whereas 32 (4x8 or 2x16) has benefits.","plus ram is the least expensive (useful) upgrade you can do, there isnâ€™t an argument that holds.","remain with 16 or upgrade to 32

furthermore it can lead to instability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if gpu usage is 100%, then it is fully utilized.",getting a better cpu would not make the gpu usage 110%.,"the video you listed had rtx 2080 ti as the gpu, that is a lot stronger than what the op has and probably the games and perhaps resolution also are different also.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i don't own it, i just tested it for a limited time",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel has flex mode so 8+8 would run in dual channel and then anything past that would run in single channel mode.,so 16+8 isnt bad.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i personally run 24gb on my i7 4790 server and there is no downsides since i use 2x4+2x8.,the cpu literally sees the memory as 3 4gb ranks per channel in dual channel.,there are a bunch of videos out there from reputable sources (like gn and hw unboxed) showing the benefits of dual rank memory.,idk what 3 rank give but so far i only see benefits and no downsides from upgrading from 16gb (aside from not overclocking as high but my mb is soft locked at 1866 anyways).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we can see that he has a g\*tx 1080 gpu.,"if he upgrades to an i5 intel 9th gen or equivalent amd, he will see a more than 100% jump in performance.",or double the performance.,"you are correct, we don't know what game he is running.","however, the cpu will not show a bottleneck as 100% utilization when gaming.",the bottleneck will occur somewhere else before it hits the cpu.,"i can't explain it as i don't have a full grasp understanding on how task mgr is reporting cpu utilization, but i know from 1st hand experience and just from viewing performance numbers on review websites like the link above from gamersnexus.",and not a lot of users do testing from older generations of cpus to pinpoint exactly where and what bottleneck is occurring.,that is like unnecessary.,"op just needs to review a benchmark, look at the data and make his decision.",he shouldn't be left to make the decision alone based upon windows task manager's reporting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
he is also likely more than 50% cpu bottlenecked.,"if we review his task mgr reporting, you can see that the first thread is close to 80% filled.",most games are still single thread bound.,and so taskmgr is reporting 50% utilization based upon all threads.,"but in op's case, he maybe playing a game that relies on single thread speed.",so he is definitely cpu bound.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"how do you explain that in the video is very clearly written that is running an intel system with bot ram configuration in dual channel (4+4) or (8+4), and the 12 gb total has less fps than the 8. yes the 8+4 has one ram 3200 mhz and the other 3000, so there is a mismatch in speed.",and sure 1000% that also op system has a difference speed between the sticks.,"in the video he has a far better cpu, which is better able to handle different ram and still has worse performance with 12 gb than with 8.  op has a worse cpu is performance loss between 24 an 16 will be even more noticeable.","there is no argument, flex mode is something than enable the possibility to use different capacity and speed, is not something that disable performance loss from mixed configuration.","is clearly states here  in the official page https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005657/boards-and-kits.html

"80% of the water intel uses ends up being filtered, cleaned and restored.","they are the only leading edge fab to have 2030 goals for net positive water usage, which means on top of further waste water reduction they spend millions on additional projects that restore the watershed in the area ([these are some of the current arizona projects](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/environment/water-restoration-arizona.html)).","you can read more into some of it here: https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/environment/restore-water-goal-report.html

and ultimately this is a drop in the bucket for water use.",only 6-8% of arizona water is used for industrial purposes.,"around 70% is agricultural, who get water subsidies and have very few restrictions on use, unlike industry use, and the remaining 20%+ is municipal.","not to mention the significant amount of money that these fabs bring to their areas, both directly and indirectly, that ends up going to local residents, businesses, and government.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we have water problems because ca especially is taking more from the colorado river than they are allowed.,az was prepared for shortages.,ca was not will and will jot prepare for it.,they just steal itâ€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

california has been in a drought for like a decade and have 10% of the us population.,they are entitled to some water.,chill out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if it has been a decade, can we really call it a drought?",maybe it's just normal.,"also, california water shortages are almost entirely about agricultural water use, which in turn is mostly about growing water-intensive crops like alfalfa and rice.",there is plenty of water to go around if california simply stops doing dumb things.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
never mentioned they werenâ€™t entitled to water???,they are also consuming more then theyâ€™re agreed to amount!,"since you didnâ€™t read my post thoroughly i can only assume that you havenâ€™t read the colorado river compact, which az along with ca are a party to.",the same agreement that ca violates year after year.,az canâ€™t do anything about because we are a poorer state.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wow that is a take.,â€œweâ€™ll have water if we stop using it to grow the food we eatâ€,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i donâ€™t think you read the compact.,california is allowed to call for more water when there is a drought.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there are plenty of other places with more water that can grow alfalfa and rice.,farmers can move to growing more water-efficient crops in california.,"in fact, they are already doing this.",the process just needs to be hastened to match the need for water usage reductions.,there is no question of food shortages being caused by a sensible agricultural water usage policy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

core 2 duo is a specific line of cpus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hmm... yea good enough.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it depends all on the os and the cpu version.,this is my only windows 7 machine and i don't need a bloated 10 on it.,"and the cpu, the e8400 at 3.00ghz is really really good even today, for all things i require, office, flash games, chrome.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the e8400 can play 1080p youtube no problem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to be honest, the higher end core 2 duos are good, even today.","yes, you're gonna need a graphics card as the integrated one supports 1080p max.","yes, you will need an ssd and have windows 10, and have at least 8gb ram.","however, once all of these requirements are good, it is still usable for today's standards if you have an older pc, but you're right to recommend at least an i3 or i5, even 1st gen as they have better tdp and performance is way better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i once had a e8400 too.,one of the best bang for bucks gaming cpu back in the day when people were still arguing about 2 cores high clocks or 4 cores lower clocks (q6600).,i gave it a little bit oc 3.6ghz daily with 2gb ram and a hd5850.,that was my first gaming pc.,unfortunately i sold it 7 years ago but still keep the gpu just in case.,it still sit below my wardrobe to this day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

very true.,very true.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this will always happen because windows gets more and more bloated.,"you'd think that computers today handle os stuff blazingly fast today compared to 10 years ago, but no.",it's still the same relative performance because of fucking bloat.,"i blame the programmer mentality of ""nah, computers are fast enough so i don't need to optimise"".",it might not be a problem for one program but when every developer thinks like that it adds up and is a big part of the reason why computers and also smartphones get more sluggish with age.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

8g is getting tight these days.,i have a couple j5005-based nuc systems and they felt really pokey at 8gb but they're solid with 16gb unless you get them swapping hard.,"i've pondered seeing if they'd take 32gb but it gets a bit wacky with the ram specifications, they basically need 2400c16 specifically and most larger kits are also faster at this point...

yeah i understand that it is quite subjective topic and everyone have different needs and expectations out of their pc's.,"probably the main takeaway from my previous message, that it may seem ""fine"" or actually ""good"" experience until you try something modern, especially when we are talking about ~14 years difference in hardware .",but yeah if you are happy with your system then yeah more power to you :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"while there is some bloat, that's not the main reason for sluggishness.",it is the fact that they stop using older instruction sets in favor of new ones.,"it is the same reason windows used to run fine on a hd and no longer does, they do not optimize for the old hardware anymore.",i have seen the reverse of this when the atom was released.,the first gen atoms were meant for windows 7 and performed great on that os.,but if you tried using windows xp (which was still in support at the time) it ran like complete shit because it only had the newer instruction sets which xp was not optimized for.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think we'll always find older systems noticeably sluggish.,this is because our senses are *relative.,* meaning we get used to the fast one and we'll notice the slower one no matter what.,"but of course there's a bit of ""greed"" involved in it as there's such a thing as settling down.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

e-cores are used before 2nd primary threads on the same cpu core on the performance cores.,"this makes them extremely useful for aaa games (and games with developers with the programming chops similar to aaa games developers) that utilize maximum cpu threads for loading/streaming data from your hard drive to ram, decompress it, and then stream it to your gpu.","reviewers generally don't test this, so very few people know of this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

won't really matter unless you overclock.,will probably run a bit cooler out of the box vs a lower quality 12900k but actual clockspeed won't change without manual intervention.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
e cores are really only used for background tasks when gaming (or is their intended use case according to intel and microsoft with win 11â€™s scheduler).,"so the answer is yes, but it wonâ€™t boost your fps or anything like that.",it more so if you have another tab open doing something it much less likely to take away performance from the game given you have enough ram capacity and arenâ€™t watching any 4k videos on youtube with the same gpu you are using to game.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

sweet silicon lottery win there!,do you know how old it is?,(like is it the old logo design or the new)?,kinda surprised it didnâ€™t become a 12900ks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you spent $900 on a 12900k?,lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks.,i actually bought it for $900.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
makes a lot of sense.,i'm getting more fps with e cores on in a lot of games and couldn't figure out why,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s why iâ€™m confused too.,i donâ€™t have the chance to test now cause i will receive the cpu in few days.,my current 12900k sp87 only can do 4.0ghz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>e-cores are used before 2nd primary threads on the same cpu core on the performance cores.,you mean the game uses e-cores before hyperthreading?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

at 2k and 4k games still love fast cpus.,the notion that by increasing the graphics settings you suddenly use less cpu is completely wrong.,"what is actually happening is the following: gpus are pretty powerful so at 1080p they usually have no issue, it is more common for your cpu to be the bottleneck here.",at 4k it is more likely that the gpu will be the bottleneck.,but running at 1080p or 4k still causes approximately the same cpu usage.,"you can't take a cpu that struggles to keep a gpu fed at 1080p, switch resolution to 4k and suddenly the cpu performs much better.","this is the same mistake people make when they say ""oh you game at 4k, you don't need that good of a cpu"".",wrong.,"you need a very good cpu, but on top of that you also need a very good gpu.","cpu benchmarks are done at 1080p not because it somehow uses more cpu or stresses the cpu more, they are done at 1080p to make sure the gpu is not the one limiting framerates.","otherwise, if you bench a cpu at 4k and get 60fps, is it because the gpu struggled or because the cpu struggled?",using 1080p takes the gpu out of the equation and allows us to look at the cpu performance.,think of this as trying to test how much weight a barbell can hold.,most humans can not lift enough to make the bar fail so saying that a bar can only hold 100kgs because that's all us humans can lift is wrong.,our strenght prevented us from evaluating the full strenght of the bar.,"this is the scenario of running at 4k, the gpu is our strenght, the cpu is the bar.",then you change the test and use a crane to lift the bar.,the crane is very powerful so the bar will be the limiting factor.,it can be tested with as much weight as you want and find the exact point where the bar fails.,in this scenario the crane is the gpu and which allows us to fully max out the bar(cpu).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my current one also sp87 using asus ai overclocking, do you have temperature spike when running cinebench?",i know it wonâ€™t matters but aioc seems like feeding too much voltage into my 12900k.,"another thing is i used to be 71% overclock, now 68%.",not sure if it was because of bios update or degrading :(,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

did you buy it prebinned?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i thought you hit the lottery, bc i definitely did not lol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it will matter if you care about aaa open world games that implement high thread count streaming/loading.,"other than that, it's as others have said, to run background tasks for the most part.","i wouldn't bother binning something like this, if that extra bit of performance is important to you, you can just wait for raptor lake.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> the chance to test now cause i will receive the cpu in few days.,my current 12900k sp87 only can do 4.0ghz.,how can it do only 4ghz if the chip is pre-binned much higher?,or is that 4ghz on your e cores?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there are a number of aaa games that utilize 20+ threads when loading/streaming data.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hyper threading (largely) hasn't been detrimental to performance for 10 years now.,"you're more often than not going to see a performance boost having the extra threads there to handle secondary tasks, especially if you use the computer to do more than just run one program at a time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why didn't you buy a 12900ks since they are pre-binned for $800 and a cool box?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12900ks are pre-binned but if you are unlucky you could get bad one too.,"i been seeing people getting sp82, most of them below sp95.","thereâ€™s a video in youtube they have 200 samples for 12900k and 12900ks, the mean for 12900ks is sp92.","i know sp doesnâ€™t mean everything, like voltage leak & temp & etc.",but high good sp at least give you assurance that your chip is better.,thatâ€™s why i rather buy used high sp 12900k than getting a new 12900ks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well i hope your chip makes you happy and you post some overclocking results :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sp binning between the 12900k and 12900ks canâ€™t be compared i thought.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you are correct, they shouldn't be compared, different operating frequencies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yep, 12900ks sp is binned for 5.5 while 12900k sp is binned for 5.3 iirc",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if this is what is swaying your decision i think you need to do a bit more research.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel gaming access is like the nvidia geforce experience.,the app should detect a qualifying intel cpu for you to claim any offer / play the games you have won.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

high 80s with fans set to100%.,"i use the stock xmp with the maximus hero z690, another trick i have seen is to add 2 extra fans to the opposite side of the radiator in a push pull configuration, will outperform a 280.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what is a push pull configuration?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"okay, thanks!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a fan pushing air through the radiator in one direction and on the opposite side of the radiator another fan also in the same direction that creates higher static pressure and is much more efficient than fans in either a single push or single pull layout,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"multi-core enhancement or a similarly named option probably is the one you're after, usually it locks all cores to the same multi (even maximum).",be sure to check everything you usually would when ocing as sometimes motherboards get a bit too voltage happy and temps often will be higher with mce enabled :).,i haven't bothered with the option on 12th gen but that's what it was called on gigabyte lga-1200 boards :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yea theyre pretty much completely locked out even in z690 boards.,my old i7 6700 was able to do bclk for a while and i had all cores at 4.2ghz but it was eventually fixed in bios updates.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what's your max cpu package power while reaching those temps?,what temps and package wattages with cpuz stress test?,what's vcore voltage look like?,i've found that i5 rocket lake chips and up can consume 220+ watts easily.,every mobo manufacturer has weird out of box settings that can end up ramping up cpu voltage higher than necessary causing even higher cpu package wattage for non stressful loads.,"240 mm aio's can generally deal with 180 constant watt load, but not higher at reasonable temps.","i own two 11700kf's and a 11700f, and know that you shouldn't be getting temps that high on the two games you're playing.",it's likely a combination of poorly oc'ed settings and bad mounting/thermal paste judging by the temps being allowed to exceed 105c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"look at this discussion https://www.reddit.com/r/ibuypower/comments/gq53vr/ibuypowers_240_mm_water_cooler_is_failing_me/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

"something is wrong cooling wise.... i would re apply some clean thermal paste and make sure 100% that you have the right mounting hardware for your cpu/mobo.....

"if it's a prebuilt with an aio, then it could be as simple as the case having very poor airflow.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do not try lower voltages until you have re-seated the cpu cooler with fresh thermal compound.,it is very typical to have high temperatures if the cooler/heatsink wasn't tightened down slowly and evenly.,"the same thing happened to me with my previous build, a ryzen 9 3900x with an aio.","people told me that because of higher voltages that that chip just gets hotter and it's ok but when i took the heatsink off, reapplied paste and put it back on, my temps went down 15â°-20â° c.

i have a gaming rig with an i9-11900k that i run at stock auto overclock/boost settings and it doesn't get as hot as your i7 same generation chip.",running cinebench23 all core i max out at 80â°c so gaming would be a lot less.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
realistically you need at least a 360 aio with the 11700k to keep the temps manageable.,but you also need to insure proper airflow through the case.,"ibuypower is notorious for having horrible airflow, and with your gpu blown hot air into the case as well, your cooling is going to suffer.",orientation of the aio also matters.,it should be mounted to the top of the case for best results.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i would use hwinfo64 sensors for better monitoring, also note vid voltages are what the cpu is asking for, not always the same the motherboard is giving.",you can double click values to pop up relevant graph in hwinfo64.,tuning 11th is different and confusing to most because it behaves differently to earlier generations.,"it has been said about asus boards some of the voltage settings (adaptive/fixed) don't care about any voltages set to lower than the normal v/f curve, i've seen similar on msi motherboard so maybe it's the cpu... meaning your fixed voltage on asrock also gets ignored.",to undervolt you need the adjust the v/f curve.,"either put negative offsets at ratios you want 46x being most important, it's the default turbo boost speed for all cores.","on msi motherboards there is ""cpu lite load"" setting which makes you a less agressive voltage curve if you set mode number lower, no idea if asrock has similar (and most likely differently named, good luck finding it!).","there is an alternative way to do above, it's using intel extreme tuning in windows.","it's usually frowned upon, but setting voltage offset is easier and less confusing there.","you just have to accept you have small process running in the background even after you close xtu program itself, and it will override your bios changes so if you don't want conflicts use either bios or xtu.",uninstalling gets rid of the process ofc.,"if you go too low with voltage you will get crashes, maybe -0.05 for 46x is fine?","this video is about ocing so don't do what he does, but the curve is explained well with pictures https://youtu.be/pxmngxm8rle?t=110

>realistically you need at least a 360 aio with the 11700k to keep the temps manageable.,no you don't.,cpus like the 11700k will boost to meet available thermal headroom.,"90-91c is well within the normal [operating spec for the 11700k](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/212047/intel-core-i711700k-processor-16m-cache-up-to-5-00-ghz.html#tab-blade-1-0-6) 

if you have a 360mm sized aio then quite likely the 11700k will boost a little bit higher than if you had decent air cooler, but the amount you'd spend will likely be worse value than just buying a better cpu.","a decent air cooler is much cheaper and will give, for all intents and purposes, the same performance/user experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i wish i could see underload voltage.,sometimes voltage can spike high randomly in low load which causes little issues.,it's really about if it's doing 1.4v underload then it could probably use a decent undervolt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah , look for a tutorial on the web , it is very easy to do â€¦.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you don't need to bother with overclocking or underclocking that cpu.,newer gen cpus from intel and amd have quality dynamic boost systems.,they'll self overclock to match whatever thermal headroom they have.,"unless you are looking to squeeze the last 2 or 3% out of the cpu, power limits be damned, then manual overclocking isn't going to give you any meaningful benefit",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i currently own three cpus in three different computers : one 10700k , one 11700k and one 12700k .","all three are overclocked to respectively 4.5 , 4.8 and 5ghz , 

none of them is even close to reach 90 degre.",but all three computers are using a water cooling loop .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if it's overclocked it might be normal.,i wonder if they turned multicore enhancement (mce) on to do the oc.,if it really is oc'd it's no wonder it's running hot.,you'll have to turn it off in the motherboard bios if you don't like the temperatures.,i would also turn the memory xmp on if it's not.,just because you buy fast ram doesn't mean it's running at that speed until you turn that on.,"and they won't turn that on from factory, usually.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also don't bother reapplying thermal paste until you disable mce.,if you don't know what you're doing you're just risking messing something up that's working properly.,mce is generally a really inefficient way to oc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
personally i use a custom ekwb water loop on a evga 3080ti ocâ€™ed 200 and an i9-12900kf @5.2 all pcore and 4.0 all ecore cpu has never exceeded 72c even running cinebench and the gpu has never exceeded 54c.,water cooling matters.,even if you are not overclocking.,i build these systems.,i also idle at 17c and when gaming or photo/video editing iâ€™ve never exceeded 61c only in benchmarks has it reached 72c with avx512,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for the tips.,on the next day off i will go grab some thermal paste from microcenter and try to lower the overclock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if he didn't overclock it i highly doubt microcenter or ibuypower did from the factory.,most likely it's a bad cooler/thermal paste application.,default clocks for the cpu i don't think should be getting that high and it probably is set to default.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sure, those are interesting anecdotes, but the cpu specs are listed from the manufacturer, intel.",the link i posted is their spec for 11700k and it says it's temp limit is 100c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for sure if you use high end cooling solutions the systems will generally run cooler.,that doesn't mean it's at all a requirement.,"nor does it generally make sense from a price to performance sense, unless you've already got the highest end hardware and absolutely need that extra 3 - 5% performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have the same cpu but i use a 360mm aio from lian li and i never go above 60 celsius,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
temp limit 100 does not mean it is normal for the cpu to reach this temp â€¦..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"under sufficient load, yes it is, absolutely.",these cpus are *supposed* to keep boosting clockspeed until they hit thermal limits.,they naturally trend towards the temp limit as a performance boosting feature,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
~27k is normal for stock,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">however, i rarely upgrade (still using a 4th gen cpu, before that it was a e5400).",12700 no question.,don't even bother with a 6 p core processor for long term system.,12700 is a locked 12700k with ~2-3% lower clock speed.,it's an absolute beast even without oc.,12600k is a reasonable choice if you're going to upgrade in a few years though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would personally go for the 12700 since you wouldn't get a meaningful oc from newer chips unlike the older days (we all know how much the older intel cpus oced).,the 2 extra p cores would come in handy and let you stay on it for longer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've tested both and i'd recommend the i7-12700 over the i5-12600k.,my testing results are available here: https://adoredtv.com/reviewed-intel-i7-12700-cpu-with-noctuas-nh-u12a-and-intels-rm1-stock-cooler/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i also upgraded from a 4690k recently.,"i went with the 12600k, i decided i couldnâ€™t justify the cost difference to the 12700. itâ€™s difficult to compare since i donâ€™t have the 12700, but can say so far iâ€™m not missing the extra cores for my use case (mostly gaming), so iâ€™m glad i allocated that budget elsewhere.",if you know you donâ€™t need the extra cores now (like for productivity workloads) i would say the 12600k is a safe bet unless you have some spare budget - â€˜future proofingâ€™ can be difficult to justify when the price difference is significant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12600k will give you the max fps if that's all you care about.,"people are actually getting some gains from ocing it, but check reviews, it's not a lot of fps, but it can be the most.","between the 12600k's 6 p cores, and 4 e cores, you probably won't need anything more.",don't even need to oc it.,"you can pair it with a b660 board, and ddr4.","no need to jump to 5 yet, but if you can wait a while, prices will come down on ddr5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i went from a x299 system to a 12600k and the thing rips, its also very easy to overclock.",with that said i do tend to upgrade every couple years and so if you are looking for more longevity out of your system i'd concur with the others here and say go for the 12700.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the problem with rarely upgrading is, at the moment 6 core cpus are still the king when it comes to price/performance for gaming, but you don't know what happens down the line.","i would just buy the 12700k, but i know that is not the question and it is over budget.",i have a 12700k and i had great fun overclocking it and i think you can get some performance out of these chips.,"so if you like this, get the 12600k and have at it.","if the day comes where you really feel the 6 p-cores are not enough, you can probably well afford to upgrade to the coming raptor lake cpus which will fit the same socket.",really by the time 12600k will not be enough i suspect the raptor lake successor will not be that expensive so you have an easy upgrade path without buying everything new.,i can run my 12700k at 5.2ghz allcore with octvb.,"it downclocks when temps get high but for most games, i can hold that frequency.",default is like 4.7ghz so it's quite an improvement.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i owned a 12700, for my case the stock cooler is unusable at all, 90 celsius with endwalker benchmark.",do consider to get a aftermarket cooler asap.,"however, by using nh-d15, the temp was fine, r23 up to 75 celsius, ff14 55 to 63 celcius (ambient around 30), playing ff14 12700 can use from 60w to 84w especially in zadnor 48 man critical engagement.","&#x200b;

an oc-ed 12600k can push more fps especially at limsa because more player = more cpu required, if you think you dont need the extra 2 cores and want more fps, go with 12600k, if you dont want to tweak the cpu, 12700 is a solid choice.","&#x200b;

do note that 12700 run at 4.5ghz all cores, however, if you able to oc 12600k to all core 5.0, it might be a significant fps gain (provided your gpu not bottleneck).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

anything made in the last 4 years is gonna knock the socks off your old system.,how long you planning on using the new system before you have to upgrade again?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i don't know where you're located, but in the us the 12700 makes zero sense because you can find a 1\`2700k for just about the same price.",so the real question here is 12600k vs. 12700k and do you want to save $75 for 2 less p-cores and less cache (honestly the cache matters more for gaming performance).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
honestly anything from 5930k onwards will be fine and sidestep the security issue haswell had; performance of newer cpus is only marginal on the i7 side if you are talking games (ex.,"my 2008 i7 920 can still average over 60fps at 3440x1440 with a 1080ti; sure my i7 7800x does a bit better, but honestly the improvement is not staggering.",if you want to save money then just grab the cheapest new i7 and go with that.,if you want to save money then cruise ebay for used i7s from the i7 5820k on up+mobos.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
go with the cheapest one.,both cpu run really well for gaming at 1080p + 120hz on ultra settings provided with 3200mhz ram and good gpu.,"i don't believe you will need 8 p cores for gaming 
6 p cores is strong on alder lake.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it was a though choice for me too.,to have a freedom of oc and z690 feature or more more core/ better gaming performance with locked b660 motherboard.,but i went with z690m and i5 12600k as i wanted to tinker with oc and later use the features of z690.,but 12700 with b660 is out of the box strong performer with being just close to its unlocked counterpart when you unlock its power limits.,so if you dont like oc stuff just go with a good combo of b660 and 12700.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

did you adjust the load line calibration ?,"it is very important for stability, basically if you use any voltage the cpu will be using that voltage while idle, however with very low load line calibration (e.g level 1 or 2 ) during load the voltage will drop while the current increases, this is differently will cause instability, so in order to lower the drop in voltage (aka vdrop) you in crease the load line calibration, however there is a point after increasing the load line calibration where there will be no drop in voltage ( while this can help overclock ) generally it will causes a dangerous voltage spike, usually modern cpu and motherboard are not that dangerous however you really should not need more than decent level increase of llc, in my experience mostly you can stay the same maximum stock clocks with much lower voltage , so it is fine, just as i told you adjust the multiplier to match intel specifications of turbo boost then adjust the voltage to manual and start low then increase llc to the medium settings ( should be labeled with number ) then see if you boot, repeat until you can get into windows and start testing with cinabench r15 ( do multiple runs (4 or 6)) the open prime 95 for stability testing ( use custom settings and small fft and also tick the box which says run in place, and adjust the minimum value to 12 and maximum value for 12) if you pass prime95 with those settings for 1 to 2 hours then your system is stable for gaming and maybe generally stable for 24/7 use",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

for gaming, if your cpu/gpu combo can still get you to your desired experience and quality range, then there is honestly no need to upgrade (whether generation or sku tier).","for productive workload, if the smoothness and efficiency start to degrade vs the experience you want/need, then it may be time to upgrade, otherwise hold off.","or, if you find an insanely good deal vs market (like 20-30% drop)...but even then you may not see any huge gains and would become more a case of chasing price-to-performance of the product more than anything.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

bigger is better.,i thought you knew.,"/s 

transistor density for intel 10 is the same as tsmc 7 .",the nm shit donâ€™t mean jack in reality thatâ€™s marketing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably gave up some density to improve power delivery + wasted space from avx512.,intel's nodes are hp focused while tsmc has been density/low power focused.,"the space doesn't seem necessary now that they fused off avx512, but enable it and suddenly things start to make sense:

https://images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph17047/127213.png

avx512 is pretty beautiful, intel's clusterfuck of implementation is the main problem.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's just the way it's designed.,amd focused on compactness and scalability of core count and prioritized power efficiency.,intel 7 (10nm) and tsmc 7 are of comparable transistor density.,between ipc and clockspeed improvements intel leads by alot more than 15% in most single threaded applications.,it's staggering how much faster my 12th gen rig is than my 5950x in things like gaming or benchmarks.,where as the 5950x does alot better at things like cinebench or blender.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there are multiple factors affecting die space.,l1 l2 cache is one.,avx 512 is quite heavy on die space.,then it also depends on the frequency that the core is supposed to run at.,higher frequency support requires lower density as we need barriers that are wider between cells.,if you are comparing density then you should compare the dimensions of l2 cache.,that will give a more accurate comparison coz the effect of frequency and other complex operations will be low in l2 cache.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1/3 is the gpu and display unit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
where's the size information for the zen 3 core?,+ comparison.,need more representation of what you're talking about.,but i doubt it's anything too significant.,eg.,"the avx mentioned, possible contribution from having to be able to handle ddr5 and ddr4, having to talk to gpu, pcie 5 etc.",could be w.e.,random reason,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ye they'll have to design a more balanced architecture in order to compete with neoverse, epyc servers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pretty sure it's because they still have not gotten to the level of miniaturization that amd has.,they're playing catchup after years at the top.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
some of it is adl is both able to attain higher clock speeds and also scale a bit better at higher clocks (less ipc drop off above 5 ghz).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i don't know about the whole core but i remember thinking that disabling avx512 would be quite a waste considering the die space it requires, given the pic in the news is accurate:

probably because zen is a new architecture than core series.,you see zen launched in like 2017. while the core series dates back to a decade.,just like what amd has done with their zen 1 to zen 3(improving upon same architecture by eliminating it's shortcomings and such) is what intel has been doing as well.,"being relatively new than intel and been on some cutting edge node always(except zen 1), they always optimised it that way.","if you really want something changed in intel architecture, it's not gonna happen until that rumoured royal core project that intel's working on.",it's a new architecture being designed from ground up just like zen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my thoughts (not technically brilliant in any way) : 

cpu's these days are primarily compute(alu) ,memory(cache) ,control units etc.","firstly talking about compute intel include avx 512  instruction set so there are hardware units for this.. also include wider pipelines, buffers more ports , registers etc.","and more those directly translate to more transistors, considering similar densities there is already a large increase in transistor count.. if the density is even lower for logic that again doesn't bode well for core size.",now the main culprit for the inflated core size in my opinion is sram(cache).it is rumored that tsmc's sram library density is better than intel's(don't have source to back this up) while also having bigger l1 and  l2 cache which are included in the core size.,these may be some of the factors .,it may also be that amd were able to do better transistor level optimization since they had been on 7nm for some time at this point,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no replacement for displacement?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"op - reading through this and thinking a little more about this, i think the short answer is - they're different architectures and it's really hard today to gain performance by adding transistors..  so even a 10% performance gain often requires a lot more than 10% more transistors to achieve.","i think it's fair to assume that both amd and intel engineers are competent,  that tsmc 7nm and ""intel 7"" are similar in density and perf/watt characteristics... so the main difference is that adl brings higher ipc, higher clock speeds, and ability to maintain higher ipc @ higher clock speeds (zen isn't so good above 5 ghz) requiring a lot more transistors.",here's a few historical examples why it's hard to predict how many transistors yield given performance.,tl;dr from 3 examples - 1.,"3x transistors for more than 3x performance,   2.","1/2 the transistors for more performance, and 3.",1.,"80386 had 375k transistors, 80486 had 1100k transistors;  the 486 had about double the ipc and could clock higher (\~ 30-50%) on the same manufacturing process (50 mhz vs 33 mhz), for a \~ 3x performance increase on integer code, for about 3x the transistor count.","however, the 80486 also added a fpu for \~10x improvement (sometimes more) on floating point code.",these gains were huge because there was so much 'low hanging fruit' available to improve performance back then.,the 486 was the first pipelined x86 cpu generation from  intel.,"2.  pentium d on 65nm (2 core) had \~ 230m transistors, while core 2 duo (2mb cache version) had only 111m transistors,  but overall substantially outperformed pentium d on the same process.",this was due to the pentium d chasing performance via clocks that process nodes didn't support.,3.  phenom ii vs. amd fx 8150 -  \~ 0.76b transistors vs. 1.2b transistors.,"the fx-8150 ended up barely faster than phenom ii in a lot of workloads (occasionally slower), despite a huge increase in transistor count, and having a better manufacturing process to support higher clock speeds (32nm vs 45nm).","the reason for this tradeoff was fx being designed for high clock speeds, and highly parallel workloads.",there were some cases where the extra transistors paid off - but not for most use cases at the time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it pretty much boils down to architecture.,this generation amd managed to carry out instructions with fewer transistors.,"avx512 is definitely a factor, it enables more transistors (thus more power) to be used.","next gen amd has avx512, so we'll get a better idea of the impact then, that will be interesting for sure.",i'd bet that intel's years of simply reiterating the same core design gen over gen has led to stiffer design culture in their labs as well.,"now that they've got one 100% brand new big core design with alder lake, we might see that shift a bit too.","all around, the next few gens are going to be very cool.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the answer is that you should not be comparing a monolithic design versus chiplet design based purely on die size area.,we just don't know enough about both architectures and this reddit forum isn't really the ideal place for discussing this kind of technical thing.,i mean a lot of the comments are just boiling down to comparing sizes and then comparing performance numbers.,which is fine but i don't think that really answers the question.,i think a better comparison could be comparing zen 2 cores versus zen 3 cores.,they are on the same process but perform differently.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
monolithic design makes it so everything is on one die.,"zen cores don't need the full i/o that takes a sizeable amount of space (see how big the i/o die is despite being only that, i/o.","yeah, it's on a bigger node, but still.)","intel has to put the i/o of each core in the die, so size grows quite a bit.","some amount of die area can be attributed to arch differences, but imo the main one is that a zen core is just a compute core while a gc core also has the i/o next to it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
foreword: i run an i7-8700 and happy about it.,"that being said...

> all that for ~15 percent higher ipc than the zen 3 core

zen 3 cores have lower clock speeds yet perform just as fast as a-l in all the reviews ( gn/hub/tpu ) i've seen.","logically, the opposite of that ipc claim is true.",what am i missing here?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"performance in single thread assuming everything is perfectly equal(design, design teams, process technology, execution, ideas, etc, etc.)","is said to scale in accordance to the ""square root law"".",so if you quadruple the transistors(and the core power as well) then you end up with performance in single thread doubling.,"that explains 32% of the 74% differences leaving 1.74/1.32 = 32%

there are possibly execution issues with the core team considering how hectic it has been especially on the top management part of the company.","another is that golden cove clocks quite a bit higher, and at 4ghz+ you are running into a territory of extremely diminishing returns.",so they might have chosen larger cell blocks solely to allow the core to clock higher.,compared to the gracemont portion.,golden cove is 1.5x faster per clock but nearly 4x the size of gracemont.,so gracemont beats them all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"a really technical read which tbh i don't understand most off, but i have been trying to find a good way to start learning more about.",the broad overview was decently easy to understand.,"chips and cheese writes some great stuff, i especially liked their investigation about golden cove caches though.",edit: i used though like 4 times in those 3 sentences lmao,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you are referring to the intel 7, formerly known as intel 10nm which is equal to tsmc 7 in transistor density.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
howâ€™s the implementation outside of the adl segmentation kerfuffle an issue?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lesser density is probably one of the main reason why intel chips clocks so much higher than ryzen.,"both companies have capable engineers, it is just that they went off diff path.","amd is going hard on density & power efficiency, intel seems to going for absolute performance gain.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we should be happy they were able to pull off that 15% considering the huge amount of time between those product's launch dates.,i'm hoping they can ramp up sooner rather than later now that they've got new toys to play with.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
transistor density is the important part for the core size.,the process size is just a marketing name at this point.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nobody's 7nm is 7nm.,they're all marketing names at this point.,"intel 7 is similar density to other similar named processes, so the name is probably a good choice on their part and not just marketing nonsense.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel has always been honest with their density, amd and tsmc however have not",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is false.,the transistor density in intel 7 is pretty equal to tsmc 7nm and that is the process node used in zen 3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well alderlake uarch is nothing like nehalem lol.,"but yeah, from rumors it sounds like lunarlake will be a significant redesign, more so than skylake -> alderlake.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably a combination of several factors.,"to throw out in random order: 
 zen 3 is the second design on a relatively mature node, so probably well optimized for that node.",adl is on a new node that had to be reworked relatively late into development (its predecessor even had to be backported to 14nm).,it is probably a much more hurried layout due to time constraints.,there are some disabled features (avx512) and also wider data paths generally throughout the design to accommodate wider avx data.,zen 3 lacks these.,"we don't have exact density figures for intel 7 (beyond the vague remark that it is slightly less dense than intel 10nm), but it may be somewhat less dense than tsmc 7nm.",doesn't take many 15 or 20% differences to add up to 75%.,will be interesting to see if raptor lake is much different once they've had more time with intel 7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the golden cove is just bigger in almost everything.,"it has bigger buffers at every step, wider frontend, wider backend etc.",zen3 was significantly limited by amd wanting it to fit similar size chips than zen2.,the golden cove core itself is significantly faster than zen3 in most workloads.,amd gains some of the difference back with their faster caches and very large l3 cache.,also amdâ€™s branch predictor is still a bit better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea.,formerly known as a marketing concept if you can change it from 10 to 7 arbitrarily and it doesnâ€™t matter for all intents and purposes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""avx-512"" consists of over a dozen isa extensions that are implemented in a seemingly haphazard way across different intel cpus, as shown here: [cpus with avx-512](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/avx-512#cpus_with_avx-512)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i mean if we wanna ""play"" that game it took amd 4+ years to finally surpass intels 14nm in terms of performance.","it wasn't until they launched zen 2 that their ipc finally surpassed intel, but due to memory latency due to the chiplet design intel still held the gaming crown quite easily.","quite frankly as far as absolute single threaded and gaming performance went, zen 3 did finally surpass intel, especially when only considering for out of the box stock performance.","but in the hands of a knowledgeable enthusiast, with a good cooler, high speed bdie ram, and a good 2 dimm motherboard a 10th gen could be overclocked to maintain its crown of the best overall gaming cpu up until the launch of 12th gen and the recently released 5800x3d.","honestly the fact that intel kept their 14nm process ""relevant"" for over 6 years is extremely impressive and a testament of not only how hard intel was sagging off and not trying for so many years, but also a testament to how good their packaging and execution is.",pretty insane to think of where they (and amd) would be if 10nm had launched back in 2017 or even 2018 as they had initially predicted.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i agree, but op was comparing intel 7 to tsmc 7nm thinking they were the same thing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's an interesting way of saying intel stopped publicizing this sort of information several years ago.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"raptor cove is supposed to be just golden cove with a bit bigger l2 cache, so likely the size will even increase a little.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wonder if the intel chip includes graphics?,it's probably likely that the zen3 core does not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
indeed.,for many tech illiterate people the old nanometer scale was what they used to compare process nodes across manufacturers so intel had to make this change to numbering.,"most people seemed to think that intel 10nm was worse than tsmc 7nm, just because the other had a smaller number.",go figure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
new cpu gets newest instruction right?,howâ€™s that any different than any other standard thatâ€™s ever been rolled out?,people donâ€™t complain that their older laptop lacks usb 20g because the hardware wasnâ€™t ready 10 years ago.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm not fanboying, i want competition, but that should have been very clear with my last sentence.","...then again, whenever people only reference gaming and don't think a knowledgeable enthusiast could do the same with zen 3 via your overclocking example a person has to question motive, especially when they defend the 14nm rut.","i actually started playing with the rival because of how pissed off i was at intel - i mean i went 5+ years between a 3770k and all they had to show for it was a 7700k...  that was my only choice at the time, what a waste.","i might flip back next build, and i hope they keep one-upping each other.",prior to any of this i had not touched an amd product since the athlon 64 days...!,"ryzen got a lot of attention because it earned it, gotta be real here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"don't want to fight this war but zen 3 in the hands of good tunners and overclockers was relatively and most of the times faster than any 10th gen configuration, even with all the ram and chiplet bottlenecks on amd's side.",ipc from zen 3 was so far ahead of intel's 10th it wasn't even funny.,the only reason 14nm was so relevant on intel's side for so long was purely from clock advantage.,"both have their own merits, but completely disregarding what can be achieved on zen platform to make 10th gen look good is a bit unfair.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tsmc 7nm is not 7nm either.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in terms of density, they're close.","in terms of performance, the intel wins.","responding to that by saying intel's is ""actually 10nm"" is actually making the confusion worse, since that gives the impression that tsmc is ahead.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"lol, thereâ€™s a lot of fair criticisms of intel, but they really have been the most honest fab by a very wide margin.","most minor node revisions get entirely new bogus names from competing foundries (12nm, 8nm, etc) that intel just marketed as a â€œ+â€ revision.","people trying to meme about intel +++ were mocking a foundry actually being honest about the level of process improvement, while claiming intel was somehow more dishonest than the competition.","even with an admittedly stagnant node, intel held onto the ipc crown for most tasks with their 2015 microarchitecture until zen 2, and the gaming ipc crown so many redditorâ€™s seem to care about it wasnâ€™t (mostly) taken until zen 3.

alder lake and intel 7 (formerly intelâ€™s 10nm) were very impressive jumps, competition is great, amd isnâ€™t your friend, no company is.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, but manufacturing and yields can be tweaked to improve through time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if it is a similar architecture it will be interesting to see if they are able to optimize the layout further to reduce it's size.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for some instructions.,"for others it looks like: new cpu gets new instructions and depreceates a random subset of existing instructions, only for later processors to maybe pick those up again or maybe not, and any configuration whatsoever of these over a dozen instruction sets has the exact same marketing name.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i own both.,and ive heavily tuned both.,10900k with like dual rank 4600 c17 fully tuned memory flat out gets more consistant fps in most games even vs a fully tuned all core overclocked 5950x with 3800 mhz c14 ram.,most ryzen owners don't even realize that an all core oc is actually faster in the vast majority of games.,but that's another topic for another day.,"in a fair number of games the 5950x would have the higher maximum frame rate, but the 10900k has much more consistent frame to frame variance and much better minimums.",10900k isn't universally better in all games and both are usually pretty close.,"but, if i only cared about gaming and could only pick one of those two i'd choose the 10900k.",though there are some games where the 5950x comes out ahead.,and obviously on any multi threaded workload the zen 3 chip wins hands down.,hell even most single threaded benchmarks the 5950x wins.,but that memory tuning and latency is just a massive boost for the 10900ks frametime performance that the 5950x even with all its ipc advantage just cant fully compensate for due to the nature of it having to communicate across the fclock between cpu caches.,"for a novice user who just sets things out of the box, the 5950x will be better overall.",but in the right hands a 10900k is a hair faster once both are properly tuned.,i'm not disregarding anything.,just fully know what both platforms are capable of.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you know intel chips can be overclocked as well, right?","intel systems are generally less restricted than amd, as intel allows vendors to modify the microcode and bootloader before it's compiled whereas amd ships them precompiled.","it's by design that basically every amd zen 2/3 chiplet design caps out at 1900 mhz fclk, while intel systems can generally run as fast as the silicon allows.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">they would optimize it only if they found that it's needed

i'm going to stop you there.",they absolutely need to optimize the raptor lake layout since there are some architecture changes.,"you cannot ship a new cpu (even one relatively similar to an existing one) without doing that, it won't hit frequency or power targets if you don't.",it's one of those things you need to do to have a viable product.,i think it's interesting because the changes look to be relatively small.,so total gates per core is probably similar.,"however it will have been designed much later in the intel 7 development cycle, so it should give them more time to work on it.",if they come up with a better design we know alder lake was probably rushed by the intel 7 changes late in it's development cycle.,"if they don't, maybe not.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

vehemently disagree.,again i own both products.,i'm not trying to extrapolate numbers from a cpu i own to make performance estimates for products i dont.,benchmark performance doesn't necessarily translate into gaming performance.,sometimes they can be correlatory but it all depends on what its testing.,"at the end of the day, yes zen 3 has higher ipc.",but without a doubt it also has significantly higher memory latency and lower memory bandwidth.,"some games, that matters more than others.",but it's definitely a noticeable advantage for high refresh competitive gaming.,"in such scenarios more often than not, a fully overclocked 10900k will beat out a 5950x which itself is generally a few percent (though not usually meaningfully) faster than a 5800x.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ipc between them is similar.,like a 11900k performs more or less the same as a 5800x in most workloads.,it's just a matter of which games you test.,they tested 3 games.,"here they tested more games:

node size always used to mean the average gate width.,"the gate being one part of the transistor (gate, source and drain.",voltage at the gate means current flows from source to drain).,i guess the gate was the largest part of the transistor.,"there are lits of other metrics you can look at though, track width, track spacing, layer spacing and height and more.","think about it, you are layer by layer building masses of transistors and the tracks to wire them all up.",reducing all of those measurements will make thinga closer together and hence run faster.,"that isnt easy, however.",keep in mind a silicon atom is about 0.2 nm across.,"so if the largest part of your transistor is 5nm, then its 25 *atoms* across.",how many atoms in the smaller parts?,"things start getting impossible fast, and quantum mechanical effects start taking over like quantum tunneling which translates to leakage and crosstalk.","from about 25nm and most forever before, transistors were basically the same.",now in order to get more performance out of the same node size different transistor designs are used.,things like finfets and gate all around and such.,"this allows many more transistors to be fitted in, not because they are smaller per say, but because their design allows them to be packed closer together and use less power etc.",so instead of calling them 25nm +++++++++++++ fab conpanies extrapolated how they'd consider the old style transistors to perform when scaled down to impossibly small.,then they predict this new nodes performance and line it up.,"boom, this is 7nm.",its really 25nm but it performs as if it were 7nm because of our funky new transistor design.,"you have to grain of salt it a bit though, because they are all different.","i'll say one thing about intel and their fabs, they have always been conservative with their 'xnm' proclaimations.","ok there were lots of yield issues with it to begin with... but their 10nm node, when you looked at all the metrics, was only marginally worse than competitors 7nm nodes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

agree to disagree.,"most competitive games, if not all of them, that require high framerate perform significatively better on zen 3 than 10th gen counterparts.","again, i'm not extrapolating anything, i've had a 5800x myself, i see what it can do and i've seen what 10th gen can do in the hands of some very capable people on private discords.","i know who you are from several discords, you know me as well just not from this alias.",i'm very confortable with my assessment.,"again, agree to disagree, nothing wrong with that.",happy days,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"switching to ddr5 gives an enormous boost in bandwidth but only a tiny difference in performance, so not particularly bandwidth constrained.","memory latency seems to be at least as big a factor, at least for games.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"gaming performance does not actually correlate to any productivity ones, even those that are single or light threaded.",if you check out 5800x3d benchmarks you'll find that it loses nearly every single or multi thread productivity benchmark to 12900k (and even the original 5800x) but is overall on par with 12900k in gaming.,gaming is a very special type of workload.,"here are a couple of reasons i could think about why alder lake barely beats zen 3 in games,

1.",**games have higher branch prediction miss rates** comparing to a lot of productivity workloads (regardless 1t/nt).,"golden cove has deeper pipelines, hence much higher penalty on missed branch prediction.","in fact, zen 3 is extremely good at hiding its branch miss penalty (we're talking about 18 cycles on golden cove vs 13 cycles on zen 3)
2.",**games are more memory dependent and more latency sensitive** than a lot of the 1t/nt benchmarks.,"alder lake has way worse l3 latency (like 15-20ns comparing to 10-12ns on zen 3), and the cache is smaller too (30mb max on i9, cut down to 25mb/20mb on i7/i5 while all amd vermeer processors have access to full 32mb cache and some even have 96mb).","also, when the little cores are active, ring bus (where l3 cache is at) frequency got limited at the lowest clock of the little cores (like 3.7-4.1 ghz) so this contributes to the higher l3 latency when you have something like background service active on little core when you play games using the big core.","what makes it even worse is the higher memory latency of ddr5 running at stock speeds (like 4800c40 or even lower if you fully populate all the dimms with high capacity kits)
3.",**we've reached a point where the cpus are so powerful that a lot of games are gpu bound even at 1080p**.,and the framerates are also ridiculously high anyway.,"(1) and (2) are the major contributing factors, while (3) could be mitigated by benching 720p.",a lot of reviewers did so and found larger gaps between processors.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think a large part of this has to do with the cache and cache clock.,"amd chips generally have more cache than intel chips, and this gen there's been some additional tuning issues on the cache clock with a mix of p and e cores.","i wouldn't say this is bad as a design flaw, but if the cache clock is a bit fussy at boosted clocks that could cause problems at peak performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i've really been enjoying reading all of your answers.,i feel like i'm learning a lot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
any cpu that scales with faster memory is technically bandwidth starved.,this is mostly true for gaming workloads.,productivity applications tend to favor ipc and clock speed.,adl beats zen 3 in a fair number of games by 30% or more when the architecture is getting stressed more than the memory.,when zen 3 chips launched they were barely faster than comet lake in games despite the much higher ipc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is more to fps than just the cpu.,"also, the cpu tries to predict what itll have to do next, and fetches the required data in advance.",amdâ€™s algorithm for this on zen3 is better for common gaming scenarios than intels algoritm on alder lake.,so basically in gaming intelâ€™s ipc takes a dip in gaming scenarios compared to amd.,but what youre probably seeing is boosting behaviour.,"in single core workloads turboing over 5ghz is super common for the higher end alder lake parts, whereas youre not gonna see that in workloads that stress more threads, like gaming.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm not a scientist or engineer.,so my take may be wrong.,alder lake has 8 performance cores and 8 efficient ones (in the top end at least).,"the 8 performance cores do almost all the work, while the efficient ones only do the background ones.",so the 12900k is just a 8 core part for the most part.,zen3 has whole 16 cores on the top end.,20-30% performance per core for 8 cores is still less than a 16 core cpu in multi thread.,"if you take zen3 per core performance as ""1"", then 16 core give 16 (1x16).",lets be optimistic and take alder lake as a 30% jump in single core.,so this will be 1.3 (30% + 1).,so 1.3x8 is 10.4. so it's still missing that 5.6 points.,alder lake isn't lagging so much behind in multi core maybe because the e cores do some work.,so let's say e cores give about 50% of p-cores' performance.,so that'll be 0.65 (1.3/2).,8 e-cores add up to 5.2. so total 8p + 8e would be 10.4+5.2 which is 15.6. lower than a 16 core zen3.,so essentially lower performance.,"&#x200b;

my take could be wrong, so i'm sorry in advance for that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i feel like we're actually gpu limited.,cpus are advancing at a rate that 90% games don't really need.,"the fact  is that at times the 12900ks is sometimes 30% faster than a 5950x, when paired with with ddr5, while other times it's only like 5% ahead.",i'm expecting the gap to widen when new gpus get here.,"you might not think a 3090 or 6900xt would be a bottleneck, but we're often talking max settings at 200fps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

where did you get 13 cycles for zen 3?,golden cove has a longer pipeline stage but the differences aren't drastic.,golden cove is 19 cycles without the uop cache but uop cache hit results in 15 cycles.,zen 3 i believe is 18 cycles with uop cache miss and 14 with uop cache hit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ddr5 doesn't hold a candle to a well tuned 4000mt/s+ ddr4.,ddr5 has bandwidth but it only runs half the memory controller speed (gear 2) and has pretty slack timings resulting in a pretty underwhelming overall latency.,"next gen ddr5 will be good though, no doubt.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> any cpu that scales with faster memory is technically bandwidth starved.,"all cpus load from memory and so faster memory will always increase cpu performance, if only slightly.",usually bandwidth starved implies that the scaling from faster memory performance is comparable to the scaling from faster clock speed.,"in that scenario the memory controller is failing to feed the front end, hence it is ""starved"" for data.","if doubling memory bandwidth has a much smaller effect than doubling clockspeed, then the front end is mostly being fed, and so not starved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

zen 2 has a 4k instruction uop cache and haswell is at 1.5k.","at 4k, the average hit rate seems to be in the 60% range.","with golden cove, the hit rate will be similar as it also has a 4k uop cache.","it could be that zen 3's implementation makes the best case scenario few stages shorter, but the worst case scenario difference isn't that big.","golden cove: (19 - 15)\*0.6 + 15 = 17.5

zen 3: (18-11)\*0.6 + 11 = 15

which is still nowhere drastic as you originally claimed.\* i am not faulting you for anything just reminding you how they go about saying the stages are.",with uop cache it varies depending on the application.,\*also the document says 11 stage is not only with a uop cache hit but depending on the application and average minimum could be higher at 12-13.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the minimum of 13 stages for golden cove also falls into the same trap as amd saying minimum for zen 3 is 11. yes there are corner case scenarios but i assume the minimum is 13 for zen 3 and 15 for golden cove for the most common scenarios.,"also the test didn't mention what it got for zen 3.

the 26 stage worst case scenario for golden cove is likely for floating point instructions and when we say branch mispredict penalty, we don't mean fp, but integer.","fp is less affected by mispredicts because it's easier to get higher ilp and has quite a bit higher stages, and the integer portion is what really determines ""ipc"" or basically the quality of the core.",beefing up the integer ipc is the real test because that boosts *everything*.,"then if we looked at mispredicts by what architects refer when it comes to branch mispredicts, then the maximum should be 19 for golden cove(18+1) when it misses the uop cache.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there's a table in the article, right above what i quoted, showing the results of zen 1/2/3, skylake/cypress cove/golden cove as well as gracemont.","https://imgur.com/mvpmyve

it shows that what amd stated in their optimization guide is correct, since most of the test cases falls into the \~13 cycles range.","and unlike zen 3, most test cases for golden cove is 18 cycles.","there are a few cases that golden cove took 13 cycles to recover from failed branch prediction, but **in those cases zen 3 only took 8 cycles**.",zen 3 clearly has a huge advantage in every test case in the table.,"combined with similar branch prediction accuracy in almost every specint tests, it wasted much less cycles processing branches.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"problem with gear 1 vs gear 2 on ryzen is you're comparing ddr4 vs ddr4, giving you a latency penalty with no hardware improvements to compensate, so you'd need either high bandwidth demands or very high frequency overclocks to justify going gear 2.

with ddr5 you don't really have a choice right now and ddr5 has improvements like longer burst length and improved bank refresh that helps reduce real world access times even if the spec is higher latency.",so when you compare gear 1 ddr4 vs gear 2 ddr5 the results tend to favor higher frequency ddr5.,it's when (if) memory controllers get good enough for gear 1 ddr5 that you'll start to see the problems with gear 2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the technical penalty for gear 2 means the imc, internal memory controller, runs at half speed.",meaning it takes ddr5 6400 mhz to have the imc running at 3200 mhz.,this is the penalty.,itâ€™s important for memory latency.,if itâ€™s ddr5 5600 that means the imc is running half speed at 2800 mhz.,4800 mhz ddr5 has imc running at 2400 mhz.,"also the timings canâ€™t be as tight in gear 2.

> ddr5 seems to have some sort of mechanism to compensate for higher latency.,"ddr5 is divided into two parallel channels whereas ddr4 has only 1.  technically this has no effect on latency, memory takes the same time either way.","but if you have a multithreaded program and multiple cores are issuing loads, then having two channels means you can issue them to the memory faster on average (less waiting), so the effective penalty for a cache miss is probably a little lower than the latency figures suggest it should be relative to ddr4.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes exactly.,i had an asus prime z690-a that said it supported ddr5 6000mhz at top speed.,and yet it crashed an occt test like 10-20 minutes in at xmp settings.,and it was not cpu as cpu had exact same settings on a asus ddr4 board and passed with flying colors many times.,"6000 would probably work well on the higher end boards, but that is the point.",you cannot get the advertised speeds it says it supports as you have to step up to a 6400mhz oc supporting board on average to get 6000mhz reliable.,"&#x200b;

by the time ddr5 has a significant impact in gaming your cpu will most likely be mid-range at best.,"letâ€™s say in 2-3 years ddr5 really boosts performance in games, by that time the 12900ks will be out-performed by the 15600k or whatever mid-range cpu is available at that time.",whether itâ€™s worth paying the extra money to go with ddr5 now is something only you can decide.,personally i upgraded from a 9900k to a 12600k and stayed with ddr4 mostly because of the price of ddr5 and also that the performance increase isnâ€™t worth it yet for me.,i will probably keep this setup until ddr5 really shows a big performance increase in games which i imagine will be in 2-3 years time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

then you haven't paid attention to history.,"haswell-e was never able to run more than ddr4-3200 reliably, and people were hitting ddr4-3200 within a month of release.",broadwell-e was hitting ddr4-3400 within the same timeframe.,newer boards did nothing to improve that.,"raptor lake might be able to run slightly faster than ddr5-6800 on the 2 dimm boards, but i wouldn't hold my breath.","seeing as the good z690 apex boards can daily ddr5-7400, i suspect the main limitation right now are the boards.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
interesting never knew that.,can a lot x99 boards and z170 boards support faster than 2400mhz ddr4 reliably with bios updates??,"&#x200b;

"> there seems to be an architectural wall at around 46ns latency and 62000mb/s read/write with the ram where going past that gets no fps gain

for that reason i figure you may as well get a top bin of ddr4 and wait for ddr5 worth buying.",raptor lake may require ddr5 in which case youâ€™re forced to get it but tuned ddr4 is still super strong in gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"honestly being just an spec observer i doubt the 12gen run hotter with ddr5, dont forget that the imc runs at half the speed of the ram compared to when you run ddr4 at 1:1. the temp difference is probably because of the voltage differences of the board.",but if the cpu get access to much more data at once i can imagine the cpu itself can get hotter as it gets more to do at once.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"you will probably get both better performance and improved thermals by lowering 0.1 or 0.2ghz, and with really fast ddr5 like the 6400 cl32 or 6800 cl32 stuff.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
from what i understood ddr5 can send 2 commands per clock(not 2t) compared do ddr4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and even at same clock speeds of same exact alder lake cpu is it still is expected behavior as it has more work to do to process faster ram??,"&#x200b;

well even though amd uses less power, it seems harder to cool and traps heat easier.",and also ihs is smaller since it cannot get rid of heat as easily so alder lake seems easier to cool relative to power consumption anyways based on research.,"&#x200b;

and i am an air only cooler.",water cooling is out of the equation for me.,if there is any leak kiss your components goodbye as it shorts it out due to liquid conductivity with electricity.,if a component overheats it shuts itself off and components can withstand extreme temps for seconds unlike spillage of liquid which shorts it out immediately.,plus i also hate complexity and maintenance of water cooling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so would that make performance equal to 1 command per clock in gear 1 at same ram frequency??,"&#x200b;

so for instance is 32gb (2 x 16gb) of ddr5 at 6400mhz with 2 commands per clock in gear 2 roughly the same performance as hypothetical (as i know ddr5 cannot run in gear 1 at least not the same gear 1 you see in the bios and hwinfo with slower ddr4) 1 command per clock ddr5 (2 x 16gb) 6400mhz in gear 1??","&#x200b;

"they [perform nearly identically in gaming](https://youtu.be/ydgn4w97esk?t=1156) when power limits are increased on the 12700(f), however anything that force the cpu down to its all-core frequency will show a difference, like with [cinebench r23](https://youtu.be/ydgn4w97esk?t=514), it drops down to ~94% of the performance of the 12700k(f), so probably around 4.4-4.5ghz all-core turbo vs the 12700k(f)'s 4.7ghz all-core turbo (i could easily find the 12700k(f)'s all-core turbo, but couldn't find the non-k's all-core turbo).",also ddr4 memory frequency past 3200mhz is hit or miss past 3200mhz because of locked vccsa.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is true.,"cpus i3-i9 are generally all produced the same, trying to be i9s but suffering from manufacturer faults.","these are tested, and individual cores and other components are measured for quality and binned into i9, i7, etc.","so if a cpu comes out with 8 functional p-cores, and the worst is i7 quality, that chip becomes an i7.","and if a chip comes out with \[i3, i5, i5, i5, i5, i7, i7, i9\, that chip can become an i5 because that model is spec'd for fewer p-cores, so you can turn the i3 quality core off.",this generation is unique because of the e cores.,"since the 12700s are spec'd for 4 e-cores, while the 12900 is spec'd for 8. this means a chip can have 8 out of 8 p-cores at i9 quality but the chip ends up being an i7 because of a single defective e-core.","this isn't super likely, but it does bias the binning to be favorable to the 12700k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the ihs will always bow or concave due to the way the cpu is held in place, manufacturing tolerances, and the cooler cold plate that you choose to install with.",it will never be perfectly flat.,no cpu ihs is perfectly flat.,the news about alderlake ihs bowing is like all the other prior intel ihs.,it will bend slightly.,it is of concern for extreme overclockers looking to squeeze off every edge that they can get.,"but for the everyday guy like you or i, radiator placement is much much more important than if the ihs is bowing leading to poor thermal performance.","place your radiator in front of the case for the cool air, and your cpu should run fine.",bonus if you get the tubes down.,extra bonus if you use arctic liquid freezer 2 aio.,those radiators are thicker than normal.,so a 240 or 280mm rad from arctic will have more cooling capacity than the competition.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
alder lake are the [best selling cpus on newegg](https://www.newegg.com/d/best-sellers/processors-desktops/s/id-343?tid=7671).,check the reviews.,if there was a problem with bowing and cooling the average rating would not be 5 stars.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thanks for confirming i guess that everything i was reading was just bs blown out of proportion.,im upgrading from i7 6700 and before that i had an i7 980x oced and my single fan corsair h60 aio blowing out the back panel has kept both of these cpus below 65â° their whole lives.,so my guess is the 12400f will probably run even cooler.,i dont plan on using that garbo cooler that comes with it...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the problem is with the clamping mechanism of the socket.,"previously it distributed the pressure evenly from all sides, now it's mostly concentrated on left and right due to the new, longer clamp design.",thus the ihs bending happening.,whoever modified the socket like this should be fired for being retarded.,all it took was adding two small clamps top and bottom.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah this whole alder lake bending case was just very popular for tech news to write about because those articles attract a lot of views meaning more money.,if it was a real problem for usual user it'd reflect in customer reviews.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great point.,as i said in another reply my single fan aio has kept my system cool thus far.,and i run my system with open panels since i greatly favor performance over aesthetics.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wow really i never knew any of that.,all these comments helped take away any uncertainties i had.,guess im set on getting a 12400f unless theres some magical deal on an r5 5600.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i think im gonna decide between those 2. on newegg the 5600 just raised from $179 to $209 and the i5 12400f is at $169.,but b660 boards still cost more than b550.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yup,

check it out.",from 2006. people were lapping their ihs and they gained 3 to 4 c off the cpu temps.,"https://www.legitreviews.com/intel-ihs-lapping-and-removal-for-lga775-cpus\_402

yes he can achieve better thermal results but at the cost of less contact pressure (this pressure is actually required for correct contacts with the pins).",i assume you would see similar results if you decided sand the ihs flat instead of the washer mod.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but theyâ€™ve used similar mechanisms in the past.,"lga2011 applies pressure from just two sides, although itâ€™s maybe spread out a bit more (that was definitely a beefy socket).",air coolers compensated for this effect a long time ago by adjusting the shape of their contact surface.,"it seems a big part of the issue is many aio cooler designers got lazy and stopped doing the same thing (â€œitâ€™s easier to make it totally flat!â€), and because the product could already cool better, no one cared.","but now many aios arenâ€™t performing well when that long-standing effect starts to matter again, and people blame the cpu versus the cooler design.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
makes a whole lot of sense intel has been dominating the market and critics were probably purposely overreacting just to spite sales (which it obviously never did),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the problem lies in the clamp design.,also lga2011 has 4 points of contact.,[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/socket\_2011\_imgp3918.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/socket_2011_imgp3918.jpg),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i've got a 128 gb ddr4 alder lake system now.,do you really need to wait for sapphire rapids if you're on a budget?,it'll be the same basic architecture but without the small cores and most likely will have the higher latency mesh.,it'll be great if you want to pay for dozens of cores or at least 256 gb ram but not exactly a good value platform compared to alder lake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah the age of 2 dimm per channel is pretty much dead as far as i can see (and was pretty iffy even in ddr4 era with high capacity dimms), which means we should see realistically 128 gigabytes of ram with 32 gigabytes per dimm in a hypothetical 4 channel hedt setup.",we are seeing rumors of 5600 mt/s ddr5 support for raptor lake (and presumably the hedt counterpart as well) which should bode well for that generation.,"lower latencies are certainly rearing their heads finally on high capacity dimms from g.skill, but i will take that with a grain of salt, since g.skill is one of the companies that bin extremely unreliably unlike a brand like crucial (micron).",i honestly would not expect actual reliability at more than a few bins above 4800 on sapphire rapids hedt at 1 dimm per channel for 32 gigabyte dual sided dimms.,maybe 5600 at absolutely maximum.,10ns bins start at an eye watering 750 usd per 2x32 gigabyte kit currently (and only just came out/coming out in the next few days).,hopefully those tamp down to at most 500 usd per 2x32 gigabyte 10ns kit by sapphire rapids hedt launch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

my recommendation is to wait until you have a budget to upgrade to a new cpu generation and new motherboard.",especially if you're gaming at 1440p.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i looked it up, i guess not.","i thought it was all 400 series boards, but it's only z490 i think.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"optane is supported, but supposedly only h series.",as far as i know h series can only accelerate the integrated ssd and not other drives.,someone with more knowledge can correct or clarify.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have a h670 board and various m10 drives, 12th gen only supports h10/h20.",the feature set has been deprecated.,"you can only use the hybrid(optane + nand) m2 drives for accelerating their own storage, they've killed sata based acceleration.","i was also surprised as i upgraded from a 10th gen that was accelerating a 3tb drive with 118gb optane module, after upgrading and fighting to get all the appropriate drivers installed intel optane and memory storage claims there are no valid pairs for acceleration...

it's not worth it and is quite annoying, if you truly want to accelerate storage with optane try [primocache](https://www.romexsoftware.com/en-us/primo-cache/), works just as well, it is $30 for a license but has a 30 day trial thats definitely worth trying out especially if you already have all the parts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think you're right- from what i'm seeing h series is just a bunch of nand flash with an optane cache.,pretty niche.,omg this is so dumb.,"nand is plenty fast enough for my needs, and intel's own docs don't specify that it's only the fairly worthless variation of optane that's supported on new hardware.",fuuuuuck.,i've had all this hardware long enough i can't return it.,i thought between 12th gen being amazing and this tidy solution to massive storage this was a home-dunk.,i woulda gone with 10th/11th gen or amd or gotten a giant nand drive if i'd known intel kneecapped their coolest tech.,"sorry, im frustrated.",i hope someone knows how to get it to play together anyway.,i'm too mad to let intel tell me what i can do with my hardware.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i know this post is 2 months old at this point, but i feel this is worth mentioning since i'm sure this is useful for some people.",i believe you should still be able to use the optane m10 drives as normal nvme ssds that you can use with primocache.,i think this is the case since only the rst/optane software is what is keeping it from working on 12th gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so, you have these parts and they donâ€™t actually work together?","iâ€™d contemplated getting a m-series drive for my 12th gen system just to try to get it going, but in the end decided it wasnâ€™t worth it.","for like the last 15 years iâ€™ve always had a big hard drive array in my systems, but decided to abandon magnetic media this time around.",i settled on a 2tb gen4 m2 ssd and two 4tb gen3 m2 ssds in a raid 0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

power draw is basically just set by the manufacturer.,"alder lake has options down to 9w class: https://www.anandtech.com/show/17278/intel-launches-alder-lake-u-and-p-series-processors-ultraportable-laptops-coming-in-march

9-11w idle sounds really high and is probably total system power?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very interesting thanks!,i am pretty constrained by whatever nucs intel releases because i built my computer around the form factor.,the u series looks very fun and i hope those are available.,total system draw sounds about right now that i am thinking about it.,i have a small  7 inch screen maybe adding 2.5w.,i was getting about 3-4 hours with a 4800u editing text files on a 60whr battery and that's something i am looking to improve on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
e cores will not help for idle.,"by the way idle power differences will be added to loaded scenarios as well, high or low.","so if one system uses 5w less in idle, than expect 5w higher when it's light/bursty load, or heavy load.",that naturally makes reduces the impact of idle power on higher workloads.,they won't help for light workloads either\* because windows hardware is built to accommodate countless hardware and software configurations.,so the cpu is built to reduce power use in such general purpose scenarios.,the e cores are there to increase multi-core performance without blowing tdp and area.,"it is ""efficient"" that way, but not the typical way people think of efficiency when it comes to laptops, such as battery life.",the cores are all pretty close to zero at idle anyways.,"as for a sff like a nuc you are using, power efficiency especially in idle is determined significantly by motherboard design.",how will you know?,reviews and testing unfortunately.,\*actually it can but likely needs explicit software support.,you can expect current supported applications to be numbering very close to zero.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10700-11700k?,almost no benefits.,it's like throwing money into fire,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">should i buy the 11700k, wait and do a 12th or 13th gen when i have more budget?",wait till you can upgrade to one of those.,the only real reason to get 11th gen when youre on 10th gen is avx-512 accelerated workloads.,"it seems like you are relying on the igp, but if you're not the 12700f can be had for $310 and has essentially the same performance as the 12700k, its an easy way to save money for builds that dont need an igp or overclocking.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
one advantage of 11th gen is pci-e 4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no gaming in this case.,wonâ€™t even run windows,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's a troll,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
word on the street all these 12th gen laptop cpus are terrible for battery life.,only good for benchmarks when plugged in.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am using an lg gram 17 with the i7 1260p.,"it lasts around 7 hours, and the fans do spin when i have a significant amount of tabs open.","on my wooden table, the laptop can get warm when web browsing.","but compared to the 11th gen on the surface laptop 4, i can say the 12th gen processor with faster ram makes the experience of using windows 11 more snappy overall.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, i think it's the uncore power draw?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how do you know?,you own one?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am trying to get feedbacks on gram 17 with i7 1260p.,i am learning coding and developers around have laptops worth 3000 dollars but they only code no game.,is it really necessary to get a laptop worth 3000 dollars to code plus awful battery life.,lg claims 18 hours but your claim sounds more realistic but still great.,17 inch i found it for 1099 dollars.,"i want to buy it, what do you think?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have had the opposite experience.,these 12th gen laptops are so much better than 11th gen for battery.,get 10+ hours on my laptop.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"watch reviews, read comments by people who already got them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the lg gram 17 is an excellent option for a programmer, and you will certainly appreciate the large screen real-estate.","&#x200b;

it should be more than powerful enough for any programs you create in college.","&#x200b;

the only issue i found with the lg gram 17 is that it doesn't fit into a typical backpack (it is just too wide/tall).","i found this to be a significant inconvenience, so i actually just returned the gram 17 and replaced it with the gram 16. it has the same performance and specs except for a slightly smaller screen (i found it not to be really a huge deal).",now my gram 16 fits into my laptop sleeve and in the laptop slot in my backpack.,"&#x200b;

what is the spec of the gram 17 you found?",i paid 1499 for a gram 16 but got 16gb ram and 1tb ssd to ensure i do not run out of storage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what's the size of your battery?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
both the dave2d and ltt reviews of the dell xps 13 plus show around 10 hours of battery life.,"obviously not leading the industry here, but with more performance than amd and the m1 macbook's.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same as yours only with 512gb ssd which is enough for now.,check costco warehouses and you will find the greatest deals on anything basically.,i realize warehouses have better prices than online on almost anything.,i stop by weekly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
71whr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and 10 hours is considered bad now?,what?,a few year ago if you had a laptop that lasted 6 hours on battery then it was considered awesome battery life.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i really don't get that.,i use the 1260p and get about 10 hours or so of battery life.,thats double the battery life of anything i have used previously.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what do you want to know?,itâ€™s a previous generation quad core cpu.,graphics is what intel integrated graphics are.,capable of some basic gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it will perform similarly to the i7-1165g7, perhaps even the i5-1135g7 because they are all 4 core 8 threads.","(i5 has a 15% slower integrated graphics) if you can find these it might save you a fair bit of money, given these laptops still fulfill your needs.","because high frequency requires a lot of power, and laptops can't handle this much heat (especially since these are often found in business/ lightweight laptops...)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"basically, what can i expect from it?",is it at least half decent or is it pretty meh?,what kinda games are we talking?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh ok, thank you!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on what you want to do with it.,browse internet - sure.,compute molecular dynamics models - maybe not.,the graphics will run modern aaa games at maybe 20fps.,older or less demanding titles should run better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"okay, thank you for taking the time to explain!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 12700k at $300 is where it's at.,"great performance in games, with a powerful single and multithreaded showing as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 12700k/kf still seems like bad value to me unless you are a hobbyist overclocker.,"at least looking at us prices, ""mid-range"" builders should be looking at the 6-core cpus in the $200ish price range like the 12400(f) and 5600(x).",the next logical jump up for a gamer is the 12700f at just over $300.,that's the pick that make sense for a build with something like a 3080 or 6800 xt.,"the 5800x3d makes sense for an ""all out"" build or if you're the type of person who wants to get the maximum framerate in a competitive game.",imo 95% of people building gaming rigs today should be buying one of these four cpus and nothing else makes much sense unless you have some non-gaming use case as well that demands something different.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i want to build a pc.,i haven't done it before but i feel pretty confident and know a bit about pc's.,i'm kind of stuck between the ryzen 7 5800x3d and the intel i7 12700kf.,i want to get into gaming and maybe a bit of streaming.,which cpu would be the better option?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on regional pricing.,"here in canada the 5800x3d launched for $570 cad, the 12700k/kf goes for $470/$440 respectively.",at this point the 5800x3d is more expensive then the 5900x and opting to spend an additional $130 beyond the 5800x3d for the 5950x nets you a doubled core count and there's the 5600x for $250.,the 5800x3d does have niche as a drop in upgrade for older motherboards but some vendors are eally slow on rolling those bios updates for those unfortunately.,i have an msi x570 unify and they still l haven't released the [1.2.0.7](https://1.2.0.7) agesa and the x570 unify was and still is top end board.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i'd say that a msi pro b660m-a + 12600k + tuned 3200c14 b die will probably be the most that the average gamer could need at most, if otherwise you don't care about memory tuning then save the money by just getting any cheapo 3200mhz kit + 12400f.",i mostly bought a 12700k over a 12600k because rpcs3 really demands 8 physical cores over 6 physical cores.,"this is purely speaking from a us perspective, lord knows how pricing extends elsewhere.","the 5800x3d is great for someone who really does not want to bother with overclocking your cpu, investing in particularly robust liquid cooling, or for bother to get an expensive ram kit.","but between the 12700k, 5800x3d, and 12600k, they hardly draw much power in general gaming workloads as is so it's kind of whatever.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
of course the 12700k is bad value for gaming.,it's a 12 core prosumer part like the 5900x.,i wouldn't buy either of those for gaming.,"i'd look at the 5600x, 12600k or the 12400, personally.","the 5800x3d is also far too expensive for what it is, although the 5700x is worth looking at too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"see, to me the sensible purchase there is still the 12700f at about 400 cad.","put it on a decent b660 board and you'll save a pretty penny vs. 12700k w/z690 and for gaming, at least, the 12700k offers little to no benefit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"> 12700 will be for driving next gens top gpus not this gen.

my model for recommendations assumes a typical gamer upgrade path where the person keeps their cpu/motherboard for 4-6 years but upgrades their gpu sometime in the middle of that.",i'm also assuming that a person buying a mid-range gpu today will also be upgrading to a mid-range gpu later.,"with that in mind, a 5600x/12400 is arguably slight overkill for a 3060 but it will be able to push the mid-range gpus of tomorrow just fine too.","same logic for the 12700, but with high-end gpus.","i know ""futureproofing"" is a bad word in most pc building circles but it does make sense to consider the longevity of your cpu to a degree.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the thing is with a 5800x3d, you get the same performance as a 12900k and in many cases, more, for a much cheaper price than going all out 12900ks + most expensive ddr5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 12600k seems uncompelling to me because:

-if you are a mid-range buyer who is planning on using a mid-range gpu, the 12400 or 5600 are cheaper and will also support next-gen mid-range gpus just fine

-if you are wanting to buy a high-end gpu like a 3080 or 6800 xt, the extra you spend on an i7 is a marginal fraction of the overall build cost, and the i7 is probably going to give you a bit more longevity than the i5 given its extra p-cores and bigger cache

in short, if you're the sort of person who can buy a high-end graphics card, it makes sense to over-buy a bit on the cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
non-k models have locked vccsa which restricts memory overclocking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have no idea where you got $400 cad for 12700f but that isn't the price lol.,12700f is going for $439.99 cad plus tax.,it's about $500cad.,b660 in canada are more expensive than cheap z690.,the very low end asus b660 is $200 cad which is really bad quality.,others are $260-$340 cad.,basically msi pro z690-a is cheaper compared to majority of b660 (90%) of them.,this z690 is $220-280 cad .,12600k is much better value.,it's $330 cad right now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"also much more expensive, though.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yup.,my 11700k/3070/32gb ram/2x500gb m.2 raid 0 build pulls the same 200w from the wall as my ps5 when playing 4k games.,"of course, some games like cyberpunk and metro do push the card hard but my cpu is still very efficient and under 40c all the time.","nowadays i only need to enable turbo boost when playing star citizen (loves those 5ghz cores) but that's just an oddity, not the norm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dlss in quality mode is just an amazing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 12700f has no system agent voltage control though so no frequencies higher than ddr4-3200 (and also stuff like ring clock/uncore depend on sa voltage, which is critical given how low ring clock is with e-cores on).","for general gaming, a 12600k + tuned 3200c14 kit will beat out a 12700f by a good amount, and the difference in l2 size will be offset by the increase in dram frequency.",if by all intents and purposes you don't care about memory tuning just save the money on a 12400f.,that performance is enough to drive most modern gpu's just fine anyway.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sure, but like i said originally i'm talking about people who aren't wanting to do any serious tweaking, but rather want a set-it-and-forget-it experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it only matters for gear 1. and the l3 on 12700 series helps mitigate memory performance.,"gear 2 clocks high enough to overcome these issues with both ddr4 and 5.  with the addition of way more bandwidth,  which seems important for alderlake.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, but in gaming the performance gains for higher memory clocks are marginal at best.",we are talking low single digit % for a $80 savings (depends on 12700k sales).,price to performance the 12700f is the far better buy.,and then doesnt even factor in that you likely would be buying nicer ram if you plan on overclocking it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

wait i'm confused you said you undervolted but never minimized the voltage?,does that mean you didn't lower the voltage?,the difference between a 9900k and 9700k is not really going to change much for your room temp tbh you would be better severed getting a fan and opening a door,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'd be down to chop my gpu heat output down when not gaming.,i just don't know if you can set a crazy low undervolt for low-load use cases that would provide a meaningful decrease in idle temps without running into problems.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this would help a ton but the only problem is that the cooler air is in the house.,having a setup/fan moving air from my room to the house would sacrifice some of the privacy and sound isolation from my room.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

when you're not gaming your gpu uses a fraction of it's power anyways.,these days both the cpu and gpu downclock when not needed unless you are forcing them not to.,"you can reduce them further, but ultimately you have a bunch of small wattages adding up.","like my 27"" monitor pulls more wattage than my pc at idle...

you may run into quite small change tbh in gaming 9700k vs 9900k are probably within 10 or 20w of each other and at idle it's probably only a watt or two if you recently upgraded your gpu from say 10 series to 30 series of a similar model that's probably more so where the increased heat output would be under gaming load.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i guess what gives me this idea for my post is that my old cpu and gpu combo was a 9600k and a 1070/2060.,when i had those my idle temps were about 10c lower and my room was about 5f cooler throughout the year.,not only that but i'm positive that the idle power consumption/performance was more than overkill for just browsing and discord.,"if only there was a ""cool"" setting or something that gives me bare minimum performance when the gaming heat pump isn't necessary.",i feel like that would help a bit.,also there's not too much room for improvement in other areas since i can't move my bearded dragon out of my room and my bulbs are already all led.,i do need to have someone look at my window or something though because my window screen has no gaps or holes yet it still lets gnats and other bugs in.,though that won't help me in the summer when the outside air temp hits 80f-85f at night.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a cpu at idle draws like 7-15 watts.,"most modern gpus donâ€™t even run the fans when youâ€™re not gaming, so unless youâ€™re doing some heavy duty processing while not gaming, i doubt your gpu or cpu are responsible for most of your heat output.",could it be your monitors?,i recently discovered that it was my 3 panels that puts out most of the heat in my room.,"certainly incandescent bulbs put out a ton of heat, but you might be surprised by how much heat even leds can produce.",you could also get a more efficient power supply.,low efficiency means energy is turned into heat.,get a plantinum or titanium certified psu and theyâ€™ll run a lot cooler than a bronze.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

those are 3 very different processors you got there.,apart from the fact that the they span a 5 year period they are processors that are designed for different use cases.,how did you end up with such different laptop choices?,those laptops won't be anything similar to each other?,"the u series processors are the ultra low power consumption ones, so the 6660u was designed for a 5 year old thin ans light with limkted power draw

the 9500e is on the contrary a 6 core 65watt chip most likely used on high end consumer laptops

and the 1125g4 is again a low power entry level chip whick being newer than the 9th gen high end one might actually be more powerful (but i didn't do research on that so you should check it out).",please also keep in mind of the different integrated graphics in each of those processors if that is of significance to you.,but again as i said above...how does one shortlist such different type of processors?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9500e should use 60-70w in all core workloads.,you need something with the cooling ability similar to a gaming laptop to run all cores at their max.,"1125g4 should offer similar or even better performance while only using 40-50w at max load, which makes it run fairly close to it's peak even in something like a business laptop.",6660u has only 2 cores 4 threads which is about half that of a 9500e.,should also be the least efficient as the silicon has been refined a bit since then.,1125g4 should be the most powerful in terms of the cpu only.,i don't know what you are going to use it for though so make your own choice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i personally cannot believe this got upvoted.,terrible advice in my opinion.,negotiations should not hurt you at an organization that isnâ€™t toxic.,"iâ€™ve always negotiated, it has never resulted in a pulled offer and iâ€™ve always gotten more money.","sure, there are horror stories of rescinded offers, but that is uncommon and you probably wouldnâ€™t want to work for a company that gets offended at you advocating for yourself.","iâ€™m not saying youâ€™ll always get more money, but not negotiating would tend to leave money on the table and hurt you, while negotiation would generally at least leave you where you started.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ltd is the new name for ptd, it's the term for the manufacturing division in hillsboro.","it depends a lot on who your direct manager is and who your group leader (2nd or 3rd level manager) is, but it is a hostile, aggressive, fear-based work culture.",in my experience intel manufacturing managers tend to either be very hands-off or very hands-on.,"there are pros and cons to both, mostly cons.",people typically do not like to share knowledge.,it is a very large company and the bureaucracy is difficult to manage.,"again, this depends entirely on the specific area and there are good and bad managers and teams in every area.",i am not familiar with the politics or culture of tsv vs the rest of ltd as i was in a different area.,"maybe it's wonderful, maybe it's more like where i was placed.","the benefits are good, the perks are good, the work life balance can be good if your position is not on call.",the pay is mediocre for the industry but you will be making 1.5x the average household income (that means two working people usually) in the portland metro area when counting your bonuses and rsus so you will have no issues with affordability.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that is correct, i more meant skills growth and personal growth, not career growth.",at a smaller company you will have more opportunities to do work outside of your job description and feel more integrated with your coworkers and mission.,i believe that could be a valuable experience for someone early in their career and adult life.,"if you only want to have one employer for the rest of your life, intel is the perfect place to make that happen.","but it is a leviathan, and that stability comes with tradeoffs.","also, i would not have suggested they take an offer from a smaller company if i knew they needed a work visa.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

intel has the international hiring streamlined quite well.,"other than providing all the required documents and filling out some necessary info, theyll take care of all the immigration paperwork and filing for you.","and believe me, there's a lot of paperwork.",i went from opt/f1 to green card in about 2 years.,"ltd can be very hit or miss, but theyre working on it.",its generally better than it was 5 years ago.,my experience has been good so far.,"like many have said, it all depends on your manager.","the job titles are intentionally vague, so really you don't know much about what you'll be doing until about week 2. there is also opportunity to move within intel.",just pick whatever job your gut is telling you to.,"either ways, you'll probably be eating ""enough"" for the first year or two.",as long as you're happy with your choice your brain will rationalize it for you later :p .once you have your green card and you're no longer tethered to your school or employer you can always move.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

wow!,only 2 years?!,"so, you didnâ€™t go through the h1b process?","if you donâ€™t mind me asking, do you have a phd ?",because that might make it easier for you to get the green card,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

friend of mine ordered a pre-made and went with the 12700kf.,i asked why?,"he said well, â€œi have a 3080 why do i need an igpu?â€ i mentioned well itâ€™s nice to have an igpu if something goes wrong with the video card.","â€œnah!â€

kid you not, his pc arrived with a doa 3080. he waited 2 months to get the 3080 replaced.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the igpu is nice to have when there's issues with your dgpu, maybe it dies, it stops being detected, etc.",(definitely worth having if it's within $20 of the f).,"as others have already said, it automatically gets disabled when you install a dgpu, so there's absolutely no hard in having an igpu while you have a dgpu installed.","me being on ryzen, the thing i hate the most about it is the lack of an igpu, i accidentally killed my dgpu (little bit of water dripped onto my case, luckily the only thing that got damaged was the dgpu) a couple years ago, until i could get a replacement i had to switch over to my i5-6600.","it is 100% worth having an igpu as a ""just in case"" if you have the choice, saying you don't want one is like saying ""i don't want to use my pc if something happens to my dgpu"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so its not like a laptop that uses the intel for some things and the  other gpu for games?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i dont think i want the igpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, you can't swap between them as far as i know (although windows 10+ has a gpu selector built in but i don't think it lets you switch between the igpu and discrete gpu on a desktop).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"afaik (but i can be wrong here), you *can* use both, but youâ€™ll have to do some tweaking to enable the igpu.","by default, if you have a dgpu, the igpu is disabled like it wasnâ€™t there.","but this is just something i gathered by googling here and there once, never had a pc with both igpu and dgpu myself.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nope.,"and you can disable the igp easily within the bios, and even if you don't disable it yourself your pc will never use the igp unless you manually choose to (like for quicksync encoding).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, thereâ€™s no harm in having one as thereâ€™s no downsides to it, and the price doesnâ€™t differ much usually.","but itâ€™s totally fine to get an f chip if you get a good deal, for example.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you enable the right bios settings (and, frankly, your bios was designed to allow it), a desktop igpu can work exactly like a laptop, and you can choose what gpu will be used with each application (and the results are sent to the appropriate monitor output, wherever thatâ€™s hooked up).","like, i have a 6700 xt with triple monitor and a 12900k with the igpu enabled just for quicksync support, but i can also pick which gpu to use for every app.","so like game with the gpu, browse web pages or play movies with the igpu, etc.","have confirmed with monitoring apps that itâ€™s actually working, too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
im fine with that.,i dont want it active at all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i know you can ""enable"" it with the setting that allows output on the motherboard connectors but i have never tried to swap between the two because until windows 10, the only way to do that was via the gpu driver and the desktop nvidia drivers do not give you that option (and i've never owned an amd gpu).",now that windows 10 has a gpu selection menu i guess it would be possible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, iâ€™m using 11 and it works fine.","for general productivity apps you really canâ€™t tell which gpu is being used, unless you go and check the settings or watch resources like video decoding activity.","thereâ€™s no settings in the amd or intel drivers for this, itâ€™s all operating system based.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's worth coming back to the mainstream platform, unless you need the additional lanes and memory support.",the top end mainstream cpus have entered into hedt performance territory these days.,the adobe suite loves the st gains and ddr5 bandwidth that 13th gen offers.,"it's rumored that intel will launch a new hedt platform later this year based on sapphire rapids, but cost will likely be start at 2x that of a 12900k build, and with no eta or performance it's hard to recommend waiting on that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 as a photographer im about to jump to 12700k from 9900k.,"i would go for 12900k, but considering the temps i dont feel like the the difference will be too much to justify the cost, as in longer exports it may throttle.","my main problem right now is not the 1-2 hours it takes to export, but the overall snappiness while i apply sliders to 1000s of photos.","when i press export, i can go around doing some other jobs and then come back.","basically lightroom is so badly optimized, that i was thinking i need to find something else, but i admit i'm too tied to that app after so many years.","now i suppose you use x99 series for the option to have many hdds/ssds, etc.",?,hdds have grown way too big nowadays.,"even if you have hdds in your desktop tower, 2-3 of them (like 14gb hdd) can accomodate almost everything.","of course what i use and a better solution is a nas, as i have.","i work all active projects locally on nvmie-ssd, and after they are done they are archived in my nas.","i some times need to go back, and i can work them from my nas directly, with a small loss on speed, but its ok.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the only reason i would stick with x299 would be if you need more than 128 gigs of ram/quad channel ram or more pcie lanes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i switched from x99 / 5930k to a 12900k and i donâ€™t regret it.,"the platform definitely feels more â€œcrampedâ€ in terms of expansion options (on a good motherboard you get like one extra slot, period), so be sure you get the most lanes you can with z690.","thankfully pretty much everything you need is built-in, and if you get something like a z690 hero you get loads of gen 2 usb and even thunderbolt for external expansion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the linux kernel has been optimized to work with big.little cpu architectures for years so it makes sense that it's considerably better fine tuned than windows's scheduler.,same thing happened when 64 core epyc was released and you had severe bottlenecks under windows server while it scaled almost perfecrly linearly with minimal bottlenecks under linux.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"linux user here - iâ€™d recommend a more upstream or widely used os like fedora, debian, or ubuntu.","for certain things it will look good on paper, and certain benchmarks.","gaming is far off because directx is native to windows, and x11/wayland is still not that efficient.","maybe games with vulkan are okay, but i canâ€™t imagine gpu drivers are all that great for gaming.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=ubuntu-2204-alderlake&num=5

i hear pop\_os and proton working in steam valve have done a lot of work to making gaming a better experience on steam they've long seen microsoft store as a threat wall garden,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"proton is a compatibility layer for windows tech, including directx iirc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> i am saying, what is the reason for it being 100 c and not 200 c for instance?",is there a component in the cpu that has a lower melting point and as such the whole thing has been limited to prevent it from getting burnt?,"yes

thermals can have pretty extreme local maxima, so if you have a package temperature of 100c, you might have one spot on the die that's >>100c.","additionally they also can be super transitory, so while you might have an average package temperature of 100c over 1 second, you might have >>100c for 1 millisecond.",combine these and a 100c package limit actually results in some locations experiencing temperatures >>>100c for short periods of time.,"if you allow a higher limit, then you risk either melting stuff, or leading to longer term stress and failure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it has do mainly with tolerance of the transistors used on the chips.,for the field effect transistors (fet) used on these chips there's a very thin barrier between the gate of the fet and the channel it controls.,when temperatures exceed a certain level a junction can suffer a breakdown failure resulting in a runaway condition that cascades across the whole substrate.,it's possible to design more heat tolerant transistors with higher allowable substrate temperatures by using more robust gate junctions.,"the thinner the junction the better the efficiency, but it lowers tolerance.",100c is a reasonable compromise between efficiency and temperature tolerance.,there's a safety margin there so actual breakdown is an amount higher than the designed thermal limit.,intel has always been good about using healthy margins for reliability so actual breakdown is probably quite a bit higher.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
chemical reactions can cause fires at less than 200c (hell even less than 150c) a 200c cpu is almost 400 degrees f which is literal oven territory surrounded by components that would not react kindly to that kinda heat outputâ€¦plastics melt at much lower tempsâ€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as you heat up a semiconductor more and more charge carriers get thermally promoted to the conduction band.,"eventually enough are there that you go from semiconducting to conducting, which is very bad for the survival of a circuit.","how fast this happens depends largely on the bandgap of the semiconductor, and since cpus all use silicon, they have pretty similar temperature ranges.","other semiconductors have different temperature ranges, sic for example is often rated for 200c or more due in part to it's larger band gap.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"pvc melts at between 160 and 210 degrees celsius  
above 100c most metals and plastics begin to warp.",i think 90c should be the maximum.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all of the chips i have worked on the last 15 years are designed to work from -40c to +125c.,the transistors switch slower as the temperature increases.,the wire resistance increases as the temperature increases.,this is physics and you can't really change that.,at some point the temperature is going to physically damage the system but i'm not sure where that is exactly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there are ways to manufacture high temperature versions of chips for use in industrial environments, but fabricating them costs more money.",i do not think intel makes any of their chips that way.,"i do not think i have head of any exceeding a maximum operating temperature 160 degrees (maybe 180 degrees) celsius, but i am digging through a memory of something i read many years ago.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you've said nothing op hasn't already implied.,he's asking why 100â° and not 80â° since that's also really hot.,"it's quite clear that it's a safe measure, but why is that temperature where the safe measure sits on?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not sure what problem that person had with your comment.,it looks useful to me!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"actually, amd used to only be able to do around 65c back in the day with products like the phenom ii.","so, 100c wasnâ€™t always the case.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not exactly, but at least now it's not redundant.",thanks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am adding to what you said.,the fact that processors have higher operating temperatures is the reason that extreme overclocking uses liquid nitrogen cooling.,it is also why amd processors will vary their peak clock speeds as a function of temperature.,"off the top of my head, ryzen clock speeds will vary by around 100mhz to 200mhz as a function of temperature without any custom clock settings, provided thermal throttling does not happen.","they also vary based on how many core are in use, but one could theoretically do a test with the same number of cores used at different levels of cooling and see clock speeds vary.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and some intel chips were good up to 110-120c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not too familiar wit vmware, but kvm/qemu creates one process per guest cpu core on the host.",scheduling these processes is done by the host's scheduler.,"so, in that case, basically the answer will be that if you allocate >8 cores and load them all 100% on the guest, some of those will be scheduled to run on the e-cores by the host.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"even if you only got 8 cores, the 8 p cores on the 12900k perform better than the 10 on the 10900k",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well i understand, well i suppose that if it works like this, there is no problem if you assign loads to the e-cores, i suppose that there is no performance loss in the vm, thank you very much, it seems that the 12900k is a better option.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
even the e-cores are very strong.,it is not much slower than a full-speed 10900k core.,having 8 e-core is way better than 2 more full cores for this use.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm really underestimating the e-cores, but if what you say is true i'm going to do great with the 12900k.",thanks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
update: fixed it.,"if anyone else has this issue:

go to intel's website and download their updated storage drivers and have them on the same usb as you media creation for the os.","once you load those in, you should be able to read the device and reformat it in the os install options to use as the primary drive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, if youâ€™re using raid or optane (basically if your bios has intel raid / rst / vmd / vroc enabled), you need to download and copy the intel rapid storage technology drivers onto the windows installation usb, and then on the screen where your hard drive is not shown, click the â€œload driverâ€ button and find those drivers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

eh.,i think by the time it'll be matured there will be new cpu gens and as you're going with such a high budget you'll probably not mind selling what you have and replace it with new.,z690 are good but might be overkill for your needs tbh.,z690a pro msi is a solid all around which can handle 12700k with ease and its cost is fair too.,you mention not planning on overclocking cpu so is z mobo necessary?,is it anything else you need from the z.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i got the msi pro z690-a ddr4 and itâ€™s been a good experience.,it was the cheapest board i could find with everything i wanted including excellent vrms.,biggest downside is that the ethernet port requires drivers to use.,so you need to download ethernet drivers on another device onto a usb to get a new pc build online.,this causes issues with windows 11 which requires you to get online to install.,when my win11 install got to this step i just used ctrl+alt+del to end that .exe task and the win11 install moved forward with no issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

iâ€™m not 100% sure.,like i said i think it may have some better power delivery which could be beneficial down the road if ocing but iâ€™m not as well read into the fine details like others are.,iâ€™m sure the pro will fit 99% of your needs and i donâ€™t think you can go wrong with it.,"i could just have easily snagged the pro and a wifi 6 usb stick but meh, no need to waste a usb slot",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it'll be fine.,"h610 doesn't support pcie4 through the chipset, so stuff like m2 slots will be pcie3.","the gpu connected directly to the cpu would support pcie4 - i think technically 5 is possible, but manufacturers are avoiding that cost obviously.","vrms (power delivery to the cpu) will be as cheap as they make them, so you *may* have throttling if you run something extremely cpu heavy (not gaming, rendering or something) for hours on end and also have a cooler that can keep up with that.","for gaming, general use, etc it will never be an issue.","h610 definitely does have limitations though, you lose a lot of ports and ability to add stuff.","that gigabyte board only has 1 m.2 slot for an ssd for example, you only get 2 ram slots so it's tougher to upgrade that later, and you lose all the fastest usb slots.","it also looks like neither have wifi built in, so if you want that you would have to use the single extra pcie slot for it and probably spend an extra ~ $25.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hmm.,are you trying to mix the cpu and chipset m.2 ports?,i think raid can only be done on chipset ports.,"edit: okay, iâ€™m reading the manual, and itâ€™s giving me the impression that it does not support raid on the m.2 ports (only optane).",just raid on the sata ports.,i suspect it might be due to a lack of resources.,"thereâ€™s a note that m2_2 share bandwidth with both the pcie x1 and wifi pcie connector, and if either are used, will only offer 2 lanes on the m.2.",perhaps intel does not support raiding drives with dissimilar lane setups.,or asus just figured it wasnâ€™t worth it.,"also, the thing you read about having to use intel drivesâ€¦ iâ€™m just going from memory, but iâ€™m pretty sure that has to do with raiding a cpu attached ssd with a chipset attached ssd, which does not seem to be an option here.","put simply, it seems that this motherboard just doesnâ€™t do that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

itâ€™s in the specifications.,"your motherboard has a note that says:

* intelâ® rapid storage technology supports sata raid 0/1/5/10.","while other asus boards, like the z690 hero, says:

* intelâ® rapid storage technology supports nvme raid 0/1/5, sata raid 0/1/5/10.",note the lack of nvme mention for your board.,:(,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"both optane and raid are functions umbrellaed under the intel rapid storage technology brand, so support for optane does not necessarily imply raid.","itâ€™s surprising that the board doesnâ€™t support it, but iâ€™m sure thereâ€™s a reason why thatâ€™s not immediately apparentâ€¦",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
neat.,guess my decision has been made as the only place i can find an optane h20 for non-scalper prices has a 7 week lead time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
donâ€™t forget optane is not raid.,a h10/h20 drive can only use the optane memory cache with the onboard ssd.,"and note that the h20 is actually 2 drives in one, meaning optane gets 2 of 4 lanes (pcie 3.0, by the way) and the ssd another 2 lanes, meaning sequential reading/writing is basically half that of a pcie 3.0 ssd, never mind a pcie 4.0 drive.","so you get improvements in latency, but not throughput.",i note you were looking for raid 1 which just implies a mirror for redundancy.,have you considered other data backup options?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

most folks will tell you to never use raid as a backup - even mirroring.,"itâ€™s good for uptime/availability, but raid 1 volumes can fail as well.","a true backup is something in a completely different location, like the cloud, so if your computer gets destroyed your data is still intact.","granted thatâ€™s not easy to do with a huge amount of data to deal with, and subpar internet.",iâ€™ve personally experienced data corruption on raid 1â€¦ and â€œbare metalâ€ backups (meaning you can restore the complete functional computer) have saved my ass several times.,"along with versioning, which saves different historic versions of files.","there is software that can do what you want with your nas, or even just an external ssd or something.",which nas do you have?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

battery life and power efficiency is more about light cpu usage and idle states.,this running 1 core flat out is not realistic.,running all cores flat out is utterly niche.,"realistic usage is lightly loaded, lightly threaded and bursty.",most laptops when lightly loaded are going to be at lower frequencies as well.,thus 5~15w is the most interesting range to be testing single core perf / watt.,"hell, the m1 cores consume like 5-7w tops for single core.","if your processor is already consuming 15w+, your battery life is already hosed.","for web browsing and video playback, the entire chips power needs to be more like 1~2w on average.",you are measuring extreme active power use cases which is interesting in its own light.,but you are comparing a 28w chip design vs a 45w (the hs is just a 45w binned chip).,"the 6800hs competes with the 45w

yeah i was also curious about the battery life though....but that's something i cannot have a fair comparison though..... the battery on my stealth is 53.8wh and i got to say it's not that impressive - i do tried to drain it with netflix video playback to see its battery life and it lasts about 6 hours or so.,"the g14 got bigger battery, which is 76wh.",my friend also tried to drain the battery with netflix playback and it lasts around 8 and half hours.,i know it's a rough test but currently i don't have a tool that could measure the battery life of these two models precisely.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"some h models are also configured in an stupid way, the legion 5i pro for example, has a pl1 of 70w.",who knows how pcommon that is.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
unless intel can keep their p core clock speeds at bay battery life is going to stay awful on intel.,amd does it right by not trying to run at 5ghz and race to idle every time there's a minor load.,my 11th gen laptop goes from 2 hours of battery life to 5 by using throttlestop to tell the cpu to be less aggressive.,i'm sure 12th gen could see much bigger gains *if* intel handles clock speed responsibly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i don't think that the 6800hs is something born to compete with i9-12900h - it should be 6800h or 6900hx's mission to fight against the i9.,hs processor aims to be squeezed into thin-n-light performance model like g14 or g15 and that's right the idea of former tiger h35 - although it had been blamed so much for its embarrassing 4 cores.,"so i think adl-p is the new h35 with more cores, to be put into the model like my stealth or asus tuf dash.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

intel launched new 12th gen processors at ces 2022 and the main highlight this year for me was the p-series chips with 28w tdp.,these chips are based on the new hybrid architecture which means these cpus have both performance cores and efficiency cores at play.,"now its not just that these cpus also have improved evo standards implying support for an instant wake, fast charging, a healthy suite of connectivity options, compact form factor, fhd displays, and fhd at 30 fps webcams, besides high-end performance and battery life, thunderbolt port, wifi 6e,  
amazing right!!!",the high-end p series cpu i.e.,core i7-1280p incorporates a total of 14 cores (6 performance+ 8 efficiency).,there is 24mb of l3 cache and a max clock speed of 4.8ghz.,right now all my attention is on the msi summit and prestige series of laptops with these cpus as they come with great performance and also some fancy features like laptop tracking and tobiaware just to name a few from the long list.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

k/non-k is irrelevant for power limits.,all intel consumer processors support changing it.,only time you can't is if the motherboard disables it (usually only small form factor systems and laptops).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i agree.,the 12700f is arguably the best all around high-end cpu you can buy due to it's high performance but low price point at $310.,"the 12700k has however gone on sale for around $328 in the us, which would be a no brainer choice between the two, but sales come and go and that low price isn't always there.",it's unfortunate that the locked/f chips rarely go on sale in comparison.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

just go zen3 or 5800x3d.,its not worth buying a new platform when upgrading from am4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
unless you absolutely want to get away from amd a drop in ryzen 5xxx is probably the way to go.,5600(x)/5700x/5800x/5800x3d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if gaming, your best upgrade at present is the 5800x3d.","if you need productivity stuff as well, i'd look at a 5900x.",the outlay for a new mobo etc to go alder lake isn't worth the small gains (if any) you'll get.,"personally i'd wait and see what am5 and 13th gen brings, cause your current system isn't exactly that bad and unless you desperately need an upgrade i'd hold off.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's an upgrade.,but not huge.,like going from 90-100 in newer games to 120-130 (assuming you dont have another bottleneck in your sydtem).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"z690 will support 13th gen at a minimum, beyond that is pure speculation but probably not meteor lake/14th gen.

1. short answer : yes!,"2. depends, but mostly yes.","3. from unofficial sources, intel raptor lake (13th gen-lga1700) will also support z690 platform.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would say since you have x570 just to milk it out more get 5800x3d or r9 in 5000 series.,that would be more beneficial for you i guess.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the ryzen 5600 is going for $184 on newegg right now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks.,5800x3d is to expensive where i live (\~543 usd).,maybe i'll consider a 5700x or 5600x :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"where i live, 5800x3d is \~543 usd.",to be honest that's too much to pay (only) for a cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thanks for you input!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks!,should i go for 5600x or 5700x?,"i don't know how in reviews, 5700x has better fps than 5600x but has lower boost clocks...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm thinking of it yes.,maybe **5600x** or **5700x** :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why are you down-voted?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks, it seems that you have the most ""unpopular"" opinion here :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no problem.,"sorry for the late reply, but innocentiuslacrimosa is probably right, unless youâ€™re planning on going ultra high end in terms of gpu, the 5700x will also likely run all your games just fine, but honestly i would wait for the release of ryzen 7000 and intel 13th gen before upgrading to current gen stuff",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i echo what jack said there except, what you suggested as 5700x gets most of the benefits that 5800x 3d gives with a fraction of the cost.",anyhow 12600k is a great cpu and it is a lot better than what you have now.,you will notice gains in some work applications.,for gaming though you would only see gains in some cpu heavy games like strategy games with long turn changes etc.,for most other games your 3600x is enough to almost fully saturate what your 3060 ti can do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 12600k is a better cpu than a 5600 but the cheapest i can find it is about 270, plus a new motherboard.","it's better, but not 100 dollars+new motherboard better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the non-x cpus are the current value go-to lineup from amd side.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5600 > 5600x in terms of bang for your buck.,it's only like 1 or 2% worse in performance.,you won't notice it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all you need for gaming with your card is 5600 if you prefer single player games or maybe 5700 for multiplayer.,cpu's typically last longer than gpu's always build a gaming pc around your gpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're looking at that price range if you buy into z690/12600k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"then get a 5600x/5700x

if at some point 5800x3d goes on sale, get it and sell the other",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wise choice, this way you dont have to change the motherboard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
personally iâ€™d go for the 5700x but the 5600x is still a nice upgrade over ryzen 3xxx.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the cost of buying a new intel board and cou is 5800x3d money.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"lol...  


i haven't considered the price btw.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks.,at the moment i was thinking about 5700x.,"regarding the ryzen 7xxx, usually it is better to buy the second gen. like how it was with ryzen 1xxx.",also ddr5 prices are a joke.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for your answer.,"can i ask you, why does the 5700x has better fps in games compared to 5600x, but has lower boost clocks?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
z690 & b660 motherboards at least in the itx space are a massive disappointment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's correct but that also brings the new intel platform perks (pcie5, ddr5 etc.)",+ maybe support for the next intel gen. of cpu's.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for your opinion.,"i also think the same but i don't know how in tests, 5700x has better fps in games, with lower boost speeds vs 5600x...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's ok. it seems that indeed, the ""cheapest"" option is just to upgrade the cpu but the 5800x3d is \~ 543 usd, i can't spend that much on a cpu as i'm not that of an enthusiast.",maybe 5600x or 5700x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"more fps in some games, sometimes less on others.",the main difference though is that 5700x has 2 more cores (8 vs 6).,"if you release the power limits and turn on pbo, then the boost clocks are mostly limited by your cooling (what is set as default on cpu is pretty artificial).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wouldn't know i dont follow the itx market.,"i'm not sure what relevance that has here tho, i don't see op mentioned itx anywhere and those are niche builds.",z690 and b660 have plenty of atx and matx options.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i understand.,[i just switched from a 3800xt to a 12600k/ddr5.,"](https://valid.x86.fr/stwpfi)  

strongly considering delidding it as it runs quite hot.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"all the reviews iâ€™ve seen show he 5600x, 5700x and 5800x performing the same.",iâ€™m just of the mindset that 8 cores will age better than 6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how does it matter if you spend 550 for a new cpu or 550 for a new cpu + mobo if the outcome is very similar?,"you are upgrading the system for the same price and getting similar performance gain... don't think of it 550 for cpu ""only"".",my opinion is don't upgrade at all atm.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've read that even with power limits disabled it's still not a 5800x so the boost clocks are limited :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was just mentioning my disappointment at itx  support from motherboard manufactures rather than any info for the op,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that was the mindset on fx 8350 too :)

it didn't.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i guess it's a psychological thing.,"i mean spend 550 ""only"" for a cpu, or spend 550 for intel motherboard / cpu etc.",":)

also by doing this i would also get the perks of new platform (pcie5, ddr5 etc.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it is within 1%-2%

"i think itâ€™s a bit disingenuous to cite the bulldozer architecture due to its design but it doesnâ€™t matter to me, you do what you want.",either will be an upgrade and work well with your 3060 ti.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
none of those perks apply to you nor will they anytime in the future.,ddr5 is just another expense.,"you have a 3060ti, you will not see a significant difference even if you upgraded to a 12900ks.",save your money for a more meaningful upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""meaningful"" meaning a better gpu i suppose :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a better gpu, maybe a better cpu too.",we're talking a few years in the future at least though.,"you have a very good, well-balanced setup.",the longer you hold onto that tech the more cost effective your upgrade will be.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you use the same connector type to connect to your monitor like you were using with your old gpu?,old monitors might not support 1440p over hdmi (i have a 2012 dell that only supports it over dvi and dp but not hdmi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so it doesn't have the ecores but is still overclockeable?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"make sure you have the latest intel drive installed, and see if thereâ€™s a proper driver available for your monitor (vs using generic pnp).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, i am using the same hdmi cable just swapping it from the gfx card to the motherboard display out.",in fact i can even set the higher resolution as well.,though my display isn't that high resolution so it scales down and looks bad.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"obviously a typo, while a 12400k would be great, it definitely doesnt exist.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, i had tried all that unfortunately.",it seems to not recognize 2560x1440 as a valid resolution no matter what i do.,it however will go to 3840x2160 which my monitor *doesn't* support.,confusing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"u/natsu_happy_end02 yeah, sorry, typo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
kind of implies the monitor is not communicating its abilities correctly.,"however if your monitor accepts the 4k signal and down-resses it, then maybe itâ€™s working fine.","which leads me to wonder whether itâ€™s stating only 1440p @a high refresh rate, which i donâ€™t think intel supports over hdmi (only 1080p @144hz).",do you have displayport as an option?,even a dp to hdmi adapter might give you what you want.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not need to be, i was just joking.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it does.,what is strange is that it works fine with my graphics card.,so i am not sure why the igpu is not communicating correctly while the gpu is.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the thing is, the gpu likely doesnâ€™t have the same hdmi restrictions as the igpu.","the igpu should be able to do it, just not over hdmi.",i think it might be a licensing thing.,what actually is your monitor?,is it 60hz or higher?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's an lg 32qn600 its max is 75hz.,it does have a display port maybe getting a display port cable might change the possible resolutions?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
follow up on this.,i got a display port cable and confirmed that this is the reason.,hdmi can do 1920x1080 *or* 3840x2160 but not resolutions inbetween.,it can however do it with displayport.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"to be honest, even cheapest i3-12100f is on par with 7700k performance nowadays.",intel made quite a big leap forward in this area.,best bet would be selling 7700k with mobo and ram as a whole and getting anything you have money for from 12th gen intel.,"if you want to go cheap, go with 12100f, h610 board and ddr4 (fastest possible per your money).","if you want go middle go 12400f, b660 board and some faster ddr4 kit over 3600 mhz.",if you want spend more let us know your possibilities and people will gladly help you with choosing right components.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"first, why do you want to go to w11?","second, depends on your budget.",you'll need to upgrade your motherboard too so keep that in mind.,might be time to take full inventory and see where you plan on going with your build.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"with a little tinkering, you can just install win11 on your current system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

as far as im aware there is no reason to upgrade to windows 11 unless your on 12th gen due to the task scheduler only working properly with 12th gens e-cores.,i wouldnt even call windows 11 an upgrade its like a re-skin of windows 10 with stuff removed not added.,"i have yet to think of one thing i liked over other windows... it only got worse for me, even stuff like photo thumbnails are gone.",like why microsoft?,if you dont have a 12th gen with e-cores there is really no point.,its just a windows with more resources... also i think currently its rated worse for gaming performance from the benchmarks iv seen!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would not recommend using windows 11 because it sucks its still new and needs move development in the future its would be a good idea to install it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

tldr: the problem is not incompatibility; it is most likely because the vrm on your motherboard was not designed to be able to deliver so much power.,"i've done exactly the same thing, upgrading from 7700k to 9900k.",i was able to boot the 9900k on my z270 motherboard after modding the bios.,"the real problem is that the vrms on most z170, z270 and even z370 motherboards were not designed for 8-core cpus (a 9900k is essentially two 7700ks combined).","as a result, the vrms are very weak and will be unstable at high loads as they are unable to deliver the required power.",the 9900k @ 5ghz full load can draw as much as 300w with avx and 240w without.,"however, those motherboards can only deliver maximum 150-200w or so.",only the topmost tier of z170 and z270 motherboards can handle the 9900k.,"if your z170/z270 motherboard is not top-tier, modding the bios to run a 9900k is just a waste of time.",i ended up buying a new z390 aorus master for $80 and it worked perfectly.,"if you still want to use the bios modding method to run windows 11, a 9600k is a better choice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

exactly.,my motherboard can only handle up to 130a icc before vrm temps reach 93â°c  so i had to down clock to 4.2ghz 8 cores and limit pl1/pl2 to 95/130w.,lost about 10% cbr23 mt score and in prime95 it sttil throttles to base clock.,not so ideal condition but at least i don't get many bsod and crash like before.,"the funny thing is, it's still unreliable as a workstation to the point i rolled back to w10, left the system to my younger brother as a gaming only system and get a whole new 12th gen pc ðÿ¤£",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the easiest method by far is to change the the file in the installer that checks for supported hardware.,"to do that you'll need a win10, a win11 iso (both can be downloaded for free from microsoft), a pendrive.",you create a windows 11 installer on to the flash drive.,"(you can do it by clicking on the file you downloaded)

depends on what gpu you have but a 12400f would be a pretty good leap in performance at a budget cost.,12600k or 12700f if you have more money to spend or a good gpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

my gpu is nvidia geforce gtx 1060 6gb i think,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then the 6 core 12400f would be plenty for gaming unless you plan to upgrade your gpu in the near future.,cost would be around $180 for the cpu+100-$130 for the motherboard.,"if thats out of your price point even the i3-12100f, which is a quad core, still handily outperforms your 7700k, and could be had for as low as $100+$90, but i would still recommend the 12400f as it will perform better and last much longer without needing to be upgraded.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

plug all three monitors into the gpu.,you may need displayport to something adapters depending on what monitors you have.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"step 1: install gpu

step 2: plug in all three monitors to the gpu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok i'm going to describe the display port as best as possible but essentially what it looks like is a rectangle with one corner dogeared.,(folded over).,those are most likely what you're unable to identify.,"so, you will more than likely need to get a couple longer display port cables.",and would also recommend a 3 monitor stand is very beneficial as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is my pc tower.",i still haven't bought the screens yet?,are there someone that will help me?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wich one of them.,there are 2 hdmi 2.1 ports and the rest do i not know.,i told you a im a totally nerd in this matterðÿ¤•ðÿ¤¢ðÿ¤®ðÿ¥¸,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hello fellow human, how computer?",haha iâ€™m just playing around.,by default your computer should recognize them if they are plugged into the gpu.,donâ€™t forget to right click on the desktop then click display settings and adjust what you need from there.,one of the things that trips new people up the most is changing mirror this display.,to extend this display.,after that click identify and make your adjustments from there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"according to asus specs  
interface yes x 2 (native hdmi 2.1) yes x 3 (native displayport 1.4a) hdcp support yes (2.3)  
maximum display support  : 4  
make sure at least 1 monitor has display port or you will have to buy a display port to hdmi adapter  


it is rather simple   
1. install gpu on motherboard,   
2. connect gpu power connectors 2 x 8-pin  
3. connect 3 monitors to gpu  
4. once windows boots, download and install drivers or let windows 10/11 do its magic.","5. once drivers are installed , right click on the green nvidia icon on the taskbar and click on  nvidia control panel  
6. under display you will find setup multiple displays, here you as assign the primary monitor, move around the monitors in order etc ..  
7. congratulations",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thx for your help.,i'm really glad that someone strange gives away there time to help a totally newbie without no knowledge about simple things about computer.,for 30 years ago i was a pro user with my selfbuild pc tower.,and i was a nerd at that time.,but suddenly i pull it of and didn't work with it any longer.,i can really feel that things have change and the component and what's good and not good have change over the years.,i think i will get the rest of infomation at the hardware store when i shall buy the monitors.,they will probably guide me the rest of the way.,it sound pretty simple.,thanks a lot one more time and may luck and happiness be your fellow companion in the future!,ðÿ™‚,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thx a lot?,i'm a newbie so all help is warmly welcome!,ðÿ‘,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not a problem.,"youll find out most monitors these days will have both the hdmi and display port options as most gpu's will have 1 hdmi and the rest display ports, atleast the past couple ive gotten have been this way but itsnot the end of the world they have the conversion connectors you can purchase and such.",like you said go to your local electronics store and ask the questions and also asked to be shown what theyre talking about so you can visually see it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

h is laptop.,k is unlocked.,"if it has an f added, like kf is unlocked but without igpu.","f is only without igpu, locked overclocking.",hk is laptop unlocked.,"not very hard

but there are more suffixes.",there's p now which means laptop 28w.,"there's u, which means laptop 15w.","there hx, which means laptop extreme, 55w, unlocked, so a tier above hk.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">differences between intel i5 12400,12500,12600. i am confused here.",why would intel split the i5 into there different category.,market segmentation.,see also [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alder\_lake#desktop\_processors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alder_lake#desktop_processors),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i3/i5/i7/i9 are not vital descriptors.,they are simply a performance category.,everyone knows 12100 is an i3 and 12700 is an i7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so, for laptop i know there is u and h and y series.","but does laptop version also have like ""k"" and ""kf"" and ""f"" version ?","to my knowledge, from what i have seen is only ""h"" on gaming laptop, and if it's an ""h"" does it mean it's not unlocked ?","i don't understand unlocked and locked, does the unlocked version can overclock itself ?",how does overclocking work ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
basically no laptop cpus are unlocked because they have to work within the cooling design of the laptop.,"if youre going to buy a laptop, just forget about overclocking.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"only, there are unlocked laptop cpus.",those are hk suffix.,"for example, the 12900hk, or the 11980hk.",i assume only premium gaming laptops would get those.,however i donâ€™t get why the op is concerned with laptop cpus as heâ€™s stated heâ€™s getting a â€œcustom built pcâ€ which would imply non-laptop.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel can create cool and efficient cpus, as shown here.",that last 25% frequency comes at the cost of 2x the power draw.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why does a 12490 even exist?,"supposed to be a 12600 but had damaged, but fast clocking, cores, but they require incredibly low power to run???",how many chips could possibly fit this category?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i want to see intel i1-2345.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm guessing this is for web cafe use?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™d almost rather they unlock it.,a $200 5ghz modern 6c/12t chip sounds *epic*.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, this isnâ€™t the same chip design as a 12600. the 12400, 12500, and 12600(non k) all have 18mb of cache and are a single design that does not have the e cores at all.","the i5 12490 is the same chip design as the 12600k, 12700k, and 12900k.","basically, they cut out 2 p cores and all 8 of the e cores.","honestly, iâ€™m a bit surprised intel doesnâ€™t have more skus like this than they do.",it seems likely they would have chips that could be just 8 p cores with  all the e cores being failures or 6 p cores with 8e cores still working.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel is making money when they would otherwise scrap the chips.,"it makes sense, especially in the china market, where there are tons of cyber cafes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you can see why intel didn't unlock it from the benchmarks, similar gaming performance to a 12900ks for significantly lower price.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think the power numbers of cpus and gpus have been on the upward trend, and i think that's a bad thing.",i wish they'd come down more.,"electricity prices keep going up, and in some areas are incredibly high.",plus the power needed to cool the room the computer is in.,"this processor in some parts of the us would can potentially cost roughly almost $50+ a year to run 3 hours a day while gaming over a non-'unlocked' part, and that's being a bit on the safe side, in an all things considered situation.",the power a gaming computer can consume now-a-days if you're not keeping track is too darn high.,"it was going down for a few years, but it's starting to skyrocket in recent years.","i'd rather have a slightly slower processor that uses way less power, than one that uses a lot more and requires me to be miserable in the summer using it, unless i have an ac in just that room.",it's one of those things that keep you from even using the computer in the first place.,i've heard a lot of people not want to play some days just because their computer makes their room too hot in the summer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is a legit case where most of those chips will not clock that high.,"also, most people wont overclock or even slap a different cooler to the cpu(other than stock).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if that isnâ€™t the most intel thing ever, iâ€™m not sure what is.","all they had to do to compete with the 5800x3d was let people overclock the 12400, but they wouldnâ€™t do it, despite pushing all their previous chips to the limit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

my 12600kf + 3070ti combo uses about 400w when playing warzone.,i track it via a monitored outlet through my sense energy monitoring device.,"to compare, our xbox one series x uses at or just under 200w",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel's goal is to make as much money as possible.,"if you want competitive/better performance compared to a 5800x3d through overclocking, you must buy the 12600k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
funny you mention the 1060. i was just watching a benchmark comparison video with the 1060 and another card current.,"i was so surprised when i saw the 1060's power draw was relatively low, heck, the 3050 uses way more power lol.",it's disappointing nvidia moved the xx50 series outside the 75 watt no-6 pin category.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at that point it pushes people to use their current boards with 5800x3d or wait for next gen products.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't think anyone on am4 was going to pay extra to swap their mobo for adl based on the performance difference alone,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'd swap to a adl board if intel released the 12400f with overclocking and cheaper boards, if you could overclock 12400f on a $100 board it'd kill amd for gaming.","could've done bundles with the cpu, they'd sell more like than currently.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"meteor lake will have desktop and mobile versions, unless something extraordinary happens.","as for the release date, as it stands the first models should be out in q2 2023, but given the current situation in the industry anything can happen in a year's time so take that information with a grain of salt.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
meteor lake will be released for desktop.,"recent rumours have placed the meteor lake-s (desktop) launch date at q2 2023, although there's a chance it could be q3 2023.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel official slides confirmed a 5 to 125w tdp range for meteor lake.,**125w** means desktop.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as long as products are not announced intel can do whatever.,so nobody knows.,i think it's more likely that laptops are launched first.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and you think any answers you get will be accurate?,for a product that doesn't exist?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
meteor lake should launch in q1 2023 is everything goes well.,the laptop skus should come out first so the mtl s desktop version might come out in q2/q3 2023. there is arrow lake coming out around the same timeframe maybe q4 2023.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
laptop cpus are usually launched second,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i saw there is an official roadmap, and there are some speculations about that, anyway i think some rumors are quite accurate, i just want to figure it out these 2 aspects",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no way you are going to see mobile meteorlake on q1 2023, unless you are talking something like the -m, %w series.","raptorlake is coming q3 of this year, that leaves about 6 months for meteorlake.","desktop q2 is possible alongside -m 5w, even as late as q4 i expect for rest of mobile.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is more common that some laptop chips launch before desktop.,12th gen was special because intel desperately needed a desktop update while the laptops were fairly competitive still but both 10th and 11th gen had laptop chips launch first.,"which kinda leads to the point, intel launches whatever they need on the market.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10nm was on an official roadmap in 2016. does that mean it launched in 2016?,no.,why do you think the plans of a multi bilion $ company are common knowledge on reddit?,its rumors and make belief.,it will launch when its ready.,its intel so something will launch either way ( for desktop and laptop ) so manufacturers get to refresh their lines.,when you see the review you will know if its worth it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">no way you are going to see mobile meteorlake on q1 2023,

meteor lake is a mobile first product and it's scheduled for q1 2023. raptor lake s is going launch in couple of months although mobile may take another month or so to launch.",raptor lake is a desktop first product.,meteor lake s could be q3 2023 though i'm not quite sure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"other than broadwell (5th gen), ice/comet lake (10th gen) and tiger/rocket lake (11th gen), all desktop cpus have launched before their laptop counterparts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the product exists and is slated for 2023. chill.,https://www.anandtech.com/show/17366/intel-meteor-lake-client-soc-up-and-running,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're pretty aggressive over nothing.,intel's roadmaps are usually pretty good and they update if anything happens.,2h 23 is a pretty good bet.,maybe tone it down a bit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it doesn't matter.,if it comes that quick manufacturers will choose to use raptorlake mobile or meteorlake mobile.,then intel will be forced to do the same thing.,it's business common sense that you need a year to sell things and profit.,it takes couple of months just to ramp high volume!,you can believe what you want but you'll be disappointed if you are expecting meteorlake mobile to come 6 months after raptorlake.,yes no m chips exist so they can come q1 but u/p/h won't.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"quick look at ark shows that 4th and 6th gen laptops and desktops launched simultaneously, 7th and 8th gen had u series laptop chips first.","so we now have 9th and 12th gen where desktop actually launched first and 5th, 7th, 8th, 10th and 11th gen where laptop chips were first.",of course 6th to 10th gen the chips are largely the same so it's a bit of a moot point.,"many ""launches"" were more like renaming.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it would be easier to count the roadmapps executed without delay than to count delays.,pretty good?,"also, you are asking about idiotic rumors from mlid ( mobile only launch ) and expecting a factual answer.",who is going to know anything about an unreleased product ?,not 1 generation from now but 2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
raptor lake m/p is a minimal update on alder lake m/p with only power delivery and frequency updates.,so oems don't have to do a major update to the board or chasis.,but as you said there are concerns of a back to back upgrade from oems.,then the skus are also a bit skewed with launch spread out over 2 quarters for mtl.,alder lake desktop just launched in q4 21 and raptor lake s is already going for an launch by the end of q2 or early q3.,so the same issue is applicable here.,intel is planning to make significant improvement in performance and efficiency over the next 2 years and this needs executing faster than usual with more launches happening than what we will see from competition.,maybe they will provide the extra support required for oems to manage these upgrades.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're confusing me with the person who asked the question.,we are not the same.,"again, you're overly aggressive like you have something to prove.",intel's roadmaps are pretty good.,none of his questions were really unusual.,these products are in development multiple years ahead of time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there's a big difference between laptops and desktops.,"alderlake mobile didn't take 9 months to launch, it took little over a year.",same with tigerlake and icelake.,it was a different story in desktops.,with desktops and socketed designs you can build systems the day it's launched.,with mobile it takes them few months to put them in laptops because there are optimizations to be done and settings to be changed.,in desktops there will be relatively minor amoung changed.,"but even what seems like a ""minor"" update, in mobile it'll take lot longer.","remember, if you get one component misbehaving, or one drive misbehaving, that'll throw the entire power management algorithm astray.","also dlvr is pretty much a mobile thing, so that is a change.",so hastening launches have to be done with clever tactics.,like now in mobile the m skus don't exist.,"so that's a potential for raptorlake, or meteorlake m to be coming earlier since there's no -m for alderlake.","they keep claiming meteorlake starts at 5w, or that it's ""lower power"".","it makes sense to me because without the foveros approach that's coming in meteorlake where it essentially connects the pch in a on-die like manner, they'll continue to have worse battery life compared to the competition.","seems like a perfect launch to get a fanless, great battery life chip out.","\-server skips intel 4 because it's already much delayed without it, which also speeds up intel 3.",\-client skips intel 3 which gets intel 20a faster.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looks like the [answer](http://www.asrock.com/mb/intel/z490%20phantom%20gaming%204/index.asp#cpu) is no.,weird.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wow, that isâ€¦ surprising.",vast majority of their z490 boards donâ€™t actually support 11th gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ah damn that sucks, out all all the z490 chipsets available, i had to be the person with the unlucky one.",looks like a mobo upgrade is necessary in my case :(,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yea i think i'll upgrade to an msi board, they seem somewhat promising regarding these newer gen cpu's and other features like  pcie4 support etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if youâ€™re upgrading motherboard anyways, donâ€™t go to 11th gen. go to 12.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, perfect setup considering that card performs like a 2070 super and people back then were using i5 8th/9th gen cpus with it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, itâ€™s a good combination",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes but not enough to matter.,itâ€™s not worth upgrading yet.,"no idea why youâ€™d be buying a 6600xt though, get a rtx 3060.

i mean if you are gonna stream buy nvidia obviously.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on what the workload is like.,if the game or software is very compute i.e.,cpu intensive then it's possible.,that said i have a friend running a 9700k with an rtx 3070 and his rig is bottlenecked but not too bad for most games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i would hold off, until you see a bottleneck, intel and amd are having a cpu price battle at the moment just watch prices closely.",and jump on any good deals.,that being said you shouldn't have a problem until the previous gen consoles finally get dropped for games.,if it can run on those pos systems then your cpu is golden!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the degree of bottleneck depends on what you plan to do with it.,"you should generally be able to get fine performance out of that card with your cpu in most use cases, if that's what you're worried about.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at 1080p yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lower res yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you mentioned nothing else other than cpu+gpu so it is impossible to tell.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm using an rx 6600 xt @ 1080p with an i5-8400, which is fairly similar to what you have.","yes you will encounter bottlenecks in certain games that are known to be cpu hungry, like bf 2042 for example.","most games will run ""fine"", but at a lower fps than you'd get with a faster cpu.",it's a decent enough pairing until you can upgrade to a better platform.,"my 2cents, if you want to get the best of your gpu i'd upgrade to a pcie 4.0 system, for example an i5 11th/12th gen or ryzen 5600(x) with a pcie 4.0 motherboard, just so you avoid potential future bottlenecks from the x8 lanes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>will an rx 6600 xt be bottlenecked by an i5 9500?,"no according to steven walton's

radeon rx 6600 xt is about a radeon rx 5700 xt, and core i5 9500 is about a ryzen 3600x.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on the title and target resolution.,for most titles @ 1080p it's likely a good pairing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is the 6600xt really that powerful???,?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm planning to use it solely for gaming and streaming purposes only will it be okay or should i just upgrade my cpu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
will it be a problem?,i'm planning to use it on 1080p gaming and streaming.,should i upgrade my cpu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
like i said it depends on the games you play and whether they're more graphics intensive or compute intensive.,if they're not too compute intensive but the graphics are good then your setup would be perfectly fine.,"if they do require a lot of game calculations then that will tax your cpu, which is weak relative to the gpu, and thus cause a bottleneck.",so bottomline this isn't a yes or no question based solely on hardware.,the software side matters and the presence or lack of a bottleneck or limitation depends on how the code in your games makes use of the hardware.,in general though i would recommend upgrading the cpu because you're pairing it with a bleeding edge gpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh gaming + streaming i think you need to upgrade the cpu.,"i would look into a 12600k or 10700f, maybe even a 12700k but that would be a little much for a 6600 xt",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> streaming.,"watching videos, or are u a live streamer?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you'd want to do a new motherboard and processor and not just upgrade on intel 9th gen.  i don't stream but i was fairly sure nvidia's encoder was better for streaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"at 1080p, it depends on the game, and it also depends if you want very high quality or really high framerates.","i had an i5 8400 and i was very cpu limited in competitive games like apex, fortnite, cod, or even valorant.",frametimes were bad trying to run at 165+.,then i upgraded to 8700k and overclocked at 5.1ghz and that got a little better.,though iâ€™m still cpu limited in those games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
upgrade is not required now atleast this year....but in future if you are playing more cpu intensive games than u can think about it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so would you recommend it for 1440p ?,?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the majority of people misuse the word streaming.,good chance he is just talking about watching videos.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6000 series encoder is reasonably good enough.,though nvidias is still superior,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they market it as a 1080p card, but it gets pretty good 1440p performance.",even moreso now that rsr is available.,i'd recommend it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i use mine for 1440p60 but sometimes i do have to turn down settings a bit.,in normal times i would say get a 6700xt or better if you're doing 1440p but i paid $440 for my 6600xt when 6700xt was selling for $999... so it's good enough.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if that's the case i still think playing the latest games and have videos in the background is too much for 6 threads.,i mean he didn't say what he's playing but new titles will max the 9500 out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

can i check this with cpu-z?,will download now if so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i donâ€™t use cpu-z much, but i imagine that most sensor monitoring programs can.",i personally use hwinfo64.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the t400 is several times lower than the minimum gpu spec for that game, so you'll probably want to upgrade that too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"honestly i wouldn't, cyberpunk runs horribly on low end cpus.",if you have a system built around a g5400 then i also question the spec of the ram and which chipset the motherboard has.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what's your budget like for the cpu upgrade?,your best bet is to look for a secondhand cpu.,any of the 4 core 8 thread chips should do you fine for around 100 dollars.,i wouldn't stick a 8700 on a h310 board since it's still fairly expensive secondhand.,"also, your gpu is fairly low powered, but aggressive resolution scaling or fsr mega performance should get you 30 fps at 720p.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
first thing you need to upgrade the gpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i9 9th gen, if you have money for it.",but you may need a good motherboard for it with enough power to supply a cpu.,"if you have h310 motherboard, just check what the best cpu it supports, it may be i7 non k model.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
h310 chipset and dual 8gb ddr4 both running at 2133mhz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the best option would be an upgrade to a 12th gen i3 12100 or 12100f if he can afford to get a new motherboard since i think cyberpunk cares more about ipc than high core counts.,"though the cheapest, cash strapped option would be a second hand i5 8400 or 9400 since the h310's vrm should handle either of them without any problems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

wait for 13. if you play any cpu intensive games your 3000mhz ram is holding u back a lot.,but if you play at high res and don't really bottleneck ur gpu then u could maybe even get to 14th gen when ddr5 matures even more.,low latency ddr5 over 10000mhz is something to look out for.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

~~but otherwise i completely agree.~~ edit: unreliable source.",no concrete evidence for this rumor.,"raptor lake is rumored to bring double-digit ipc improvements over alder lake, but is compatible with the same motherboards, so getting the 13th gen for ddr4 is more worth the investment(not to mention raptor lake has higher core counts and more mature manufacturing node)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"first, make sure that you are opening the game with the correct gpu.",the 950m and not the integrated graphics.,"make sure to use it plugged in and max performance in energy options as some others say

if everything is correct, then:

close everything using cpu except the game and windows related things.","yes, close the antivirus.",bonus points if uninstalled and use windows defender instead.,upgrade ram to 16gb if possible (hopefully 2x 8gb ram 1600mhz).,"change thermal compound of the cpu and gpu (a good one, not a chinese one), clean the fans and radiator.",always use it with something elevating it so the pc has air down of it.,"after all this, check the temperature with hwinfo, if it's still too hot, maybe making some holes in the plastic is not a bad idea.","if still not satisfied, use a 'lite' version of windows.",there are some on internet and also you can make your own with some research.,that can free some ram and cpu usage.,"if nothing works, then the cpu is just not capable of 60fps on valorant",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, your cpu is quite old.",a 2. ore cpu isn't optimal for gaming.,in fact my 8th gen i5 is garbage so i can imagine that 5th gen is even worse,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i see the problem, the computer has a weak cpu, only 2 cores that are clocked at 2.3ghz or something around it is not really powerfull enough for a constant 60fps, but there are other possibilities as well, like cleaning the cooling system so the cpu wont throttle (meaning it will work better because of less heat).","i once played valorant on a core 2 duo which has 2 cores as well... but clocked at 3.1ghz which i got overclocked to 3.8ghz, what might help as well is undervolting your gpu, so thr cpu can have more, because there is something called power limit throttle as well, meaning that if the system reaches a specific amount of power, it will stop giving pore power to any component, and so you can have more for cpu and less for igpu...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"op, do you happen to have a dell laptop?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this is just kind of a shit cpu by modern standards, so i donâ€™t think thereâ€™s much you can do to improve the performance other than closing all background tasks and keeping the laptop plugged in",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with my i5 7200u and 940mx laptop barely get  80fps and drops to 20. so i doubt you will get above 60. valorant loves cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
easiest solution for you problem is upgrade.,"because you are 7 generations in the past, it is not good idea to play one of the newest games on that hardware.",12500kf will be perfect for you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, my tip is upgrading your hardware.",no wonder it doesn't run well with these specs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1: use it plugged in
2: use quick cpu to optimize the cpu 
3: valorant is very cpu intensive 
4: i often see more usage on my 10100f than my 280x",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
close background programs.,that's basically all you can do here.,your machine is simply not capable of gaming at 60fps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

damn...u lucky to open task manager with valorant running....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
poor little dual core lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1. when you put a constant load on a mobile/laptop processor it will not turbo as high; it will thermal throttle otherwise.,"you can try using a laptop **cooling pad**, and if you're willing try using **intel extreme tuning utility to under-volt** for lower temperatures (this might allow it to turbo higher), be carful with this though.","2. there is a setting in valorant called ""**multithreaded rendering**"", try turning that **off**.","this might help fps, as it will force valorant to use fewer cores, which could allow the fewer cores to turbo higher.","3. download a program called **process lasso**, think of it as a more advanced task manager.","you can use this program to auto-apply cpu core affinity, cpu priority and memory priority to programs.","search on youtube for this program, there are videos that explain more.","4. adding another 8gb of ram, could also help a bit.","a small upgrade, that is fairly easy to do and wont be that expensive.","while you have it open, clean out any dust and if its easily doable; redo the thermal paste on the cpu.","(5200u; so im guessing it could help)

you also want to download the latest drivers for you gtx 950m.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the cpu alone is a serious bottleneck even when paired with gtx950m (640 maxwell cores)

i have a haswell i7 4510u.",my cpu have extra 1mb l3 cache & turbo much higher then your i5 5200u.,"it is paired with gtx750m(384 kepler core gpu), it still barely able to keep up with the significantly smaller 750m gpu.","your laptop is already cpu bottleneck from day 1, it is going to be difficult to balance it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you laptop is at least 6-7 years old.,cpu is underpowered and the 950m gfx is also too slow for a game like valo.,upgrading the ram to 16gb and using a sata ssd with you existing hdd in a second hdd caddy.,will improve load times and speed up things.,but don't expect a fps boost.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i played at valorant with i5 5200u, 4 gb of ram and amd r5 m230 and i get a constant 70 fps",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thereâ€™s no thing such as a â€gaming cpuâ€.,"itâ€™s an older laptop processor with only two cores and hyperthreading, however as most games are single core they prefer processors with a higher instructions per clock rating (ipc).","furthermore games like plenty of cache memory, thatâ€™s why the r7 5800x3d getâ€™s better game performance than the r7 5800x",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i get 70-80 on a geforce 920mx,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're also running below your base clock speed.,"i'm no expert in this and someone will correct me hopefully if i'm wrong so i can learn too, but i think this is either going to be because of cpu usage being limited by your power plan, or it's thermal throttling (getting too hot so reducing its prrformance/clockspeed so it doesn't overheat and break).",something like hwinfo may help you figure this out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"oooh, thats a nice cpu also (even with all the bad rap the 11th gen got).",11900k has a nice single core and pretty good multicore.,it is rather rare that i get workloads where 5950x can use all cores in excel as many tasks have a main thread that determines the overall speed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, but only because of amount of cache and high ipc, itâ€™s a high performance cpu overall.",and games are high performance demanding aswell as low latency demanding (which the stacked 3dvcache is good at),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

link?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would be my first try,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that sounds like mine!,you're running at stock settings?,and 360mm cooler right?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the washer mod is like the #1 thing people like to worry about before building, or recommend to anyone with a troublesome cooling system, but it only does anything in a very specific set of circumstances.",just ask the guy who actually invented it.,it has the possibility of creating poor contact between the cpu and the socket.,"plus, the socket brand that asus is using is not one of the ones that seems to show a difference.","anyhow, your power draw seems about average, but i would expect better performance from a 360 aio.",once youâ€™ve sorted that out you can also look at doing a mild undervolt to tame temperatures further.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"pls try other tests, mine also showed temp jumped to 80 in several seconds.","maybe the reading is off :(

as long as it does bot throttle, i think you will be fine.",the normal workload may not come close to the cinebench test,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is enough.,you didn't happen to leave the plastic on it when you set it up?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
incorrect.,"both brands of ilm show the same over bending of the cpu ihs (as per intel spec) thus both benefit equally from the washer mod

the only circumstance where the washer mod makes less difference is with very heavy air coolers that have high mounting pressure",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's correct!,"my rendering through premiere and after effects   
maximum temps after 1 hour render = 84'c   
and max package power is 220w",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yea i removed it, the cooler was on my old processor 7700k working fine  
i bought the new lga 1700 bracket and installed on the new 12900k",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the asetek designed cold plates/pump head on the lian li and nzxt coolers do not play well with the alder lake ihs.,there is data behind this and the convexity causes contact problems once the cpu is tightened.,i used waterblocks with the same convexity and resulted the same as the lian li.,i used completely flat blocks and cold plates and found temps to be 5-10c lower on cpu package.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same.,i have a 360 cooler and i hit 98c all the time.,did you find a solution?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"in that case, pull the cooler and check the coverage of your thermal paste.","being a larger ihs, it can take more paste than some are accustomed to in order to get proper coverage.","will also tell you if you are getting even pressure/contact with the center of the ihs, which is the scenario where the washer mod may help.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 12400 won't slow you down for opening tabs and extra applications.,this is kind of a weird situation and my initial reaction was to just tell you to buy a new motherboard since the 10850k is fine.,and you end up trading multicore performance for single core/gaming.,"but you can sell the 10850k for $280 on ebay, -$180 for 12400f, -$130 for a quality b660 board.","so moving to a 12400f only costs $30, and gives you pcie 5.0, uses less power and an upgrade path if you decide you want more performance later on via raptor lake.",if gaming is your priority it's not a bad decision.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 12400f is a great chip, but itâ€™s around an i7-10700 in multicore.",your 10850k is superior overall.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"fyi related to opâ€™s issue: https://forum-en.msi.com/index.php?threads/warning-z490-boards-problem-with-recent-bios-updates.367575/

i stopped updating my z490m gaming edge due to that thread",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, the 12400 is definitely below the 10850k in multicore.",youâ€™d need at least a 12600k for that.,"also, watch b660 and pcie 5.0. it is not a requirement to be supported.",one of the top recommended msi b660 boards does not actually support pcie 5.0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

only gaming sell 10850k....go with 12400f and it is also good choice for smallformfactor pcs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my 2 centsâ€¦ i went from a 10850k to a 12900k and it is snappier and the fps is slightly higherâ€¦ but i wouldnâ€™t swap a 10850k for a 12400f.,i would just pick up a used z490 motherboard and wait for 13400 or 13600k if you donâ€™t want to spend on a 12900k rn.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>outside of this would i notice the difference in things like opening multiple browsers or say 1-2 game windows?,lol no.,you could grab an i3 and it'd be fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if it's getting too hot, you could adjust the all-core multiplier in the bios maybe.","i'm not sure if it's possible to reduce the voltage when all cores cores are in use, vs just 1 or 2 cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
failed update using their bios updater from within windows?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would not upgrade if i were you!,"always update when you are no longer satisfied with the performance you have, like if your 10850k is maxing out your monitor then you would not notice this much improvement, if you are gpu bound there will be no improvement, i donâ€™t think the i9 of 10th generation is obsolete yet, and in the future more features and probably faster cpus will be available â€¦it will be too much hassle now for little gain that you may or may not feel it depending on your current experience",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they will perform similarly in gaming but the 12400 will not run as hot and since you have a small case that might be worth it.,i bet if you play at 1440p on that 3080 you won't notice a difference between them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean a 12400f is a pretty massive downgrade overall and this would be the wrong move.,"even for gaming, games are slowly using more cores.","6 cores isnâ€™t gonna be enough forever, especially since you have background tasks and what not as well.","your average frame-rate might be higher with a 12400, but your 1% and .01% lows could be problematic when windows randomly decides to use two cores in the background lol.","iâ€™d say get a 12600k at minimum, thatâ€™s at least a slight upgrade.",you get the 6/12 p cores exclusively for gaming and 4 extra cores for windows and other garbage to use.,"plus, 10850k will hold its value a lot better when you sell it later on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"op said he only plays games, and the extra cores are being wasted.",the 12400 has better ipc and gaming performance.,but moving from the 10850k to 12400 is definitely trading multicore for single core/gaming performance.,it's not a straight upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wait, which board doesn't support pcie 5.0?",?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tangentially: der8auer's 12400 overclocking videos are proof that 12th gen would have mostly shut am4 out of the conversation and op missing out on multicore performance could be more of a discussion about overclocking.,"alas, intel just loves arbitrary product segmentation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no the 12400f does not have better gaming performance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tbh comet lake with good ram and good clocks (core+cache) is still very very capable at gaming.,"the 12400 is about equal to 5600x in gaming or maybe even a bit less, and the 5600x in turn didnâ€™t even beat the 10600k in all games.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i would bet this is because you used more paste with the new method (or better torque).,because there have been countless tests of thermal paste methods (with other cpus) and they all end up being within 1c of each other.,typically the pea method is whats recommended.,"however as the ihs got bigger with 12th gen (and also hedt like threadripper), pea size doesnt make sense, as you need more thermal paste to cover the ihs, so you need a bigger pea.","having too much paste is never an issue with proper mounting torque, as it gets pushed out, but having too little paste is definitely an issue.","you probably wont try this, but you should try using the pea method again, but with more paste than the first time, like marble size.",it should net you the same temperature as this new method.,"still this is a helpful post, as many people might end up using a small pea size, and creating issues.","noctua's method, or smearing is safer in terms of ensuring you have enough thermal paste.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the best method is no thermal paste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've used a bead of paste in the middle of the ihs for every cpu i've ever owned and never had a problem with temps.,people who test out all these varied methods of application are really overestimating the effect most of the time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i did something similar to this if i recall.,small blobs alternating with larger blobs.,at the time it seemed like it could be too much thermal paste; used the arctic silver 5 that i had laying around for a few years.let it cure for a week; cycling pc on and off normally; i have identical package temp to the new noctua method (29c).,this is with the noctua dh-15 chromax.,cpu heatsink fans running at \~700 rpm atm on idle.,up to 1300 rpm on load with 4+ case fans on intake and a rear exhaust at \~700 rpm.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you do not need to cover whole ihs.,the hot spot is above the die and thermal conductivity of copper means that the corners of ihs are far less important.,"neither method from two pictures takes the shape of the die into account - the first one is obviously bad because the die is a big bar, and second one is needlessly complex (even though it is obvously better than first one).",if you want universal method - covering whole ihs is good.,"if you want spot application method specific for your cpu, your paste should match the die.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

at this point in time i recommend people to wait for the 13th gen and z790/b760 motherboards.,raptor lake cpus will support existing 600 series motherboards but their full potential will only be unlocked on 700 series motherboards as the 13th gen comes with a new voltage regulator (dlvr) allowing a decrease in power draw by 20-25% for a 7% clock speed uplift.,this is how rpl cpus will achieve the rumored 5.6-5.7ghz clock speed.,the new voltage regulator is an intel patent and will be implemented on motherboards by oem partners.,"rpl cpus should be more power efficient than their adl predecessors at the same clock speed with that dlvr feature (on z790 motherboards), while zen 4 cpus on am5 will be more power hungry than their zen 3/am4 predecessors (170w vs 105w) in an effort to match intel clock speeds.",if gaming is your main focus the improved cache in rpl chips can also make you save a few bucks on ddr5 ram as you will be less reliant on speedy ddr5 kits.,this will be the trend going forward as each new cpu generation will get significant cache improvements.,ram speed will remain relevant mainly for productivity tasks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ok, since you're hitting a power limit throttle, have you checked the pl1 and pl2 limits in the bios?","it sounds obvious, but if they're not set to anything in particular then set them both to 350 watts or something like that.","even on the 12900ks the max stock tdp is still supposed to be 241 watts, and you're coming pretty close to that at 229 watts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
could be your cpu lid is bowed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's really blurry.,hard to see what im supposed to look at.,obviously if you disable the power limits your cpu is going to run hotter.,you've got to have great cooling to keep these things cool.,most ks chips will use 1.35v+ out of the box.,which is gonna pull well over 300w.,you can try undervolting.,start maybe a -50 mv offset and work your way up from there.,feel free to pm me if you need additional assistance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am just using the default settings on the asus motherboard with multicore enhancement disabled so that it uses the intel recommended settings.,however i did increase the power limit but it just informs me the the cpu current is throttled but it was showing 5.17 using 257w at 87c.,https://imgur.com/a/g4erjem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"stock will work, but it will run hot and be noisy.","if that doesn't bother you, then you don't need to upgrade it.","however if you want your cpu to run cool and quiet, i'd suggest a low to mid-range tower cpu cooler.","the cooler master hyper 212 series would be a good option, especially since you're not overclocking.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes and yes, more colling less noise win-win",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""need?""",no.,"""want?""","probably, yeah.",you can get something better than a stock cooler for not a whole lot of money.,there are plenty of inexpensive tower coolers out there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you could run into heat issues depending on the case, which could cause blue screens.","i would recommend getting an aftermarket, even if itâ€™s a cheap $30-$40 cooler master.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i was using 12700 with stock cooler while waiting my noctua bracket arrives, the temperature just went crazy and i cant play any game at all (90 degree) even i limit pl1 and pl2 to 65w, i re-paste with mx-4 still same result.","&#x200b;

my nh-d15 now gimme max around 70 degree running r23 or handbrake.","&#x200b;

since you already have the stock cooler, you can try out with stock cooler 1s, if you can run with stocker cooler then no need to get after market cooler, or else get a new cooler.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
youâ€™ll want something on the level of an nh-u12s for that thing: the i7-12700 can draw up to 180w in all-core workloads.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"okay cool thanks for the info  yeah thats what i was looking at actually, it seems to be solid for years now",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
big difference in cooling?,"i know i have a 6600 right now, mind u it's old and didn't really get cleaned all to often, but while gaming runs at about 90-93c",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how often so you think all ciresnwould be used?,is that possible in higher end gaming at 1080p?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea you kinda do.,itâ€™s like trying to cool off roughly 1/3 of the heat energy from your 2-slice toaster my dude.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a 6600?,"like, an i5 6600?","if so, that's pretty hot for that processor.",clean your cooler and give it some new thermal paste if you haven't in a while.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in almost every game, no.","i would recommend a $30 aftermarket cooler for the 12700, since it is a high end cpu, but in games you can get away with stock.","worst case scenario if you're not happy with the fan noise, you can get a new cooler later on, you dont have to commit to using stock forever.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i haven't done anything except air spray it out a few times.,i have a new 12th gen now so i am good!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"3070ti is a 1440p+ card, no wonder it's bored with an older cpu @ 1080p

my friend just went through this.,"he had a 8600k and asus z-370p bottlenecking his 3080.  he tried a 9900 and although he said it was better, he said it still wasn't getting the full performance and overclocking on that mobo was a pain in the ass.",i should mention at 1440p.,he ended up changing his mobo cpu to 12th gen and said it was a giant leap for the 30 series cards.,"so i would say if you had to pick one, a 9700 would be it.",hope this helps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

quite.,"*this keeps the price of the motherboards reasonable, and allows for the power of two cpus (also known as cores) with a cost that is less than two separate chips.","this, in a nut shell, is what the term ""dual core"" refers to - two cpus put together on one chip.","*

and yes.","of course there are architectural differences, mainly in that things *designed* to be multi-core are designed better for that use case.",that doesnâ€™t change that the concept is very much the same.,"if you look at the apple m1 series, itâ€™s even clearer.","the m1 ultra happens to be two dies, but that doesnâ€™t make it fundamentally different from the max or the pro, even though the difference between those two is just amount of cores on one die.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"don't use asus mce, it really like to run way too much vcore.",this has been true for every single generation of asus boards.,"sync all cores to your desired speed and tune your vcore manually you'll get much better temps for the same level of performance, just like you found out.","auto overclocks are good for manufacturers and their advertising, but enthusiasts can do much better in finding the sweet spot between performance and thermals.","edit: am wrong, see comment below.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no its not higher sp the lower vcore u need and lower vcore = lower temps and higher oc its important,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, that is what confuses me, because i read somewhere that even if the sp score is higher, that doesn't mean that the cpu will actually run cooler... what does leakage mean here?","sorry for asking dumb questions, but i am kind of new to the whole oc world...

i guess i should test what is my lowest stable voltage when trying to run all p-cores at 50.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

have you tried 5.5 with e cores on?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
asus mce on alder lake doesnâ€™t seem to do anything except remove power limits.,it doesnâ€™t seem to mess around with voltages at all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"eh, this is one area i wish i could find a good article about.","so, my best guess from what iâ€™ve foundâ€¦ cpus that have â€œhigher current leakageâ€ tend to run hotter, but can often take more voltage while remaining stable and overclock higher - provided you can cool them (like with liquid nitrogen :).","while cpus with lower current leakage run cooler and are ideal for air coolers, but canâ€™t handle the same types of voltages and typically canâ€™t reach as high of frequencies.",are you running the latest bios for your board?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i dont know all of your needs but a 10400f which is non overclockable i wouldnt put on a z490 board, unless you really need the extra features of the board.",i would go with b460 or even b560 so that you can upgrade to 11th gen in the future,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"might be better to save up for the i5 12400f cuz it costs around 30$ more than the i5 10400f and it give like 11% more performance :)

depends on where you live.,the idea of b660+12400 is that it's competitive on performance and on price agaisn the r5 5600x.,in my country a h610+12400/b660+12100 is more expensive than b450+5600x.,that 15-20 bucks more does not hold itself if there's a better option elsewhere (amd in this case).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i respect that.,leaves a pretty good upgrade path and ability to oc future cpus.,something like the asus prime boards and the b660 pro msi boards are fine honestly.,aurous boards are good as well.,but again the asus prime b660 for around 160 cad is pretty alright tbh.,cad is pretty similar to aud btw.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the hybrid design doesn't matter for battery life.,it's all sleeping at 1w or less anyway.,you can specifically set some programs to run on the e cores but that only helps corner case scenarios and is much more applicable to android where everything is locked and goes through the app store.,on windows you have 99% of applications that can't do that so the cpus are designed to take that into account.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah does seem something is wrong.,their battery test was chrome.,it's possible the p cores were engaged even with light load.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"while i also believe alderlake won't result in better battery life, it's not conclusive if it'll be much worse.","the yoga 9i uses an oled display, which is bad for battery life.","plus, it's also qhd and 90hz.","if you want a laptop with good battery life, you avoid oled and above full hd.",we also seem to believe in the mistaken knowledge that tdp is a big contributor to light workload battery life.,"it does play a role, but in bursty workloads where it's under max load for perhaps 5% of the time, idle and screen power usage dominates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"at the end it says the cpu averages 23w in their tests, vs the zenbook 13 averaging 25w, yet the zenbook 13 has longer battery life with a smaller battery.",they point to the cpu as the problem but that math doesn't really work out.,either their average is wrong or other components are drawing more power.,"i thought maybe intel's power profile was worse since they're refreshing chrome and maybe refreshing pl2, but they run another full load bench and the zenbook 13 is still much better battery life at 2w more power draw.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"meh, i find all these battery issues to be made up by people at most.",what intel did with alder lake is push the boundry in raw performance.,i don't think ever promised miracoulous battery life as so many people have claimed.,i gota 6-8 hours with my base model 1080p ips 60hz yoga 9i 14 gen 7 whereas this guy was using the 2.8k 90hz oled model.,oled will always always always suck out battery life no matter where you put it.,and the previous gen 9i with 1080p and 11th gen intel performed around the same in real world use.,"so really, there is no real ""alder lake problem"", it's all hyped up expectations that really didn't have much merit to begin with.",better battery life when you add a shit ton of cores with a compnay that was already lacking in the performance department?,this is a result that was easily expected...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
battery life was fine.,he was complaining that it had a bigger battery but didn't have battery life that reflected it.,comparatively the battery life was fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
actually you stick with cometlake or whiskeylake if you want better battery life.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it does seem like there are issues keeping power down at idle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's what your marketing spin is when you know battery is disappointing ""let's just tell people its not about the battery performance""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the zenbook13 also has an oled display.,"yet, with a smaller battery (67whr vs 75 whr) it managed much longer battery life : 17h vs 13h .","if you want good battery life, the answer is not as you say avoid oled, but shop for a cpu that has better battery performance.","all things being equal (display, ram etc) and only difference being cpu, if one of the two cpu has much better battery life, the answer obviously is go for the cpu with the better battery life, not go with the cpu with the worse battery life but change the h/w specs (change monitor to non-oled etc) .","also, the blender tests are just crushing.","even the 15w 5800u  crushed the i9, let alone the 25w.",this speaks volumes to low power efficiency of alder lake.,i have yet to find a review that shows good low power efficiency in alder lake.,this is not by chance.,nobody said alder lake is not good.,just not as good for thin& lights and ultra portables.,"for gaming laptops and dtrs, they are awesome, as they are thicker laptops, with robust cooling and battery power not an issue, as nobody games on battery.","people trying to force me to accept it is good for low power stuff though, no, just no.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"keep in mind this isn't the first laptop with alder lake that's shown to have disappointing battery life: the x1 carbon gen 10 has also been shown to have pretty abysmal battery life, too.","i can't recall if that model was using a qhd screen as well, but the battery life saw a regression from last year's model using the otherwise same hardware, so it's definitely the architecture to blame and not the other components.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah that does seem strange.,"can't tell you what's going on there, but it does point to something else.","the x1 carbon gen 10 is shown to have pretty awful battery life, too, so we do know alder lake isn't ideal.","the x1 carbon was using similar specs across generations, including panel and battery size, so it's definitely the architecture.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"tdp doesn't matter here, what matters is power consumption under light or idle loads, which is what laptops spend most of their time doing when handling basic tasks like web browsing etc.","they very rarely hit even pl1 in these cases, and they certainly don't hold that power consumption for any lengthened period of time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm actually interested in the reasons why this is wrong, can you elaborate?",i prefer to judge claims on content and not because of a user's post history.,"for example, i own both intel and amd stock, and i own an intel desktop and an amd laptop.",there are people here in this sub that acknowledge the strengths of each company.,"so, what exactly was he saying that's wrong?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

just lol at the downvotes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they have the 9i reviewed on ultrabookreview.,it's showing 7w usage with 0 brightness and idle.,it might also be terrible hardware/software quality control as 7w indicates that the cpu isn't entering the deep sleep states and other reviews like the one from pcworld shows getting 12 hour battery life(that's less than 6.5w) while playing back video.,"while it's a regression, but it's not as extreme as 7w with 0% brightness on idle.",that kind of a difference shouldn't exist.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's pretty much confirmed that alderlake is worse in perf/watt at 1~20w compared to zen3.,"problem here is both systems are set to power limited profiles and pulling around the same power according to their review, so even if performance is worse at this power level it doesn't make sense for battery life to be so much worse if the only problem is the cpu.",even if the cpu was eating the full 28w it still doesn't account for the huge difference in battery life considering the battery is so much bigger.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they're not measuring tdp, they're measuring average power, which was 23w with the weird intelligent profile on the 1260p system.","the system tdp is 28w, which is the ""extreme"" profile, but they tested with balanced and intelligent on all systems.","https://i.imgur.com/68napul.png

their second test was a stress test loop that just ran until the system died, which would remove the issue of bursty pl.",the zenbook still had longer battery life while the cpu pulled more power.,man it's wild that nobody in this thread even watched the video.,it gets worse battery life at the same power draw with a larger battery even in the full load test.,"that's an indicator that something else is a huge battery drain:

"well, the point of calling the e cores an asic for one, or that they ""don't have a full instruction set"" when you can boot and run all windows applications on previous generations(going far back as 2009 with first atom) perfectly fine.","the only missing instruction is avx512, so he's basically calling pre-icelake chips as being a ""half core asic"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"exactly, itâ€™s not a 1:1 comparison there, the amd oled version is a much lower resolution panel.","and contrary to popular belief most oledâ€™s still arenâ€™t as power efficient as higher end lcd panels, youâ€™re right there in that the oled display is hemorrhaging more power.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you have a point, platforms are different.","yet, one has to take into account all the converging data points.",i look at the blender data.,"comparing the 23w lenovo ( 6 minutes 31) to the 15w zenbook (5 minutes 13 sec) , or in its 25w configuration of 4 min 35 sec, the screen plays no role in rendering a scene.",this is 100% a cpu workload.,"like iber said in the video, for short bursty workloads sure, the intel is faster, but anything even remotely prolonged , the amd wins out handily due to better power efficiency.",it is just physics.,"to perform the same exact workload, the amd used less energy.",this is the definition of power efficiency .,this blender test allows us to move past the battery endurance tests which are affected as you say by many variables and focus on a specific & repeatable workload --> blender scene rendering.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the video i linked in this post speculates precisely that: it could be that the scheduler/firmware just isn't up to snuff.,that could definitely be part of the issue.,"the x1 carbon saw a pretty severe regression in battery life, you can hunt down that review if you're interested, there's a few out there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"unless c states aren't working correctly, which would cause a much higher idle usage.","in fact, a few comments up in this thread, one user noted a separate review of this device saw a 7w idle usage, which would technically be a problem with the cpu (not idling properly).",this should be able to be remedied in firmware.,also you have to take into account the scheduling between the cores.,i have personally experienced issues where e-cores aren't properly utilized on desktop due to the scheduler obeying the priority set by the application (which is flawed at the application level).,"if this occurs with the mobile arch, the p-cores are going to be over utilized when they shouldn't be.",this also drains battery.,"so, it does appear the battery issues are a smattering of different causes, all contributing, including the inefficiency of the arch itself",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's the average power under an all core workload and is not indicative of idle power consumption.,that is not average power consumption at idle.,"if it was, all of these laptops would have 2-4 hour battery lives.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"he characterized them also as a ""half-core,"" which i take to be a cut down core, which i think is accurate in this case.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think i found the video of the carbon you are talking about.,he was saying 4-5 hours when he was expecting 8?,i'm pretty sure anyone knowledgeable enough can go in there and get the power usage down.,i bet you the 9i in the ultrabookreview is stuck on c1 most of the time rather than c7 or lower.,"that alone will cut the power across all usage scenarios by 3w, which is substantial at light load.",i also noticed inconsistent performance/watt numbers for the larger alderlake-h. one review showing greater than 20% difference from another.,"intel has actually been regressing on battery since icelake, then further with tigerlake, and i am talking at a fundamental level comparing equal c states.",they are not going to reverse this trend until meteorlake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no... because they ran a bench loop that gets rid of that problem.,"the second test is just pure bench, which is why it's only a few hours of battery life even on the best system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
never said it was at idle... the second test loop is literally not idle load and it's getting more battery life on a smaller battery.,https://i.imgur.com/okjvjtu.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,"he is saying that the e-cores don't have the same instruction sets as the p-cores, and that causes issues in windows.",this is catagorically wrong.,both the p-cores and e-cores in adl support the *exact* same instruction sets.,"the golden cove cores have the hardware for avx512 while the gracemont cores do not, but not only is avx512 a very niche instruction set, the p-cores in alder lake have them disabled anyways.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, 4-5 hours is abysmal for the carbon.","the guy reviewing it is very knowledgeable, not sure if you're trying to insinuate he's not.","there's plenty of threads over at /r/thinkpad acknowledging the regression, too, and many of those are power users, all knowledgeable.","you can't just get more battery if firmware is involved, it would require bios updates and windows updates.","if it's an architectural issue, which you do acknowledge some extent in your last paragraph, there's nothing you can do, at all.",it's important to call these issues out.,you can't just stuff larger and larger batteries in notebooks attempting to remedy the issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes there is a limit but yes you can go lower the power by quite a bit.,there was a whole thread on notebookreview(before the whole site went down) about optimizing battery life.,this applies to brand new laptops.,i know i can do this.,i dropped a base 4th gen core laptop power by 1.5w in all scenarios by doing this.,before it was staying on c3 most of the time and 3w cpu idle.,after it got down to c6 and 1.2w cpu idle.,"i doubt the reviewers can do this and neither those power users because it takes something beyond a normal ""power user"".",the op of the thread took it so low that during video playback his 6th gen y cpu used under 1w!,there is a limit you can drop and that's the firmware limitation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have a noctua fan with similar clips and i always use a flathead screwdriver.,put the end in the part in the middle that is sticking out a bit and you can pop it right off.,you can put it through or behind it.,saves your fingers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
part that looks like a tab can go up a mm or 2 then out\\off.,"i was able  to do i side at a time, not sure about that brand but the fan should have rubber about where that cut out circle is opposite the camera.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the clip is somewhat flexible.,the radiator has a lip that its hooked onto.,"you can just pull the clip down to ""unhook"" it from the radiator.",it does not really take all that much force.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you.. pull it off..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if you look closer those hooked go through the inside so that's not an option i don't think.,those do look flexible i think op just never done it before.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you have mini hook tools it's even easier.,"i have the cheap $5 walmart set , i can use the 90 hook or the curve hook to act as leverage and lift it off that way.",also really handy to have for locking connector tab releases.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i saw this.,this is why i wrote if possible.,it depends on hook length.,and maybe fan can be attached without passing hook through hole.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you might be trying to bend it the wrong direction.,"like others said it's similar to a paper clip, so you should be using similar force as you would a paperclip.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

:(,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it will be an ugly four years for them and maybe even far worse if economy and silicon demand drops.,every semiconductors manufacturing and fabless has had double digit revenue growth and margin expansion.,even the memory companies are doing well.,for intel the largest boat in the ocean to be flat to down while the sea is rising points at deep structural problems hidden.,it is actually far worse and only looks good on the balance sheet due to the lack of capacity from alternative amd in client and server.,thank god  for their scale and x86 captive pricing and the fact amd is capacity constrained or it would be a bold bath.,"next couple years as tsmc expands capacity intel is in even bigger trouble and if the market softens they canâ€™t hope to compete on product line up, price nor scale efficiency  that amd has.",look at the pricing of amd and nvidia have in combination with tsmc and samsung to understand how bad it is at intel.,10nm will be painful for two years and when they migrate 4nm they will be competing against the huge scale and learning that tsmc has accumulated manufacturing more than a few million wafers and billions of chips.,there simply is no shortcut to manufacturing learning than volume.,they face that same problem at 3nm and 2nm mode as well.,no amount of government subsidies nor on-shoring address that simple economics!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
q2 is also going to be impacted by sapphire rapids launch.,the launch quarters usually result in a slump of demand as that's a transition period.,"you can see that impact most readily in apple earnings, where the release quarter goes down noticeably, but the quarter after that more than recovers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

huh?",you can go back all the way to q2 2017 and look at intel's own presentation.,dcg has always been higher margin than ccg.,"there are few quarters where ccg has better margins than dcg, but overall picture is pretty clear.",it's only recently intel's dcg margin complete collapsed and rely on its ccg to hold up its gross margin number.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as for your first comment.,if you are the only supplier in town and the demand for server chips is high.,who has the pricing power?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is straight up lying.,"datacenter margins have been ~50% for a long time until... well, epyc arrived.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah and these earnings are in limbo anyways, you invest here if you believe they can execute in 2024 and outwards, not one quarter",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so i went all the way back to q2 2017 and checked the presentation and it seems intel's revenue from client computing group was around twice as big as from data center group.,"data center had slightly higher margins (38% vs 37%) than client computing but overall saying that data center was the ""lucrative portion"" is at least widely misleading.",most of the money came from client computing.,edit: also the comment doesn't seem to be deleted.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
still can't recommend investing yet.,intel still has several bad quarters that can dip the price before it gets better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
q2 2017 had higher operating costs due to significant 14nm ramp.,calculate the fy results.,this is a very weird thing to argue about.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
meh i'm just going to keep investing gradually a bit from every paycheck for the next couple of years.,you never know what crazy things the market will do (but i wouldn't be surprised to see the price fall farther before things start improving as you said),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i went to where you asked to look.,now you asked me to look something different.,full year operating margin was 43% for dcg so it was a bit higher but nothing major.,client business still produced significantly more profit.,"14nm ramp happened a lot earlier, server products in 2015-16 were already 14nm.",in fact they list lower cost of 14nm as one reason for improved margins in 2017. this is indeed a weird argument.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wasn't the same person who asked you to go back and look.,a 6ppt difference is still significant and still means that dcg is more lucrative than ccg.,higher margins = more lucrative.,not revenue.,taking home more cents on the dollar is what is important.,"14nm product ramp, not initial ramp, sorry.","[operating margin lower on higher unit costs](https://i.imgur.com/dt8ufnr.png)

this has been intel's legacy for the past 5 years.",as 10nm failed to mature and competition emerged.,intel has had to incur higher costs keeping up with the demands of the industry.,"dcg, historically, has been intel's most lucrative business.",the difference used to be much greater.,"so when someone says, ""data center has always been smaller and lower margin than client computing"" and another is willing to back that up.",it's weird.,it's widely understood that the datacenter market is the most lucrative in the industry.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
under consideration means that they are actively looking at your app.,they will most likely reach out to you for a screening call.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"it's been 3 days since the internship interview and the status is still ""under consideration"".","i've been in another the internship program from a different company and their response was really quick, right after the interview.","intel seems pretty slow, maybe because there are so much applicants out there applying for one single position.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i upgraded from a 9900k (which is similar in performance to a 10700k) to a 12600k.,"you will notice a difference if you are cpu bottlenecked in games, but otherwise not that much.",at this point you are probably better off making your next upgrade to a ddr5 platform.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, wait.",also wait until benchmarks or until you actually have the new gpu.,we've seen quite a few new cpus in a timespan where people haven't even been able to get a new gpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"can i ask where is this, op?",was this newegg and are you buying from abroad?,"i just bought a 12700k and msi z690 tomahawk (ddr4) for a combo deal that shaved $115, but came with a promo code deal that further reduced the price of the 12700k ($45 off).",total price for me before taxes was $514.,"plus, the cpu came with a free game--dying light 2. 

i have a 6700k so i am well due for an upgrade.","to be honest, i think you could afford to wait it out till the new 13th gen comes out, but totally wouldn't blame you if you decide to upgrade.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"why when 13600k is 6 months away and, with the launch of 700 series mb, old 600 mb will start getting discounts ?",its not like you need either one until you buy a better gfx card.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what do you hope to gain?,selling the 10700k + a z490 will probably net you $275-$400 depending on all the usual factors.,then youâ€™ll spend $550 (tax included) for this plus a decent ddr4 motherboard.,"if you are doing production work, go for it.",gaming?,i say no.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a 10700k and honestly don't feel i need the upgrade.,i might wait for the 13700k and for ddr5 prices to go down,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yes, i think with amd, they will or they almost have to take it to another level.","i know for sure they don't want intel to take any shares, and with amd i feel like they will go all cores 5.0ghz with no e-cores bs.",i think that's probably why the prices are dropping so drastically.,"i mean, this is like 1months's time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

can you elaborate?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
?,?,12600k is a 10core cpu.,"although it is 6p + 4e

well then this is a great deal wtf.,shoulda said monopoly money in the first place.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"only for pcie 4 not worth it right now....upgrade after new gen gpus/cpu releases from amd/nvidia i.e im guessing it will easily take 6 to 9 months from now

at that time you will easily able to make jump directly to pcie 5, ddr5 and atx 3.0 all at once.",hopefully ddr5 prices will also fall somewhat by than.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, that's why we have options.","mini itx builds are the ones that look the best (to me), while also being more portable, reducing the footprint in your desktop, and honestly with cases like the nr200p, you are not losing any thermal performance at all, heck the nr200 outperforms a lot of mid tower cases.",regular atx builds to me are a massive waste of space and look ugly to me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that and maybe runner up gtx 1080ti.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that a new cpu surpasses it doesn't mean it's bad lol.,"btw game devs now seem to be mostly optimizing games for high fps, that means games aren't really getting much more demanding on the cpu.",already happening during last 2 years.,also 9900k surpasses 3.5ghz zen2 by a pretty big margin so that's the room for the higher setting of pc games ( porting from console to pc is now very easy as both use basically the same architectures ).,btw if you overclock 9900k to 5ghz and ring clock to 4.6ghz it goes to zen3 gaming performance level - which is a relatively modern and powerful architecture now.,last gen of consoles was also normal gpu architecture but they were paired with a cpu that was very weak already at release day of those consoles.. because of that game devs were often forced to offload stuff that would be usually computed on cpu to the gpu which then made it harder to port the game to pc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

tests show that you lose 3 to 5 percent on a 3090 between pcie 3.0 x16 and pcie 4.0 x16.,"that's not a huge deal, but that gap would likely widen using something that requires more pcie bandwidth than 3090. that isn't a problem right now, but it might very well be with high end 40 series cards.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if it's boosting, it's natural behaviour.",maybe it's only sustaining for a few seconds.,"if you wanna reduce the tdp, u cld use throttlestop to do it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the tdp rating is about the same as 'having maximum load on all parts of the cpu, while running at the claimed base clock'.","so it can, and will run higher than 28w if the laptop's bios tuning allows it (i think something like aida64 fpu without avx512 can push it to over 40?",a 4c8t with roughly 4.0ghz should be around that number.),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pl2 for those can be as high as 60 watts.,"so within tau, it can scale far higher before pl1 kicks in.","(pl2 performs within a 99'c thermal limit, though, so it may cut off at, say, 35w, for laptops with limited cooling)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the idea is that intel wants to give users the best possible performance in the chassis of the laptop you have.,"so if you have thermal headroom, the cpu will boost for a short while to a much higher power and performance level that isn't sustainable in the long run, but it is for a very short while in order to give you snappy response in general usage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the oem likely just has it configured that way.,more often than not these days oems tend to maximize boost performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no clue man.,maybe your laptop manufacturer configured it that way?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

could you explain what a uniprocessor is?,do you mean single core cpus (which are basically non-existent for pcs) or something else?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that was the case when pentium 4 was a thing with an extra thread vs a pentium 3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all modern desktop chips are multi-core.,"i think the last time intel released a single-core chip was a very low-end sandy bridge-based celeron in 2011.

some high-end server and workstation xeon and amd epyc motherboards do have more than one socket, though it's extremely niche.",99.9% of users won't need more than one cpu unless you're planning on spending thousands of $$$ for a high-end server.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
single core performance depends on ipc and max clock speed of cpu.,"usually newer gen cpu offer better ipc than older gen cpus

multicore performance mostly depends on how app is optimized or utilizes core n threads...a slightly lower ipc multicore cpu can still beat lower count higher ipc cpu again totally depends on app",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

â€¦the same?,"if a program only uses a single thread, it will use one core of a single core processor, or one core of a 16 core processor.","assuming both processors have the same â€œsingle threaded speedâ€, they would be identical.",modern multicore processors are way faster single threaded than any former single core processor.,"like, 12th gen has some of the best single threaded performance of any former intel processor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if an application only uses 1 core, then it will run on a single core and the others will remain idle.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wouldn't particularly say that most programs were made meant for single core.,there just isn't a mainstream technology out there that can reliably split a single thread's instructions into parallel streams for multiple cores to work on.,you deal with issues such as every next instructions relies on the previous.,"if there was a way for my single threaded program to scale across multiple cores without having to rewrite the whole damn thing i would be, heck anyone would be for that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there would be no issue.,the application would just run on one core.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks, i appreciate the detailed response.",i wasnâ€™t sure if there would be a loss in performance/efficiency or if it would have issues when fetching instructions or so.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you.,so the other cores wouldnâ€™t be fetching instructions?,"just the one core, because it was originally meant for one to begin with?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>there just isn't a mainstream technology out there that can reliably split a single thread's instructions into parallel streams for multiple cores to work on.,"without going into a lot of deep compsci theory, the reason this technology doesn't exist is that it's mathematically impossible.",in that sense programs really are made for some a single cpu or are made for multiple cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks.,so there really wouldnâ€™t be a loss of performance or conflicting cores in any way?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if anything, multicore will be faster, because modern operating systems always have background tasks going on.","with an old single core processor, those tasks have to share the core and be swapped in and out, so you donâ€™t usually get 100% of a core 100% of the time.","itâ€™s one reason why hyperthreading was originally created as a thing - it allowed two processes to efficiently share the same core, and managed to eek out some additional overall performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a program is a sequence of instructions for one or more cpus.,"if the program only includes a sequence of instructions to run on a single cpu, then it can only run on one cpu.",the others might run another program at the same time or else will be idle.,"if you want to run on two or more cpus, you need to change the code to use both of them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it can be possible if a program is pre-parsed and translated into a different object code that runs in a vm or parts are replaced.,next level shit i know.,"best case scenario would be a hybrid maybe where well coded stand alone functions are identified and then replaced by calls to the modified code backed by a thread pool eg:

`int arg1 = 5int arg2 = 7int arg3 = 15`

`result1 = standalonefunction1(arg1)`

`result2 = standalonefunction2(arg2)`

those functions have no reason to run synchronously

if a cpu were to do this on its own it'd need a look ahead unit many times faster than actually executing the code and then re-arrange the program.",but that would be a ridiculous waste compared to having software that recompiles for multi threads.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
none at all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks again.,"itâ€™s a bit to remember, but it does seem pretty simple once you get the basics of it all.",it really is crazy just how fast they have become.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"alright, thatâ€™s good to know.",what exactly is this hyper threading i heard of though?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if you win the silicon lottery you can achieve an overclock while undervolting but the nature of alder lake leaves very little headroom to begin with.,i was able to achieve a small overclock on my 12700k while also lowering my overall core voltage despite bumping up my ring p and e core clocks.,anything lower than -0.130mv would net me blue screens during benchmarks and any lower than -0.110mv would cause usb drop outs but everything else would be stable.,i found -0.100mv was my sweet spot.,albeit in the end it was all for a very marginal performance increase that outside of benching is not really noticeable.,i did achieve my main goal of lowering my temperatures significantly though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

use v/f point offsets instead of global offset and provide voltage for your max oc ratio.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">razer blade advance 15

although i dont have first hand experience with them, i'd warn you about getting razer products in the philippines but these are what i know which could be outdated already:

\- they are difficult to avail of warranty and repair services

\- they dont perform well if left to render over 10+ hours without thermal throttling.","they're more for gaming where gpu usage fluctuates giving it time to breathe now and then

\- they prioritize thinness, aesthetic.","their laptops often undervolt but i'd double check websites like notebookcheck

\- lumion is usually bottle-necked by the gpu and not the cpu so an i7 might be better long term.","best to look around for thermal tests on that specific model if it throttles on stress tests, you should never buy a laptop that throttles under load for lumion

you should also buy a laptop cooling pad that performs well soon as you start rendering on it

"you need to look up what the vrr range is for your specific monitor/machine, then try and tune games settings to stay within those limits.","also since you have a rtx card, to use vrr you need to turn it on in the nvidia control settings and v sync needs to be disabled.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i also tried playing valorant and gta 5 with vsync on no tearing as expected but stuttering means that vrr is not working,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

also, disable v-sync in the game, and make sure the game is running on exclusive fullscreen.",intel adaptive sync doesn't seem to work when running on borderless windowed mode.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i actually got it to work a month ago had to enable adaptive sync from graphics command center and vrr option from windows setting at the same time .,adaptive sync for me seems to work in borderless fullscreen for dx12 games and only in fullscreen for dx11 games .,but it would be great if intel shows an indicator while starting a game that vrr is functional similar to gsync indicator.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm glad you got it working.,"apparently, microsoft will introduce an ""optimizations for windowed games"" option on future versions of windows 11, to allow dx10 and dx11 games that run on borderless fullscreen to use vrr, auto hdr and other technologies.","dx12 games already have these optimizations, so that's why vrr works on them.",https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/updates-in-graphics-and-gaming/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so that means i can't get vrr working in something like retroarch?,"i currently use g-sync but am looking at a laptop with the intel adaptive sync implementation, and vrr is very important for retro arcade games.",in fact it's the only way to get games that were originally below 60hz to show all their frames and at the correct speeds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"afaik retroarch by default runs in exclusive full screen mode, you'll need to set the correct refresh rate on retroarch settings and activate the ""sync to exact content framerate"" setting to get vrr working.","it should work on the dx11 driver in exclusive full screen mode or the dx12 driver in both exclusive and borderless full screen modes, not sure about other drivers like opengl or vulkan.",you might need to go to retroarch's forums or discord and ask there to see if anyone has experience with adaptive sync and an intel gpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's the thing, i use the vulkan driver.. however, for retro arcade games and neo geo, there is no reason why i can't switch to direct x when i want to use those.","what i now need to find out is if the final burn neo and mame cores will happily use direct x for the actual gameplay part and don't switch to gl, like for example, kronos saturn automatically does.","fullscreen is more of an issue as i generally don't game in full screen.. with g sync i can activate it ""both in windowed and full screen mode"" which is what i do.","yes indeed, thank you, i have always had the sync content to exact frame rate selected but it's a good note for anyone reading, as that is the setting that will do all the whizbang timing with a vrr monitor.","with dx12, is there any chance of it working in literal windowed mode?","i have a feeling things with win 11 will improve in this area though.. well, one would think.","btw, thanks so much for the reply.","so cool to get my first reply here (i'm a noob), and it's helpful too!",cheers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"any core that uses software rendering should work with dx11 or dx12, so any arcade core or console core from the snes generation and older.","console cores for ps1 generation or older that use hardware rendering for upscaling will need to use the driver that they support, and they should switch automatically.",i'm not sure if vrr will work on opengl or vulkan though.,"vrr should work on dx12 in windowed mode, according to the blog post from microsoft i linked in previous replies, but i'm not 100% certain.",right now intel's implementation of vrr is still too new and depends on microsoft apis in windows which are not as mature as nvidia's or amd's.,"it should improve a bit with ""optimizations for windowed games"" that are mentioned in the blog post, those should land in windows 11 22h2 update later this year.","also, the documentation is not very accurate yet, microsoft and intel only mention vrr working on dx11 and dx12, but it worked for me on a dx9 game.","if you really value vrr for retro gaming, then i would suggest to get a laptop with advanced optimus and g-sync, or maybe a laptop with a ryzen cpu and nvidia gpu to use freesync through the amd igpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this looks fine.,so i watched a video on youtube with same specs and warzone was running at low.,6600xt usage was around 70-80%.,don't know who told you that cpu won't be a bottleneck but it is for sure.,specially since you run it at low for high fps.,"you should have gone with a 12400 at least, it's a much better cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no it's normal, this thing is just used to keep the cpu busy.",yea you are right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yea true it's normal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i ordered the 12400f at 1st but the diff between it and the 10400 ( with mobo) is 100$.,"so i opted for the 10400 and used the extra 100$ to go for 6600xt instead of 6600. also based on this video, the 12400vs 10400 produce 3-10% better results in games at 1080p

but yesterday it was going for 100%.,plus in elden ring cpu usage was 50% but still gpu usage was not going above 75%.maybe it's a malware,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if this fake idle process was using cpu, the total usage wouldn't be 100% like the op describes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you made the right choice by saving on cpu and getting a better gpu.,you will definitely get better performance because of the gpu at high or max settings.,that video shows results at high settings where gpu is the limit.,at low the story is different like it shows in watch dogs in the video.,anyway you are still getting 100+ fps in warzone and that's not slow by any means.,stop worrying and have fun gaming on your new system.,:),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
elden ring has 60 fps lock so the gpu usage will be low as the framerate cannot go above 60.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good point.,op: you can right click it (or expand and then right click it) and see the options to search online or go to file location.,that might give you some additional ideas about what's going on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yea its fine but whats annoying me is the sudden fps drops happening, like from 110 to 70 for 1 sec and then comes back",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"plenty of malware exists that calls itself ""system idle process"" or similar names so that people won't try to remove it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think that's why the reviews include 1% lows.,you are still above 60fps so nothing to really worry about.,sometimes what's happening in game can cause drops for a second or so.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think the drivers are the same.,"try them, nothing to loose :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this really depends on hardware that you are using.,"i recommend to use vendor provided drivers first, the try windows update next, in last case i recommend to use official intel drivers.",windows server 2022 ltsc should be based on windows 10 21h2 build so you can try windows 10 drivers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

remember that data reporting from early engineering samples is not necessarily accurate.,i seriously doubt we will see 20% improvement in performance per clock.,"also userbenchmark says that the boost clock is ""(avg)"".",so the single thread test has probably ran with much higher speed.,that would also explain why the 4- and 8-core score is lower than the 12700k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if you can wait, wait until meteor lake(14th gen) next year, and if you can realllly wait, then hold off till around 2025 for 18a.",i think those two generations would be good purchases.,"meteor lake will come at a time when ddr5 probably becomes more commonplace, as well as the new chip design, new manufacturing process, and likely even more e cores with possibly a new e core architecture.",will likely see huge multicore gains(mostly for the e-cores) and the e cores will likely be a little more polished by this point.,"the mention of 18a is pretty far away, but it looks to be very promising.","by 18a, intel will likely have a huge swath of e-cores, and will likely settle down.",it's supposed to be the new process efficiency gains according to intel(which has been mostly truthful so far recently).,18a will be an e-core army.,expect it to be a big generational leap again here.,"truthfully, most processors nowadays are overkill for most people's usage, so you likely will be happy with most things out at this point, as long as you avoid amd's low-end currently.","heck, we're even getting back to the pentiums being usable in a number of situations, obviously not with your rtx 3080 though lol!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

does it matter if you're comparing intel to intel?,"also, it's only notorious due to the overall relative performance being measured by an average of benchmarks which are skewed towards lower thread counts.",cpu user benchmark still allows individual benchmark comparison which makes it easy to compare intel to amd without being disingenuous.,the overall performance number is generally disregarded yet there is still this fallacy that the entire benchmark system is skewed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

~~the average is calculated by averaging out the total number of benchmark submissions.,"since there's only one benchmark the average is equal to the only benchmark's boost clock.~~

furthermore, engineering samples are always gimped so that motherboard vendors and other partners are not getting a final product but have enough performance and functionality to develop support for the cpu.",the frequency will increase in the final product.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my first thought on seeing those numbers is that its showing the tb2 boost clock but not the tb3/tvb clock which is a couple hundred mhz higher.,pretty common that software doesn't detect es clocks correctly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i thought 10th gen was a decent improvement.,"11th gen was a bit of a let down though, just a side-grade really, it was kind of the same thing just more power usage for more performance.",best of luck with your purchase then!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ddr5 will most probably only get more expensive after new dddr5 platforms launch(because scalpers will try to buy out all stock + very big demand of people upgrading to am5 ), the price will fall about 6 months later.",in summer 2023 probably should be possible to buy 32gb 6000mhz for around 200$.,"so you would have to wait a long time for that.. 
i'd still go with ddr4 instead, that will certainly remain cheap.",it's not like there's a huge performance difference in running ddr5 vs decent ddr4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you mean intel 700?,that will most probably only be a more expensive version with tiny improvement over 600.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you don't have to blindly trust a single source.,you can do sanity checks by comparing a source to an alternative source to ensure its accuracy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"but there is no issue with their benchmark, only with their rating system, which does not affect the benchmark results themselves, and thatâ€™s what weâ€™re looking at.","additionally, all the controversy is a very effective way to bump up your pagerank, which is probably one of the reasons theyâ€™re always at the top of google search results.",hard to say this isnâ€™t all very deliberate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"its a leak

leak have never had ""this represents final product with 100% accuracy"" marking",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don't get caught up on the ratings.,that's more subjective than the benchmark numbers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> they rated an i3-9350kf (a quad core) to be faster than an 18-core skylake-x:  

it shows 9980xe has +429% over 9350kf in overall performance.","the ""5% faster effective speed"" at the top means gaming performance and for some reason it was tested with 9350k overclocked so it's not surprising it beats 9980xe in games.. if you disregard the ""effective performance"" thing then the rest seems fairly accurate at least for intel vs intel comparisons",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">they rated an i3-9350kf (a quad core) to be faster than an 18-core skylake-x: 

the problem is none of the remaining people who use ub look at the ""effective speed"".",we value that it has separate scores for 1 core 2 core 4 core 8 core and 64 core.,"only other benchmark site i know that does that is cpu z validator, but they've neglected updating their charts to be compatible with a hybrid architecture, and dont have a competing compare cpus page.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
r/amd_stock?,"but hey, **amd smol** â®, you should give as much money as you can to amd",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
alright it's possible the clock was higher than 3.9 ghz for the single core.,bummer for the ipc gains.,at least we still know it has more to give though because the listing says windows throttled the cpu at 87% performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"maybe, but thatâ€™s just an assumption.",they could also be hiding a much bigger improvement than expected behind this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel claimed a double digit performance increase from ice lake to tiger lake.,it ended up being about 20%.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> if we adjust the numbers to account for the clock speed difference, we can see the real ipc difference is only about 25%

a little sad for intel's standards perhaps.",good thing pat is running a tight roadmap and invested so much in building more fabs.,if raptor lake brings 10% ipc increase then that would make it closer to 40% over skylake?,i don't overclock so it's more from skylake to alderlake for me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i meant around october-november 2022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think it's a typo he meant 13 gen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yea like z790, maybe it can address the ddr5 issues when using 4 sticks etc?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah uhhhhhh that's a wonderful general-purpose principle and i wholeheartedly appreciate your effort in acquainting people with it

do you, by some chance, happen to know of **literally any other alternative source for this cpu's benchmarks**?","otherwise, your post uhhh, isn't able to comply with the requirements of the principle that you yourself have just proposed others use",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
their benchmark was customized for intel st.  they will likely change now intel is pushing more cores,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"having more competition is good and they should be kept alive and somewhat blooming, but not to the level when they just price gauge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> if raptor lake brings 10% ipc increase then that would make it closer to 40% over skylake?,alder lake already outperforms skylake by 40%,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if comparing clock for clock yes that would be more like 40%.,"if however we're talking about say a 6700k at stock clocks vs a 13900k at stock, the difference would be bigger since 6700k has a very conservative stock clock speed of only 4.2ghz or less.",being able to claw back another gigahertz on the single core clock speed will raise performance linearly so that 40% could be amplified by 25% itself (5/4 = 1.25x or +25%) resulting in typical single thread performance gains of 50% or more.,let's keep our fingers crossed for the best.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok but 12th gen is already out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13th gen desktop should be out in june or early july.,not sure about laptop.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ddr4 support and cheaper motherboards because of that will be literally the only reason to buy raptor lake instead of zen4 with superior performance and efficiency.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"uhhhhh maybe don't uhhh talk like this on the internet, you sound uhhhhh insufferable",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's a leak dude, don't get so worked out.",time will tell if this information was accurate or not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s not true.,the final weighed score (effective speed) is heavily weighted towards st performance.,the individual benchmark results themselves are not however.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"whenever amd got ahead, they priced gauged the shit out of the budget consumers for whom they are even alive today lmao.",remember the 1000$ athlon 64 fx?,"and for gpu, they price gauge even more.",the 6400 is 160$ laughing stock that people are saying is actually good!,ðÿ˜‚,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"maybe at stock clocks but push a skylake architecture chip (7700k, 8700k, 9900k or 10900k) to 5ghz+ and you are dropping that gap down to 25% on average.","again, this is single thread performance where ipc and clock speed are basically all that matter.","no, avx-512 loads don't count since only early revisions of alder lake even had it on the die and isn't viable going forward.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
raptor lake will most likely double skylake's single thread performance on stock speeds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if buying now, i would stick to dd4, but i don't mind to wait a bit in hopes of faster speeds and improvements, just have to see how it goes.","since i plan to keep for 5-6 years, like my current system, i rather newer technology.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"when intel is ahead, they price gauge the double squared shit of everyone with cherry on a top, corporate and private citizens alike.",this really is not a talking point you should try to put forward.,it's really simple.,"when there's only one real option, that one option is going to cost you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, when did intel increase the price tag of their quad-core i7?",never.,they kept it constant.,"that's not price gauging, that's profiting while delivering the same for lower production cost.",that's ok. amd selling literal slow 6400 for 160$ which is a rejected part is price gauging.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's not in the official memory support list on the website,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just take the i7(f) and maybe put some more money into other components :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on your use case.,"for gaming only, get the 12700(f), if you actually need the extra 4 cores/threads for highly threaded workloads, get the 12900f.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12700. you are not gonna notice the difference.,actually i would argue 12400 if you are just gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just get a 12600k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
between just those two is not a ton of difference except one is just a little bit faster but whether that little bit is worth $100 is up to you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
where did found a 12900f for this price in europe?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as you are not going to oc take 12700 but the f version as that leaves you with more money to put out on other components.,you will not notice a difference big enough,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i usually have a few applications running in the background like voice chat, video streaming and video playback.",i don't think the 12400 will suffice in that regard since my current 6 core chip is choking when doing more than just gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the b660 board doesn't have any oc capabilities.,so the k version would be wasted.,i will take 2 more p cores for 30 bucks more.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if the gab was more than 200â‚¬ (usually it is at msrp) would definitely grab the i7.,but as of right now it's less than 100â‚¬.,so i might just got for it and take the higher clocks/more threads.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sry for the late response.,the 12900f deal was available at notebooksbilliger.de a german online retailer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 12400 probably would, but if you are using windows 11 those e-cores do help a little on background tasks & streaming x264 surprisingly, but personally i still use nvenc so once again the 12400 would still be an option.","edit: forgot to add 12900k/f is a nice chip but i think if you want to go all the way with the 12900f do it properly = ddr5 ram & z690 board (future proof pci-e5.0), but that's just me & i live by example, if i was going to do it on a budget or for current standards it'd just get the 12700.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"here in the states, the 12700k was actually cheaper than the 12700, so i purchased the unlocked model.","even if you can't oc, you would still get a better binned processor that will hit higher clocks.","also, the memory voltage is unlocked on k processors, so they support better memory xmp and overclocking.","if your memory is faster than 3200mhz, you will almost certainly need the k processor to hit xmp unless your 12700 is a silicon lottery winner",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i see.,is the 12900f a higher binned processor compared to the 12700?,i assume yes?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, but only slightly.",and it still has the issue where the imc is handicapped by the voltage limitation.,"so, you're only really guaranteed to get 3200mhz max ram xmp",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

arctic actually shits the bed in gaming workloads.,gamersnexus does a constant load test which is fine but not a variable load test where it had to speed up and slow down to cool and the power req might spike as more stuff is happening.,ekwb or deep cool 360s are better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you know i will be honest people can downvote me for this but in my experience switching from air cool to aio i been seeing so many damn problems already and iâ€™m using the â€œbestâ€ company arctic.,but i havenâ€™t even got to play because the aios donâ€™t even work until i found something to work it feels like the damn lottery for finding a working aio.,like if you actually found a good aio bam!!!,celebrate with the family have fun which to me is more depressing then walking in the rain.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my experience, not others.",i bought a corsair h60 and it lasted me just about 5 years.,i wouldnt consider that long term but long enough to be happy with the product.,the pump actually died out due to some kind of clogging.,it couldnt push liquid anymore but it could still operate when i flipped it upside down.,i figured it wasnt worth the fight and bought a new aio.,bigger and stronger pipe ofc.,aio tbh will never match an air cooler in longevity.,depends what you're looking for honestly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

many (most?),b660 boards also lack pcie 5.0. just because the chipset technically supports it doesnâ€™t mean motherboards are designed to.,"for example, one of the most popular (and expensive) b660 boards, the msi mag b660 tomahawk, does not support pcie 5.0.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i assume you're talking about windows so for that os i'll second the recommendation above.,i'd say it won't hurt to try a reconfiguration on the fly initially.,if you feel anything is off you can always go forward with a clean install at some point later.,"you don't have to install clean, but windows persistently installs profiles into the registry for every piece of hardware it detects.",you can avoid potential issues with stale hardware being resident in the configuration.,other operating systems handle hardware configuration in a less persistent manner so it's not as much of a concern.,"personally i do some pre-configuration on my installation image to allow for quick clean windows installs when i feel the need, usually after the instance gets wear and tear on it from device changes and software installation/removal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think all the options you've mentioned are a bit problematic.,"number 2 makes a lot more sense but if you're not going to be gaming at high res, your ram is really going to hinder your performance.",so ideally you're going to want a new mobo too.,"1st option is somewhat pointless unless the games you play are very cpu bound(esport games, moba, mmorpgs).",however your gpu is not the strongest so you may still be gpu bottlenecked in those games.,"if its really desperate, number 2 might be better in the short term than number 1 but in the long run number 1 will be better since then you'll just have to upgrade to a really nice gpu when that comes.",you'll likely upgrade again with option 2 and option 1 you may not see much difference.,"out of the 2, number 1 is prob what i'd do.","you'll see some gains in frametimes and smoothness and then it'd be a simple gpu upgrade, but it's not a clear fps upgrade like a new gpu.",hence i'd honestly just wait it out for next gen to come out to do a massive upgrade + save more money until then(rpl/zen4 + ada/rdna3).,"we're at the end of am4, ampere, rdna 3 so i'd really suggest waiting unless you absolutely have to upgrade.",since it'll be half a year and your 600 or so for a gpu now could have possibly netted you something much much faster.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

increasing cache doesn't really increase the cache latency.,increase in number of cache slices can increase latency.,in raptor lake they don't increase the number of cache slices by much.,cache latency can be improved by increasing the mesh frequency.,most probably raptor lake has higher mesh frequency than alder lake and that should result in lower cache latency.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i wouldn't pay anything to upgrade my current 10700k to 11th gen i9.,they're essentially the same cpu aside from the higher clock speed.,there won't be any noticeable improvement imo.,i would just use the gen 4 ssd in gen 3 mode until i move on to my ddr5 build.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no they aren't at all the same cpu.,11th gen is a new architecture backported from 10nm.,it has ipc gains.,this is why the 11700k at 5 ghz has more single core performance than the 10900k at 5.3 ghz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11900k beat the crap out of the 10700k my man.. its 2% slower in multicore than 10900k which is a 10/20 cpu so keep this in your mind my friend.. and single core dont even talk about that you know what are the results.. comparing 10700k to a 11900k its like a ferrari vs toyota ðÿ˜‚ðÿ˜‚,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

back then 12600k was around 300$ couldnt find it cheaper and the z690 boards are so expensive either just the mid range tomahawk ddr4 is around 300$ which is lot imo and it doesnt worth that money.. and there is a big difference in single core between 10900k and 11900k in cinebench r23 the 10900k scores around 1400 points and 11900k is around 1700.. mine does between 1680-1700 and thats a huge difference imo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"there is more than 1 'design' now though, such as the 8p+8e and 6p core on 12th gen desktop,  or the 8c16t+32eu?",(igpu) and 4c8t+96eu 11th gen laptop.,but within the designs the same binning happens,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this process is called binning and is very common across the industry.,"intel, amd, nvidia and the other, non-desktop manufacturers/designers all do this.","deciding on the number and specs of chip designs for a product lineup is a tradeoff between multiple factors and i want to highlight three major points:

#### product lineup/segmentation
right off the bat, it's easy to add more product tiers by simply taking an existing design and reducing the specification.","it can be cheaper and easier to make that modification after manufacturing than to make an additional design, which i'll discuss below under the aspect of volume.",more product tiers means you can more closely match the desires of more customers.,"let's say you offer 4 cores for $200 and 8 cores for $450, but a customer has a budget of $350.","the 4-core is too little, the 8-core is too much.","especially when there's competition, you might lose the sale.","#### manufacturing defects  
as you said, there can be impurities in the wafer, and also defects introduced during lithography (putting structures onto the wafer).",the defect density will often decrease as a manufacturing process matures.,using the same chip design for multiple product tiers and considering defects in your design and product lineup allows you to salvage chips that are not good enough for the top-tier product specification.,"""not good enough"" can mean plain defective parts, but can also apply to achievable frequency or power efficiency.","also, there's often built-in headroom between the top specification and actual chip, e.g.",redundant structures or a higher-than-specified achievable frequency (which is why overclocking is even a thing).,"one high-level example of redundant structures is the microsoft/amd scorpio engine for the xbox one x, which contains 44 gpu compute units even though the marketed console uses just 40. only the very limited developer kit enables all 44 cus.","the same strategy is also used for its successor, the xbox series x.  
on a lower level, you might also find that some large sram arrays (like caches) are bigger on chip than what the public specification says.","sram arrays make up relatively large parts of a chip's area, meaning that they're relatively likely to contain defects, and are very homogenous, repetitive structures making them an easy target for an extra fraction of spare capacity.","#### volume  
there are two kinds of costs for making something: fixed costs and variable costs.","fixed costs happen regardless of how many units you sell, e.g.",the design costs and research.,"variable costs scale with the volume of your sales, e.g.",factory and raw material costs.,fixed costs are amortized over the entire sales volume.,"the more units you sell, the cheaper are the fixed costs per unit.","designing a chip, which also includes testing/qualification, is an expensive fixed cost.","that cost must be covered by the sales of the products using this design, otherwise the design isn't worth making.","to showcase this, i believe there's an interesting contrast between intel and amd here:  
intel has a long-standing, predictable, high sales volume, so they follow a strategy that optimizes variable costs: specialized chip designs.","for alder lake, there are four different chip designs with varying cpu p/e core and gpu eu counts.","on top of that, they use entirely different chip designs (even with a different core architecture) in the server segment.","basically, intel wants to waste little wafer space per unit because for many millions of units that adds up to a lot.","it adds up to so much savings, that the cost of designing multiple different chips is worthwhile.","in contrast, amd - especially at the time of first-gen zen (2017) - had low volume and an uncertain outlook.","they decided to supply their entire product portfolio across embedded, mobile, desktop, workstation, and server with just two chip designs (summit ridge and raven ridge back then).","part of that strategy is that summit ridge does not contain a gpu, because that space would have been a plain waste on server cpus and a negligible feature on high-end desktop/workstation cpus that are usually paired with a discrete gpu anyway.","meanwhile, intel desktop cpus almost universally have a gpu, because the desktop chip designs aren't used for server cpus at all, but are used e.g.",in a large volume of business pcs where an integrated gpu is the cost-effective choice.,"as a result, amd are/were wasting precious wafer space to disabled cpu and/or gpu cores and e.g.",server-specific features like ecc memory support and infinity fabric on the majority of shipped units.,"however, for them the savings from fewer distinct designs had a greater per-unit impact because they were selling fewer units.","additionally, this strategy allowed them to bring more products to market in a shorter span of time with limited staff.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">yes, they are the same chip.",what i mean is they go through exactly the same fabrication process.,this is wrong.,"there are typically 3 desktop and 1-2 mobile focused cores plus 3 xeons per generation, so about 7-8 different chips from which all the i7, etc are drawn from.",the xeons also do not necessarily use the same process node as the desktop parts since their launches are staggered (current xeons are mostly intel 10sf while desktop is 7).,but yes if you compare an i7 12700 to a 12900 then they're made from the same dies and just binned differently.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not really.,"there are always multi dies for desktop / mobile, like alderlake desktop has two design: 8p+8e and 6p.",12600k and above use the first one.,"for mobile there's two as well: 6p+8e, 2p+8e",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i didn't realize the bining process is still news to some people.,"it's kind of like realizing a big slice of cake and a small slice of cake are made the same way, you bake a large cake and then for the bigger slices you just take a higher slice of the main cake.","the only difference is because of the shape of the cake and how it bakes and comes out, you might only be able to get so many larger slices out of it, and cut up whata left into smaller pieces.",but it's all cake,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah.,it's great they can do this though as opposed to the waste that would happen if they had to scrap processors.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is not entirely true.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good old days when you could unlock a core with some pencil and run it slower than the other cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is literally why they call it the silicon lottery.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think this was true back in the sandybridge days, not anymore.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
overclockers have been exploiting this for decades.,iâ€™ve had top tier gaming performance on a fraction of the budget my whole life.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes and thats why amd can sell their chips at such a low cost.,"they use 1 die for everything from low end desktop to high end server, and another die for mobile and desktop apus.",intel has 2 or 3 dies for each segment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think youre missing a fundamental core tenant of chip manufacturing - its like a giant sheet of square graph paper in the shape of a circle.,"you can only cut so many 6x6 squares out, but can fit a lot more 4x4s or a zillion 2x2s.","it's not *quite* this simple, but chip manuf very similar to screen (tvs and shit) manuf in this regard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
overclocked 4.5 ghz extreme edition i7s?,lol what year is it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just to add - those defect and deformities are usually caused by impurities in the silicone.,semiconductor grade silicon needs to be on the level of 99.9999% pure.,so chances are it was a molecule or two of another metal or some pesky oxygen that contaminated the silicon and resulting defects.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"lmao, this guy got it wrong on so many levels lol.","imma forward this to my colleagues, will give them a good laugh.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this.,even before the usage of efficiency and performance there should have been multiple designs.,"the small dual core desktop cpus were a smaller chip to be started with, than the 10 or now 16 core cpus.",a lot of waver area would be wasted for smaller cpus.,but i did not find a good source spontaneously.,"on the other side i do know for a fact that amds chip design, since 2017, is based on the usage of a single chip design for all cpu only products per generation.",whether it's a entry level desktop cpu or an expensive server cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

silicone lottery?,that's a weird thing to say about something made of silicon.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> yes and thats why amd can sell their chips at such a low cost.,what low prices?,the msrp of zen 3 was insane.,"5600x was $300, and traded blows with the $180 12400f.",5900x was $550 and lost to the $320 12700f.,"even today after price cuts intel cpu's are cheaper, and amd doesnt even compete in the low end.","amd didnt sell their cpu's at a low cost, they sold them at a high margin.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>just to add - those defect and deformities are usually caused by impurities in the silicone.,silicone (rubber stuff used for breast implants) is different than silicon (hard semiconductor used for cpus).,"and no, most defects are not caused by impurities in the source wafer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
unused or disabled areas of a cpu from my knowledge on the subject is actually beneficial for heat sinking and increasing it's head distribution/dissipation.,the material and production cost is nothing compared to the engineering cost for development.,it's probably more efficient and cost effective to tool the fab for one design than it is to constantly change production for variants of the same architecture.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i live on the border of hillsboro and beaverton.,my commute to the jf campus is about 15 minutes.,you can find some cheaper stuff in beaverton than hillsboro but depending on which campus you're at might impact your commute.,shouldn't have more than a 30 minute or so commute if you get a place in either hillsboro or beaverton.,i'd personally avoid portland.,it's costs more to get less home and traffic will make your commute closer to an hour or more.,for apartment searching i used a mix of zillow and apartment list.,worked out well for me!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"windows 10 works fine, been using it with my 12900k since it was released.",no need to do anything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
â€œthe microcontroller on the cpu is what we call intel thread director.,"it has a full scope view of the whole processor â€“ what is running where, what instructions are running, and what appears to be the most important.","it monitors the instructions at the nanosecond level, and communicates with the os on the microsecond level.","it takes into account thermals, power settings, and identifies which threads can be promoted to higher performance modes, or those that can be bumped if something higher priority comes along.","it can also adjust recommendations based on frequency, power, thermals, and additional sensory data not immediately available to the scheduler at that resolution.","all of that gets fed to the operating system.â€

â€œwhat makes windows 11 better than windows 10 in this regard is that windows 10 focuses more on the power of certain cores, whereas windows 11 expands that to efficiency as well.","while windows 10 considers the e-cores as lower performance than p-cores, it doesnâ€™t know how well each core does at a given frequency with a workload, whereas windows 11 does.","combine that with an instruction prioritization model, and intel states that under windows 11, users should expect a lot better consistency in performance when it comes to hybrid cpu designs.â€

i turn my e cores off anyways.,i suggest most people do.,8 cores 16 threads with higher cache speeds and tuned memory > e cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
windows 10 since 21h2 has the same core assignment thing as 11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah makes some sense though complicated.,"&#x200b;

if i am understanding right windows 11 is always better.",but difference would be smaller and less significant between win10 and win11 if i disable hyper threading and statically set all 8 p cores to all core same frequency and statically set all 8 e cores  to same frequency?,"&#x200b;

as opposed to leaving ht on or worse yet also having different frequencies among p cores which would mean win11 would help more than win10 than in above scenario were difference would be smaller??","&#x200b;

but either way win11 is better, but more so the more variable it becomes with more frequencies and adding hyper threading.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i actually plan to leave e cores on and disable ht.,i always have disabled ht/smt with high core count cpus.,"&#x200b;

i mean smt/ht is kind of pointless with 8 or more cores as real cores are way way better than logical cores.","&#x200b;

with 8 p cores plus 8 e cores.",i have 16 real cores ad 16 real threads.,"e cores are not as good no doubt, but they are actually pretty solid just more like haswell to skylake ipc and not the best in world ipc of p cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i really donâ€™t think hyper threading or allowing the cpu to change frequencies has anything to do with it.,"youâ€™re assuming the os and/or cpu thread director is exceedingly dumb and canâ€™t tell the difference between a cpu idling at 800mhz and one running - for whatever reason - at 3ghz, or another at 5ghz.","(and weâ€™re not talking about forcing 4 cores to one fixed frequency and another identical 4 cores to a different frequency, which i donâ€™t know why you would want to do.)","the cpu knows exactly what it is, and is capable of, as it manages its computations and relays this to the os.","the os knows what hyperthreading is and how to best make use of it, and isnâ€™t going to confuse loading up 2 100% load threads on the same physical core (with hyperthreading) versus 2 physical cores, and leaving everything else idle.","for 99% of users there is no need to disable speed step, or hard-code frequencies, or disable hyper threading, or disable e-cores, or burn the maximum amount of power doing nothing, unless you are a huge overclocker, have a very specific outlier use case, or are anal about getting 244 vs 242fps in certain low-threaded games.","what i got from the article is that windows 10 only knows p-cores > e-cores, and will try to load most stuff up on p-cores, but when it runs out of those, has to live with e-cores.","however e-cores are not useless, and can in fact be more efficient or even faster at certain workloads/frequencies (not everything benefits from running 100% full bore max frequency).","so windows 11 can detect that something would be wasted on a p-core and direct it to an e-core, leaving the p-core for something else.","or if everything is loaded up, manage what should go where based on what a process actually needs and how important it is.","so while windows 10 is probably just fine for playing games or running benchmarks where everything is forced to run full tilt anyways, windows 11 has more finesse and makes less â€œmistakesâ€ about where processes should go, and should give a smoother experience day-to-day.","* and yes, there can be p-core speed benefits to disabling the e-cores, but that also assumes your workloads would have no use for more than 8 physical cores.",iâ€™m doubtful that a fully tuned 12900k/s with e-cores disabled would outperform a fully tuned 12900k/s with e-cores enabled on heavily threaded programs/tests.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am actually an overclocker.,"not hard core, but modest with reasonable thermals on all air cooling, so i always set a static frequency and voltage.","i got the 12900ks specifically because they are best binned 12900ks and paid the premium so i do not have to play silicon lottery and can get good clocks on both  the p and e core clusters with lower vcores and thermals as such

&#x200b;

and no i have 0 intention of turning off e cores as they are still good cores and real threads/cores unlike hyper threading.",but yes i will disable and have always disabled hyper threading on cpus with 6 cores or more.,"&#x200b;

and is it true if you have 8 p cores and 8 e cores and turn of hyper threading you are not really losing performance and gaining clock speeds as you still have 16 threads backed by real core all of which are good.","&#x200b;

but yeah either way win11 is better at utilizing it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thanks for the advice.,do you find hyper threading useful even on high core count cpus?,"or if you are using 16 threads or way less most of time, is having a real cpu core per thread an advantage?",?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think it depends on your needs.,"personally, i donâ€™t find hyperthreading has any negatives to just leaving on.","it allows higher utilization of cores in higher threaded scenarios, and generally speaking if you arenâ€™t needing it, itâ€™s not using it, as virtual cores are less preferred.","but because it allows the cpu to be pushed more, it can increase heat and power usage.","and if absolute maximum single threaded usage is critical, and you can guarantee youâ€™re never going to have more threads than cores, disabling it can improve single threaded performance to some degree in those scenarios.","but once your threads exceed the number of cores, the scheduler has to swap them back and forth, and there is an overhead penalty in doing this that doesnâ€™t occur when both threads are running hyper threaded.","a 16 core cpu is more than enough for todays needs, but for tasks such as rendering where you literally cannot have too many cores, hyperthreading helps.","and, for my needs, disabling it wouldnâ€™t make sense.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you seem to have found the base reason for the clockspeed yourself.,running faster in heavy multicore workload such as cinebench requires power.,the motherboard is able to provide 150w.,though your results are bad even with that.,">vcore compensation set to level 5 

this is bad.",drop it as low as it goes or disable it.,it's a useless setting that should never be used.,it pushes more voltage to the cpu.,">it is a hunch the the cpu is undervolted for some reason

no, the problem is more likely that it's overvolted.",more voltage means drastically more power used and thus lower clockspeed in power limited situation.,you want to run as low voltage as possible with the cpu still stable.,load default settings in bios.,"then enable xmp and set ""long duration power limit"" and ""short duration power limit"" as high as they go.",then check cinebench results.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you update the bios?,"i had really low usage, similar to you, on my 12700k until i updated to the newest available one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i do not seem to be able to remove power limits in the bios.,"actually, intel xtu reports that my cpu is power throttling when it tries to maintain a power around 165w, then it defaults back to 125w, which is actually the highest maximum possible to set in the bios.",i start to fear that my h660m itx mobo cannot provide efficient power for the cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah, your motherboard is the issue.",that asrock cannot power more than about 125 watts constantly due to a very poor vrm (even though itâ€™s an h670 which you think should be designed to a higher level).,"basically, itâ€™s designed for celeron, pentium gold and low-end i3, and is the wrong choice for i5 or i7, never mind i9.","i think below z690, gigabyte is the only brand with a decent itx board.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its located in the bios under oc tweaker.,scroll down to the bottom.,"but yes, you're limited because of your motherboard, it can't provide much power.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"unfortunately, it did not work, without the power raised to 150w, clock frquencies stagnate at 2.8 ghz during the cinebench test.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, i found it and the max option is 150w, which is not enough for my cpu.","that is what i meant, sorry for not being specific.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would still avoid gigabyte.,i have a ddr4 z690 itx board from them and they still haven't fixed the issues (pcie 4.0 not working at all).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i believe i told you to set the power limits as high as they go.,if the board uses default settings for that processor 2.8ghz is fairly high.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i asked asrock and they confirmed that there is not way the board can sustain a 202w output that the cpu would require significantly lowering multi-core performance.,"while i appreciate their candor, i preferred to have seen this type of info in the specs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we already knew it can't sustain 200w but it should reach higher than 2.8ghz sustained clockspeed anyways.,2.8ghz sounds like it is using the standard 65w setting for the cpu.,did you set the powerlimits?,"in the bios you go ""oc tweaker"" -\> ""cpu configuration"" and set the long and short power limits as high as they go.","make sure ""turbo boost"" is enabled in the cpu configuration.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

they don't rely on anything intel specific but will make use of a trusted zone or similar feature if available (e.g.,"amd psp, intel txe).","4k blu-ray playback on pcs, on the other hand, always relied on sgx and thus won't play on cpus without the feature (e.g.",anything amd and newer intel cpus)...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sgx.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11th gen vpro mobile (10 nm) is different than the 11th gen intel vpro desktop (14 nm).,the intel vpro mobile platform has intel tme.,the desktop version does not.,most if not all intel 12th gen intel vpro platforms have intel tme and intel tme-mk.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how would e.g.,"protection of video played in browser work, then?",that is not sgx.,also u/mbc07,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"disable all the killer services in services.msc

"same mobo and w10, i get that too when i install through device manager and update driver.",i basically ran a driver from september or something until recently because of that.,"i ran the actual exe file from intel lan 27.2 and then it would work, surprisingly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am getting this same error code but am unable to roll back to previous driver.,any ideas on what i can do?,i already reset my network and it's still not working,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
interesting.,the latest driver on intel site is older (newest on intel website) than the one driver easy says there is.,thanks for the advice tho.,ill stick with the one on intel site 27.2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you just decide to rollback the driver or find a fix eventually?,having such an old driver is going to cause problems eventually,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
never found a fix.,even re-installed windows (not cause of this issue) and still cant downloaded it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i should have said.,it goes up to 95 degrees constantly no matter if i undervolting or underclock it and always thermal throttles.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"lots of these lga1700 replacement ilms coming out, we've got ones from lzmod, maple (both china only right now), thermalright and now thermal grizzly/der8auer.","the der8auer one seems like it would be best if you are using a lapped cpu and plan on doing ln2, due to the material it is designed with.","der8auer does note a specific torque has to be used with this frame, otherwise contact pressure won't be correct.","the maple one from taobao looks like it has silicone padding underneath to prevent overtightening, and there's also an insulated fiberglass ilm you can get, which some users claim has improved memory overclocking due to less interference.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this may not be totally necessary, however i hate the thought of my â£350 cpu being held down with such uneven pressure by the stock ilm, to the point that it actually bends.","if the price is right, i'll be getting one to protect my cpu from intel's awful implementation of the stock clamp.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

been waiting for a while.,i'll buy it day 1!!,!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are any of these for sale yet.,im just curious.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had no idea they were so uneven.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is exactly what ive been waiting for i knew something would be coming be it a standalone mounting system on a made to order pcb or proprietary like this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wonder how this would pair with the rockitcool copper ihs... tempted.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so is this easy to install/apply.,is it just plug and play for better performance?,or do i have to do something more to reduce temps?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thermal grizzly/der8auer has a video on installing it on youtube, well explained and very informative",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

does not fit.,i learned yesterday.,"what im wondering, copper ihs the lm needs to be reapplied every so often.",but the stock ihs is nickel plated so the lm will last forever compared to raw copper.,would it be more beneficial to go with stock ihs with lm on die and use the frame?,or copper ihs?,which one is going to give the most gain... ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that was the manufacturer sending me the wrong washers making the bracket unusable at the time.,if you would have snooped my history better you would have known.,also i have the right bracket  now and it's still hot.,i've literally built 30 plus 12900k systems and the temps are insane in most applications.,but hey if you think they're fine then this is a future we can look forward to forever.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the loss in performance is minimal, with hugely reduced temperature and power draw.",this is better than pushing stupid voltages for insignificant gains.,"and as shown in the post binning is useful for undervolting too, so i wouldn't consider it a waste.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this was actually at thing with the 9900ks too.,"the better bin means it's almost definitely going to give you more clocks for every undervolt compared to non-bin, so it's really good if you want to cram as much power as you can without hedt cores in a thermal/power/space constrained setup without much regard for price.",given the stock thermals of the 12900k that's probably every system.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah great work indeed.,"back in the day i also got an fx 9590 for my platform, since it was simply the best piece of silicon available.","you can go either way, maximum clocks and heat for 2 fps more, or efficiency.","these days, i much prefer the latter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
binning means selected for the best clocks for a given voltage.,"just because it normally is used for highest speed at as high voltage as your can push without below ambient cooling, doesn't mean that such a chip won't be much better than others at requiring less voltage at a given clock.",it's their money and there's nothing wrong with this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if it's not insanely more expensive - go z690 and 12700k or even 12700 (no k).,"(if budget is a challenge, 12600k is actually faster in apps and games than 10900k while giving you access to pci-e 5.0 (instead of 3.0!","), and other advancements on platform..  plus an upgrade path to 13th gen.)

apps:  12700k = 100%;  12600k = 87.1%, 10900k = 82.8%

games:  12700k = 100%, 12600k = 96.1%, 10900k = 87.9%

pros/cons on these chips:

12600k - cheapest, faster than what you have, can keep the socket warm until you go 13th gen i9 later.",with oc 12600k can match 12700k in 99% of games.,"12700 (no suffix) - 97% of the performance of 12700k, making it faster in apps and games than 12600k.",even comes with a box cooler (see techspot review).,games are generally not limited by the box cooler;  some apps benefit from better cooling + removing power limits.,you can even run this with a b660 board.,12700k - most expensive of the 3 but fastest overall.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"depends on the pricing really mate, what are your options price wise?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
absolutely!,"the performance boost is gonna be noticeable, better go with with 12700f for best price to performance instead of 12700k.","i am kinda baffled at the current prices of z590, should have been cheaper by now.",you can then give your 10850k to your friend who might not have as good of a system.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the input!,"unfortunately, it kinda sucks that most of the respectable z590 boards here are almost the same price as the z690.",and i forgot to add that i'm having a hard time finding a z490 board with good vrm that's reasonable in terms of price.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cool!,how's the uplift?,how noticeable it is?,i love my 10850 k and it serves its purpose well.,although z590 and z690 boards here are almost the same in terms of price.,that's also tempting me a lot to upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok then 12th gen it is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the fps boost was great, especially in the mmo i play (ffxiv) but overall the nicest upgrade was the frametime tbh

but your cpu is still great, so you can't really be wrong with picking a compatible motherboard to keep using it, just be aware that you'll still be using pcie 3 (which can be a issue for future gpu's generations)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes you can uninstall it.,software using the me (of which you likely have none) will no longer work.,99% of the time it will do nothing at all uninstalling or installing the unused me driver.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the 13900k is rumoured to be a significant step up from the 12900k in multi-core performance and slightly faster than the 12900ks in single-core.,it's safe to bet that for the majority of workloads the 13900k with your current ram will be faster than the 12900k with ddr5.,the biggest issue about keeping your current ram and upgrading later would be you'd need a new motherboard too.,i don't think there are any motherboards that support both ddr4 and ddr5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"end result is what you can afford in ram case, there is cheap ddr5 ram out there kingston fury 5200 cl40 (can overclock to cl38 at 1.35/1.4v but not much more).",[here is a vid doing a comparison of ruffly both speeds & cl](https://youtu.be/h5dggtemsmw?t=28).,so you really are not missing out on much **currently** if you don't go to ddr5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

don't touch ddr5 yet.,terrible latency/timings atm.,give it a year or two,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i bought into 12700 and ddr5 but that was because i was making a new system... since u already have ddr4 just switch to 13900  and somewhere down the line when ddr5 us stable and cheap switch to ddr5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wasnâ€™t sure if the 13900k was going to be ddr4 compatible which is why i was leaning more towards the 12900k.,you are definitely right about having to upgrade the motherboard down the road as well.,i figured there would be fair amount of people still on the z690 platform or looking to make the same upgrade but stay ddr4 with their current ram so resale wouldnâ€™t be difficult.,i will definitely wait to see the raptor lake performance before i make a decision on my next move.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 13900k will not have a ddr4 memory controller.,ddr5 will likely be a must.,you can get 64gb of ddr5 ram for around \~480.,if you don't really need an upgrade ddr5 will be cheaper by am5 and raptorlakes launch (4-5 months).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"you realize that ""core i3"" encompasses probably 50 different cpus both laptop and desktop over the last 10 years, and that ""fast"" is a completely relative term with no way of even defining it?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends what you're asking?,"if we're talking about i3 12100/f and gaming, then yes, it's pretty good.","it beats almost every budget cpu from the past, while being priced around 100$.","if we're talking about other tasks/productivity, then probably not, cpus with more cores beat it in that situation.","but from a price to performance perspective, it can't really get better than this.",you can't even find the older budget alternatives for that price on the used market.,"so for a budget gaming focused build, it's pretty good.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"well, it depends - i3-2130 absolutely sucks, but i3-10300 is a very good cpu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's fast enough,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
really depends what i3 and what your definition of fast is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have the i3-10100f.,it's fast.,"it's better than my previous cpu, the 6 core ryzen 5 1600. modern quad cores with multithreading are amazing value for gaming.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
latest desktop i3's are too good for gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's an excessively broad question and could include quite old cpus.,the short answer is depends on use case and specifically which i3's you're referring to.,some will be fast for some use cases others woefully inadequate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the i3 is absolutely fine for my plex/file server but i wouldnâ€™t if i wanted a decent gaming rig.,not to say you canâ€™t game with it but iâ€™m going 6 cores for gaming.,if you tried to put anything better than a 3060 ti or 6700 youâ€™ll be cpu limited.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't think they need to.,the new p-core golden cove architecture is so good that it can make up for most core disadvantages and meet recent generation multithreaded performance with more cores.,"for example on the desktop side the 12100 (4c) vs 10400 (6c) or 3600x (6c), the 12100 ties in mt despite the lower core count while having much better st.

moving up to 6 cores would be equivalent die size of 4c+8c, and would be slightly less efficient and hotter.",it also means changing the lineup as the i3 is a cutdown part and not its own die.,"and with amd's atrocious budget lineup under $200, there is no pressure to make the i3 significantly better and zen 4 likely won't change that due to the rumored required ddr5 which obviously isn't budget friendly.","don't get me wrong, i'd prefer a 6 p-core i3, over the current 4 p-core but i don't see that happening until 2024.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ye i agree with you there, intel really has no pressure to do so with amds budget offerings not being very good.","however, the lack of cores do cause stuttering in games which could be noticeable, even though it has good mt performance compared to other 6 core cpus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"depends on what laptop it's in, but the 6800h should be much more powerful.","also, for gaming, the gpu makes more of a difference than the cpu (in most cases).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

none because of how powerful the igpu is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and no one answered my question yet
.",it's a simple question which intel cpu will u consider  a direct equivalent or near par performer for my ryzen 7 6800h laptop cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just now purchased a rog laptop with ryzen 6800h 3050 graphics sadly my country did not get alder lake cpu yet otherwise i would have got a i7 alderlake instead of ryzen 7 6 series,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're gonna need at least a 12700h or maybe a 12600h to compete with the 6800h,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your friend is stupid,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
eual to an i5-1250p probably.,"the 6800h has higher frequencies, but lower ipc.",probably equal single core performance as it balances out.,"it only has 4 powerful cores, and 8 weak ones.",overall it's multicore performance from the mix of 12 cores in total is probably equal to the 8 relatively strong amd cores.,"the amd one is more energy efficient, i'd guess.","it also has better integrated graphics, but that might not matter if it is attached to a dedicated gpu anyways.","it doesn't really matter, because you're almost always going to be limited by your graphics card.","on a laptop i'd prefer amd because the goal of a laptop is to be mobile, and have good battery life.",at least i know the higher end intel i7 suck back power.,maybe the i5 is equal.,"this entire thing between your friend and you sounds like an immature egotistical pissing contest, though.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
some say alder lake mobile cpus have a high non-core power usage (memory controller etc).,you might demolish his i5 in terms of battery life.,whether this is important to you is another thing though.,and as for performance somewhere around the 12500h/12650h should be close to your 6800h depending on what type of work is being compared i guess.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you literally can't even buy a ryzen 6800h without a dgpu right now, in fact i don't think a single 6000 series laptop is available with just the igp only.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if suppose people are asking this just because they are primarily going to use a discrete gpu and plugged in with power and the factors such as igpu and power efficiency is not a matter than which among them will you choose,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the issue is the answer is not so simple.,there are different kinds of performance categories.,"single thread performance: alderlake wins

multi thread performance: probably between a 12600h and 12700h (when using 45w or less which is the tdp of this chip).","if you push the power higher then of course the alderlake chips will perform better, but you are literally pushing into desktop levels of power consumption which is ridiculous and silly imo.",igpu: amds demolish intels (around 40-50% more performance).,this might not matter if you have a discrete gpu inside the laptop though.,performance efficiency and battery: amd wins here.,i would argue amds 6000 laptop series are better all-rounders and are better suited to actual laptops and ultraportables.,intel alderlake cpus seem to do well at higher power levels so they make for better chunky desktop replacement laptops.,im not dissing alderlake; i just am a bit disappointed in how the big.little arch design doesnt excel in the low power segments like i thought they would.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ok, so what's your point?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s not true.,12500h also beats it.,https://nanoreview.net/en/cpu-compare/intel-core-i5-12500h-vs-amd-ryzen-7-6800h.,but i agree with the sentiment that if your laptop does the job you want then thereâ€™s no reason to be upset even if itâ€™s not giving the best bang for the bucks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for making this clear,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">i just am a bit disappointed in how the big.little arch design does excel in the low power segments 

alder lake has way more than just cores.","its not necessary that sith low power is because of sith implementation of big.little

and it so happens that sith low power of alder lake is due to sith uncore

>i would argue amds 6000 laptop series are better all-rounders and are better suited to actual laptops and ultraportables.",intel alderlake cpus seem to do well at higher power levels so they make for better chunky desktop replacement laptops.,"actual laptops and ultraportables with alder lake have barely launched or reviewed but actual laptops with ryzen 6000 have already launched and reviewed

it is only natural that ryzen 6000 *looks* more suitable for actual laptops",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this 100%.,"i think big.little already has proved itself efficient in arm, and there's a lot of room for growth for intel in the future, but this generation is not great for lower power parts and battery life.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my point is whether i made a mistake by buying ryzen 7 6800h i feel terrible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's just in single core though.,"when i buy a system, i buy it assuming i'll be doing things other than gaming on it too.","given a choice, i'd go for the higher core count system even if it costs 20 to 30% more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">actual laptops and ultraportables with alder lake have barely launched or reviewed but actual laptops with ryzen 6000 have already launched and reviewed


you make a good point.",i am extrapolating based on power efficiency of big and little cores.,when the current alderlake mobile cpus are given less power their performance drops to below amds.,the performance power scaling with intel is steeper which doesn't bode well for performance in low power envelopes.,"if you cut down the performance cores, your performance drops and those performance cores are power hungry so you have to drop some of them to get the tdp low.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yep.,nothing to worry about.,"the problem with a lot of those websites is they show cpu comparisons based on very specific workloads, which sometimes favor a vendor of one cpu over another.",an example is stuff like geekbench comparing the apple m1 against an intel 12th gen cpu.,"they're both very good cpus, but the m1 absolutely sucks at certain workloads that intel breezes through.","but the m1 is more power efficient and makes less heat, so it's less prone to thermal throttling... things to consider.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
70s is fine under load,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
90c sometimes is just fine.,don't worry.,your cpu throttles if it's too warm.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"perfectly fine, 95+ is when you should worry",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fine.,my 9700k runs anywhere between 50-75c most of the time and hasnâ€™t missed a beat since july â€˜19 with 1.38v pumped to it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think it's ok, k cpus run pretty warm with a little overclock",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""70c is fine""

""90c is sometimes fine""

let me give you a real answer.",modern intel cpus are good until 100c.,anything below that (including 99c) is within operating spec.,"once you hit 100c, then the cpu will begin to throttle (lower clocks) to compensate.","until then, it's perfectly fine.",[here is a small faq direct from intel concerning temps](https://www.intel.ca/content/www/ca/en/support/articles/000005597/processors.html).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
me chillin with 80 degrees on intel core i7 3th gen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is fine but if you have those temperatures not under load then you should probably look into it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
who scammed you ?,or did you pay <100$ for it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this.,"unless you're operating out of spec (over default voltage to get an overclock), in which case you generally don't want to stray above 80-90 to ensure the lifetime of the silicon.",100'c limit is geared *exactly* to stock intel spec.,"some silicon is perfectly happy upwards of 105 or 110 c, too, but that was more back in the 45nm days.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this.,"i've been abusing my 8700k for 4 years now, 1.45v for 5ghz to be stable, temps under load constantly between 80 and 98c, depending on ambient temperature, still runs like on the first day.","i put zero stock in what the temperature alarmists on this stock say, cpu takes care of itself when it gets too hot.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"a couple of racks already went to the doe for borealis, so the parts work, just a question of how long it takes intel to produce the quantity aurora needs.",him leaving for samsung suggests they've done all they can and are just waiting on their fabs/tsmc to produce the chips.,i doubt they'd drop their partnerships considering they just fine intel more money every time they're late so there's not much incentive to drop them.,if they're late again intel will end up giving them aurora for free.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

for browsing nd trading you can even get 12400 all three will offer simile performance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they are both overkill for your use case, but if you have no budget, get a 12900k lol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's hard to see what an i9-12900k would offer you for $200 over the i7-12700k.,it has 4 more 'efficient' cores which are intended to do low-level non critical tasks.,"the i7 has 8 performance + 4 efficient cores, the i9 is 8+8

the i9 has a small amount more l3 cache, fast memory that assists performance, but the i7 isn't shy either.",the i9 has slightly higher boost clocks.,a couple of percent.,"the i9 uses way more power, is harder to cool.","overall, there's very little the i7 doesn't excel at, the i9 is for bragging rights, true all core workloads (honestly pretty rare) and people who just have to have 'the best.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i can't comment on what is best for the trading use case as i'm not super familiar with those programs but just some food for thought here: hold off on buying anything new right now.,"intel is supposed to launch it's new generation of cpu's in q3 and from reports the 13700 is going to be on par with the 12900. if you can wait that long, you can get same/better performance for less.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"right, depending on how many mt4/5 termjnals you'll be running.","reckon you need an upgrade to 32gb ram as a minimum, or even 64gb?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hope so, as i often used >30gb on my machine.",good luck!,:),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got a i9-12900k because i went with a prebuilt this time around.,"it runs hot, undervolted it .07 and it's definitely cooler now but still runs 10-15c higher than any other cpu i have owned.",just gaming it will chill around 67-75c.,it is complete overkill for what i normally do (game/stream) and i don't think i have pushed it past 45% usage outside of benching.,you definitely do not need this thing.,"i would go i7, and i probably should have too :p",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12400f or even 12100f is enough for trading.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"won't make much of a difference for you, both have much more performance then you need and will last a long time.",i7 will run cooler and quieter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12900k is over kill for most things but you will need to upgrade other parts of your computer before that the 12900k is out of date.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"never buy dell (worst quality and thermals)

and you can do trading with and modern cpu even the very low end stuff",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for someone invested in â€˜tradingâ€™ you donâ€™t seem to handle your money well...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can even use 12100 or g7400.,it really doesn't matter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
im more concerned about the heating issues on the dell and i mean if i can save money then i will use the money towards other stuff lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wrong.,the 4 efficient cores are efficient at multithreaded workloads.,they make efficient use of die space and thermal headroom being clocked lower.,they aren't intended for low-level tasks.,they surely can keep the cpu running small tasks but their real muscle is adding more multhithreaded performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i agree that the i7 is likely more than adequate, but assuming identical workload/performance, the 12900k is no hotter or more difficult to cool than the 12700k.",but if you actually use the additional performance offered by the 12900k (ie.,"allow it to do more), then it starts using more power and producing more heat, and in that case itâ€™s not a waste.","still, i think the op would be served well by even the 12700 (non-k) or 12600k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

at dell i can get i9 same price as the i7 thats why i was looking at the i9 and thought it would make sense to get the i9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

would the 1tb sdd be much of a difference to 512gb would it make the computer slower",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
im sort of questioning the i9 now as it runs hot and i think i7 would be enough i9 could possibly be overkill i just want a fast snappy computer with no problems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
will the i7 12700k with 3060 graphics card be able to handle 2 4k monitors comfortably ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok thanks for that thats my main concern dont want to buy a stack and it runs hot and is loud just want a fast snappy computer that will last for years to come,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"99% of people have said go for the i7 which is good to know as can save around â£400 and use that money for some 4k monitors so its a win win 

i just thought with the i9 being the most powerful on the market it would be the better option for little bit more money but by the sounds of things there is minimal performance upgrade on the i9",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh i do lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so you do have a budget!,"yes go for an i7, even that is overkill for what youâ€™re doing but will last you a long time and be a good performer for the next few years!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well they're not intended for critical threads either since you want to bring the p cores to bear on those.,"the scheduler sends anything important to the p cores, is my point.",i'm not wrong to state the i9 offers little to op over the i7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> but assuming identical workload/performance, the 12900k is no hotter or more difficult to cool than the 12700k

sure,  but this also indicates that you're not doing anything that necessitated the i9 in the first place!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the i7-12700 would be overkill/ideal for you.,in fact even an i5-12400 would be awesome.,"i've got most of these cpus, in 'normal' use there's just no perceptible difference to how snappy the pc feels.","i'd place a solid bet that you'd fail a blind test (or even metrics like responsiveness or speed of applications opening) between an i5 and an i9, given 32gb of ram and a decent ssd.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"dont buy hp, chances are you'll have horrible software or other issues.",dells are alright.,wanna just put your own together?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the power draw isnâ€™t worth the performance gained imo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"same here, no gaming but heavy desktop exercises.","i have moved from mt4 to mt5 last year, 64 vs 32-bit program as well as far superior ea backtest capability.","often struggled downloading long historical data from mt4 server, rarely happen on mt5.","as mt4/5 backtests use only single-core (whilst optimisations use multi), i9-12900k i think this is now worth upgrading as it has finally achieved roughly doubled single-core performance than i7-5930k (after 7 years, good job intel...).",i'm now sourcing the component for such upgrade (and from 48gb to 128gb ddr4) and i'm expecting the each backtest will take 30-50% time shorter?,"also pay attention to graphics card if you are using multiple monitors, i'm using 3 monitors but then needed to overclock my rx570 to prevent screen flashing!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have a nvme 1tb ssd, no need for hdd.","the size of the ssd has zero impact on the speed of the computer, it is how much it can store.",a nvme ssd however will actually read/write faster than a normal ssd.,they are becoming the norm nowadays.,"no offense but considering you don't know if the size of a drive affects the pc speed, you **definitely** would never notice the difference between a i9 and i7.",it really is an enthusiast chip for people doing crazy things with it.,if you are mostly web browsing or gaming getting an i9 is pretty much just accepting more heat for zero to a incredibly small fraction of performance increase (none in terms of web browsing).,not to mention it also is just more expensive and is paired better with more expensive cooling.,a good analogy is you are essentially driving a lamborghini down a 30mph road to get milk at the store.,the i7 is a luxury 75k sports car that will do the same thing and more never breaking a sweat.,"the money would be infinitely better spent on getting a good high resolution 1440p ips monitor for the web browsing, more comfortable chair, monitor mounts, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes ofc, (12600k should be enough ) .",even though you use 2 4k monitors there isn't a huge graphically intensive task.,"also if you're planning to open multiple browsers tabs and all , get a good amount of ram.",also i read the other comments and found that you're planning to buy pre-built.,"my suggestion is , even if you don't know building , try building from a good shop or someone who knows.","pre-builts can have poor airflow , bad psu , cheap mobo etc .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean who doesnâ€™t want to save money haha just want the right computer that will last for years,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, but my point was if you actually get to the point of the i9 being hotter and using more power, then you are actually making use of it, and thus the i7 would not have been a better choice.","i was just clarifying that itâ€™s not like the i7 is somehow more power efficient or runs cooler when doing the same workload, as can happen between different cpu architectures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for this i was just curious as to what the differences are as i9 is only a little bit more expensive out of them links what one would you choose?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i literally know nothing about building pcs unfortunately i wouldnt even know where to start hence why im going down the pre built route,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah i know pal no offence taken haha i have decided to go with the i7 it makes more sense i thought the sdd made the comp a bit faster,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
im looking at 16gb by the sounds of things a pre built is more than enough for what i need if i need to upgrade i can buy parts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no chance in second guessing if you get the 12900k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4 extra e-cores in the 12900k aren't going to mean a damn thing re: future proofing.,edit: also the silicon lottery is at play in either case.,"my mildly oc'd 12700k has better single core performance than many similarly oc'd 12900k's, but that's just luck of the draw.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah agreed.,"my initial point was just that an i9 prompts a spiral of cooling requirements, psu spec, etc to get 'the best' of it that mean it's not a 'cheap' upgrade over the i7.","given op is looking at pre builts, i doubt they'd every actually get to experience the capability of an i9 outside of whatever restraints dell/hp put them under to get them working on whatever motherboard and cooler the sandwich them between anyway.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
literally none of them.,"they use cheap motherboards that actually do throttle cpus, as well as inadequate cpu cooling and are otherwise poorly specified for your needs.","you don't need a gpu, the cpu can do that.","this would out perform them, can run 4 monitors off of the motherboard, and is half the price.",jsut don't try and game on it!,"(unless you add a graphics card, in which case it will also be very good at gaming).","basically, i think you should look for a strongish cpu (i5 would be fine but lets get you an i7), 32gb ram, 1tb ssd (hdd's only for long term slow storage of media, for example), and a capable supporting component list.",only get a gpu if you plan on gaming on this pc.,"[pcpartpicker part list](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/list/jv9zwc)

i just went from 2666 to 3600 after upgrading to an i5-12600 and it made quite a bit of difference.,ddr5 is pretty pricey at the moment and to be honest if you're just gaming 16gb will probably still do you for a while yet.,if you still want to go to 32gb prices seem to be coming down.....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">there is basically no practical observable difference between the two

that is incorrect; the 4000 cl16 kit should have measurably higher bandwidth at xmp.",">3600@c14 (7.7ns) is actually slightly lower latency than 4000@c16 (8ns)

you mean lower first-word latency.","we can do the same calculation for each kit's four primary timings to see a bigger picture:

|speed|tcl|trcd|trp|tras|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|3600 mt/s|14 (7.78 ns)|15 (8.33 ns)|15 (8.33 ns)|35 (19.44 ns)|
|4000 mt/s|16 (8 ns, +3%)|16 (8 ns, -4%)|16 (8 ns, -4%)|36 (18 ns -7%)|

>3600@c14 will give better theoretical performance

these calculations are only estimations of latency, while real-world performance relies not only on latency but also on bandwidth.","with such close calculated primary latencies, the 4000 cl16 kit will likely have better real-world performance at xmp due to its greater bandwidth.",">ram is one of those thing people massively overthink

i had the same overheating issue with my 12700k and the lf 360. i swapped out the cooler with the msi s360 and temps dropped from 97c to 75c in cinebench r23.,i think arctic aioâ€™s have issues cooling when the cpu is bent.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most of the bending issues i have heard about were from using 115x mounting hardware instead of proper 1700 mounts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

also use r23 as your bench.,r20 is outdated and will give you different scores,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1.38v isn't that high but tbh undervolting is the way to go.,the 12900k doesn't need that much voltage.,it just creates unnecessary heat that causes early thermal throttling.,"i mean in his case, 88c on the e cores?",that's crazy man,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i mean my temps still average all mid to high 90s range during the run.,i unfortunately don't have an rog asus board so i don't know my sp.,wanted to get one but was sold out so i settled for their tuf board.,i did have an inkling that my piece was pretty decent given i easily beat most benchmarks posted by a lot review places without trying too hard.,always wondered why those sites usually averaged 26-27k even when overclocked.,"i am however, not very technically skilled with tweaking all the settings so can really extract the max out of it.",plus i'm on air and pretty much hit the limit in terms of temps.,i literally just put the core voltage in adaptive and gave it a 0.9 negative offset and changed the multiplier.,obviously with xmp enabled but besides that nothing else changed with regards to tweaking.,what's your score?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"not sure what motherboard you have...   with my asus board it asks when you enable xmp, would you like to ""enhanced system performance"" with xmp?","if you answer yes it changes a bunch of settings behind the scenes bumping up voltage, setting all cores to boost to the same frequency, setting all power limits to maximum and a few other changes.",the thing that is annoying it doesn't really show what settings it changes as everything is on auto.,if you answer no it leaves everything to the intel defaults and only enables xmp.,you'll sometimes need to increase vccsa & vccio voltages when you turn on xmp though if using intel defaults.,"\------

it's been recommended since probably 9th or 10th gen intel to not turn on those ""enhanced system performance"" settings from asus or other vendors.",on my maximus x hero board and 9900k if i turn that on it will raise my cpu voltage to 1.42v everything else left on auto.,the stock voltage for my cpu without that feature enabled is 1.18v.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yup, intel basically said it shouldn't cause *enough* of an issue to affect cooling in any *significant* way but it's enough of an issue that quite a few companies are coming out with different accessories to assist with it, and i've seen people having quite a bit of difference in cooling just by adding one of these accessories to eliminate the bending and no other changes to the system.",https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-comments-on-alder-lakes-warping-and-bending-issues-mods-void-warranty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that's not the flex that you think it is.,a properly configured 12900k won't even get into the 60s during gaming.,amd redlined the 5800x so hard that manually limiting ppt/edc/tdc can actually increase performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ok, so would you say it'd be a good idea for me to remount my cooler and put a bit more thermal paste on?","i already changed my thermal paste from the one included into the cooler to thermal grizzly kyronaut, but i didn't use really much...the temps decreased slightly by up to 5 â°c but not more.",or should i change from the air cooler (bequiet dark rock pro 4) to an aio?,i have a 12700k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

better.,are the aio pump and fan speeds at max?,if not then make it so that they run at max above 70c or so.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you did offset too?,"this was better, youâ€™re almost there to under 80c",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
true.,"but regardless in ops case, i think for the average person, 1.38v is unnecesarily high.",hes clearly throttling at that voltage and overheating,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thats not solder,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"late question, is that -7 mv or -70mv?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well what sort of temps are you having under load?,there's no point in messing with your system if you're not having high temps or thermal throttling or anything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is your processor idling at really high temps as well or is it only when youre benchmarking?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
max is a bit too loud for me.,they ramp up to full speed when it reached 88c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
didn't do the offset yet.,how would i go on about doing it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
btw bomb ass scores.,are you doing throttle testing or 10 min stress test,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"\-70mv, now running -150mv which has been much better temp wise and stable so far, no performance issues.",i'm assuming semitope was referring to -150mv and not -15mv...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

iâ€™ve seen crazier things than high temps on the 12 gen lineup.,offsets lower the voltage and give peak temperatures on load if the hardware cannot cool itself efficiently.,"iâ€™ve seen $400 motherboards pull 5.3 all p core, and 4.2 all e core.",the idea of it just being a bent socket is a good way to deflect the fact that 12th gen runs really hot as it is.,i see those temps slowly climbing down on his end.,and that will still lead to optimal performance so he can keep his pc much longer.,ðÿ¤·â€â™€ï¸,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i originally used my first gen h150i with an lga 1200 mount and got terrible temps.,"same after using their 1700 mount, although it turns out it wasn't actually the official asetek 1700 mount.","anyways, i ended up getting the ryujin ii 360 with the official asetek 1700 mount and got like a 50c+ drop in temps.",i went from thermal throttling at 100c when running karhu ram test to running at 50c.,having an incompatible aio and mount is murder on these chips.,have you seen if anyone else with that cooler is having issues?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i read some comments about cpu fan orientation but for i5 12400f it does not really matter.,noctua redux cooler is anyway too powerful for i5 12400f and temps will be great either way.,you might want to change cpu fan orientation if you decide to upgrade cpu to i7 in future,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah true,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its pretty bad as it creates a lil negative pressure at the bottom of the case which sucks in dirt from the floor where there's no filter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's interesting actually,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"like the other guy said when there's moving air, heat rises is null.",the issue with this is you're actually pulling hot air from the gpu instead of cool air.,"if you're saying your top fan will pull the cool air from the front before reaching the cpu cooler, it really depends on the afm and pressure between the cpu cooler fan and top fan.","the cpu with higher afm and pressure will ""win"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"see that makes sense, but i'm not used to people orienting the fans that way.","lol usually they'll have the fans going through the front, top, and out the back sense the top and front can get the most fresh cool air most of the time.",or the side for those who want a leg warmer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thats bad unless you want to upgrade down the line.,"for the 65 watt cpus, the motherboard is irelevant almost.",the board you have now would be better paired with a 12700 or 12700k or if it will work with raptor lake a 13700 or 13700k something like that.,"it is a great board, but overkill for a 65 watt cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"this is purely for aesthetics, seeing as the cooler is more than enough for this cpu in any orientation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on the case.,my case has filters on the bottom as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"personally, while â€œhot air does riseâ€, iâ€™m not sure this is as good thermally.","the fanâ€™s intake is like an inch away from the gpu, so itâ€™s dealing with trying to get air through/around that, and what air it does get seems like it would be pre-heated by the gpu much more directly than when in the normal orientation.","on the other hand, perhaps gpu temperatures are improved?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"gotchya, i'll keep an eye on my temps.",i don't mind gpu air going into my cooler as long as the cpu doesn't get too toasty.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not sure why it would look any better sideways lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah that makes perfect sense to me, may need to let the op know that",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is a fair point and i thought about that.,"it might make a little difference in cpu cooling to have air going side to side, but overall it is leaps and bounds better than the stock cooler as it is.",extra gpu cooling might be nice when the summer hits lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

chipsets already have a core inside but much more primitive and in intel's case it's using a very tiny arm core.",isa compatibility with using an atom will will help here.,i also know there's no reason for intel to be so far behind in battery life.,it's all about managing power anyways.,one thing is that they have an on-package chipset while arm devices and even amd has on-die for mobile.,that's why the ryzen 6000 is starting to do better now.,with foveros they can effectively emulate this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

let me better explain.,i think it would be more helpful to you if you have better understanding of how it works.,11th and 12th gen intel processor's have a memory controller that runs at 1600 mhz.,"this controller is, essentially, what talks and controls your memory.",ddr memory is double data rate.,you take the base speed and double it.,"so 3200 mhz ddr4 is in reality 1600. so a 3200 ddr4 kit is perfectly in sync with and in specification with the officially supported intel speed of 1600. if you run a 3600 kit at xmp, you are asking the processor's memory controller to run at 1800.

this is why it is an overclock.","there's some more to it, but that's the essentials.","regarding cl's, that's a whole other thing to get into lol.",hope that helps!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you couldn't be so wrong.,the 5800x3d mops the floor with tenth gen... not even a comparison especially if you rock a high-end gpu.,the 12600k actually destroys any tenth gen out there in gaming and yes including the 10900k.,"if you are happy with the performance of your tenth gen, good for you but anyone with high-end gpu and interested in high frame rate gaming would definitely be looking at upgrading.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

saying the 12600k destroys the 10900k is a bit of a stretch.,"if you run a 10900k with its max overclock and the fastest ram kit it is stable with vs a 12600k with the best oc and ram kit it can support, the 10900k wins more than it loses.",it also highly depends on the games you play as some games like warzone the 12600k really doesn't stack up to the 10900k in terms of minimum framerate when you push each configuration as far as it can go.,"even if you compare them with a basic 3200mhz cl16 ram kit and no overclock the 10900k still wins in some games, and it's pretty close overall in most others.",there are outliers where the 12th gen does mop the floor with a stock 10900k across the board but that's not true of most games.,"you probably couldn't tell in a blind test which cpu you were playing on between 10900k and 12600k unless you were playing a game like warzone where the min fps is higher on the 10900k or one of the games where the 12600k actually does pull very far ahead like far cry 6.  

the i7 12700k is where the difference really starts to show, as you need to have a max oc and high end ram kit with tuned subtimings 10900k setup just to compete with the stock 12700k and a basic ram kit.","even then, the difference is small enough that it's more like a sidegrade for most use cases as far as gaming goes.","the only real upgrade path right now for somebody that bought a 10900k, the fastest ram kit they could get and overclocked it all is to go to the 12900k.",i'd pick a 12600k over a 10700k or any 11th gen cpu but people that already have a 10900k setup probably shouldn't switch to anything less than the 12900k as the 10900k still offers a premium gaming experience.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have no idea what ryzen has to do with anything.,the debate is between whether or not ddr4 or ddr5 is better on 12th gen intel and i provided evidence that if you push ddr4 as far as it goes it performs equal to ddr5 7000.  you haven't shown me anything so far that convinces me that the evidence i provided is incorrect.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'd encourage you to pay the extra to get a decent kit of b die and take the time to tune it.,generally you wont see much difference between xmp kits unless you're comparing a really cheap kit to a very expensive kit.,patriot viper steels are pretty good.,4400 cl 19 are around 90gbp.,"if you have no plans to manually tune it, it doesn't really matter otherwise.","id go with the 3600 memory, you wont really find a huge difference.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'd recommend going for ddr4 at 3600mhz, any low cl such as 14 or 16, i got a 12700kf and 16x2 sticks of adata 5200mhz ram cl 38 and it was working properly only on stock (around 4600mhz), with the xmp profile enabled i would reach the 5200mhz but i was getting bsod over and over again, i tested every component without luck, but finally i managed to fix it after cranking up the ram voltage from 1.25v (stock) to 1.35v, so this means that ddr5 is still pretty raw and i would not recommend unless you are okay with modifying things on the bios.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would save another ~â‚¬50-80 and buy something in the 4000 mhz range if you plan to stick with ddr4 and 2x 16 gb if youâ€™re mobo only has two dimms.,if it has 4 though ignore getting more capacity now and look for much higher speeds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

is it better to run 4x8gb or 2x16gb for 32gb of ram on alder lake?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i would go for the second one

idk if that is a typo or not but the first one says 8x2gb.","only really high end motherboards even support 8 ram slots, the second one will work on almost all ddr4 motherboards and the difference between them is not noticeable in most cases.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why not ddr5?,jc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got crucial ballistix 3600 c16 for my 12700k.,the memory was good.,at standard xmp profile temps were good too.,but i ended up returning it and corsair 3200 c16.,the rgb soft sucks on crucial.,itâ€™s very difficult to work with.,i have 32gb total ram using 4 sticks.,as far as overclocking goes if you are not planning to do it and would like to save money go for 3200 c16.,there isnâ€™t much difference between the two frequency especially when it comes to gaming.,besides intel suggested frequency is 3200mhz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
second one probably,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
go for a 16gb as cheap as possible.,dont buy from wish or amazon.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i built a new computer this week.,i7 12700k with 2x16gb ripjaws cl-16 3600 mhz and haven't had any problems!,i am overclocking the ram so it actually is 3600 mhz speed and not the factory default 2133 mhz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm building a 12700k itx pc this weekend and i decided on sanding b die.,the hp v10 rgb 3200 mhz cl14 was the cheapest i could find over the last two weeks.,"it was $200 for 2x16 gb, which is only ~$10 more than the non b die 3200, cl14 / 3600, cl16.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for 12th gen intel buy ddr5 ram .,i personally recommend cosair vengeance ddr5 4800mhz memory,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is patriot viper any good though?,especially for 12700k itâ€™s only till i can afford a much better 32gb kit later on,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ive been running 3200 on my 12400. does that cause issues?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
should i go for them?,over ballistix itâ€™s only till i get a better 32gb kit or do you think thatâ€™s stupid not to wait because iâ€™ve only â£60 just now maybe â£80 so i wouldnâ€™t be able to get 32gb just now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
typo it says 16gb before it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
should i go for cl16 3200mhz or 3600mhz cl18,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i only have the choices above till i get a 32gb kit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m only looking for 16gb 3200mhz or 3600mhz for gaming and streaming until i get a better 3600mhz cl16 32gb kit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™m not using ddr5, but yeah thanks i have no idea what to go for",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
getting 16gb and upgrading to 32gb later on will probs be getting 3600mhz cl16 32gb later not got the money for anything expensive just now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™ve got everything, just need ram",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tomahawk,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s cl18 the ballistix is 3200mhz cl16,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah heard a lot about this being unstable and as iâ€™ve said these are my two options above till i get 32gb not spending lots of money 16gb when iâ€™m going to get 2x16gb eventually,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as iâ€™ve said idk if itâ€™s not coming up on my post, only these are the options till i get a 32gb kit",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2x16gb or 4 i think doesnâ€™t really matter think itâ€™s better with 2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
okay thanks iâ€™m thinking going for the same ones but cl16 for â£25 more but totally unsure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
guess,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah iâ€™m not really bothered about rgb the now but iâ€™m sure itâ€™ll still look great and i was going to get 3600mhz cl16 but unsure if i can get it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah i am already, but thatâ€™s not what iâ€™m asking",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah im wanting to get the same but idk if i can i might have to go with 3200mhz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"drr5 is pointless right now, will upgrade in a year or two i already have my ddr4 board and iâ€™ve ordered 3200mhz 16gb until i get 32gb 3600mhz or more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sorry i shouldâ€™ve clarified iâ€™m only able to get 16gb for now until i have money to get a good 32gb kit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
doesnâ€™t cause issues but thereâ€™s been a shift to faster memory for the recent cpu generations.,faster memory has gotten significantly cheaper these past few years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you aren't missing that much because non-k alder lake can't guarantee anything over 3466 in gear 1 (memory controller voltage is locked to circa 0.95v),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would get them over the crucial.,micron e-die most likely.,"they overclock fine, but you'll probably get tighter timings on the viper ram.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ball out homie.,get them new joints.,ddr5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8x2 is still 16 so idk man it might be 8 2gb sticks lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3600 cl18.,similar effective* latencies but more bandwidth in this case.,"edit*
you can check the ram latency chart to see the actual numbers.",just search on the web.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 3600 is a lot better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if youâ€™re on a budget, that is a good speed and latency, no doubt.",only thing is that alder lake can take advantage of super fast transfer speeds (mhz) and is why you should consider getting a really nice bin of ddr4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
g.skill ripjaws v 32 gb (2 x 16 gb) ddr4-4000 cl18 memory is 140.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

16gb is fine.,"they arent unstable, people just don't know how to tune memory.","they are single rank, you can always buy a second kit down the road.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

oh.,then get 2x8 now.,and then put another 2x8 kit from the same manufacturer.,patriots should be good.,ballistix are great.,very good ram.,if you're budget is more limited try vengeance lpxs.,they're really cheap in my country.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if youâ€™re replacing it in the future why are you even debating?,buy the cheapest of the two you can,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mad a mistake the vipers are c18 and the crucial is c16 3200mhz but i was reading base timings instead of latency,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
already have ddr4 motherboard and no point going ddr5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah lol but shows a picture of two sticks and 16gb,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but 3200mhz is cl16,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i will be when i have the money for a 32gb 3600mhz cl16 kit but for now for a while itâ€™s out they two options,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
will look eventually shoukd i go for 4000 or 3600mhz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah iâ€™ve tried but as i said these my only two options till i get better 32gb kit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah no thanks, thank you though",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah most people are saying 3200mhz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™ll be replacing my 16gb with 2x16gb sticks eventually, so 3200mhz cl16 over 3600mhz cl18 for a 12700k?",iâ€™m also wanting to use xmp,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the ballistix is 3200mhz cl16 and the other is 3600mhz cl18,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for which one is better out the two,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cl18 is likely to be hynix hjr.,you might get lucky and get djr.,cjr is on par with micron e-die.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
those are just two out of 8 sticks.,they just didnâ€™t have enough room to show them all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah so?,just see for yourself.,actual effective timing is same but more bandwidth.,[ram latency chart](https://eu-browse.startpage.com/av/anon-image?piurl=https%3a%2f%2fwww.cgdirector.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2fmedia%2f2022%2f02%2fram-latency-table.jpg&sp=1650665550ta84eaecdc426151f06972d8beb79c9f06183eaf4c9da09d355d088e3e4807fc6),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thing is you could get a 4266 mhz cl 18 2x 16gb (32gb) kit for like $130 so ~â£100.,maybe availability is another constraint iâ€™m unaware of.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
some people are just immune to good advice.,why even go the 690 route if you cant even afford ram.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because you may successfully overclock it to 3600 cl16 with 3200mhz cl16 ram.,i'm lucky to do that:-),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they should be the same in performance.,but if they're at the same price go for the 3600mhz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
unsure whether to get the cl16 3200mhx or cl18 patriots or wait and get 32gb but that means having no pc for a long period of time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s 16gb itâ€™s typo description says 2x8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"whatâ€™s better for gaming and maybe some streaming 12700k, z690",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah but these options is all i have the now till i get a better 32gb 3600mhz cl16 or more kit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its not really good advice when i can get better 32gb kit later on and iâ€™ve saw most of the reviews to that is problems or unstableðÿ˜¹ and itâ€™s ddr4 and i was supposed to get 32gb off my mate plus you donâ€™t have to spend tonnes on ram thatâ€™s just stupid also as i said for 10000th time iâ€™m getting a better 32gb kit eventually,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
will this not cause things to be unstable or cause issues with any parts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, but apparently can overclock 3200 cl16 to 3600 cl16 and the price is â£3 difference, unless i get 25 more and get 3600mhz cl16 ballitstix",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you are just wanting to set xmp and forget about it then get the ballistix.,every set i've had has been stable and oc-able for the past 20 years.,the only down side is that they stopped manufacturing ram this year so getting rma support might be a pain.,i personally have a set of the ballistix max in my rig and i put a set of ballistix elite in my son's.,"no issues, but i haven't overclocked my rigs for a while now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"maybe itâ€™s not though, could you send them to my house so i can check it out?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh ok sorry, my bad.",just am confused why thatâ€™s the case but prob me being dumb.,"bottom line those two options are good, but def prefer 3600 option to the 3200",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
32gb isn't better.,idk why you keep saying a 3600mhz 32gb kit with trash timings is going to outperform a 4400 kit that can literally push 3600mhz with much tighter timings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it might.,many have success ocing the ballistix 3200 cl16 to 3600 but not me.,it's unstable and causing bsod when i stress test it or play city skylines.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 so what should i get the patriot sare cl18 thoigh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you paying ðÿ¤£,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"itâ€™s because i donâ€™t have the money to be spending under â£200 on a 32gb kit just now and yeah people are saying 3200mhz, cl 16 the 3600mhz is cl18",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so youâ€™re telling me 32gb cl16 3600mhz gskill trident kit isnâ€™t better?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah iâ€™m unsure what to get then,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[removed],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i guess it just depends if you want to oc it then.,you prob could get the 3200 mhz kit to run at 3600 and at better timings but itâ€™s not guaranteed.,idk what your use case is but youâ€™re likely to see little difference between the two kits tbh.,most programs favor speed to latency though so unless you have a specific use case would keep that in mind.,*from experience micron rev e is very easy to oc just make sure thatâ€™s what youâ€™re getting if you go with the 3200 mhz kit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you are talking about the 16-19-19-19-39 kit then absolutely they are not better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i got them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not overclocking, just running what theyâ€™re at",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i donâ€™t know why iâ€™m even trying to go back and forth with you i said multiple times, these are my two options for now, thanks",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you asking which processor is most suited or which gpu is?,"for straight power, 12980hk and 3080ti.","however, 12700h has the same core and thread count so performs very similarly.",the 11800h and 5800h or 6900hs aren't bad options either.,gpu wise the 6800m is between the 3070 and 3080 and in my market it's cheaper than 3070 so imo could be worth it.,however while it loses in rasterisation nvidia does have advantages.,"if you want ray tracing, go nvidia.",if you want better image up scaling now instead of in a few months (dlss vs fsr 2) go nvidia.,if you want better 'work' support with cuda go nvidia.,nvidia also typically performs better in unreal titles or older titles like dx9.,the new cards are coming probably after christmas so you would still have to wait a while - it's up to you to decide with what deals you can find and what you value.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok 3060 and i712700h should be good enough as i prefer 1080p gaming and i love playing older titles which i missed out in the last 15 years so 3060 saves me money and 12700h future proofs a bit my laptop,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"3600c16 will be a little faster than that, and ddr5 would be faster than that.",if i were you i'd just get the 13900k or 13700k whenever those come out in a few months and upgrade to ddr5.,should be cheaper by then.,if you get the 12900k and use that memory you are going to get performance that's slower than a 12700k with ddr5 tbh.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah but find a good motherboard that is stable with 4000mhz especially on alder lake,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's not as drastic as that for average fps.,"https://www.techspot.com/article/2402-intel-alder-lake-memory-scaling/

if i were op i'd just bring his existing kit over.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so say we all!,but unfortunately op seems to have a bad case of upgrade itch.,"\^\^

if it has to be intel, i'd wait for 13th gen because they'll be using the same lga 1700 socket.",hopefully by then ddr5 and ddr5 mobos have not only matured a bit and but are also cheaper.,"the gaming performance uplift is estimated to be 10-15% and multi threated programs 15-25% or more compared to 12th gen. well worth a wait this close, if you ask me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so what rams then?,all above 3200 mhz ddr4 is overclock and not guaranteed to work with 12900k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"msi pro-a

the key is to use one stick of single rank per channel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the official spec is 3200 but anything below 4000 is nearly guranteed to work with intel chips.,4000 and higher is kind of iffy and may require manual tuning.,3600c16 is the sweet spot because it's fast and also widely available for a reasonable price.,but you're only gonna get like 2-5% more performance  compared to what you have,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so buy 3600c16 or stay with current 3200c16?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just wait for a 13900k and then get ddr5.,or if you are buying the 12900k no matter what then buy ddr5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

depends on the b660 board.,"https://youtu.be/r3o1ebk_jca?t=1001

"low end z690 boards cost about the same as b660 boards

absolutely silly choice to pair the top end unlocked i9 with a non overclocking board",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you should probably balance your budget better between the cpu and system board.,pairing an unlocked core i9-12900k with a non-oc capable board and weaker chipset will nerf the processor.,for a similar amount of money a 12700k and a good z690 board would be a more powerful combo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it can but i wouldn't recommend
12900k is an unlocked cou, pairing it with a locked motherboard wouldn't make sense, if you don't want to overclock then i wouldn't get a k series",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what is the purpose of that build?,i assume you want to do that bucause you are tight on the budget.,"if you have budget limitation, buying a b660 mb that won't make 12900k throttling and has good powe delivery would cost you as much as some of respectable z690s like gigabyte z690 ud.","so even if you have budget limitation, there are better ulternatives.","if you are so tight on the budget that cant even afford a decent b660, then buying something like 12900k is wrong, because not only you won't take full advantage of that cpu because of weak vrms, you may also shorten the life span of that mb considerably by pairing it with something it hasn't been made for.",in that situation i would suggest a decent b660 like msi pro b660m-a wich has very good vrms and can handle up to i7s easily and pair it with 12700f.,"it would cost you alot less, and will be fully stable for full workloads.",in gaming you probably won't notice a thing unless you want to run the games at 720p with 3090ti tier cards just for benchmarking.,"and if productivity is the purpose of this build, honestly again i would suggest the same combo unless you can expand your budget and get a quality z690.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i disagree only because i'm guessing op is not overclocking therefore don't waste your time with any k chips.,"just get a regular 126, 127, or 12900 and pair with appropriate board.",waste of money getting the k if you're not tweaking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,"12700f would be my recommendation for gaming, if not gaming then 12900 could work.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
honestly getting a 12600k with a b660 isnâ€™t so bad.,donâ€™t even know why intel released the 12600 without the extra e-cores.,itâ€™s literally a 12400 clocked higher,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's more than likely a vbios and/or motherboard bios incompatibility than anything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'm not saying you need to update the bios... i'm saying that asus likely needs to provide an update to fix this.,updating the bios won't fix shit if the bios has an incompatibility that isn't fixed.,if the 1080 ti works in another system then it isn't the 1080 ti.,if a 1070 ti works in the current system then it isn't the cpu or a physical issue with the motherboard.,at that point it's pretty easy to determine it's probably an issue with the bios that needs fixed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"pretty much the plan, rmaing it so i can give away the return to a friend or something, was thinking about getting the corsair icue h115i rgb pro xt 280mm but someone else on this post had some recommendations iâ€™m also gonna check out aswell!",btw would the corsair model above do well cooling a 10700k?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is al enhancements?,and iâ€™m assuming svid is in bios?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if mce was on, and voltage was set to auto, it would make sense why it was adding so much.",but the voltage should be greatly reduced now unless you manually set it to set something else.,is it still getting to over 1.30?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you have some msi dragon software installed with a gaming mode setting?,just read someone else's post and they said disabling that mode fixed it.,also had temperature issues.,"i would install anything like that, and reset your bios to factory default, only with memory xml enabled.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is the rpm of the pump.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i saw that same forum and i uninstalled msi centre to no avail,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4150 rpm on full speed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also should mention when temps are in the 90s the top of the rad isnâ€™t blowing hot air still feels normal to the palm of my hand,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if ddr4 get the frequency for which the 12700k is rated for with the lowest latency so that it can run at gear 1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is this peasantry?,"get some proper ram, with speed above 4000mhz",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my 12700k doesnâ€™t like more than 3600mhz in gear 1 with 4 sticks.,iâ€™m running my 4 stick kit at 3600cl13.,looser timings and lower frequencies should work without issue on your 12700k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i donâ€™t what thatâ€™ll be,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah iâ€™m planning on getting 3600mhz cl15?,16gb until i get a better 3600mhz or more 32gb kit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
look at the intel ark listing for the 12700k it's going to tell you all then things you need about ram speed and everything else,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
one of the first boards i tried was a gigabyte board that didnâ€™t like higher than 3200mhz no matter what i did but iâ€™m assuming that was patched months ago.,iâ€™m using a z690 edge wifi now and iâ€™m loving it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah minimum is 3200,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™ve got a msi pro a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so do you think thatâ€™s a good idea going for the viper 16gb cl15 3600mhz iâ€™ve got a good deal on itâ€™s only â£60 just now until i get a better 32gb kit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do remember to set it to that speed when you get it cause very often it goes to 2666 out of the box,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good choice and i believe it uses the same memory topology as the edge so you should be good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah thanks and should i go for my 16gb 3600mhz cl15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just scared to get this ram and my computer f*cks up and people are telling me to get better spend tonnes on it but iâ€™m not sure if the patriot viper cl15 3600mhz is a better choice over 3200mhz cl16 ballistix plus the ballistix has a little rgb lol for â£3 more,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sounds good but you wanna make sure you match the spec later if you wanna upgrade to 32gb's,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s not going to fuck it up in a damaging way but if you like to make sure itâ€™s stable run memtest after you install the ram and if it doesnâ€™t pass then you can return it and/or investigate the issue.,spending a little more might be worth it for you but i donâ€™t want to spend your money.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™d be using 2x16gb kit hopefully 3600mhz or higher idk if iâ€™ll need more frequency and probs just cl16,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
go for the lowest latency speed above 3600 isn't really important for gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah thatâ€™s the best i can get thatâ€™s actually cheap is 3600mhz patriot viper cl15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
xmp 4000 just generally doesn't work on all 12th gen cpus.,anything rated over 3600 is matter or luck and or skill.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the z690 aorus elite ax isnt as bad as alot of people make out atleast in the case of f8b + f7 bios

the main thing i dont like as with all low end gigabyte boards 
the 3.3v rail droops like crazy with a large load on the cpu

e.g.","z390 m gaming does it z390 aorus master doesnt, z690 aorus elite ax does it, z690 aorus master doesnt

3600 is easy as pie to get 100% stable

3733 is easy as pie to get 100% stable same timings as 3600 but with 1.370v

anything higher i can get to boot and run just fine at 16-18-18-36-cr1 and get to pass a good few thousand % of karhu
but rtl's go wonky so decided to stick with 3600 as tight as i could get the timings 

3600 rtl 67,67,67,67,69,69,69,69

3733 rtl 69,69,69,69,69,69,69,69 can be coaxed to 67,67,67,67,69,69,69,69 

3800 rtl 69,69,69,69,71,71,71,71 can be coaxed to 69,69,69,69,69,69,69,69

3900 rtl 75,75,75,75,79,79,79,79

the grade depends on the candidate.,"hiring managers have a target grade, but they can go up or down depending on the candidate's experience, you can try asking which grade they're targeting.","in general, employees don't have access to salary ranges except for their own role/grade, but managers do have access to this info, so again you could try asking the hiring manager what the range is.","i don't actually see any role called ""operations program manager"", so you would need to find the exact role in order to determine the range.","if you get an offer, the two components i would recommend trying to negotiate are your apb target and initial stock grant.","you probably don't want to try to negotiate the grade unless it seems obviously too low, because hiring managers have a good sense of which grade you'll be successful in; you don't want to come in at a higher grade and then fail to deliver, or you'll have a bad time.","the exact point you are in the base pay range is not that important because it's easy to change in any given year, and it gets reset any time you get promoted.","apb bonus target has become quite inflexible for current employees, so if you're able to negotiate to a higher target within your grade's range then you'll be above 90% of employees in your grade.","stock is pretty negotiable since it's a one-time thing, just ask for a number that seems big for the role/grade and they'll probably increase the offer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you need to be running two ram-sticks my guy.,get another 1x16gb and run dual channel and you will see a huge increase,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
get dual channel memory and get a better motherboard such as z590 because a h510 is seriously bottlenecking a â€œkâ€ sku cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the h510 chipset and board designs are intended for celeron, pentium gold and low-end i3s for low-end business pc use.",it does not pair well with a k series cpu.,the vrms are simply incapable of supplying the power needed for an i5 or higher processor.,"in the bios there should be a section about power limits (pl1 / pl2), many boards have them configured for their maximum vrm capabilities, but sometimes you can still remove them.","if you can and do so, your vrms will get much hotter, likely to the point of thermal protection, which will still limit power being delivered to the cpu and will likely shorten the life of the board as well.",and never run a dual channel memory system in single channel mode (even though itâ€™s really common for oems to do).,itâ€™s a definite performance no-no.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
motherboard's cpu power supply isn't powerful enough so it overheats and cuts your current (i.e.,"frequency drops)

if what you spent is more than a 11400+ the board, then you are in a bad spot.","if you spent the same/ less than this combo, then if you aren't going to change the mobo, you might consider underclocking it into a 11400, or even lower... (3.7ghz is about half the power draw of 4.6), then keep single core at some 4.2-4.5. not sure if the bios on a h510 can do this, but xtu or throttlestop should work.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"imho, mobo cant handle that chip.. prob throttles the boost capabilities... unfortunately, you need to grab a z490/z590 board.","don't forget to make sure the ""dual channel ram"" you use is on the new motherboard's qvl list... good luck.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've heard that 2x8gb matters a lot in bench performance but not real world such as games.,"i've seen so many conflicting opinions on this topic, is the performance difference really that big?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"is it bottlenecking it because i can't oc my cpu, or is the mobo seriously just bad that it is preventing it from performing at best even while stock clocked?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11400 + board would be roughly $360cad where i live.,i got the 11600k + board for around $250,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
damn looks like i'll need a new board.,thanks for lookin out!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it really is.,"friend of mine tried switching from 1x16gb to 2x4gb ram, and almost doubled his fps in assassins creed valhalla.","you need to be running dual channel, for gaming as well as productivity",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are pairing a low end tier board with a unlocked cpu.,vrm prob can't handle all the watts cpu want or not for very long.,watch a review or 2 about your board.,but you are prob limited.,and yes dual channel memory is a must,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

people have already answered your question but you should always download a copy of your motherboard manual and keep it around.,"here is your board manual and then search for ""ln2""

read the manual what the header is for and decide for yourself whether you need it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that plastic pin support will come off the board and leave enough pin sticking up to use a short jumper between the appropriate pins.,"you'll have to work slowly and be patient with it - use a pick (preferably plastic) to get under it and work it lose from the board, but take care not to abrade on the board behind it.","if you have trouble, you can heat the plastic to soften it and it should come loose, or alternatively, use an olfa blade to cut the plastic away...just mind the board surface.",i wouldn't try to extract that pin and replace it.,"not that it cannot be done, but with multilayer boards, an amateur solderer with a hobbyist iron is asking for trouble.","if there is no need to repeatedly move the jumper, a formal 'repair' is not needed...just use a fine wire and jump the 2 pins for your config.","if the need ever arises to have the jumper in the other position, you can move your jumper wire...no risk to the board.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"> even tho the pin broke, the board wonâ€™t try to jump itself into ln2 mode and stuff now randomly would it?","no, because the jumper has to connect the two pins, no connection no change.","with the broken pin its no different than if it had the pin still there, the only issue is if you ever wanted to use ln2 mode, which you never will, then you would have to fix it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it'll be as good as an air cooler in the $50 price range but less reliable because of pump failure.,"it'll be good enough, for sure at stock settings.",the 8000 series was not soldered to the ihs but the 9000 series is.,and when i say good enough i'm talking temps in the 80s.,which too many people freak out about.,100c is the thermal limit for a reason.,if your cpu would die in 2 years from running at 90c intel would not have made 100c the throttle temp.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the b660 tomahawk reportedly has a good vrm.,"but there are limitations:

- no pcie 5.0 support, which is kind of one of the major alder lake advancements (z690-a has this)
- only 3 m.2 slots, one of them x2 (versus 4, all x4, 3 of them 4.0 and one 3.0)
- realtek lan (vs intel)


the b660 tomahawk does have some advantages:
- more 10gbps usb ports
- better onboard audio

the 12700 is going to be best with power limits removed, making it very close to an unoverclocked 12700k, so a good vrm is essential.","the z690-a is a very well received board, and the chipset has more advantages over b660 than just overclockingâ€¦ so it seems like a good pairing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

maybe it's a lemon cpu that doesn't have good contact between the die and the ihs?,like there was too much glue used to attached the ihs.,if it isn't the pump then it's something to do with the chain of contact from the die to the radiator.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ensure that your fans are in a proper push pull configuration, i like to go with the air conditioning method with my arctic sitting at the top of my case as the heat outlet and having the sides being the intake.",next go to your bios and try not to stay in there very long!,put a fan next to the pc just long enough to get her running and booting up.,youâ€™re going to go to the overclock settings on your motherboard and clock each core with a 4800mhz on your p cores and 3700mhz on your e cores.,this should reduce the temps for now long enough to get a good temperature reading.,the pump on bios is going to run shitty and my cpu temps gradually climb the longer iâ€™m in bios.,"if possible, use smart fan curves starting at 8v for 20c, 9.5v on 30c 10.7v on 40c and max voltage at 49c.",do this for all fans so theyâ€™re wicking out the heat rapidly.,this should allow you to start running the computer enough to download core temp on your computer and check your core temps.,take each core down 100mhz until you hit a sweet spot where the idle is about 27-31c idle.,"thereâ€™s an undervolt method i use outside of setting the base core clock speeds which will be letting the computer run on auto, but changing the voltage to 1.25v with a negative offset.","the offset will have a (-) symbol, and set the offset voltage to 0.150 .",this will get you started somewhere while you figure out the proper offset value thatâ€™s right for your cpu.,iâ€™ve used my ai overclock function paired with the 1.25v -.100v offset and this was pretty damn great but the temps would go to 81c on throttle tests on cinebench r23.,pm me if you want some help with the walkthrough!,!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you have your pump rotated in the wrong direction.,check the installation manual of the cooler.,the small fan of your cooler should be facing wram at the top of mb.,your cpu is thus covered just partially with your cooler resulting in overheating.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sounds like a combination of poor ihs-coldplate contact, possibly wrong mounting hardware (lga1700), insufficient thermal paste, and the z690 ilm over-bending the ihs causing poor contact

still stock and hitting 100c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i know the d15 is a powerful air cooler but i been hearing from a lot of people it canâ€™t cool the i9 12900k because it runs too damn hot but they might be wrong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as i stated on the top i removed it first thing when putting it on since it had a gaint warning symbol on it lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had it going up like you said and it was still overheating.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

well the good news is amazon is sending me replacement to see if it that lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i did and made good pressure but it still was overheating sadly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i didnâ€™t get to see it before the computer locked up but i think it was 16000 dont quote me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had it right the first time the only reason why it on the side was i saw a youtube video and saw people do that but it was still overheating even when facing up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and i checked all of thoses the first time it was poor contact and re did everything to make sure it was getting cooled but sadly i tested see if the cpu would cool at least  10 times and it still failed to cool.,iâ€™m going to try the new pump arctic sent me to see if it was just a failed pump,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the only problem is i canâ€™t even mess with the bios without the dang thing locking up on and shutting off due to heat and when the cpu does lower it self so it doesnâ€™t overheat it still manages to overheat and shut off iâ€™m getting a new pump to see if it that because that what arctic thinks it is.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't think that's how it works - cpus don't go defective like that - it's something to do with the cooler and most likely the pump,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i don't think it is worth it.,"besides, it's not only the cpu you'd be changing but motherboard as well.",maybe even ram (faster ddr4 or ddr5) and cooler.,if money is not an issue... well... still not worth it?,fc6 is badly optimized.,i played it fps capped at 60 and was happy with it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you have ""cpu"" issues then your fps does not go up significantly up when you drop graphics settings.","so drop the settings to ""very low"" and drop resolution to 720p.",see if the drops go away (drops to 65 are fine though).,anyhow: 10850k is a great cpu.,i would be very surprised if that would somehow be holding you back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not worth it.,"just overclock, you can do better than stock.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

using the same ultra details,1440p,rt both on.",i have fps between 85-100 fps and droppiing to 65fps when driving in car or riding horse.,when that person on 12900k dont have that drops and steady 95-115fps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not for far cry, no.",for cpu heavy things maybe.,i saw a huge boost in fps mins in msfs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ram makes quite a big difference especially on far cry 6. if money isn't the issuse you might want to consider it.,but what makes a lot more sense is to get a kit of decent b-die and tune it.,it's a lot cheaper than buying a new mobo and cpu.,"and chances are if you stick to ddr4 3200 on adl, you wont get as much fps as he did anyways.",3200mhz is really low hanging fruit when it comes to improving ur pc's performance.,"even better, if your gskill kit is cl14, chances are its b die and you should spend some time trying to overclock it.",just something worth checking.,"and if your cooler is decent, try to overclock it(ring+clock speed).",it's something to try before you're give up on your system.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
driving in any open world game is subject to cpu bottleneck.,"a more recent cpu will mask it, but it's the nature of driving across different zones while assets are streaming.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think what other users have said in this chat make sense.,upgrading ram specifically for this game will make a difference.,here is a digital foundry (eurogamer) review of different types of ram for the ryzen 7 3700x cpu.,"i know that you have an intel i9 10850k but i think in the article, they are reviewing just the ram.","[https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2020-08-22-does-ram-speed-affect-fps-on-amd-ryzen-memory-frequency-vs-timings?page=3](https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2020-08-22-does-ram-speed-affect-fps-on-amd-ryzen-memory-frequency-vs-timings?page=3)

for some reason, the far cry engine can benefit from faster ram.","they tested with far cry 5 engine, but i believe far cry 5 and 6 use a similar game engine.","further below in the article, they test the game crysis 3. and in that particular game, ram speed makes little difference!",so what does this mean?,it may mean that the youtube reviewer had better/faster parts.,and yes he also has a faster cpu.,12900k.,"likely drivers\*, game patches, cpu, ram, and even the gpu itself plays a major part in getting stable 90 to 110 fps for far cry 6.

he might have done some advanced cooling mods to his 3090. but you and he have rtx 3090s.... 

so i cannot say exactly where your bottleneck is coming from and where/what to spend your money on in order to extract the ultimate performance from your system.",honestly if you do these two things.,"* replace 3090 thermal pads, repaste 3090, and add a custom waterblock/closed loop.","* delidd the 10850k ihs and replace the ihs with a smooth copper rockit cool ihs, and add a beefed up aio or custom cooling loop to the cpu.","i think if you just do these two things, it maybe cheaper than buying a new z690 and 12900k.",maybe?,either way i think you can optimize your setup a bit more before thinking about purchasing new hardware!,even after you buy the 12900k.... you may not achieve the exact same results the youtuber has!,because that guy may have done all the cooling mods and overclocking possible for his system !,!!,just too many variables....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,"further, if you really get that upgrade itch, set a goal to buy on the next release of a new mobo and cpu launch.",having a long term goal to upgrade at a specific time can stop you from making a rash decision now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
trash ram.,buy faster memory with tighter timings not 18 22 22 stuff.,then overclock your cpu to 5ghz and ring to 45 or above.,then overclock your gpu.,that should give you a huge boost in peformance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

just for the record.,your 10850k or 10900k is an excellent cpu.,just look at the really tight fps for far cry 5 in the digital foundry review.,look at 1440p results and look at the 10900k.,the 10900k has the smallest bar.,that means the 5% lows and 5% highs are very close to the average fps.,that means smooth gameplay.,low chance of stutter.,"[https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2021-intel-core-i9-11900k-i5-11600k-review?page=4](https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2021-intel-core-i9-11900k-i5-11600k-review?page=4)

yes.,very slow.,you can try run the 3dmark timepsy benchmark.,you can find the demo free on steam.,then post the results here.,i bet your score would be much lower than other people with the same cpu and gpu configuration.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 not sure what user's video you were watching?,"but, most likely that user has windows 11, due to 12th gen just working better for windows 11, especially for gaming.","but, besides that, for me, i have windows 11 slim version for my 10700k oc @ 5.2ghz on all cores.","so, no bloatware, no background ""noise"".","just very stripped down, and i saw at least a 10fps gain vs a bloatware windows 11.

hes fps when driving is alot faster.",95-120fps.,when i have 90fps -100fps but with drops to 60-70fps.,its on 1440p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cpu temperature is a bit high.,should be the gpu hitting higher temperature before the cpu.,yeah that can indicate a cpu bound situation or ram or something.,how is it possible that the gpu hits a maximum of only 64c?,is that a stock cooler or modded?,either way excellent temps!!!,i am jealous of that gpu!,i don't have far cry 5/6 to bench.,but every game i play where i cap the framerate at 144 fps or 120 fps(144hz or 120hz) my gpu will always be screaming before my cpu.,i only have a 10700k for reference.,i've play at 4k 60fps and sometimes i switch to my 1440p (165hz gaming monitor).,both situations the cpu remains at 50c and the gpu (3070ti) hits high 76c.,any situation cap at 60fps or 120fps/144fps and the gpu is melting!!,!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4000 is fine as long as the second primary timing number isn't stupidly high.,for example 4000 18 22 22 42 ram will be bad compared to 4000 16 16 16 36 memory.,thats why there is usually a price difference between the two sets.,here is a video guide on buying memory.,its 8 months old now but it should still apply.,"https://youtu.be/jt2184c63tg


ideally if you do try timepsy and your cpu scores around 15,000pts thats a good score.",if i had to guess at the moment your cpu score would be around 13000.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i see... and i do understand where you're coming from.,"for me as well, avgin above 100fps is very important, since i have a 165hz monitor.","as i mentioned try a different version of windows 11. 

that 10 to 15fps difference can come to that.",at least try that.,your cpu is pretty much like mine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the same speed ram ?,with lower cl will be more expensive.,yes.,but the number after cl is more important when buying memory.,4000 cl16 22 vs 4000 cl16 16. trcd 16 vs trcd 22 is a huge difference.,the lower the better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13800 isn't terrible but isn't the best.,that means there's still room for improvement.,you can post the link to your timespy score i could have a quick look.,but yeah faster memory can increase your cpu and over all timepspy score / increase peformance in farcry 6. i would recommend a ram upgrade but i wouldn't spend to much on it as well.,good memory doesnt always have to cost a fortune.,you could try overclock your cpu and gpu first and see if that helps peformance.,that doesn't cost anything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

they've deprecated its capability and i don't see a purpose to it anymore, it was nice and worked well but i think the market is gone with 1tb nand drives dropping towards the $50 range, i got a couple of those in raid0 instead.","if you are hunting for m15 check ebay and mercari, they appear rarely and usually for a pretty penny(eng samples).",you might want to look for the p1600x (basically a rebirth of the canceled m15) which is currently for sale \[â‰ˆ$200\].,"you might want to consider using primocache as well, it is paid software but $35 isn't too bad.",free 30 day trial.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is it the same as amd storemi technology.. speeding up a spinning drive with a faster ssd or nvme drive as cache?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was afraid of that.,"i don't think it's very clear on the intel product pages, but i figured i would at least try it.",i guess i need to track down a m15 module if i really want to accelerate this hdd?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"both optane and storemi are disk caching technologies but optane specifically relies on 3d xpoint memory as the cache, which has a much greater read/write lifespan compared to other non-volatile memory technologies.",xpoint memory is rated for ~30 drive writes per day (dwpd) whereas other nand memory is typically rated for ~5 dwpd.,"the worry with using non-optane memory for caching is significantly diminished drive lifespans, but i suppose it really comes down to the specific use case.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can try.,i'm pretty certain that m15 was cancelled by intel prior to release.,it's not listed on intel's website.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the i7-12700k has a tdp of 125w and a max boost tdp of 190w, so yes, everything else aside it should work with a 550w psu.","of course, it also depends on what else that psu needs to power simultaneously (ram, hard disks, etc).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no problem, provided your psu is decent and you have a midrange / mid-higrange gpu so total power does not become an issue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
550w is fine it would just get dicey if you add a dedicated gpu.,but if there is no need or plan 550 is plenty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have a 1080ti for now.,"the plan is the upgrade the gpu and psu later, it it will worl like this",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea it's definitely edge power usage if you some how hit your 1080ti and 12700k specailly if it's a higher limit 1080ti.,but for games you should not ever run into that max power usage so you should be more then fine and if your ok with a psu upgrade later you should be fine for a bigger gpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
decreased noise would be one reason to get an aftermarket cooler.,"the deepcool ak620 is remarkably quiet, cools very effectively, and is reasonably priced.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you do not plan to overclock i don't think there is any need for aftermarket coolers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"basically the only thing i considered an aftermarket cooler for now, is just the silence.",so i will just stick with the stock coolers and see if it is loud or not.,if it is i will just buy an aftermarket one most likely.,thanks for the advice..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nope, im not into overclocking.",thanks a lot!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that kind looks like what happened when i took the ram out of a computer that was still running to see what would happen (it had an igpu so it doubled as vram).,"other than memory, iâ€™d say the monitor is fucked, the igpu is fucked, or there is an evil being trying to release itself from your computer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i am inclined to think the same thing.,"here's a 2nd gen cpu that by the op's own admission is getting the shit beat out of it, 100% utilization, 70c w/water cooling.",it's probably time for a new rig.,rolling it back to win 10 may squeeze some more life out of it but they have run the heck out of an old piece of hardware.,time to retire that antique if you are hammering on it so hard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah it is more useful to take 5 minutes to explain.,rather than drop mystery answers.,my opinion... having generic vm like compute on pcie cards inside another system may not as flexible as you really want.,it locks you into a one size config.,"for most multi vm uses you are likely better off with high core count xeon, plenty of ram, etc.",not separate discrete boards.,"personally, over the years i've bought multiple nuc.",the older ones still work and i use to offload experimental stuff.,the benefit is simply that i can power cycle any independently.,most days separate small computers beats all the other options for me ðÿ˜ƒ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there is a very small difference between 12700k and 12900k for most use cases (unless you go for some professional applications that use full multicore performance).,as you are somewhat experienced overclocker i would say that you will probably like the 12700k very much.,i think that is the current sweet spot.,you can also get a ddr4 motherboard and use your current ram as that seems to be rather good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"all cpus, gpus, and ram have diminishing returns ie you dont get 2x fps for 2x price.",so its upto you if you want to upgrade to the very expensive parts or not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the biggest question here what is your aim with this upgrade?,sure there is quite a difference between 8700k and 12700k but 8700k especially oced is still no slouch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
could be a cpu bottleneck.,have u locked the fps?,(could be the reason of low gpu usage).,"also, the dips will be much improved with upgrading ur cpu.",a 12700k should be enough,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hey.,i play triple 1440s on iracing.,i recently got a 3080fe and paired with my 8700k and it was an okay jump from the 1080ti i had but nothing special.,i went ahead and got a 12700k since i broadcast too and boy was it a huge bump in  performance.,iracing is largely cpu intensive.,the the jump from 8th gen to 12 gen was noticeable right away,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"laptop cpus usually have unnecessarily high frequency to make it look good on paper (like the 5.0ghz on the 10870/10875h), but it translates to excessively high voltage (high clocks need voltage)

iâ€™d probably be fine with it if it was a good 850w.,"nvidia themselves recommend 750w and if there were a serious issue with the type of computer a 3090 buyer would likely build (ie, high end), iâ€™m sure they would bump that up.",even the 3090 ti they still recommend just a 850w.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm using a 850w supernova t2 and it's fine with an oc'd 3090 and 12900k.,max power i've seen at the wall was 750w and accounting for ac-dc inefficiency that means it have almost 200w of room.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it should just be ok if you keep the pl to 350w and dont stress test the cpu whilst gaming

i have a hx1200i which i can monitor in realtime and it spikes to around 850w just gaming but usually around 500w",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for normal use, 850 should be fine.",but if you plan to oc iâ€™d consider a more powerful psu (850 should still be fine in this case as well - i personally prefer to have a little extra headroom).,"numbers from my system under load (from memory): 

default -> 3090 ~300 watts & 12900k ~125 watts

oc -> 3090 ~450 watts & 12900k ~225 watts",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

just cap your frames to your monitors refresh rate just to be sure.,never run games uncapped.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i use a 1200w.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
more than fine.,i use an sf750.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you're just gaming the cpu won't pull more than 150w.,just don't do renders in the background while stress the gpu to the max.,the chances of both your cpu and gpu hitting 100% load at the same time are pretty damn slim.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how do you measure at the wall?,with a kill-a-watt?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i am not saying you are wrong per se, but you didnâ€™t really substantiate why you need more for oc.",other than perhaps some (implicitly expressed) sense of comfort with more is better.,the numbers you gave stil show plenty of headroom provided you have the full 850w available on the rails the psu is decent (which is mostly the case these days).,"you see this type of reasoning quite often, same with temps etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"fair points, and i agree that even with the oc numbers that iâ€™ve provided 850 watts is sufficient.","interestingly enough, i think the reasoning that you mention really boils down to personality.",iâ€™d assume people who knowingly prefer the unnecessary extra headroom for psus such as myself also do the same thing for most other aspects of their life.,e.g.,i always have at least 2 months of toilet paper in my closets :) i definitely donâ€™t need that much but i feel better knowing that i have a large enough buffer that i never have to think about it when i go for a dump.,"same with my psu, 850 is probably more than enough but at a 1000 i donâ€™t even need to think about if iâ€™m getting close to a limit even if iâ€™m pushing my system to the max.","1200 would be what i consider overboard though haha 

but to conclude, yes youâ€™re absolutely right that most that recommend the excess headroom do not provide a good enough reason for doing so other than for â€œcomfortâ€ or â€œpeace of mindâ€.",itâ€™s not an objective metric,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seasonic had issues with the focus line and 30 series transient spikes but i believe they have been fixed in new versions.,if the 3090 is base power then 12900k and 3090 should be fine.,but say an evga ftw3 has the ability to slide a power slider and be 450w for just the gpu.,but even then a good 850w is still probably fine.,we're talking probably 770+- peak power under a synthetic cpu and gpu stress at the same time.,if this is your build out spec you could always go 1000w if you really want to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seasonic focus line had shutdown problems before but it's now fixed.,the only problem is poor 12v noise at full load.,"seasonic only recently fixed the prime line which was shutting down with 3090 gpus due to an oversensitive 12v protection circuit, so people with prime titanium or platinum were getting random shutdowns at 450-500w load even with 850w models.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"interesting, i thought last i looked their maximum load was to low for this, but for example this kasa kp115 says maximum load 1.8kw.",so a pc with a 1000 watt psu is 800 watt below the maximum load of the smart plug.,https://www.amazon.com/dp/b08ln3c7wk,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"first, letâ€™s look at some 5 slot boards:

"i'd avoid going the bifurcation route, no need to steal lanes from your gpu slot if you don't have to.","there are z690 boards available that will give you five nvme m.2 slots without needing to resort to traditional bifurcation via adapter cards, albeit with one typically at gen3x4.","z690 has quite a few lanes to hang accessory slots off of, and the wider 16gb/s dmi 4.0x8 link gives them all a bit of decent breathing room.","some examples are [msi's z690 ace](https://www.msi.com/motherboard/meg-z690-ace/specification) and [z690 unify boards](https://www.msi.com/motherboard/meg-z690-unify/specification), each with five nvme m.2 slots.",gigabyte's [z690 master](https://www.gigabyte.com/motherboard/z690-aorus-master-rev-1x/sp#sp) does as well.,"some asus boards support up to five, however they rely on the usage of a bundled add-in-card, which can be a bit of a pain due to it requiring a slot.","this can block other expansion cards, or even interfere with larger gpus, so plan carefully if you go with one.","the one that i checked, the [z690 hero](https://rog.asus.com/motherboards/rog-maximus/rog-maximus-z690-hero-model/spec), can be used in either a cpu connected slot with a single drive (in gen4x4 if using top slot, or gen5x4 in second slot, either reducing the gpu to x8), or via a chipset slot with two drives at gen4 (leaving the gpu at x16).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"it really shouldn't on that board, there aren't any shared or switched resources.","if your second slot isn't populated with anything, double check your bios to make sure you didn't accidentally set it to x8/x8 operation.","you're right that performance won't change much, but you should still be able to run it at full width.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

how much are you beating my bad bin 12900k by?,"im at 5.1 all core btw on a arctic liquid freezer ii 280

i doubt you will c these temps even in rendering.,i saw the 12900k cpus get efficient in gaming and several other workloads.,so in a stress test i think this is normal.,have u checked gaming and rendering workloads buddy?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nice to know my
12900k is amongst the top of the gaming lot.",or that iâ€™m going to oc.,am happy with mine as it is for gaming.,probably overdid it with 128gb of ram but aaah.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what are your radiators + fan specs?,i'm doing a custom loop myself with a 12900ks and would love to get an idea of temps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a little update.,i went all the way from 1.35v to 1.26v at 5.3ghz!!!,these ks cpu's are very highly binned or i won the silicon lottery for the first time.,i think 1.26v is stock for a  12900k.,and temps are down so much too!,this screenshot is from a cinebench i did at 1.28v but this was the higher score i got and you can see how much the temps lowered.,"the temps dont hit over 76c at 1.26v which is insane at 5.3

actually your score is 100 points higher than mine 0.0 which could be from your ram.",what ram are you running?,i have 64gb 5200mhz gelid ddr5.,maybe a little tune on the e cores as well would help my score.,i have the e cores at 4.1ghz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you will almost certainly bsod with any real stress test,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh yeah for sure.,"i don't do video rendering anymore but for gaming i definitely probably won't see temps over 80.

i donâ€™t think the overall sweet spot is actually available yet.,"i mean you can find a sweet spot for what works and is available today, but in 2014 no one would have considered 3600mhz the ddr4 sweet spot to buy, even if it was technically available.","ddr5 is expected to reach speeds nowhere near available for purchase today, nor even supported by current hardware.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have ddr5 5200 and i'm seeing a decent uplift of about 15%-30% in memory bound loads vs ddr4 3466

but if you're gonna get ddr5 now get the best you can afford.",you're gonna regret it anyways when cheaper ddr5 comes around.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think the sweet spot (in the future) would be ddr5 7200 cl 28/32, if the imcs of future cpus don't get improvements compared to current ones.","current-gen intel/amd cpu imcs can be guaranteed to handle 3600mhz ""gear 1"", or 7200mhz ""gear 2"".",that's part of the reason why ddr4-3600 is the sweet spot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the sweet spot for ddr5 isâ€¦.,"ddr4

thereâ€™s no reason to go 5 as of now.",we havenâ€™t got the speeds we will get in the future.,ddr3 1333mhz was terrible.,ddr4 2133 mhz was terrible.,ddr5 right now is gonna be terrible.,youâ€™ve gotta wait for the sweet spot speeds to actually show up.,"for ddr3 the minimum decent speed ended up being 1600mhz, for ddr4 it ended up being 3000mhz.",sweet spots were 1866mhz and 3200mhz respectively.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whatever ddr5 will be available and cheap in 2 years.,8400 probably.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for what have i seen (its not final) between 5600mhz and 6000mhz is the best range.,have tested so far samsung kits and my hynix is coming tomorrow.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wait for low latency 8000mhz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the problem is that with any early dram generations, it's going to be expensive to get the high performance ones.","ddr4 at launch came in 2133/2400/2666 mhz flavors, and any faster ones quickly went up in prices.",same with ddr3 at launch.,i remember the many debates over ddr2 vs ddr3 when the memory controllers were on the motherboards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and later cpu generations will be able to run faster ddr5 kits, while also benefiting from the faster ddr5 kits as well.",anyone remember when 1st gen skylake and zen struggled with anything faster than ddr4-3200/3400?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i can't find any motherboards that can even handle this speed, would this mean that a motherboard/bios update would need to be pushed before we could access those speeds or would we need to buy new boards all together?",for example the bought that i've just bought that wasn't cheap by any stretch of the imagination only supports ddr5 ram speeds of up to 6200 (oc).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,green pcbs are almost universally micron ic's now.,32gb is the min acceptable setup for ddr5 because 8gb sticks are ddr4 ic's strapped to a ddr5 stick(they kinda suck you shouldn't buy them..).,that build is really bad for anything except gaming in 4k+.,you are cpu bottlenecked really badly.,you are right though ddr4 for your case (maximizing budget) is the right choice.,"overall though this would have made far more sense:
12600 (239$)
b660 mobo (150?)","vs
12100 (139)
h610 (100)
especially for 1440p that cpu will bottleneck a 3080 really badly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i mean, define cheap.","i spent â£211.17 on corsair dominator platinum 3600/cl14 which is on the higher end and such and this was at the end of the shelf-life of ddr4, so i doubt decent speeds will be low in price any time soon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you test the hynix?,i assume most likely the corsair ones are mostly going to be that.,"i know people go on and on about how there is ""no"" reason to buy ddr5.",well there is for me... i am building an itx and all ddr4 itx mobos suck.,"also, buildzoid said itx is a rare time when ddr5 may make sense.",and people forget that ram isn't only for gaming.,"anyway, back on topic... for now i am deciding between corsair 5600 cl36 and kingston 6000 cl 40. trust corsair a tad more, although i am worried about either of them since so many kits not specifically on a qvl will not get to the proper speeds.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think the motherboard manufacturer only thoroughly verified 6200mhz kits and they could not claim that higher-spec kits were guaranteed to be supported.,(or they had higher-spec kits running smoothly but wanted to be conservative.),g.skill/asus had ddr5-8888 running with i7-12700kf and rog maximus z690 apex.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"especially for 1440p, not at 1080p.",thats how it works.,at 4k you don't even use the gpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"what you could get on early ddr4 days for that price was ddr4 3200 cl16, nowadays that's dirt cheap, i imagine current 6000mhz cl36 kits will be the same in the future and 7000+mhz + lower latency will take the price range the former currently occupies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"actually the kingston with 6000mhz cl40 are hynix, i run them with my daily pc @ cl34-36-36-36-56 1.39v.",the corsair ones could be samsung.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i ended up just getting the corsair 5600 cl36 kit rather than wait around thinking or waiting for something faster to go on a good sale.,people overdo how much the speed and timings are noticed in everyday life.,but would have been nice to get the 6000 cl36 or 6200 cl36 kits.,the one i got was like $194 whereas at the time the 6000 corsair was $295 and 6200 above that so way too much extra to pay on those.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

just curious why people out there prefer 12900k over 12900ks ?,"since 12900ks is newer, or just because the price performance of 12900k is preferable than 12900ks ?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

when idling?,yes.,i run the pump at 65% under 40c then 80% 45-55c.,100% anything beyond that.,fans setup is similar except i run 1 at 100% to ensure constant suction into the case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hey sorry for the super delayed reply..not sure why i missed it.,"anyways, i am hoping for minimum 5 years out of this :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i had my arctic lfii 280 mounted like yours, rotated it so that tubes were at the bottom, no more pump whine.",i think it's better for any air bubble to sit at the top of the rad.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
air is less dense than liquid and rises to the top of the loop.,you don't want the intake at the top because it can suck air into the cooling block.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i had to buy a pack of long screws and a fan hub.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wow youâ€™re pretty aggressive, you must be fun at a party.",the information in the video is actually pretty informative regardless of the clear dislike you have for the channel.,as with anything there are nuances and itâ€™s not just clear cut to do something like this or like that but in general pipes down works best unless the pump is below the inlets and then pipes up works also.,i think it would be best if you just go sit down.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the edge is indeed fantastic and supports ddr4 for those of us not ready to jump on ddr5.,pretty much seems to be a ddr4 version of the carbon with a few other minor differences.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i would really, really not go for intel and just go for nvidia/amd if you are going to wait until  november.","i know this is an intel sub, but i am going to risk the downvotes for this opinion- and here's why.","**the timing**

buying in november means that next gen amd (rdna 3) and next gen nvidia (lovelace) should have been launched by then, rumors saying they will launch in september.","these gpus will most likely decimate the arc 7. even the most optimistic arc 7 rumors put it at performing at a 3080, and with leaks of rnda 3 and lovelace doubling their performance, you might end up seeing cards 2x as strong as the 3090 from amd and nvidia.","**the bugs**

this is intel's first generation of gpus, and the state of their drivers, to be frank, are atrocious.","they limited the launch of the mobile cards to south korea, and the reviews from what we have seen there are some games won't even launch at all.","others have terrible frame rates despite ample hardware power to drive higher frames, and other times gpu usage is extremely low resulting in worse fps.","yes, there are months of time between now and november, but it takes a while for drivers to mature.","**software stack**

nvidia has dlss and amd has fsr which should, in the end, result in the same thing you would want from xess- more frames without a drastic quality reduction.","and what deep link sounds like is using both the intel gpu and the integrated graphics on the cpu together to improve performance , except the thing is that on desktop it should be less of an issue because your desktop gpus have so much more execution units, have less of a power cap, and are clocked much higher, while in mobile this technology seems to be much more interesting.","not sure about deep link i will admit, but xess should really not be a major reason you go intel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think i worded it wrong in the original post.,i meant to say it only boots when the ram is in the a1 and a2 slots sorry.,it doesnt boot in any other configuration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this one is likely a missing memory channel (channel b) then.,have you checked the motherboard socket?,"there could be a bent pin or two under the cpu, somewhere around the right hand corner.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
theres no physical damage from what i can see on the motherboard.,ram slot and cpu pins.,itâ€™s possible that im missing it though.,itâ€™s happening on both my motherboards which is the strangest thing.,i ended up buying [this](https://www.amazon.com/dp/b09mtdjg67/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_aswab20th33ymc6fjw0k) bundle to be sure.,hopefully the problem wont be there after installing these new parts.,if you read what i replied to the other guy you can see the problem is a very strange one and after calling msi and a pc repair place they both advised me that both motherboards might have failed at the same time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a photo would be nice, but buying a new board is a solution, too.",hope it solves your problem!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would take a phote but im at work right now.,im just thinking that since both motherboards worked before with my other parts maybe when i was changing things around one of the times it damaged something.,because ive taken this computer apart at least 3 times in the last month.,"i got a new case so we took everything out of the old one and into the new, and then i got a new mobo so we took it apart again and then we took it apart again to swap back to the old one.",so im thinking somewhere along the line both mobos got something messed up possibly.,thanks for the help im hoping with this new mobo and cpu i wont have anymore problems.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you can repair this board you can either sell it or keep it as a spare!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well with the protection plan i got for the b356m they gave me like $70 in a refund and let me keep the board.,and im returning the other z370 thats having the same issue today for a full refund.,so maybe i can have someone look at this old one for the hell of it to see if something was in fact damaged.,assuming the problem goes away after getting these new parts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is true; however the responsibility for production scale almost certainly has nothing to do with raja.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you should spend a little bit more money and get a better cpu cooler.,what are your idle and gaming temps now?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you should swap the stock cooler with a 212 evo or nh-u14s so that it's silent at all loads.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it looks as nice and clean as a pre-built hp omen!,:o,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice build!,congrats and welcome to the pcmr!,"like some others have stated on here, i would just recommend a new cpu cooler whenever you can afford it and don't stress it too hard before then.","the case fans and thermal throttling will prevent permanent damage, but not much room for error.",even a good cheap air cooler can drastically improve thermals.,i had a hyper 212 evo on my previous build before getting a 360mm aio and loved it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is probably one of the best matched parts pc i've seen in a while.,"also, pc looks siiiick!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have two reasons for all the fans.,"ability to cool an even higher end gpu down the line, and because i went with the stock cpu cooler.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that case came with three fans.,the fans he bought cost $40 in a kit and come with a 6 fan controller.,"he was smart to go with antec, they give the best value for cases and fans for budget builds.",he spent around $110 for the case and fans.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks it's good to be here ðÿ‘this was an upgrade from an old hp tower that i put a gtx 1650 in.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

idle is around 59c but while gaming it gets into the 80's.,"thanks for the advice, i will go ahead and order a better cooler!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they *may* need to spend a little bit more for a cpu cooler.,the great thing about oem coolers is there is no sunk cost.,if there is no thermal throttling for the user's needs then there is no need to get a new cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not really, unless youâ€™re disrupting the gpu intake or itâ€™s ability to exhaust hot air due to turbulence

quite easy to check

load up furmark, lock the gpu fan speed.",and slowly keep reducing the case fans from 100% speed.,"if at any point the temperatures drop by decreasing the case fan speed, youâ€™ve encountered turbulence.",fix it accordingly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
both are terrible choices.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12400 will be fine with that stock cooler if noise is not too much.,here is a test by *tech yes city* of the stock cooler with that cpu in 28 celsius ambient temp.,[https://youtu.be/yhkbabcfmpk?t=184](https://youtu.be/yhkbabcfmpk?t=184),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good choice.,i agree with it.,"the stock cooler can work in builds, but only in cases with very good airflow like you now have.","also, you can add 2 more fans on the bottom if you get a really high-end gpu to cool it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

my idle on 6700k with a hyper 212 evo and no case fans is 18-22c depending on the season.,did you put thermal paste and remove the plastic wrap on the cooler plate?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what?!,..... thats like really bad... 59c idle??,that can damage your chip running like that constantly.,especially when you watch 4k youtube videos.,"i would for sure at least get  280mm aio just for future proof, they did drop in price recently.","get the ""be quiet"" model, since that seems to be the cheapest.",here is my temps for context.,"[https://ibb.co/pzfkpwv](https://ibb.co/pzfkpwv)

this video is pretty close to what i was trying to say.,"temps are higher, but not dangerous (unless rendering/editing).","if op can afford it, then it would be a good idea, but nothing urgent.",i ran the stock intel cooler on my i7-4790k and that thing lived up to it's devil's canyon name lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'll probably not upgrade my gpu anytime soon.,i am running 2 144hz monitors.,"i also agree with the os related issue because i've seen videos saying performance is supposedly better on windows 11 for 12th gen. having said that, i feel this is something intel needs to fix as i feel this is their issue to deal with.",surely i'm not the only one who has this issue with 12th gen processors.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it is nice that you found a way to fix your issue.,when i had that issue i tried everything you listed.,i even bought new parts when my plan was just to upgrade my motherboard and cpu.,i spent 3 months troubleshooting my issue and gave up and rma my motherboard.,getting a replacement for my motherboard was the last time in my mind.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no problem.,yeah it is honestly a toss up.,i am used to not having bleeding edge technology.,so having the best is not necessary for me.,i remember as a kid computer stores would try to push amd socket 939 chips to me.,they weren't the fastest but they were cost efficient.,over the years i always wanted intel chips as they were the best but some of them cost upwards into the thousands!!!,but today everything is 200 or 400 for a really good performing chip.,i am not even complaining!!,"i think with inflation, cpu chips are at a really reasonable price.",motherboards on the other hand..... they are expensive!,and they have all the fun features that i'd like.... but like most things in life it is unnecessary.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thatâ€™s a fine amount, however.. if you took that picture and waited around for a response, you probably have dust and crap stuck in it now.","if not, ignore this comment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s about how much i put on my 12900k and itâ€™s cooling it perfectly.,you should be good as thatâ€™s a pea-sized amount.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
added just about the same amount to my 10700k oc @ 5.2ghz on all cores.,applied the paste about 2 years ago.,"still, 28 idle temps, and for gaming, i don't go beyond 58c.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"noctua heat sink manual showed to place five dots, blob in middle and small blobs in the corners",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you aren't supposed to use the whole tube you know.,"but i'd advice spreading it out a bit more, at least personally i haven't had full coverage with pea method after unmounting it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are probably done !,"but this is good amountâ€¦ pea size is 3 to 5 mm , easy way is to compare the size to the transistors around the cpu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
0.5g tube = i always use the entire tube.,those single-use tubes don't have too much or too little for any cpu/cooler.,they are just right.,"though they are the most expensive way to buy paste, they are convenient.",as for if you should buy more.,yes absolutely.,every pc builder should have enough available to at minimum repaste one time.,you never know when you might need to do a repaste.,a $15 dollar 2g tube should get you 4 pastes and is worth having on hand.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s fine.,for my 12th gen i did use the dot in middle and 4 small dots in corners,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most of the contact is metal to metal hence the paste is there to fill the microscopic gaps so in reality this is more than enough... imo its time for people to stop abusing thermal paste.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a lot of thermal paste tubes come with extra paste no need to worry if thereâ€™s spare,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah that looks to be a good amount.,i'd probably have put the smallest amount extra but what you have looks good already.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thermal paste is only to fill the micro gaps between the cpu and the cooler, so yes that is enough, it will spread.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
amongus moment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's fine.,the actual silicon die is in the middle on intel cpus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
short answer: yes.,"just like a drop of blood fills a glass slide once the cover slide is applied, once the cooler gets applied it will have a good distribution pattern to transfer heat away from the ihs surface to the heatsink surface.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
keep in mind no paste will conduct heat better than metal to metal contact.,thermal paste is designed to fill in the pores of the metal to ensure that all surfaces are in contact with each other or simply to fill in the imperfections that prevent the two surfaces to completely contact each other.,i n other works the thinner thickness of paste that will allow the complete contact is all that is required.,i used a credit card size piece plastic to spread a thin film across both surfaces.,"rule of thumb: the thinner the film that still allows complete surfaces contact, the more efficient and effective cooling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looks about right.,everything is as it should be.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
should be fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would add more!,better safe and sorry.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well nope it's not enough.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
definitely,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looks perfect,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

seems enough.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for attending,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there are better ways to harness the power of the thermal paste.,"i saw the video below and found it to be quite revealing:

ok,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes it is slightly enough with your i5 for all activities if you can not get more rightnow.,"but for better quality and performance, replace with full enough better thermal soon!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i personally use the thin coat method across the whole ihs as seen in this video by der8auer.,he also demonstrates other methods and how they spread.,[thermal grizzly application](https://youtu.be/trytggmdeqm),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i allways makes a x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is a fair amount of compound!,"at least fort that area, it should spread nicely when you press your thermal solution against it, if you don't do overclock an also have a/c in the room you shouldn't worry about for possible bubbles of thermal paste trapped between the cpu heatsink and the cooler.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's plenty.,it'll squish and spread when you put your cooler on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thats plenty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it won't probably change much anyway.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what voltage you running?,i have mine @5.4ghz @1.40v.,idle temps are usually 26-28c.,lapped my ihs as well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i don't spread, i just wiggle the cooler.",don't lift it tho.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the cooler spreads it well enough most of the time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it shouldnt fully coat the ihs, it's supposed to slip into the tiny microscopic cracks so you'll have patches where the ihs makes direct contact to the cooler and you wont see it there unless you use a microscope.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would evenly spread it across the entire ihs.,that is what i did with my 12900k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you mean capacitors?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
should you spread the paste or leave it in a glob when u place the heatsink?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think he means that there was only a small amount left in the tube and now itâ€™s all gone.,so heâ€™s asking if this is enough or if he needs to buy another tube.,i think.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
comparing blood with thermal paste lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with proper amount of paste and mounting pressure it doesnt matter which technique you use.,only time you need to use another technique is when the thermal solution is very thick and doesnt spread well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i do the x pattern, slightly better application to the corners of the ihs, but there is more risk of misapplication.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that isnt true at all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks.... but i only have a 280mm aio, but i do have 7 pc fans, for my thermaltakeview 71, i guess that does help.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i may have won the silicon lottery.,i did get my 10700k on it original release date.,which helps.,"[https://ibb.co/pzfkpwv](https://ibb.co/pzfkpwv)

it's simple.,"buy the newest generation, and buy the very best you can afford.","it's not much more complicated than that, really.","your budget will dictate what you end up with, but you should focus on 12th gen.

the gpu is about due for an upgrade too.",same thing applies.,"latest generation, get the best you can afford.","or better yet, wait for 40 series nvidia gpus to hit the scene, and decide what to get then.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how soon you need part upgrade for better performance?,top end intel arc or a rtx 4060 would be a solid upgrade over your gtx 1080 and they should be out later this year.,"there is a decent upgrade path from i5-8400 right now: i5-12600k or i7-12700k on a ddr4 motherboard comes into mind, but if you're gonna procrastinate then maybe worth waiting for raptor lake/zen 4 after ddr5 price becomes normal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

who on earth builts dedicated streaming pc's nowdays?,since ryzen and the rest came out there isnt really any need to do so they are powerfull enough to allocated 4-6 cores,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just got the 12600k and i love this thing for gaming.,boosted my fps +100 on games from my 6700k.,unfortunately i'm running my old hyper 212. i need to upgrade to a noctua.,do you need low profile ram for it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what game are you streaming on integrated graphics?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what do you mean by streaming pc?,you output your main gaming pc to both a monitor and the pci card above or is it pass through?,is this so you have no lag when streaming?,thx,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'd be surprised if it didn't.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it better lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very informative and interesting post,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm jealous of the clean builds you guys have.,i never learned to do the cable management so none of the cables go behind the case.,this subreddit and pcmasterrace subs would get a heart attack if they saw what it looks like inside.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

does it have ddr5?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no gpu :'(,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have the same board and cpu!,love it.,"i do programming, gaming, virtual machines, heavy workloads, etc.",it's pretty great (coming from amd's ryzen 7 1700).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

just using the cpu to stream 1080 60fps,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's still the best method for having the best gaming experience and the highest quality output.,also gives you the ability to do things like record at a high resolution while streaming at the same time.,"even on a beefy pc no way you won't feel a load like that 

if someone is a competitive gamer at a high level as well, streaming on the gaming pc is meaning that you're getting less performance to the game itself.",usually doesn't matter in reality but it's hard to say.,pros will notice a slight increase in delay and it'll depend heavily game to game.,"it's not at all cost effective and it requires more tech savvy, but it's still and probably will be the objective best method until things change in a way that's unimaginable to us currently.",plus you never know when the next apex legends situation will hit.,that game was near impossible to capture properly on most single pc set ups without significant frame limiting (bad for gaming performance) for a very long time.,like at least months on end.,anyone on a dual pc set up was able to play the game at full quality while putting out a way better stream than the competition and that was at a time when the game was at its biggest popularity wise.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my gaming pc is a ryzen haha,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

mostly just call of duty and warzone.,"itâ€™s not super smooth as nvenc, but itâ€™s pretty damn fluid on x264!",i know this sound over kill but i just really like the 12700k because i do lots of video editing as well and this cpu renders so fast.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1080p 60fps streams.,but i run my gaming pc at 1440 170hz thatâ€™s why i needed a 4k capture card.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thanks!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was gonna go 1650!,but i wanted to just get this pc prepped for gaming down road also,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
na haha ddr4 3600mhz iâ€™m prepping it for a 3080 down the road.,but for now just using it as my stream pc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ðÿ˜‚,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for sure!,i was impressed by this cpu.,itâ€™s gonna be my workhorse haha,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what gpu you running?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hella big,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
haha i donâ€™t have a gpu yet though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s great!,get the blue tooth wifi version for 20 bucks more.,i also recommend get it off amazon.,newegg be messing around with their 3 party sellers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m running off the cpu right now.,but iâ€™ll be adding a 3060 ti to it so itâ€™ll be more complete,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s a great cpu!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
haha,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
only 1c difference and i was kinda on a budget for this build.,aio is super nice though!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
haha let me have your 3060 ti please to fix that opening.,great build bro you got also l!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a 3070ti in gaming pc and rtx 3070 on the way ðÿ¤£,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh, yeah iâ€™m doing the same thing lol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great write up!,these were my reasons exactly haha,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"streaming on rtx cards uses the rt and tensor cores so there is almost no load on cuda or the cpu itself

actually cost a lot to get the same performance with a streaming pc",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've never had any issues streaming and playing from the same pc.,you have to know what you're getting into though and what that cost will be.,setup rendering off the cpu and your graphics card is free to run as fast as it wants and/or can for any game you'll be playing for said stream.,you only need a mere 8c16t cpu to do this and a graphics card that'll give you the satisfaction of sending kids to the lobby at a glorious 144fps+ leaving you feeling that satisfaction.,"even when we all had 'issues' of some sort with apex, i never turned anything down graphics wise and still pulled well over 100fps while sending 60 to my stream and running a 3 monitor setup.",so the debate on if you really need two pc's is more of a pissing in the sand kind of argument.,"if you can, then that's you.","if you can't or don't want to spend an extra maybe grand for that 2nd pc, one is doable, but you have to know what you're doing.","also, just because all the 'big streamers' do it, doesn't mean it's a real thing.","they've got more money than they know what to do with and some idiot came along and said, ""hey man you need two pc's to make this really work great"".",just isn't the case anymore since we've gone well beyond 8 cores for 'consumer' pc tech.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
shouldn't it be the other way around?,alder lake js pretty great for gaming,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m looking into the 5800x3d for my gaming pc.,iâ€™ve been pushing my 5600x at 4.7 ghz.,i love that baby amd chip.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'll check it out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it looks good!,have fun when that 3080 comes in!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was torn between waiting for the 13th gen as well.,it never hurts to wait because once the next gen comes out you are always happy.,i decided to pull the trigger because the 12th gen is the new lga 1700 chip and apparently they will use that for the next 3 gens.,also i got the 12600k for $249 at microcenter.,not a bad deal.,plus my 3090 was starving for more cpu power since i like to play high fps 1080.,6700k was great to me for 5 years.,you looking at the 13600k or 700?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are aware that video editing is very gpu bound as well?,"dont exactly see the point of a massive atx pc for just processing x264, but you do you!",i'd run everything on the same pc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe cause i use it for video editing to ðÿ˜‰,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"an rtx 2070. not the best, but certainly not the worst (i snagged it at about the beginning of 2019 or so).",came from a gtx 970. good mid-tier card.,"i can run basically anything 1080p ultra/maxed out, and well over 60fps.",when i get into the higher res.,i may have to do some tweaking to game settings if i want a constant 60+ fps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just curious.,i think the difference is more than 1c... and it looks better but i can understand if you are on a budget.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my 3060ti is priceless as i got it on 8-9 tries of my order being cancelled from almost every online stores.,finally got at 41k inr from pcstudio in 2020 october.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hell yeah ðÿ˜‚ weâ€™re ahead of the game who needs it when the cpu can handle it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i never said that streaming on one pc will be an awful and problematic experience i just said that dual pcs is still the end game set up in terms of performance and results.,"single pc streaming getting better is great and is for sure what the majority of us are running, but that doesn't change that having two pcs each dedicated to their own task is going to be more powerful and flexible.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah this a great cpu for gaming, but itâ€™s also great for multi tasking as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s cheap 249 for it iâ€™m jealous lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wait, you are using a 12600k with a 3090?",:(,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh damn, yea your 3090 would be getting crippled by the old boy 6700k lol, iâ€™ll probably got 13900k, just because i plan to use for several years like iâ€™ve done with the 6700k, i work on it also so want something beefy.",i held off a bit because i want ddr5 but iâ€™ve seen some issues with using 4 sticks and the speeds are relatively slow / expensive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i render 10 min 1080 60fps videos off this cpu in 1-2 mins haha.,thatâ€™s the reason why i got the cpu.,but i like having my options open if i do decide to game on this down the road.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great assumption but you just sound like a hater ðÿ˜‚.,i make money thatâ€™s why i can buy nice things like this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
some people have more money than common sense ;p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
definition of a hater.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s a great gpu bro!,i wish i had one for this rig haha,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
240 aio vs this is similar.,like i said i was on budget iâ€™m not spending 250 for a aio.,when iâ€™m not even gaming on this build.,but your right itâ€™s definitely cooler like those high end aio.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
youâ€™re right too aio is hella clean!,i thought the noctua hella bulky and ugly ðÿ˜‚ but it gets it done for now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks bro i know itâ€™s tough getting gpus new!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well i still am saving up for one for some triple a games,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yep, it will handle both tasks just fine.",what's your ryzen cpu?,perhaps you could get higher fps by using intel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i know!,it was the main reason i didn't wait for the 13th gen lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sorry for all the replies.,probably the morning coffee.,but i would expect the i7 to probably be better for streaming right?,i'm mostly focused on gaming and word processing lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah.,it was all i could buy a year ago.,"got it for $1,500 so it was retail price.",but yah i know what you are saying.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ðÿ‘,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol trust me i knew what i was doing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hell yeah!,what kind?,30 series is nice for sure!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looks like 5600x going by past posts.,there is nothing wrong with that cpu for gaming.,"the thing is, he doesn't need the capture card at all to do a 2 pc setup, in fact it's easier just using newtek's ndi which is free, using the ndi setup in obs.","no capture card needed, and now viewers can hear you and your teammates without any hardware or weird added sound setup at all.",you just have the game and obs running.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
even the 11600k is $215 on micro.,it's hard not to upgrade with 5 year old hardware,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s a soldier and can doit all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you should probably go 1440 p since your on a 3090,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have no issue with the gpu ðÿ˜…
thatâ€™s a nice price, was it a founders edition?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i hear you.,someone said you have 5600x in your gaming rig.,"now if numbers are to be trusted, 12700k will give better fps than the 5600x.","so, iâ€™m not so sure about your statement unless thereâ€™s a very good explanation.","you can of course do anything with your stuff, but once itâ€™s posted online there is bound to be scrutiny.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3060 or rx 6600 xt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i tried ndi and it's a performance hit in games like csgo (30 to 100 fps depending o ln 720p60 or 720p120), voicemeeter and capturecard resolve the issue",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm actually looking at monitors today.,no idea what to get tho.,any recommendations would be cool,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
haha k. i know it can't do its full potential so didn't know if you were making fun lol.,it's only the evga xc3.,"i had a founders, the card was so freaking nice but apparently they were going for so much i couldn't keep it.",i was getting really lucky at the microcenter near me a year ago.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah my plan is to transform this this a gaming pc then use my 5600x build for streaming.,what people donâ€™t get is that my gaming rig doesnâ€™t have a integrated gpu.,i did this intentionally because gpu prices are bank.,iâ€™m not spending 400 on a 1650 super.,iâ€™d rather spend 800 on a 3070. this will be my baby eventually for gaming.,i also over clocked my 5600x to 4.7 gghz all cores at 1.325 so sheâ€™s doing fine on fps.,i appreciate you being honest!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ðÿ”¥,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you have to turn off enable preview on the main if you have monitors with different refresh rates.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
msi monitor is good bro!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
going for so much?,"should be less expensive than the evga ðÿ¤”

itâ€™s more about what the gpu deserves :p

lucky for sure, microcenter had queues at some point if i remember correctly",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
appreciate your response too!,makes sense.,"thatâ€™s a nice oc, you might want to use the pbo overboost and curve optimiser for that thought, voltage looks a little high for a full time clock.",good luck,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah the queues were ridiculous.,so i never did that.,"but now i remember, got the evga at microcenter and the fe at bestbuy.",got lucky clicking,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i thought about it haha but i was like if i fry it iâ€™ll just go with the 5800x3d coming out.,but itâ€™s been running only like 69c under gaming and runs smooth and stable.,sometimes gotta push stuff to there limits haha,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
windows 10 or 11?,did you click off the cinebench window to watch hwinfo?,also it seems that the score should be just over 1900 for single core.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
win 11. i donâ€™t recall if i clicked off.,where did you find the â€œtypicalâ€ score for single core?,was only able to find multi.,also - is it normal that cpu usage was at like 30%?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just looked up reviews of the cpu.,"like, toms shows an r23 single core result of ~1915.","https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/intel-core-i7-12700k-review/5

one core should be at 100% during the test but other cores, as well as the cpu average, could be anywhere.","try running the test and donâ€™t click off the window, as if you have a single screen setup not keeping cinebench the active program may push the process to an e-core.",you can also look at changing settings -> system -> power mode (not the more common â€œpower planâ€ setting) from â€œbalancedâ€ to â€œbest performanceâ€.,this changes how p/e cores are managed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yup itâ€™s on high performance.,just ran it again and got 1700. i was definitely doing other things multi tasking while running it initially.,guess itâ€™s fine.,well thanks a lot learned a thing or two today with you.,appreciate it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just to be clear, â€œhigh performanceâ€ is the term used for the power plan setting, not the power mode setting of â€œbest performanceâ€, which is a completely different thing.","and in typical microsoft fashion, very confusing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"overclocking a 12600k requires a z690 board, which ends up being like $60+ more than a b660 board.",keep that in mind.,"my personal belief is that it doesnt make much sense to buy a 12600k to overclock it, unless you need other z690 features, as it becomes the same total cost as a 12700f.","the 12700f ends up being essentially the same gaming performance as a 12700k, and performance gains over a 12600k in gaming end up being 0-10%, but typically around 5% averaged.","i dont know if i would consider the box cooler much of value proposition, it will work fine for gaming and general use, but if you do 100% all-core productivity work, you'll see some minor performance loss, like 8%.",plus its not a quiet cooler.,the rm1 stock cooler is better suited for the i3 and i5.,so i would expect to spend at least $30 on a third party cpu cooler regardless of whether you get a 12600k or 12700f.,"in the us we have seen the 12700k (on sale) and 12700f have around a $30-$40 difference to the 12600k, which is a no brainer to get the i7 at that point.","but your canadian prices make it a bit harder of a decision, personally i'd still go for the 12700f at 80 cad more if you ever plan to do any productivity work (encoding, compiles, rendering, game development, etc) or if you plan to keep the cpu for 4+ years, because the extra 2 performance cores will likely come in handy for future games.",though i generally advise against 'future proofing'.,"both are great, and i'd personally favor the 12700f, but it really just depends on personal preference/use cases.","and if you have a weaker gpu, save the money and go with the 12600k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"sure thing, i'll give you an update when i get home and run another bench so i can compare my scores to yours for clarity.","if you lock down a stable undervolt it will help tremendously with temperatures, but one person's settings may not work for another person due to the nature of chip binning.","for instance, a friend of mine tried to set everything up in his bios identically to mine with the same cpu (different batch) and found he couldn't undervolt any lower then -0.0325mv before running into instability issues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just do an undervolt offset.,im on - 0.025 and went from 92c to 84c in cb r23.,in no way you will feel the 1-2% performance loss in actual work or gaming.,even better: do undervolt and a little overclock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
buying new ram to run xmp is not worth it.,your ram xmp is solid and you will see almost no change by swapping to another set with a better xmp profile.,"your ram is most likely made with hynix cjr or djr ics, and thus should overclock fairly well.",you should be able to do ~4000c17 at 1.5v in gear 1. have you tried following this guide?,much of the performance gains of ram oc is found in tuning the secondary timings.,"https://github.com/integralfx/memtesthelper/blob/oc-guide/ddr4%20oc%20guide.md


 if you were to buy new ram, your best option would be to buy some mid-range b-die, like 2x16 gskill or teamgroup 3600 16-16-16, or you could go for 4x8 patriot 4000 16-16-16. both options would run you around $200-250 (us).","again, the idea here is not to run them at xmp, but to overclock them and tune secondary timings.",the reason to buy this ram is that b-die overclocks the best of any ddr4 ic for gaming purposes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your ram is fine - outside of benchmarks faster ram has very little difference in gaming.,you might see a few fps extra where you are cpu bottlenecked but outside of that you wonâ€™t notice it.,i have 3200 mhz cl16 ram with my 12600k.,i was able to try 4400 mhz cl18 for a few days and it didnâ€™t make any noticeable difference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
appreciate the feedback.,this is my first gaming pc since college (almost 2 decades ago now!).,iâ€™m rusty as can be with memory tuning and overclocking.,i will give this a go tonight and see what i can do with the guide!,thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gtx 1070 is still fine.,"as for cpu, we're in a time where (thankfully) both vendors have very competitive offerings again.",amd recently dropped prices to better compete with intel.,"a 12600k, 12700k, 5700x, or 5800x would be a massive upgrade from a 7600k.","if it was my money, i'd wait until amd zen 4 and intel raptor lake and make a decision then.","zen 4 is supposed to ship in the second half of 2022, and i'm sure intel will be around the same time frame.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would start with the cpu.,going to a 12700 with a b660 might be a good option if you can.,otherwise a 12400 is a good option too.,the gpu is still pretty decent.,i feel your cpu is holding you back,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"according to leaks, which aren't always true, it will actually be either at the very end of the year or at the beginning of 2023",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

they are not completely different.,they will have the same chipset(b660 chipset).,they will differ only with aesthetics and features.,there are so many more apart from those two,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if you are not getting a z motherboard you might as well save and get a 12700f ($312 on newegg rn),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yup.afaik you can,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah maybe, but iâ€™m probably gonna upgrade motherboards eventually when ddr5 prices drop, so iâ€™ll be able to take advantage of the k then.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12700k was cheaper than the 12700 when i bought in.,no brainer to go for the k part.,"also, ram overclocks much better on the k part due to the better imc and unlocked voltages.",i'm on a b660 and very happy with the pairing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you'll probably be better off just selling your soon to be purchased cpu once you decide to upgrade to ddr5 unless you're planning on picking up a used z690.,the 12700f really is a great deal for what it is if being paired with b660 or h670.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don't listen to this guy's advice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"fair enough if it was a lower price

you're still choking its performance and limiting its potential on b660.",for a few dollars more you would have had up to 12% better performance (oc'd) and probably a tonne more features on the mobo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm not oc'ing, never wanted to.",don't care about the extra features.,perfectly happy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah i did as they said im the manual i even remounted it again,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i didn't want to say that the ihs doesn't do anything without having test results to back that statement up.,also if you don't want the hassle of direct die.,lm both under and on top of the ihs gets very similar performance in my exp.,a couple mm of copper just doesn't have much thermal resistance at all.,however 0.x mm of indium solder and any amount of convential thermal paste is a massive bottleneck.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

two quick thing.,if you paid with a credit card then donâ€™t sweat it as your purchase is protected should it come to that.,this was probably an honest mistake on best buyâ€™s part.,often times new and open box cpus are kept in close proximity in the stock room and someone probably spaced and forgot to double check.,"iâ€™m sure youâ€™ll get this sorted out, gl!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

my 12700k @ 4.9ghz all core (no e-cores) sits at ~55c in bfv.,did you make sure to have the proper mounting hardware for the 1700 socket?,"if so, there must be something wrong with the pump on your aio.",itâ€™s possible the board is pumping too much voltage to the cpu at stock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"very not normal, i only have a 140mm aio and the temps are max 55 while gaming and 85 while cinebench r23 multicore",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it didnâ€™t come with 1700 only 1200. but the asus board supports 1200 so should be fine iâ€™m assuming?,it was my first build and it was 6 months ago.,should i apply more pressure and reapply the thermal paste?,whatâ€™s your temps on cinebench multi core?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s the problem.,the cpu cooler mounting hardware is different for 1700. when i got my corsair h150i elite capellix i had to separately order the lga1700 standoffs.,check with the manufacture of that aio to get the 1700 hardware.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you have an asus board?,because they support 1200 coolers.,thatâ€™s what iâ€™m trying to tell you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"upgrade mounting kit â€“ lga 1700

"sp rating only accounts for voltage scaling, not how leaky a cpu is.","theoretically, you could have a lower sp cpu that runs cooler, allowing it to hit higher frequencies before becoming thermally constrained.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so you're both ks?,or is your friend a k?,the scales are not the same.,"also, there's another screen in the bios (extreme tweaker -> ai features) where you can see the breakdown of p and e-core sp values.",perhaps one chip's sp rating leans more to the e-core side of things.,"but, with that said, sp score is an automated indication of potential silicon quality based solely on the voltage table, and it is usually a good indicator, but it is still far from the final word on the matter.",i've seen others reporting that supposedly lower-scored chips actually fared better overall.,"like, when der8auer did his 12900ks review and he compared several chips on their max stable core clock, a mere sp80 12900k did 5.2ghz @ 1.274v, while a sp88 12900ks only did the same 5.2ghz @ 1.282v.","https://youtu.be/ow0awfxzhyc?t=476

sure, a sp97 12900ks beat them all, but you really wouldn't expect such little difference between a sp80 k and sp88 ks, and none of them got past 5.3ghz.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its complicated.,unless you're into xoc its honestly just best to ignore it as its not a good indicator for casual overclocking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they are both ks.,my chip is 94 pcore and s78 ecore.,and i can run 5.3 all p core and 4.2 all e core.,his chip is 105 pcore and 75 ecore.,and his can only hit 5.3 all core with much more voltage and ecores have to be at 3.9. we tested both chips on his system and mine to eliminate hardware differences.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

100c within 30 seconds,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have had the cam software installed.,"it hasn't helped much, currenly at 30c and 2315 rpm for the pump.",can you explain a bit more what you mean about the bracket?,"i installed it the backplate and then the standoffs, then the pump portion and lastly the nuts to lock it all down and tighten it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
something is definitely wrong.,i've tested other 7th gen asetek coolers and they stay under tjmax in standard (10m) testing.,"try reseating the cooler, if that doesn't work rma it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the only part of concern is when you attached the backplate & screwed it in with the double threaded ""screws"" it should of been loose & rattled & looked like it would fall off - bit deceptive compared prior brackets.","if it was tight then somethings off, it only becomes tight against the mb when the end caps are screwed in & they don't take much to tighten down.did you re thermal paste it?",that helps if its new out of the box.,[reason for this is due to the bend some get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkd_swdsdiy).,"that is why i did mine longer & ""weld beaded"".",ambient temp could be a factor in your idle (higher) temps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"as i said in the [other thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/intel/comments/u6ic0f/i7_12700f_or_i5_12600k/), only difference is the 12700 has 2 more performance cores, no overclocking and higher turbo tdp limit.",that grants it 10-20% more multi thread performance.,choose a motherboard that lets you edit the power limits.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"hi, my comment is now largely irrelevant due to 13th gen. but i was saying that thanks to two extra p cores on a 12700 will make a much more drastic difference than an overclock on a 12600k as they are already fairly binned from the factory to a point of diminishing returns.","again, ignore this with zen 4 and raptor lake out now.",cheers!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you.,happy birthday!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12700f + b660 from msi with good vrms is best value combo in my opinion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12700f + b660 would be better imo.,no overclocking but more cores is a certain advantage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12700 and b660.,"gaming performance will be really close, but in multitasking and productivity workloads 12700 is the clear winner.",just make sure to get a decent mb with good vrms.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'd go z690 with 12600k.,with 10th gen the b460 didn't support 13th gen processors so it is grey area as to if you will be able to put a 13th gen into a b660.,and when i invest in a platform i want as much upgradeability as possible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i7 12700/f with good b660 motherboard good enough cooler and unlocked power limits and you will be very close to i7 12700k in some cases so yes go with i7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'd say the 12600k with a z690 is probably better.,the cpu has an unlocked multiplier so you can overclock and is a solid choice for the money,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12600k for $250  ddr4 that you should already have and a cheap z690 board for around $200.,"you will be a gaming god, easy oc that beats stock 12900k",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"12700f is better value with a cheap board, 12600k oc is better performance",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i just ordered the i7 12700k and a b660 board  after reading that it is what it is, i decided to return the b660 and found a z690 for the same price.",is the i7 12700k and gigabyte aorus elite ddr z690 a good combination?,everything i've read about it seems good so far aside from just having to update the bios,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12600k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"only difference is the 12700 has 2 more performance cores, no overclocking and higher turbo tdp limit.",that grants it 10-20% more multi thread performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thank you all, i think i'll take the 12700f with the msi mag b660 tomahawk wifi ddr4.",:),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12 core vs 10 core at same cost?,who would u pick,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"12700f for sure, with a b660 it's eat 12600k in a z690",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this depends on your use case and how often you upgrade and gpu that will be paired with.,"if you're just doing gaming at 1080p - 1440p high quality+ and regular computer use such as office work, web browsing, watching shows/movies then 12600k is plenty for you.","get a good ddr4 b-die memory kit, over clock that as much as the imc + mobo allows.",tune that memory and your set.,should you need more cores or power later grab the 13th gen i7 or i9 processor.,you can sell the 12600k so you don't spend more on the new cpu.,if you do need productivity right now where i7 becomes useful then get that cpu.,just for gaming i5 and i7 are same with 1.5% difference in favour of i7.,even for some productivity 12600k is great too.,i'm using the same + oc b die memory.,spend that money on good quality memory instead.,but it's your final decision at the end since you know your use case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you could, maybe the 12700f + z690.",even outside of overclocking the z boards generally have much better features.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i just bought a 12700k and a b660 board, so thatâ€™s what iâ€™d recommend.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"better option is  i7 + b660 if u r not into overclocking also get u more cores and threads and may cost u less also compared to i5 + z690 combo also if you go with b660 mobo with 150 to 170 dollar price tag

if you want to overclock get i5 + z690",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12700f but get a good b660 like the msi mag that will run it with power limits turned up.,the i5 is only 6 cores 12 threads and you will never make up the difference with overclocking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good.,because i just impulse bought those exact things an hour ago.,getting the igpu though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not to mention overclocking cpus isn't worth it as it was in the past u/ramdom_guy_lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but the z490 doesnt support 12th gen either?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
exactly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> easy oc that beats stock 12900k

no it doesnt",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you end up getting the z690 over the b660?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how are you liking the build?,i got the same combo and it's chewing through everything on 65w mode.,nice for summer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes overclocking doesnt really have a real world use case other than more power consumption and heat generation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
of course not they use a different pin layout.,"the 10th and 11th shared the same layout, and the 12th and 13th do as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think he regrets buying that i5 instead of i7 non k lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in gaming yes, i have both the 12600k and 12900k.","12600k is oc'd to 5.3 on core zero and 5.1 on 1 - 5, 40 for e-cores

i can link you my geekbench if you're interested in facts and not speculation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"slightly higher price, slightly higher clock speeds.",good enough reason for me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that isn't necessarily true the k also has better memory overclocking which the b660 does support.,i think i read somewhere a lot of ddr4 3600 on b660 will run gear 2 which kills the performance on a non k cpu.,[link](https://www.reddit.com/r/msi_gaming/comments/scagfz/z690b660_bios_update_improve_nonk_cpu_ram/),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"thereâ€™s nothing wrong with a k in a b660 so long as you arenâ€™t expecting to make use of some of the kâ€™s features, but the biggest thing to watch for is a k takes more power, and many b660 and pretty much all h610 boards do not have vrms capable of supporting even a 12600k.","so long as you get a board known to have a good vrm, itâ€™s fine.","still, i would personally pair a 12700 with a good b660, remove power limits, and call it a day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what's ur gpu?,are you running low settings?,you'll only notice large cpu gains if your gpu isn't the biggest bottleneck.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

turn off mce and either leave it stock or do your own overclock.,mce will pump up the voltage to the max for no reason.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"> and 8 cores to 10 cores there is still a difference in games

?",what games are you referring to?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3090 might show some benefit, even at 5120 x 1440, but it won't be a huge improvement.","in general terms, the 12900ks isn't worth its asking price, but it is slightly faster than the 12900k, technically making it the fastest in intel's line-up.","it's extremely poor value, especially when compared against something like the 12700k which will get you most of that performance in gaming at a fraction of the price.","so, with the 12900ks, you'll be slightly faster, but at a huge price premium (motherboard, extremely expensive ddr5, and the cpu).",is that worth it?,only you can decide that for yourself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so it will only make a difference if you're not gpu limited.,if your gpu utilization is near 100% then you won't see a massive gain.,if you're playing competitive resolutions and settings you would see a decent gain.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks mate you are honestâ€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
warzone for exampleâ€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"but from 9900ks do i see any improvements since it has 8p and 8e, or it performa the same as 9900ks?","ok mine is 5ghz all coreâ€¦ maybe 12900ks 5.2/3ghz and get 5.5ghz on 2 cores or moreâ€¦ but when using big.little cores in games/using windows/opening an an app, loading a game etc,  is the same as 9900ks?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this sub does not understand brs like warzone.,"warzone is a unique animal, it scales off fast cpus, fast low latency memory, and fast gpus.",if warzone is your main game than a 12900k is a nice upgrade over a 9900k.,you shouldnâ€™t be downvoted for mentioning warzone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"benchmarks would show a difference, but in day to day use, you'd probably hardly notice the difference in things like app load time.","gaming will see some improvements, but again, at that resolution you're mostly gpu limited.","the e cores help with background tasks, not with gaming performance (not unless you've got tons of stuff running in the background).","so yes, there will be a difference, but it won't be all that noticeable moving from something like a 9900ks @ 5 ghz.","once you upgrade to something like a 4090, when those get released, the upgrade would make more sense.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thanks a lot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
msi z690-a is pretty much the recommended budget z699 board.,"however, do know that running four sticks of ddr5 can be a challenge, especially if you expect to run it at xmp speeds and not intelâ€™s standard (3600 or 4000 depending on what youâ€™re installing).",if you want it for memory capacity - ie 4 x 16gb - you might want to save up and get 2 x 32gb now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
really depends on what games you're playing.,the 8400 might bottleneck in many games due to not having hyperthreading.,but you should be fine.,"unless you're not getting desired fps, i wouldn't recommend upgrading",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
youâ€™ll see a massive increase in cpu performance.,and a 3070 will definitely bottleneck a 8400.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nahh your cpu is not the bottleneck .,the only reason you would get a 12600k is if you consider buying an rtx 4000/ rx 7000 series gpu .,cpus are in a good place now.,gpus are not .,if you go for a midrange rtx 3000/ rx 6000  series gpu you will be fine (3060/rx 6600 xt).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so i don't need to upgrade either gpu or cpu ya, except for upgrading the cpu and gpu at the same time, right ?","then if i upgrade the gpu to 3070, it will still be the bottleneck right ?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
*the 8400 will bottleneck the 3070..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 8400 would bottleneck a 3070.

if you upgrade to a 12600k and 3070, the 3070 will become the new bottleneck, but you'll get a ton more fps in the process and it's a very good match that should last you 5 years or so.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whether you'll be bottlenecked by your cpu shouldn't be decided by your gpu but instead by what you're using your system for.,i have a 3070 with a 9th gen cpu and have no issues but i play retro games almost exclusively at high resolutions on that system.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"also, you may be getting the *average* fps you desire on 8400, but a 12600k will bring you a huge rise in lows/mins/frametime consistency/smoothness.","going from 10850k to a 12700k for me was a pretty noticeable boost in how butter smooth framerates could be (2080 ti, 3440x1440p)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if u upgrade ur gpu to a 3070, u wld be bottlenecking hard.","rn, i cant really say whether u need to or not since u havent listed any games.","while gaming, if the gpu usage is above 95%, u dont need to upgrade ur cpu, if it is lower than 90% u might to upgrade cpu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

sounds about right.,im at 30k with the mora 360 on it 5.5p 4.3 e,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
should get higher running stock with no oc.,i'm at 27.8k consistent @ 95c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'd try to reduce the voltage as much as i can to reduce the temperature, also you try to re-paste and perhaps tighten the cooler to have better contact",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"cinebench r23, while a very good test, does suffer from fluctuations/repeatability.","i would say fully stock, a 12900k score of 26700-27400 is perfectly normal.",running the long 10 minute test can help smooth those fluctuations out a bit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the hard drive is the problem.,it is slow and when the game suddenly needs to load some data your system will have to wait for the data to load in and that causes sudden fps drop or stutter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the problem is ur 8gb of ram.,unless u mean 2x8gb.,i5 8400 should really be okay paired up with a 1070 ti.,"8400 might be problematic in warzone, but generally 12400 is a massive upgrade and you shouldnt see any stuttering.",are those ram stick cl14?,"generally ram sticks shouldnt really create stuttering, only lower 1% lows.",stuttering is generally ubrupt and not consistent bad frametimes.,"if u moniotr ur gpu usage, if its not 99% then you'll see a difference, the further the higher.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

just to back up my point, i upgraded my old pc from a ryzen 5 1600 (6 cores 12 threads) to an i3-10100f (4 cores 8 threads) and this current i3 (paired with an rx 5600 xt) should perform about the same as that i5-8400 according to userbenchmarck.",i play warzone from an ssd and it is very good.,with the framerate unlocked i can be around 80fps at 1440p.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

some more things you can do: -

disable unnecessary start-up apps

"cinebench runs avx2 mostly l3 cache it doesnâ€™t push 125% of the cpu tdp so iâ€™m standing by my point that small ffts no avx is the thermal test that even you want to go by

we don't only use our machines for gaming.,"1% is margin of error stuff, and 12900k overclocked is more than 1% faster clockspeed.",so the 5800x3d loses in against that chip.,getting 100% more multicore performance for a chip that costs only 24% more is 100% worth it.,not to mention the upgrade path and newer features.,ddr5 will also only mature further allowing for even faster ram sticks to widen that gap back up.,ddr4 is eol topped out.,https://www.newegg.com/intel-core-i9-12900kf-core-i9-12th-gen/p/n82e16819118341?description=12900k&cm\_re=12900k-\_-19-118-341-\_-product,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

good point but the issue is that we can oc sticks to hit 3800 cl14 on dr for amd which i think hbu should have used to show off max limits of the 5800x3d for curiosities sakes while intels 12th gen is stuck with motherboards that have ocing issues on the ddr4 and ddr5 boards with bios among other problems.,that and ddr5 has no dr 2x32gb kits out yet so until those are out or intel patches out it's issues (and there are several) for it this comparison works but it will probably need another do over with both sticks using tweaked dr setups but at that point alder lake and 5800x3d would be outdated lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm not really sure what you are trying to say.,my point was that at current used market price for a 6700k (around $140) on ebay.,the difference in performance does not match the difference in price between the 5800x3d and the 6700k.,"i get that it's one of the fastest cpus in gaming but that does not meant it's ""good"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

pair it with high end ddr5, you get a gaming chip faster than amds fastest- the 5800x3d, and you get a application chip faster than amds fastest- the 5950x.",you can overclock it more than zen 3. future compatibility for raptor lake cpus.,"cons of the 12900ks:

runs hotter, especially in mt tasks, because it uses more power.",little cores can still cause some problems in some unoptimized workloads.,bugs might need another generation to be fully ironed out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

- amd has unfixed issues with usb at chipset level that have remained despite bios updates.,i am waiting for am5 to see if itâ€™s resolved.,"- most current existing alder lake core series will fully support full (side band, not just on-die) ecc with w680 chipset motherboards, rather than â€˜just not disables but not well supportedâ€™ on am4.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel uses more power in multicore loads, but similar in gaming.","if your cpu fan is hot, get a new cooler.","you can get something good enough for $30-50 you could also get a 5800x3d and  get around the same gaming performance as 12900k that uses ddr4 and maybe a little more, but less than if it uses ddr5.","the advantage of a 12900k is better multicore performance, and a higher single core speed, and ddr5 support.","as well as pcie5 support (unless you really cheap out on motherboard) for future gpus, although pcie4 is still just fine, and will also work.",and you can also upgrade to the intel 13th gen in 6 months or so.,"am4 is a dead-end platform after the 5800x3d release in a few days, with no more future cpus coming....at least as far as we know.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"it's because of a setting, ramp up time delay or something along those lines.",i can't remember the exact word for it.,fan rpm delay?,"basically without adjusting the setting, your cpu fan will think that your cpu is 80c for a millisecond and ramp up a lot of rpm and be noisy.",if you change the setting to like 5 seconds then it'll be fine.,basically what happens with ryzen 3000 series is that they ramp up for a millisecond and the cpu fan doesn't understand that it's actually not that warm yet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ddr5 is expensive but has started and will continue to drop in price and of coarse its pricey its new.,its also magnitude faster than ddr4.,so how do you figure that the i9 12900k (not even mentioning the ks)which beats the 5950x in almost everything and any benchmark take your pick dominates the leaderboards followed by 4 or 5 more alder lake cpus and by quite a bit the 5800xwhich has half the cores and  thread of the 5950x.,"so how could just an increased l3 cache make it ""as fast""?","the only thing i saw was a ddr4 comp and it only beat by a few frames some games most again still beat it in and not by 4 or 5 fps in that was with the same dsr4 kit but you said ddr5 so what ""reviews"" are referencing?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this is specifically for 12th gen, but i imagine most people looking to upgrade wouldn't be going older at this point.","but the cause is the performance/efficiency core split, they redid the thread scheduler in windows 11 to make better use of them so you get ~10-15% more performance on windows 11 vs windows 10. so technically it's not required to upgrade, but you're losing a decent chunk of performance if you don't.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i don't understand why someone wouldn't take ~30mins to undervolt to have lower consumption and lower temps.,"it's really simple, you just go and set cpu voltage to adaptive (auto) and use a -60mv offset as a start.",stress test a bit and go with a lower offset if stable until you can't anymore.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"- the 11400/12400 cpus are known to bring the stock cooler to about 80â„ƒ in games, see reviews

- cpu wattage is typically a guideline, not an exact figure, and motherboards (varying by maker and model) are known to exceed guidelines and is relatively safe to do so

- cpu wattage may not be measured completely correctly in software

- per the [11400f page](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/212271/intel-core-i511400f-processor-12m-cache-up-to-4-40-ghz/specifications.html), the 65w tdp is ""the average power"", and assuredly turbo boost will exceed that wattage (this is by design for all cpus, usually for a certain period of time before 'slowing down' if necessary -- see [power limits: pl2 & pl1](https://www.anandtech.com/show/13544/why-intel-processors-draw-more-power-than-expected-tdp-turbo))

- your cpu will draw as much wattage within the limit the motherboard allows for, not up to necessarily up to that limit in entirety (so allowing for 500w doesn't mean it will use 500w)

tldr: your cpu and cooler are operating normally",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

short duration is pl2.,"power time window is ""tau"" (how long pl2 lasts under load before going to pl1.)",only adjust pl1 and pl2.,"pl1 going to 65-80 watts and pl2 being safe at any wattage value (you'll see temp spikes during tau, but that's fine.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

a lot of times it doesnt make much sense to upgrade an old cpu on an old socket.,for example a 9600k costs around $140 used on ebay and loses in both single thread (gaming) and multithread to a brand new 12100f which costs $100.,"however i would not recommend buying the 12100f with your rtx 2060 for valorant, instead i would recommend the 12400f which costs around $180 and is significantly faster, and you can pair it with a cheap b660 or even h610 board because the cpu uses such low power that high end vrm designs arent needed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"don't get a 2060 12 gb, get a 6gb version there's absolutely no reason for 12gb lmfao, also ye 9600k-10600k or anything around that tier will match nicely with a 2060, 5600g is ok but it's main selling point at this point is it's igpu, if u don't need that then the 10600k is cheaper and faster for gaming.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would suggest looking at new 12th gen cpu's.,i was on the exact same cpu as you so i know whats it's like.,if your willing to go for a kf look at the 12600kf or 12600k.,these are the best value for money and comes with 10 cores.,in terms of motherboards i'd look for z690 as it would allow you to overclock.,depending on how much your willing to spend look at the z690 ud series from gigabytye.,if your looking at asus and want to spend more money there are z690 rog strix and from msi there is the meg and mag series.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you're going to get a new mobo, then a 12400f with a b660 or h610 (if u can't get a b660) will be a good choice.",even getting a 12100f is good.,"but if u can get it, get the 12400f.","if you're staying on the same mobo, try to get a second hand i7 that's supported (i think the 9700f is supported?).","if your mobo has terrible vrms, get a 9600kf.",i recommend getting a new mobo with a 12400f.,"because if u just upgrade your cpu, say to a 9700 or a 9600kf, it will get obsolete pretty fast.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the 12400f and 5600 are about on par (i'm am intel fanboy so don't ask me which of the two i'd prefer).",the 12100f has the same core speed but just has four cores instead of the sic of the other two.,you will get 90%+ of the gaming performance with a significant price saving.,"as for your provided options, the 5600g is a graphics focused apu.",most of its value proposition is being able to use it without a dedicated gpu but the other edge of the sword is that it makes cache and architecture sacrifices.,the 9600kf may be alright but the jump up to the above mentioned cpus will provide you with a huge performance leap.,"in terms of gpu, i would definitely consider a non 12gb version of the 2060. also, any of the below options at a good price would most likely be better than the 2060 with more modern feature sets:

- radeon rx 6600 or 6600 xt
- rtx 3060 or 3060 ti

if you can find a 6600 or 3060 for cheaper then the 2060, you'll be getting on par performance at worst or higher performance for a cheaper price.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you mean i5 or i3 10600k?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
real overkill for a 2060,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there is no i3 10600k, there's a 10100 and 10100f tho, but ye the i5 10600k/kf",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also 9600k and 10600k are pretty damn close.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not really.,i have a 1080 with a 12600k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a 1080 is way better than a 2060 fyi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ye, n that's def overkill, something more like a 10400f or r5 3600 would be better match, leaves plenty of room for upgrade if you have a 12600k tho.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just went up to 12700f and z690 msi with 1060 6b gpu.,iam very happy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not by much.,has 2gb more vram and is like 10% better overall in most games.,"secondly, it's better to have a gpu bottleneck than a cpu bottleneck",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
correct.,for me i can upgrade to a 40 series card and now worry about my cpu bottlenecking me in the future.,also the 12600k has ddr5 so in the future you'll be ready.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wise choice.,although once the 40 series is out i'll be getting one of them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i guess yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ye, nowadays i don't blame you for having an overpowered cpu just cuz it is so hard to get a decent gpu.",i got a 10600k and a 1070 and the 10600k never breaks 50% usage lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mine varies around the 40-70%.,if your not up for a 10 core course look at the other i5s or i7s.,12400 or 12600 would be good since their 6 core 12 thread cpus.,or lookal at the i7 non k since their high performance even at 65w,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"what they've officially stated is launch in 'summer', compared to mobile 5/7 'early summer'.",anything past 'early summer' puts it in calendar q3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this will get steam rolled by lovelace and rdna3.,shouldâ€™ve released this in june 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"honestly, it doesn't matter.","they missed their window by not launching during the gpu apocalypse uncontested, so now they have to go against nvidia and amd offerings with mature drivers in a health(ier) market.",might as well take the l at this point and just figure out your drivers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"their gonna take an l. the market is getting better and by the time it comes out, amd and nvidia will have their gpus at a few % above msrp.",therefore making these card useless.,"they won't be faster, they might be a bit less expensive, and their launching gpus close to next gen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"more competition, more fun.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well considering the frame stuttering in the arc a350m for mobile that was recently tested, my money is on bad drivers and at this point intel should just work on the drivers.",they missed a critical chance to disrupt the market.,now new gpu prices have fallen down hard.,not yet at msrp but much better.,the second hand market will be flooded with rdna2 and 3000series from nvidia and not mention the rtx4000 series and rdna 3 gpus coming soon.,this will be really rough  on intel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when will intel learn that blatantly lying to investors will get them nowhere?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, thats basically all she wrote for arc...

i know for a fact intel won't price them relative to their performance vs other cards.","i hope i am incorrect, as aggressive pricing is the only thing that will save them.","that creates an even bigger problem for them though, if they start out low priced, they will remain there for many years.",thats just the way the market works.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cool i'll sell my intel stock then,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to be honest, even if they launched in june 2021, they'd have probably all been gobbled up by miners.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not if it's dirt cheap like polaris.,both lovelace and rdna3 will be starting at minimum 400$ for the lowest model.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mmmhmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they're going to have to seriously discount those cards to sell next to nvidia and amd.,can't see many people taking a chance on the first gen of cards especially in the enthusiast market when the top arc card is only at 3070 level of performance.,and then by august and september all of the talk will be on rtx 40 and rdna3 which will blow these cards out of the water.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they're making them at tsmc so it didn't matter.,"if these were being made at intel fabs, well they'd be worse if they were being pushed out on a broken 10nm a year ago or 14nm due to power efficiency.",being made at tsmc means when tsmc were starved for capacity these would have been even worse.,using tsmc 6nm indications would be that performance is closer to amd/nvidia parts that use half the die size.,the only way these matter in the first gen or two is if intel does it's atom/phone/tablet tactic and just firebombs pricing to force their way into relevancy but if the architecture doesn't catch up then eventually when they try to charge real prices they'll be pushed out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
more competition more fun works if wafer supply is ample and performance is competitive.,"if performance sucks and they eat up supply of incredibly limited wafers then it's terrible for everyone, intel included.",they'll be eating shit selling these at below what they cost to produce and amd/nvidia lose out supply to make twice as many gpus from the same wafers and the end user loses out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thats just clock gating.,easily fixable.,"look at the gpu speed every stutter, you will see it drop to 1150mhz.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at least they wouldâ€™ve sold (not defending miners).,now they have zero chance of becoming dominant in any market,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most accounts put it at so much less efficient that there is really no way for intel to tank pricing that much.,"if these were ultra small but efficient and somehow couldn't scale up in size due to the architecture that is one thing, but being on the other end of the spectrum is bad.",~400mm^2 cores competing with ones at half the size on worse nodes is not conducive to plentiful $200 good performing cards and that's before you get to terrible drivers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most of them are probably going straight to oem.,"oems will use it as a way to tell amd/nvidia to fuck off with their horrid ""incentives"" like priority allocation.",most people buying computers don't know what the hell goes in them so the main problem is drivers.,if the drivers continue to be miserable then intel will get nowhere even giving these things away for free.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"tsmc 6nm is a retooled 7nm, so the density is not that dissimilar.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how is it fixed if u dnt mind explaining?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"efficiency wise it's better than gtx 1600, at least the already released laptop 350m which at around 40w has same performance as gtx 1650m at 50w.",that's not too bad.,probably on the same level as rtx 3000 as efficiency didn't improve much compared to gtx 1600 and 2000.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you can tell very little about higher end efficiency from lower end chips as a huge portion of power is pci-e, memory controller and other blocks apart from pure performance core parts.","also if it's performing the same as a chip with a much lower transistor count and is only a little bigger on a 12nm node vs a 6nm node, then no they aren't close to the same efficiency.","a 150mm^2 6nm chip shouldn't perform close to a 200mm^2 12nm chip, it should crush it at the same power level.",that's all before you get to things like iq where in every single comparison video i've seen intel drivers are absolutely killing iq to boost performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
motherboard being used might help.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
following for info.,"also have 12600k, struggling to find the right settings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hey can you share settings to oc 12600k?,i got the same cpu and msi z690 ddr4 mobo.,what cpu cooler are you using?,need to oc mine as well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hmmm firstly whats your voltage for the cpu.,if you don't have enough voltage than your cpu might not be able to hit 4.0ghz on the e-cores.,"secondly, turn off any multi core enhancements or cpu upgrades in the bios since these can interfere with cpu clock speeds.","thirdly what exactly are you using to do this overclock, bios is preferred over xtu and other windows software eg.","gigabyte easytune, cpu tweaker etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you updated the bios recently?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
download the intel xtu program.,really good for testing without having to go into the bios,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m using an msi pro-a ddr4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
personally iâ€™ve setted p-cores at 5.1ghz with 1.27 of v-core and ring frequency at 4000mhz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"p-core multiplier 51, p-core v-core 1.27. e-core multiplier 40 and 4000mhz ring frequency",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"e-core voltages are at 1.2, maybe is too little?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the bios is updated, i resolved by resetting bios to stock settings.","anyway, thank you",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and how are you making these changes?,in bios or a software utility?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i cant find the vcore setting for my mobo.,i just made a post where i showed my bios settings if you'd be willing to take a look.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you leave your ecores alone?,i was thinking i might need to do e and ring at 4000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whats your cpu voltage overall (including the p-cores).,these 12th gen chips need a little more voltage than it seems.,for me to hit 4.9ghz all p-core and 3.7ghz e-core i need around 1.33 to 1.36,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bios settings :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the v-core settings are in the bottom of oc settings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
where says â€œcpu core voltage [auto]â€.,just click there and use numbers to set v-core,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have p-cores at 5.1ghz with 1.27 v-core, 4.0 on e-core with 1.2 v-core and 4000mhz at ring ratio .",iâ€™ll try with more v-core on e-cores,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
turbo **group** doesn't work with e-cores for some reason on msi motherboards.,just use all-core  setting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok so i did that but i had set it to 1.34 based on another guide.,you're thinking try it at 1.27?,it didnt even help when i left it at auto and upped the cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seems you might have a good undervolting cpu.,mine can't do 5.0ghz all p-core without having close to 1.4 volts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™ve used â€œall coresâ€, bios update resolved this",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™m having no trouble with 1.27, when i go over this voltage it crashes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good for me.,thank you so much for the advices,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when u go over those voltages it crashes?,"something's wrong, maybe ur overheating?","also, have u stress tested it at all?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you liquid cooled by chance?,"im just running fans, not sure if thats playing into it at all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"this is why you don't look up ""windows drivers"" on google and click the first link",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
does this diode lights up as some numbers or letters?,or is it just one dot of light?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can it boot into safe mode?,or off a live boot cd/usb?,"if so, you can try to uninstall the drivers, run anti-virus scan, restore, etc, to try and bring back the windows install.","but if youre saying it wont post at all, that's going to be a much harder issue to fix, because the software might've installed a bios update that either was corrupted or was intended to brick the system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
still i don't think that a bad drivers can destroy whole component.,maybe it gave too much voltage?,or electricity went off during instalation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just dot of light,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if you paid by credit card then contact your provider, explain the situation and initiate a charge back.",you will then be refunded and the seller will have to ten deal with your credit card provider.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
really sad to hear that op!,hope you get it all sorted out by either a refund or new items.,"as a side note: when dealing with delicate, costly items like this, waiting for the delivery man to receive it in person while recording everything helps.","so, basically: you hear the delivery ringing the doorbell, you start recording.","open door, greet delivery, get package, keep recording and unbox your package.","while this isn't common, its risky on very costly items, so it is quite worth it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"fulfilled and sold by amazon, or sold by a third party?",box very clearly sealed or possibly tampered with by couriers?,"honestly, these kinds of issues are pretty much impossible to prove either way.","itâ€™s your word that you really didnâ€™t get the parts, versus their worry that you did and are just trying to rip them off.",paying by credit card helps.,being a long-standing customer of amazon would help too.,"without that, this could well be an uphill battle.",about the weirdest amazon experience i had - versus a couple decades of buying way too much stuff from them - is i ordered a wireless mouse and received an empty plastic bubble pack envelope.,"it was clearly sealed, never opened or tampered with, but utterly empty, like they simply forgot to fill it.",otherwise they have a remarkably good track record for as long as iâ€™ve used them with not screwing things up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah it was fufilled and sold by amazon.,"my trackrecord is quite good, i dont return alot of stuff unless its faulty and i have not had this issue once before, i have complained once or twice about the delivery drivers/ contractors who say they attempted a delivery when in reality they did not.","but i guess iâ€™ll wait and see what happens to the case, im 80% sure that im wasting my words with amazon.","feels like i should record every box i open now, the only proof i can conjure up is that the serial numbers are different on packaging for the processor.",box didnt look tampered with but tracking was a bit interesting as it was delayed by a day when it â€œarrived final destination â€œ and then went out for delivery and an â€œattemptâ€ was made 15 mins later.,next day it got scanned again and says â€œreached final destination â€œ again,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think this was clarified for me that the numbers on the box were different but this is because they are part numbers.,i can take more photos if you would like however as you mentioned the cpu and ram were likely stolen or the stock which is fulfilled by amazon was a return.,"&#x200b;

ignore the haters.,$6k for a build that will last you another 5 years isnâ€™t all that unreasonable.,"itâ€™s barely over a grand a yearâ€¦ some people dump tens of thousands into their cars or have a garage full of motorcycles, some people collect rare coins, comics or even pokã©mon cards and some people even spend tens of thousands to get covered in tattoosâ€¦ to each their own.",the people commenting about the amount being spent are most likely pretty young and donâ€™t have an established career or investments.,i part out my builds and sell them off every two years or so and build fresh.,i put the amount of the sold parts right back into my build.,"you get more for older components than one might realize, especially parted out.",itâ€™s my hobby and i go big like the kind of build youâ€™re talking aboutâ€¦ in fact i recently built a very cool modded custom iâ€™m about to post on r/watercooling with almost identical components (except 12900k and evga ftw3 3090 hc).,"i canâ€™t help myself, high end hardware makes me happy and thatâ€™s ok!","also, when you can reward yourself with nice things for all your hard work, it makes the hard work worth it.",as long as you donâ€™t spend beyond your means and are responsible about your finances then go for it and have fun!,iâ€™ve been building high-end custom/modded watercooled builds for personal and for profit for 15 years now.,i majored in industrial design.,"if you want or need any help, send me a chat!",have fun!,!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

\-------------------

the difference between a $5,000 pc and $2,500 pc is not 100% more performance.",it is about 20% more performance.,"the difference between $1250 to 2,500 pc is about 30% performance max.",the more expensive the parts the less value you get per dollar in pc parts.,some things make sense to spend more on.,those things being items that directly affect your fps.,some things make no sense to spend more on.,"like anything made by corsair, which has a 35-50% brand name tax.",they are the beats headphones of the pc component space.,"they can't compete on quality, performance, or price.",but they have a well known name.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"to be honest i actually went with the k chip and b660 as well, but thereâ€™s not exactly a point since the b660 isnâ€™t really set up to supply power for oc chips.",if youâ€™re interested in overclocking then go for the z690 and k but you will probably also need to water cool at that point.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a lot of it depends on what you're willing to do something like the tomahawk z690 would provide the ability for you to dial the chip in.,you might not necessarily even overclock it but you can tinker with the voltage and get it running as cool as possible at a given frequency.,this can be extremely useful if you get a board that defaults the voltage too high.,it also would allow you to boost it to whatever that particular chip is capable of in the future should you want to overclock it somewhat.,i mean you already have a k chip.,you're going to have a good water cooler.,personally i would spend the extra few dollars a decent entry-level z690 like that msi tomahawk,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, iâ€™m not interested in overclocking at all.","then i just need to buy 12700 version without â€˜kâ€™ and b660 mobo, right?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yup, you got it!",and then keep in mind as well the 12700 will have integrated graphics which can be nice when you're setting up if you have any gpu issues.,the 12700f will not have integrated graphics but will save you a few more dollars,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
click bait title but a good point.,ddr5 is a poor value right now compared to ddr4 and compared to the higher clocked ddr5 sticks that will be available in a couple of years.,"but today's ddr5 sticks are no more ""e-waste"" than ddr4-2400 sticks from 2015. not great for high-end gaming anymore, but they still can work in a budget build 7 years later.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"as someone who was still on ddr3 with haswell, i'm perfectly happy to upgrade straight to ddr5 now.",that memory has a better chance of carrying forward than ddr4 would.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"seems like your argument is basically â€œthis new stuff is expensive and not as fast as it will be in the future.â€

that's nothing new though.,it was the same story when ddr4 came around.,"the first ""high end"" kits of ddr4 were either 2400 or 2666.

that's nonsense.,"no cpu in existence today (and probably motherboard) can actually support 8000+ speeds, so even if those 8000 kits existed today, you couldnt use them anyways.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i hate how slow this process is.,"i'm sitting here on a 7700k and ddr4 that's over 5 years old now because 8700k,9900k and 10900k have all been the exact same ipc with the exact same memory, and don't offer any performance boosts for me.","11900k same memory again, and only a very slight ipc boost.","12900k decent ipc boost and offers new memory, but the new memory is overpriced and underperforming.",that's 5 years of extremely limited progress and all the while the cost of that upgrade is astronomical.,it's a complete ripoff.,i'm tired of this crap.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"by that definition all electronics are e-waste, because they'll all be obsolete someday.","yeah, new technology early tends to be obsolete sooner, but somebody has to be the first one to buy it.",that doesn't mean it's bad advice to wait until a technology has matured to adopt it.,that *is* what most people should do.,it's overly melodramatic to call it e-waste though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and?,when new ddr5 launches i'll upgrade to that as well.,most likely it will coincide with the launch of a totally new platform anyways.,everyone loves a good upgrade!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

stuff like this is why i'm still using ddr4-4400 cl 19. with modern cache i very much doubt there will ever be a workload i put on it that will bottleneck on memory.,"as for ddr5, i'll wait until it matures and we find out what the ideal frequency to cas latency to price balance is.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'm of the same opinion.,i'd definitely wait a year before getting a ddr5 setup.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think you are overestimanting count of people who buy ram modules by themselves.,"i think most computers are still sold as one piece (mostly company workstations, but also gaming pcs).",and those will usually go for whatever is cheapest for them because ram modules does not make that big difference as better cpu/better graphic card can do.,"and also - most computers around me are somewhere between 2133 - 2666 ddr4, hell lot of them even run ddr3 and you know what?",people dont care.,even i run 2400 mhz ram on my computer.,those 200 usd for new 32gb ddr4 3600+ mhz ram wont make that big difference so i will rather throw it at new cpu or gpu and will probably carry mine 2400mhz to new gen of cpu i am planning to buy (ofc depending on the situation).,but ram always had worst fps-per-dollar ratio.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

current ddr5 chips are the prototypes that manufactures are building in low quantities to develop their technology.,there is a reason why these chips are only being used in the custom pc gaming market and no server or enterprise solution is using ddr5 yet.,"during this year the first production lines of non-prototype ddr5 memories will start manufacturing chips, samsung for example has already announce their 7200mhz chips for servers, using these chips we will see +10.000mhz factory overclocked ddr5 kits.",corsair said some months ago that they are already testing 10.000mhz sticks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

any ddr4 over 3200mhz is overclocked beyond jedec's specifications.,the cpu manufacturers do not tell people to use that memory.,"if you really want overclocked memory, you could just overclock the 3200mhz memory.","they use the same ics as the factory overclocked memory, so it makes no sense to pay a premium.",:/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is milking unsuspecting buyers more than anything else given that there is no reason why they could not have targeted ddr5-8400 at the start.,they intentionally designed the memory to be slower than the specification allowed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there were ddr4 dimms that did 3200mhz or more at the beginning in 2015 before the skylake launch:

whatever intel launches in 2024-2025 is not going to be backward compatible with your motherboard.,"you would still need to buy a new motherboard unless you go with raptor lake, which is unlikely to make a noticeable improvement.",intel never sells upgrades for existing motherboards that are worth buying for ipc gains.,those are reserved for incompatible sockets.,:/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the spd on the dimms is actually storage.,the xmp profiles stored in them are overclocking profiles and using them will void your warranty.,just check with intel and amd.,they made this clear years ago.,i do not think you know as much about this topic as you think you do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there is still a market for low speed ddr3.,they're selling though not as much as higher speeds obviously.,but we're also now generations past ddr3.,the main use case for low speed ddr5 is going to be people who have pre-builts or oem workstations and want to upgrade from 8gb of ddr5 to 16gb or whatever and don't care about speed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cross that bridge when i get to it - my board came with a guarantee of running up to at least 8400 jedec when it's available.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm still not talking about the cpu, just the ram.",your post was about ram.,i'm going to be able to put higher speed ddr5 ram in my current motherboard in 3 years time.,that's all.,nothing else.,which is better financially than buying ddr4 now and being stuck on ddr4 for 7 years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's misleading to say the spd is storage.,it's simply meant to allow the chip to identify itself to the bios.,"i stand by my previous statements the chip doesn't have any say or ability to set it's voltage, speed, or timings.",all chips are not created equal and the premiums are there for a reason.,factory overclocked is much different than profiles for xmp.,"factory overclocked implies that, by default, the chip will run with a set of characteristics, which is not true.","xmp is simply a 'hey try these settings it might work' that you can manually decide to attempt in the bios, if the bios even supports the ability to overclock.","anyway, i really don't care if you think i'm informed about the topic or not, my reason for commenting was to rebuttle your misleading and misguided comments about how ram works.",i'm sure your googling in the past 15 minutes has made you feel like an expert and maybe you even learned a thing or two.,nice!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it does but nothing would have stopped intel preparing that die from day-1 for adl, nor nvidia porting that ip from ga100 > ga102 (or any of the other ampere does).",nvidia chose to use gddr6(x) with ampere because it was more economical (not the fastest or coolest) and intel chose not to do that so raptor lake would help fit the gap between adl and mtl.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the issue is twofold in both price and low speeds versus what future cpus will want, but yes, it ultimately becomes a matter of much you are forced to spend.","if the present ddr5 were half the cost of ddr4, i would say to go for it since buying ram that will not be great for upgrades is fine if it is cheap enough.","sadly, the market does not sell ddr5 for any sane price.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
really?,what board is that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the i5 should be fine unless you're pushing high settings or high fps.,it should be fine for 60 fps gaming.,you should be capping your fps to limit processor usage to your monitor refresh rate.,don't expect 144 hz gaming on that processor.,idle at 10-20% most of the time is too high.,my i5-2500 downclocked right now is idling at around 4% when i'm not doing anything with just my browser and a program open running in the background.,50% background usage while gaming is also unacceptable.,definitely something going on with whatever you have installed/configured.,"sure, a better processor would definitely help, but i don't think the i5-6600k is trash worthy unless you're expecting higher fps, or trying to play challenging(performance wise) games.","i'd see what the culprit of your usage is first, before you jump on any upgrades.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not worth it.,put it towards raptor lake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you overclock both then they are really close in gaming.,the extra 5mb of cache only helps a little bit.,they are pretty much the same chip minus 4 extra e cores that don't affect gaming either way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
every new gen of tech is not about outright speed increase.,itâ€™s about how much data can be sent and received simultaneously.,think about utilisation.,it was very hard to utilise 32 gig of ddr4.,with ddr5 the system can easily reserve and call on most of that installed which equals higher quality settings and smoother gameplay.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no one is mentioning boost difference which i think is the key point over the e cores(which really would only be of assistance during compile).,"here you will see a 2-4% improvment

yea but it's still old and the cpu is trash,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
start up a game and open task manager to see whats using your cpu.,i have some cisco security software (basically norton) that my uni had to put on my laptop.,sometimes it will spike to 100% cpu usage and my computer will lag a ton.,"if you have something like that, hopefully its just security scanner app like mine, but it might be also malware so you definitely would want to know.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if this doesnâ€™t work, my recommendation would be to reinstall windows.",maybe even grab an old ssd or a new ssd and do a fresh install of windows on it so you donâ€™t erase your main drive while testing.,if itâ€™s still spiking to 100% that will narrow it down to a likely hardware issue somewhere atleast,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

for what?,"if it's being idle, then yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
during games... at idle voltages are much lower in 0.86... something,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it looks like stock voltages.,so it's probably fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no dude.. it isn't stock voltages.. i captured image during game,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
stock means factory default,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s kinda high but fine if your temps are manageable.,under 1.37 v will be fine for longevity if temps are good.,obviously the lower the better the cpu could likely run at a much lower vcore and your motherboard is likely dumping too much voltage on its default settings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i removed the power limits...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
these are voltages during game... not when the cpu is idle.. at idle voltages are much lower,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea i know i read your posts and the other comments.,"1.34 is a little high, with 1.37 being the highest youâ€™d ever want to run outside of a custom loop or ln2.",you can likely probably turn it down a lot based bc your motherboard set to â€œautoâ€ will push more than necessary to ensure youâ€™re stable.,1.34 is fine if you can cool that (temps are fine under full load) but iâ€™m certain you could run it lower.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how does this compare to nvidia's current lineup?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no.,12600k might be it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nah.,"highly multithreaded stuff was not nearly as common when the 2500k came out, overclocking was more substantial, and the market headed into a pretty long period of stagnation that we aren't seeing signs of hitting again at this time.","these days, many programs and games see a marked benefit from more cores, and competition is pretty hot.",zen 4 is said to be going along well.,"meteor lake is too, and intel's lunar lake after that is rumored to be something impressive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'd say probably no.,if amds new 5800x3d is faster than a 12900k than it wont be long until the 7000 series is announced which will be even faster.,not saying it's a bad chip.,all the mid range intel chips are worth their money.,but in a few years time the 4 core cpus will become obsolete.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 2500k benefited from having no competition from amd for 5 years.,we arenâ€™t in times like that again yet it would appear.,i ran a 2600 non k for a long time before upgrading to a 9700k.,i also went to a 1440p 165 hz monitor and did a full upgrade at that time.,"if i was still targeting 1080p 60hz, the 2600 would likely still do a decent job",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

my bank account wants it to be like before but the hobbyist says thank the engineers for bring us such good hardware.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a quad core will be all that games need for along time.,it is a shame that intel does not offer high end quad cores anymore.,a 5.6ghz 12th generation quad core would be amazing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not to be crass or anything but we've been hearing the doom and gloom about 4/8 processors since zen first released five years ago yet here we are where the same configuration is arguably stronger than ever with the price and performance.,"i think they'll be totally suitable for solid budget options for a while yet especially if someone is just pairing it with a theoretical equivalent value gpu like a 3050, 1660s or whatever.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that's overselling quad cores a bit.,"they're the minimum viable for a decent gaming experience in a wide variety of modern games (many run poorly or don't run at all on dual cores), but no reviews have quad cores competing with top chips, nor can they overclock in a way that'll allow them to compete like the 2500k could during its heyday.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not really.,i'd say more like 4-5 years.,the cpu is definitely worth the money but intel should definitely consider having the i3's as 6 core cpus.,the i5's got a big upgrade from 6 cores to 10 cores and the i3 should get some form of upgrade aswell.,it's even rumored that 13th gen i5's will have 14 cores on the k models and the i9 will have 24 cores.,they should also consider adding a k i3 since your comparing a k model to a non-k model which will limit the life span of the cpu in the future.,not having an overclockable cpu just limits performance if your to upgrade the gpu down the line,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

>the cpu is definitely worth the money but intel should definitely consider having the i3's as 6 core cpus.,"i think it's more likely intel will add several small cores to the quad core i3 at some point, which would make it a 12 thread chip with 4x8 large p-cores and 4 small e-cores.",i wouldn't be surprised intel starts adding efficiency cores to their budget chips with 14th gen meteor lake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes.,apparently 13th gen will have lga1700 so i can also upgrade my cpu in the future if i wanted to.,but i'm on a 12600k so i'm fine with 10 cores.,no game will utilize the full amount and it will mean good content creation so i'm fine with it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
true.,shame all of the i3's don't have e-cores they really do have quite the performance even if these 12th gen chips are the first of their kind.,they change a lot about a cpu and can now reduce the lag since the e-cores are doing little tasks so we don't have to worry about games lagging .,the i5's especially  are now very very powerful compared to what their intended price is eg.,my 12600k was definitely  worth the â£220 i paid for it.,it wouldn't surprise me if intel made an i3 that's comparable to the 5600x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think you would be surprised how memory-sensitive the 12900k/ks are.,techspot tested with ddr5-6400 and the 5800x3d wasn't able to beat even the 12900k in that configuration.,"intel cpus have been bandwidth hungry since  skylake, yet for some reason the conventional wisdom is that memory matters for amd.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"nobody has offered a reasonable upgrade path on anything since 2019â€™s 3600. even that one wasnâ€™t a given; amdâ€™s original marketing pitch said you needed a new mobo for zen 3.

any ddr5 less than ddr5-8400 is e-waste.,":p

"just noticed, hardware unboxed actually did what you said and tested the 12900k with ddr5-6400 cl32 ram.","of course, that kind of ram is basically unobtanium for ordinary people like us, and even if we could buy it, it would be prohibitively expensive, but still nice to see as an experiment:

their original marketing pitch was that am4 motherboards would support 2020 processors and zen 3 would launch in 2020. they changed tune when zen 3 was doing better than intel to try to charge people for new motherboards to pad their bottom line like intel usually does.,they then changed back halfway after outrage and all the way when intel was beating them.,":/

that being said, people should stay away from ddr5 given the ddr5 early adoption tax is two fold:

* the prices are insane.","* the jedec spec for the top modules is ddr5-8400, which you cannot buy now.",anything you buy now is effectively e-waste since newer cpus would be considered handicapped with the current ddr5 since newer cpus will want ddr5-8400.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
expensive != unobtainium.,"ddr5, even very fast kits are readily available.",expect prices to drop significantly and speeds to increase for next-gen ddr5.,"also keep in mind that the 12900ks is literally the fastest mainstream cpu available, not just in gaming.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> even very fast kits are readily available

not in every market.","in my country you can order it, but it's only a preorder, and you'll basically be paying gpu prices for the privilege.","so in reality it's not an option, you'll have to get slower ddr5 or ddr4 if you want to build a system now.",the 12900ks is just a stupid choice for gaming now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i would keep the 12400f given that you have an h610 board.,a b660 should be the minimum for an i7.,the motherboard you mentioned has no vrm heatsink.,my suggestion is to just stick to the 12400 unless you want to get a new motherboard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it should be 4 phase and about 80-90w before throttling apparently.,probably about equal to limiting max clock to 3.5-3.7ghz on the 12700f.,"i actually think he can go for it, if actually 'capable' boards have a big price difference...

thereâ€™s not much difference between the 12400 and 12600: theyâ€™re both 6 cores with the same power limits.,"12600 has a higher turbo and better igpu than the 12400 (which doesnâ€™t mean much since you were looking for f models, which the 12600 does not come in).","granted, without power limits the gap opens up a bit, and the 12600 will likely use more power on average than the 12400 even with limits applied.",but reviews really donâ€™t show it would be worth your time to do that change (under 10%).,youâ€™d probably get way more performance out of a 12700 even with it being vrm starved.,itâ€™s just hard to recommend a cpu thatâ€™s technically above what a motherboard was intended to handle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you really have to go with h610, you can underclock a 12600k/12700 to 4.0/3.6 (or just brute force until it overheats, though i've heard msi vrm throttle drops your cpu to like 40w then pumps up again, which isn't ideal but alright if you don't want to tweak...).","you get much more multithreaded performance while still getting more than enough single core, even with underclocked max clockd

preferably with xtu though (hope it works, then you can have like 4ghz+ single core turbo while avoiding multi core vrm throttling.","cpus consume suprisingly little power up till about 3.5ghz)

ubuntus great and all for stability and if that's what you need then go for it.","as far as a daily driver for a normal user, i'd much prefer fedora, and the countless of people i've personally known to use both operating systems preferred and enjoyed fedora more over ubuntu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, i'm aware.","unfortunately, if you're a gamer like me, you'd be missing huge gaming improvements made after 5.15 kernel since any kernel after that won't be on lts 22.04. the reason i recommend fedora is because it's just as rock solid stable as ubuntu and you get all the goodies without sacrificing anything.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but it is needed for the high end chips with a good admixture of core types like my i7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ubuntu's releases are on a predictable schedule, btw.","22.04 - released in the 4th month (april) of 2022. releases occur every 6 months, once in october (the .10 release) and once in april (the .04 release).",even number years have their .04 release marked lts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"fedora has very little officially supported 3rd party software, so if i write out a bug report boom dismissed.","you know the people who work on fedora made it a goal to add more packages to the os do to it missing out, and work with developers do to it lacking.",flathub is very nice but very few packages on there are officially supported.,btw i use 16 packages from it.,"oh ubuntu does officially support newer kernels, vm kernels, ck kernels, etc they have done so for around 8 years now.",debian on the other hand does not unless needed but they do have backports.,"i run fedora server and i do like it but, fedora desktop is more for someone who would run arch and not the normies who can't fix stuff, install stuff without clicks, but hey silverblue and flathub etc are fixing this down the road but not today.","valve has fixed most of this by making a steamdeck with steamos setup like silverblue a target for developers, and a million lines of code fixing steam to run on most any os and heavily pushing flathub this helping fedora at the same time, so in a year or 2 form now fedora maybe fine on packaging, but officially supported by 3rd party's have fun with that.",there is miles of software officially supported on ubuntu do to its stable base etc.,"15,000ish software packages vs over 60,000 software packages",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i am not sure.,this is just a guess.,prime95 only draws a lot of power when you use something like small ffts.,then it fits into cache and doesnâ€˜t have to wait for ram.,i guess linx is made in a way the cores have to wait ram more often so the cores donâ€˜t draw as much power and donâ€˜t get as hot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
linx (linpack) is doing matrix multiplication of a huge matrix.,this uses a mix of cpu and memory.,prime with small fft is entirely cpu and so runs much hotter.,larger ffts are more memory intensive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

seems to be too good.,12700k idle is about 40+â°c.,i wish my 3770k would reach anything below 40â°c in idle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if that's 27â°c, yes
by the way you can take screenshots with super(win)+shift+s",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bro next time you should just copy it on to a piece of paper with color pencils,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think so.,"i have a 12700k as well and it runs idle at 25-30â°c, with some occasional spikes to 40â°c.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bruh that's almost ambient.,this is perfect.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's normal.,my i5 12600k idles at 17 degrees.,the under load however is 70 degrees.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for a second there i thought you were saying your processor was running at 12700 kelvin and was like, that can't be good",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have the same concern with mine (i7-12700k) using an aio h100i platinum rgb cooler.,it will randomly spike up in the 40c range (one core seems to just get hot at times.,making the average overall temp higher).,"i seem to idle in the 30c range, spiking up to 40c at times.",gaming will make it in the 50c-60c range (depending on how demanding).,"stressing it hard (unrealistic scenarios), it gets to the 70c range.","concerned me for a while having an aio and it hitting 70c - although it seems to hit that, then cool off (as the aio realizes and cools it, as i have it in quiet/balanced mode).",edit: while writing this.,"i have a bunch of tabs open, a windowed game, and i just launched rpcs3 - red dead redemption.",it is 59c right now.,"when playing, shooting everyone (lol), it gets to 66c, i even opened obs, stays in the 60c area (amazing for how much stress i am putting on this thing).","but, as i said.","with something like prime95, i can get it to 70c.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you taking the piss?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's normal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mine hangs out right around 27 - 30 c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when iâ€™m browsing or just watch videos my 12700k has around 20-25 degrees so this is perfectly normal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my 10900k idles at 38 restricted to 4.6ghz.,it still thermal throttles when encoding even at such a low clock.,i have the worst 10900k in existence.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what motherboard and cooler do you use?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is that a 27 idle average?,that's roughly where my 12700 is sitting.,(noctua air cooled),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
look for ' bloatware ',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you coming here to flex or is there something off about your hardware sensors?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"mine idles around ambient room temp (as low as 17c in the winter) with an nh-u12a air cooler, so that still seems warm.",go into bios and make sure your c-states are turned on up to c7 (don't go past c7 or you could start to hit noticeable latency) and turn on rush to halt.,you won't take any performance hit on the 12th gen and it saves a lot of power / heat in idle.,"i have my frequencies locked at 5/5/5/5/5.2/5.2/5/5 + 4/4/4/4 with 4.2 ring clock and my cpu package idles between 4-15w depending on background tasks, typically between 4-8w.","edit: any oc'er who says you can't oc with c states on effectively is working on very outdated info, it's just not true at all for 12th gen. my cb23 [scores](https://i.imgur.com/acmkhfd.jpg) are better than most mild oc's for this chip and no hiccups in gaming.",ignoring chip level power management these days is idiotic honestly because intel has put a ton of work into fine tuning them over time.,c states are far more effective than frequency scaling for keeping power down.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you trying to flex good temps or something?,posts like this are annoying.,obviously 27c is fineâ€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my 10700kf floats up and down like that as well.,it's definitely not the same as a 12700k but no matter what my temps spike up to mid 30s using the internet and what not and then it'll come back down to normal idle temps.,what did you upgrade from?,i'm interested in the new platform but my cpu is holding its own for the time being.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12700 kelvin?,nope.,i'd recommend reaching out to a scientist,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yea i've seen so many spikes while idle, drives me insane, like you move the mouse and bam spike, is there a way to stop it from spiking?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"those measurements are pretty close regarding the system is running
your hard devices just need a few changes here and there",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the reported package temperature in modern cpus is generally the highest inside the die and appears to have little to no thermal inertia.,spikes like that should be normal and are almost entirely dependent on short-term changes in cpu load.,"the temperature in older cpus was often measured with external sensors and changed slower, actually reflecting changes in cooler temperature.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bro my core i5 11400 settles at 39-40â° on idle with everything closed.,what kind of chilled case you are using ?,??,?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seems normal considering my i5-12600k is chilling at 25â°c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, i got a 12700kf recently and it's actually very fresh, it's peaking 55 celcius at max usage, while my old it 10700kf would peak 70/75 but it was oc to 4.8ghz",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with a 360mm aio mine usually hovers around 28 degrees to 32 degrees if the weather is hot.,"also the spikes are normal, mine will jump like 5 degrees if i get a notification or something and drop back down to normal.","under heavy gaming load it never exceeded 65 degrees, and is the same for 3dmark and cpu-z stress test.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ðÿ˜‚ it just seems spikey,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> idle temps (unless really high) mean nothing.,be more concerned about temps under load.,"if you have bad idle temps, your load temps aren't going to be good either.",bad idle temps are the first signs of an improperly seated cooler or a liquid cooler with a bad pump or blockage problems.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so true i did cine bench multi core test went to 91 i was like oh no iâ€™m stopping.,on single core test it was constant at 50 c. iâ€™m just using this build for streaming and video editing.,maybe down the road iâ€™ll slap a 30 series gpu on it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have an itx build with 12700k with idle temps of 30â°c.,"the cpu draws 5watt idle...

40â°c+ is not normal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's not normal.,"my 12700, even unlocked, only draws about 28 deg at idle.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks this my first intel build iâ€™m usually amd haha,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have noticed those increase idle temps are with windows 11 , probably due to avx use within windows services ?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my hottest core runs at around 37â°c at idle on my 3770k, maybe time for a new cooler?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no way.,i get 20 c idle on my 6700k.,buy some new thermal paste and reseat the cooler?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's too much!!,"what is you room temp, this is important?","try to fit if you can a 240mm whater cooler and a good thermal grease on it with a room temp around 20-23c , you will get nice tempts under load aon on idle of course.","some 12 gen cpu's tend to bend when you we tight the cooler fittings , so on the middle portion of the cpu appears a  0.3mm gap between the cpu and the heat sink.",i think i had a similar issue .....to solve it i use liquid metal and that solved my temps issue.,if you want to use liquid metal be carefull when applying as is condutive material .,read all pro's and cons...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my i7-11800h is 50 c idleâ€¦
what a world we live in",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
haha thanks!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ðÿ˜‚,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah same that stuff so random!,i think itâ€™s just the way it behaves then.,my amd just seems less spikey but when i edit and render the 12700k is a monster!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you understand that ambient means the temperature of the environment, right?",op's room could be 15 degrees lmao.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17 degrees sounds almost unbelievable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
damn thatâ€™s really nice and cool!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what cooler are you using?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
haha,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
haha thanks itâ€™s weird huh itâ€™s like more stable the temp when itâ€™s working hard ðÿ˜‚ but iâ€™m concerned about itâ€™s bumpy idle.,i rendered a 8 min 1080p 60 for video in 1 min off the cpu itself and it was just 50 c stable.,what a weird beastly chip haha!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s cold haha,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
damn how bout for gaming,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
msi pro z690 and nh-15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah like maybe 35 average when running long sounds good!,i didnâ€™t wanna have to rebound repaste thermal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is my streaming pc my gaming pc is a 5600x amd.,i just built a 10700k last month.,itâ€™s an amazing cpu bro.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah my amd does 40s also as long as itâ€™s stable huh shoild be good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i get spikes sometimes though 10 c out of nowhere lol itâ€™s weird but ima just run it up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
damn what cpu voltage?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sounds good!,thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that's typical for current intel turbo boost.,a single core on my laptop will go from 40c to 99c and thermal throttling then back down instantly with how tb 3.0 works.,that tiny little spike is nothing compared to that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i get worried too.,cinebench ran my 12900k up to nearly 103â°c.,freaked me right out.,that's ai clocked to 5.5ghz with an asus ryuo 240 and corsair ll120 fan upgrade.,noctua paste i should mention.,but as for idle?,it jumps from 31 to 60 and everywhere in between every second.,thought it was broken.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ok, so what are 'good' idle temps?",it's impossible to know.,"many people and many systems are set to allow a cpu to run warmer under light load, to make the system quieter.",it's absolutely not an issue to have a cpu sat at 50c or whatever in exchange for a silent pc.,idle temps are meaningless.,"load temps are what matters, to ensure the cpu doesn't thermally throttle.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s normal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you donâ€™t seem to know which temps to expect when.,search on google for other peoples results and compare them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
91â„ƒ is nothing to be concerned about for 100% all-core rendering.,mine is running ffmpeg whenever i'm not sitting in front of it and it's typically pegged between 80â„ƒ-90â„ƒ depending on complexity of the render.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i run 98 on 10700 and its fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
draws?,what?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'd repaste it first and see how it goes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my amd 3700x spiked from 30-55 deg at idle.,this is way better than that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah, it is weird.","i came from a ryzen 7 1700, on an asus x370-f board, that was overclocked (using the same aio).",it stayed hotter than this.,"as everyone else has stated/said, though.",it's perfectly fine.,especially these new chips/newer tech.,it can handle a lot.,i've heard you would have to go out of your way to break one/etc.,and i've read that cpus can run at 80c for a year straight and be fine.,"obviously, it will decrease life expectancy, but yeah.","and like others have said, it matters more what the temperatures are under load.","us being under 80c is really all that matters i believe, but even then it's not the biggest deal, it will thermal throttle and undervolt itself before it just ""blows out"" or whatever.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
even gaming doesn't get it much hotter.,"cinebench will run it up to the low 90s, as it should, but most shit doesn't drive it past 60.

"gaming pushes it into the 70-80's,  this is on an corsair h100 aio cooling",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
interesting.,can i hope to see comparable temps with that board and a dark rock pro 4?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
haha yeah have that sudden anxiety that your cpu is running too warm...time to take it all apart and re-apply :p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"stock, i'm using a deepcool assassin iii and a corsair 4000d airflow pc case, along with 5 120mm be quiet fans, also it's almost winter here (argentina) so it's very cold and that's helping on the temps, i think that in summer i would probably get 10 degrees more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

damn haha yeah i ended up overclcoking csuse i didnâ€™t like the boost stuff itâ€™s too erratic for me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"lol, well your statement makes no sense when you just say ""almost ambient"".",ambient could be any temp.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s crazy.,never seen a cpu being this low while not on a custom water loop.,what are you temps during gaming or /and avx related tasks?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i saw that, but i don't think you can say that your cpu idles at 17â°c, maybe for the first minute after booting but in 5 minutes it will get warmer, my cpu too idles at 20â°c right after booting and that's also the ambient temperature in my room but after 3-4 minutes the idle temperature will be a more normal 26-28 â°c and i consider that as my idle temperature not the initial 20â°c.","i say this because in that photo hwinfo indicates that it's running from 36 seconds earlier so i assume you've just booted in windows, you should wait 5 minutes before saying your cpu's idle temperature.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thatâ€™s about right those temps for gaming,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[removed],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i also actually review coolers.,what meaningful information are you gleening or presenting from testing at idle?,it's a 5-10w load on alderlake.,"you're testing the case airflow configuration, not the cooler.","open air test bench testing is even more meaningless, given the margin of error in any cooler tests.","we deal with countless user concerned with idle temps over at /r/buildapc, and none of them report 'temps over ambient', they're just worrying because idle temp = some arbitrary number.",it's just not something that's useful to measure or obsess over.,it's not a test of a cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep.,literally only worry above 100'c.,"you can run the cpu at 99'c 24/7 for its entire warranty period (and beyond)

silicon is crazy durable unless you oc or overvolt it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, thats a safe temperature to operate at, most people have completely clueless ideas of what is a good operating temperature for cpus.",basically anything under 100c is not doing any damage to your processor.,"it might run slower, but its not being damaged.",people confuse an overclock with higher voltages and high temperatures and that can exacerbate the issue of degradation with just a stock processor running hot.,if you're running stock and getting high temps you don't have the compounding issue of high voltage and temps.,edit: just because its not damaging your cpu doesn't mean its optimal.,and the damage people are describing is the result of a cpu lifespan being reduced from ~12 years to ~10 years.,hardly something to worry about.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, which is still stupid since no cpu ""runs"" at any specific degree, it all depends on the environment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's just a modern cpu, all of them do it.",i would recommend looking into setting your pl2 and pl2 manually in bios.,you can get 99% of the performance and drastically cut temperatures by just setting your pl1 and pl2 to 125w.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most people keep their pc indoors.,"room temperature is defined by merriam-webster as a medical definition with a range of 15 to 25 â°c (59 to 77 â°f) as being suitable for human occupancy, and at which laboratory experiments are usually performed",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
on avx related tasks like cinebench i get around 65-70 degrees at 4.9ghz (mce).,aat 5.0ghz it managed to sustain again and stay around those temperatures although i haven't been able to get it stable until i give it more voltage.,in gaming it varies.,most games it will be 35-50 degrees under load,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'll time it and tell you how long it stays at 17 degrees,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[https://imgur.com/a/osd4m3w](https://imgur.com/a/osd4m3w) so after booting up the pc it idled around 19-20 degrees for the first 5 mins and is still there after checking.,i haven't seen it touch 30 degrees yet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
speedstep is what makes the cpu down clock in order to save power at idle.,"turning off turbo boost but raising the base clock accomplishes basically the same thing, just manually tweaked so it can potentially get better thermals.",it probably wonâ€™t change much but in theory it can help.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>i also actually review coolers.,>what meaningful information are you gleening or presenting from testing at idle?,"actually i have never posted idle  testing results because i had (mistakenly) thought this was a ""common knowledge"" topic, but due to this thread i might change that.",the meaningful information is immediately knowing if a liquid cooler isn't functioning properly or if any a cooler might need to be reseated.,">open air test bench testing is even more meaningless, given the margin of error in any cooler tests.","agreed

>it's just not something that's useful to measure or obsess over.",it's not a test of a cooler.,"i suppose we'll have to disagree on this

i am interested in reading some of your cooler reviews, where do you post them?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my 12700k when stressed with cinebench r23 is around 100. is it because it is at 100 exactly or that's the limit of the sensor?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
damn thanks bro!,i ended up clocking it at 4.5 at 1.2 volts itâ€™s real nice and stable.,i think ima abuse it more when i get bored of it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
even at 100c the modern cpus protect themselves and reduces clock and voltage !,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that simply isn't true.,"running your cpu so hot to the point of thermal throttling shortens the lifespan of the cpu... this is common knowledge and one reason why people run advanced cooling solutions, undervolt, etc.","if your cpu is thermal throttling under load, your cooling solution is not adequate or is not mounted correctly.",it should not be running that hot.,excessive heat is the worst enemy of a cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you should get a better cooling solution if you are regularly getting 98c on your cpu on a desktop.,it's never recommended to run a cpu regularly at that temp,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"would thermal paste like, 'dry out' or 'degrade' more quickly at circa 95 degrees?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the cpu will survive, but a lot of other components on the motherboard have much lower temperature tolerance therefore they can fail due to the excessive heat.",on the matter - right now i use freezer 34 duo with 12700k while waiting my liquid freezer.,"based on few benchmarks i get pretty much the same score if not better when i limit the mobo to throttle at 80c and 100c, because then the chip is insanely stable, while going up and down actually seems to reduce it's performance.","as a bonus the cooler is quite, while on 100c it drives me crazy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very true.,ambient temps play a big part in cpu temps,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s really insane.,why are you using multi core enhancements and not custom clock speeds (oc) if i may ask.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's very nice than, what's your cooling system?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"your cpu is thermal throttling itself to 100

it's essentially downclocking and lowering voltage to not exceed 100c

increasing the cooling capacity of the pc will fix this",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ya but if you're on a desktop and this is happening then you should get a better cooling solution.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
citation needed.,not totally disagreeing in theory but in practice this doesn't seem to happen at all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
source?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is my first k/kf chip i've used so i'm not used to the overclocking.,secondly on my motherboard threes 2 cpu power connectors in which i only plugged 1 in because i never saw the need to overclock because of the power of the cpu.,i use mce because it was the easiest way to get a little more performance out of my cpu.,also i intended to use it once to get to the top leaderboard in 3dmark but since the temperatures can sustain itself.,i left it running.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
noctua c14 (2x nf-p14flx),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i use the ml240 mirror for my cpu.,"it idles at around 35 degree and shoots straight to 100  when stressed with cinebench r23, however it stays around 80 when stressed with xtu.",i suspect it's because of the bending problem with alder lake and ml240 being an lga1200 socket instead of the new one.,i leave my 12700k at stock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"added a caveat to my original comment: 

people confuse an overclock with higher voltages and high temperatures and that can exacerbate the issue of degradation as opposed to just a stock processor running hot.",if you're running stock and getting high temps you don't have the compounding issue of high voltage and temps.,and just because its not damaging your cpu doesn't mean its optimal.,and the damage people are describing is the result of a cpu lifespan being reduced from ~12 years to ~10 years.,not much higher than the reduction in lifespan you get from just plain using the cpu.,hardly something to worry about.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

itâ€™s really not hard or expensive to get a adequate air cooler to keep your cpu below 90c on a desktop.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
aight!,btw you can also oc with only one cpu power connector on the motherboard.,have a good day mate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"now that makes sense, it's a bigass cooler lol and i like the design",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
im assuming you have an asus board bc of the compatibility?,"its probably not the cpu bending tho, try remounting it and reapplying thermal paste 

the fact that its shooting straight up means bad contact with the cold plate",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it just says the throttle after 95,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's a big cooler from 2010. even the lastest noctua fans struggle to keep the 12900k cool so don't think thats the case here.,even my case does not have any airflow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™ve heard about that too need washers huh?,i started thinking about that to haha,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah and thatâ€™s why itâ€™s not recommended.,there is no reason to have your computer throttle when a $50 air cooler can keep your cpu well below 90c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"noctua design is always great regardless of time, i have a pretty compact case (under 10 litres), had an alpenfohn black ridge until a few weeks ago, than upgraded with a 240mm ek aio, i do prefer my system quite so sat all fans at 800rpm and pump at 40% (1200rpm) and the system is quite and the temps decent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cpus almost never die.,donâ€™t set your voltage above 1.45v and youâ€™ll basically never see any problem.,i had a 10 year old i7-920 that was still working.,your cpu will become stupid obsolete before it breaks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you should be fine.,workstation cpus consume thrice the power and still run for years without any issues,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
temperature is the single most important factor when it comes to longevity.,heat is the enemy of electronics.,"just make sure you aren't consistently over 80 c when under load, it will last a long time.","as long as temps are okay, you can let it consume as much power as it needs",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have a pentium d processor bought back in 2006 ...which is still working perfectly....so i would not be worried about lifespan

overclocking will degrade your cpu performance but its not something which will happen in months...it will take many years and by the time cpu itself becomes irrelevant or maybe u will upgrade too.",only time it will break is if u r providing like ridiculously high voltage to a cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"probably not, a good cpu will last many years and it is more likely for you to upgrade than it breaking.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's bad for a cpu to be both hot and high voltage at the same time.,intel considers up to 100 c to be okay in temperature at the stock voltages.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i second this.,i've never heard of a cpu that outright stopped working.,"i think over time, even at stock, degradation does cause them to slow down or be unable to hit the same boost speeds at the same voltages though.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"x58 fo life ... lol, had a 920 for about 8 years, then got a x5650 for $50 and used that for a few more years before finally upgrading to a ryzen 1700x that was a solid platform.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"u/titanking4

my 12900ks @ stock takes up to 1.49v vcore.",is that a problem?,(you said 1.45v max.),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"do k cpus are made differently to sustain heavy workload and overclocking, or they just have unlocked multiplier",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"temperature is the enemy of electronics, heat is not.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i mean high power consumption is not problem, if its temperature and voltage remains normal",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have a couple 20+ year-old computers lying around that i turn on regularly for retro gaming, both are overclocked, and i've never had any issues.",i've also been at this for \~30-years and have never seen a cpu die even though i've had a couple that arrived defective.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"x5660 later on for me, sadly could only do 3.4ghz.",was a nice upgrade over my i7.,"not an old timer, i bought the system used and put in the xeon in 2018

but then i went straight from that to a i9-10850k and yeaâ€¦ probably close to 4-5x the cpu performance i got in a single step.","the old stuff was cool and all, but the thing was chugging in any modern game.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"stock is always fine, 1.49 for brief instants are normal.",even amd parts hit 1.5v for brief instants,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"unlocked multiplier 
although they are generally higher quality chips that can actually hit high clocks at normal voltages.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes they are made of better silicon than a non k counterpart to support oc.,basically they're of better quality than a non k processor.,though you really shouldn't be worried about life span.,you wouldn't even notice any difference in performance even after 5 years for dekstop cpus.,"the biggest factor that sucks lifespan away from a cpu is heat and since on desktop cooling is much better, desktops can last over a decade.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"most cpu of the same gen are actually the same design, with lower chips being the ones with nonfunctional cores.","so the k skus are definitely not made differently,ã¦.",they are the most flawless though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean heat as in high temperatures,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, i was able to do about 3.8ghz mostly stable on my i7, the x5650 let me do 4ghz stable.","was mainly gaming in vr with a gtx 1070, but newer games would max one of the cores and drop frames, so the 1700x and b350 was like $200 at micro center around a year after they came out, and i got that.",now running a 5900x and rtx3080.,"gave the 1700x with an old gtx285 to my parents as their main pc, then have my x5650 and gtx 1070 at work thinking of trying some programs to simulate networking gear to help newer engineers learn a bit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thunderbolt 2 is a physically different connector than type c. thunderbolt 3 and 4 are type c tho.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, they're different protocols.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"hey, i actually helped a friend do a build with my leftover arctic aio on this exact board.","i had the same problem as when i tried it on my z690 formula, which was that it did not mount properly and led to thermal throttling.","some aios i recommend using the lga 1200 bracket if you can't get your hands on a lga 1700 set, but the arctic aio is not one of them.",hopefully that helps!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if you don't care about the usb ports etc.,technically you can get away with a 12600k on the best h610s without fiddling with voltage/clocks too.,i guess it depends on what you need/want.,"or if you are like me and underclock your cpus, you probably can dump a 12700 in here without worrying about overheating vrms too... (but i'm not sure if bios underclock works, and throttlestop might not for the 12th gen too, i won't take the risk if i were to build one now)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"am not sure about this but h610 has pcie 3.0 not 4.0 
correct me if am wrong.","h610 works perfectly fine for pentium, i3, i5.","(locked)

the vrm isn't good enough for i7 and i9.",check youtube video about vrm.,weak vrm works fine for hour or two but after that it starts affecting performance.,h610 is perfectly fine for locked cpus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you're right, motherboards are basically the last bastion of 'future-proofing'.",people love spending more on them for little reason.,"however, it's important to remember that the chipsets are basically a list of potential features, and motherboard manufacturers start doing weird things to cut costs at the low end, so you need to look at exact specs.","the biggest sacrifice is only 2 dimm slots, which makes adding ram later much harder, and you also lose the fastest 3.2 gen 2 usb slots.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i currently use the 11400f  and i have noticed that when it comes to rendering (or rather 100% cpu usage) the b560 mobo suck hardcore.,also they pull too much power.,"i have also watched the videos of hardware unboxed: [https://youtu.be/pea0vcj0lry](https://youtu.be/pea0vcj0lry)

i would only buy a h610 mobo with the 12100 because it doesnt stress the vrms as much as a 12400 (still id go for the cheapest b660).","if you really want to use the whole capability of the 12400 you should definitely buy one of the better b660 (those with heatsinks on the vrms) or the entry level z690, although the z690 are the safer options.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
underrated for what they are.,entry level boards for entry and budget cpu's.,"if youre on a tight budget, buying a 12400, or 12100 or below, h610 makes a lot of sense, as you can get them for as cheap as $70 and dont have to worry about h610 boards vrm throttling those cpu's.","the caveat is, you probably wont upgrade to a 12600k or better due to vrm throttling on the cheapest boards, but i'd argue that someone buying a $100-$180 cpu probably isnt going to turn around and want a $280+ cpu.","so the upgrade path is only raptor lake versions of those cpu's, 13100, 13400.

being capped at 3200mhz ddr4 is perfectly fine too, its still pretty much the sweet spot for price to performance, and something like a 3600mhz will only yield like 3% more performance in games.","if you can afford b660, go for it, youll get better/more i/o, better features, better vrm (and thus upgrade path), better ram compatibility, etc.","but for an entry level build/someone on a strict budget, those are bonuses, not necessities",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no h610 aren't underrated.,"the main two reasons being you only get one memory channel vs two, and you miss out on chipset pcie 4.0.",&#x200b;https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pvghndysvtmum4d3y4lmzq-970-80.jpg.webp,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well the only issue is u cannot lift power limit on h610 board which is by default 65w nd i5-12400f max out around 92w, so on h610 u might get almost same fps in gaming (since games don't use 100%cpu) bt in cpu heavy task u will feel.",lack of power,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"less usb ports sometimes, and only 2 memory slots.",you can't overclock ram.,i think the ram speed limit is 3200mhz on h610.,some really cheap h610 like asrock boards will enforce a lower long term power limit.,"but i'm not sure if that even matters for the 12400. it mostly affects cpus that pull like 100w or more, so it might be irrelevant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"h610 is best motherboard if u dont want to or dont know to tinker with motherboard settings good to pair with i3s and i5 non k. lowest io/connectivity options

b660 is kind of a middle ground who knows some stuff about what they are doing or who are going after the i7 and i9s non k versions.","b660 entry price point mobos are also good pair with i5 non k. b660 also offers more connectivity than h610 mobo

h670 who wants same io/connectivity options as z690 mobos but dont want to get a k cpu

z690 for oc enthusiasts and who wants to tinker with everything like cpu, mobo, ram, etc etc",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""don't care about usb ports"" to what extent?",i have about 10 of those and the product's specifications list about 10 ports as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the way i understand it, it's the chipset that has no pcie 4.0 lanes.","however, a typical minimum gaming build only uses the 20 cpu lanes: 4 for nvme, 20 for the gpu.","~~~and they are pcie 4.0 regardless of the chipset afaik.~~~ i stand corrected, apparently no nvme4 on h610, see below.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
h610 boards also lack the cpu attached nvme m.2 slot present on all other alder lake chipsets.,"they connect via the pch, and all models that i've seen so far offer just a single drive at gen3x4.",memory overclocking is also limited to xmp profiles on h610.,"for something to just slap a 12100 or 12400, simple gpu and one drive into, they're not bad, but if anyone intends to upgrade *anything* down the line, spring for a b660 board.",h610 has some pretty severe [expandability concessions](https://www.techpowerup.com/img/gsgxwi3xpb4sckp6.jpg) to hit those lower price points.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well actually it's 2 channels with 1 dimm each, and 4.0 isn't even that much better than a 3.0",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would like to read more about this.,how do i check a mobo's power limits?,thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
honestly i haven't checked the ports difference between cheap/expensive boards.,"(and i am still using a prebuilt...) just look at 'usb ports' as a generic term, for sata/m.2/pcie x1 maybe?","and i think usb port counts do actually differ, and sound cards seem to be different on high end boards?","but for me it is more than enough, i manage to get away with an almost full 1tb hdd, with the majority of stuff moved to a 1tb ssd in the new prebuilt but still not running out of space, so even if i built one instead of getting the current prebuilt i don't think i will be finding anything lacking.","and i use lan too, so no wifi card needs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh thanks for explanation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no cpu attached nvme m.2 support on h610, unfortunately.",if you pull up the specs for any h610 model you'll see that they specify only a gen3x4 (via the chipset).,:(,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and both are not needed, the performance difference between pcie 3.0 and pcie 4.0 for both m.2 and pcie x16 is negligible, also the 3200mhz ram limit that most h610 boards have is more than enough, ram speeds have never really affected performance unless on an apu based system, not to mention that 3200mhz ram is the best value memory out right now.","my msi pro h610m-g works great even with a 12700f as long as you provide adequate cooling to the vrm's, i got it for $52cad less than the msi pro b660m-a, which didn't really provide me with any extra expansion that i needed, the only notable difference i could see is better cooling on the vrm's and an extra 4pin power connector for the cpu, which i'm pretty sure is not even needed since even the asus prime b660m-a only has a single 8pin cpu connector as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pcie 4.0 doubles the bandwidth of pcie 3.0 so i wouldn't say it isn't much better.,i have no idea what you're trying to say about the dimm slots.,even if you find a h610 motherboard with two dimm slots they will operate in single channel mode because thats all h610 supports.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"u can check in bios, advance setting",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
from what i've seen the b660 only have slightly more ports,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i stand corrected then.,"still, nvme isn't terribly important for gaming either.","i'm still on sata, of all things, and see no reason to upgrade.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 i'm a beginner here that wants to make a budget system shortly and i wanted to ask if budget mobos(610/510/410)have power limits for the ram sticks that you can insert into em.,like can you insert 2 8gb ram onto the two slots all of the mobos have right and what's recommended?,like brand name and mhz.,thx,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what you're referencing was a typo on [intel's release slide](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pvghndysvtmum4d3y4lmzq-1024-80.jpg).,"the h610 does support dual channel, with one dimm per channel.","they [clarified it later that day](https://twitter.com/iancutress/status/1480573841088950273?lang=en), as it raised many eyebrows.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it doesn't matter if it doubles the bandwidth the performance difference is negligible, go look at benchmarks, the same is true for m.2 drives, also h610 boards still have a pcie 4.0 x16 slot, but doesn't matter to me since i still use the best value older cards like the 1070, which are limited pcie 3.0.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, b660 feels not worth it to me, especially when i don't really need anything...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"definitely not a deal breaker for a true budget build, but for someone wanting a cheap entry point to potentially upgrade later, it's a bit of a downer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, i have 2x16gb 3200mhz sticks in mine, there are no power limits only capacity limits, all the 610's i've seen can support up to 64gb of ram, so even 2x32gb sticks are supported.","you want a board with at least 3200mhz supported frequency for optimal performance in games, most 610's can achieve this by updating the bios and enabling the xmp profile, you'll also need 3200mhz ddr4 memory.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oooo epic!,then all that's left is pcie 3.0 and vrm performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ssds can saturate the pcie 4 spec during sequential reads and sequential writes.,it's in random read / write where they still dont get that great speeds and this is what affects real world performance as most of the time the os is dealing with random storage activity and a lot of small files.,if you do happen to deal with large files such as huge backups or virtual disk images then the doubling of bandwidth is very real.,regardless we do not know the future and a pcie 4 capability can open that board into the future 10 years where random read/write performance may make a break through.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no for a gaming pc, though.",maybe for video editing or something.,but all a gaming pc will gain from nvme is *slightly* faster load times.,iâ€™m saying this as a guy who has a 3080 ti and a sata ssd in the same pc.,i have *zero* desire to go nvme.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they also support pcie 4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

huh.,that is strange.,"**my experience**

i have the 12700 (non-k) & on a multi core run i've been able to score 20,712. which personally i'm chuffed with, but i only achieve this if i let the machine just sip away as much power as it can get its hands on.","my single score was a mere 1,940, which seems inline with what other people have reported online.",temps hit a peak of around 85â°c-90â°c.,"fyi, i only use hwmonitor to keep an eye on my temps.",i've recently throttled my cpu just enough to keep the temps & noise down.,"long story short, i use my machine as a work station & it's on my desk, so i appreciate the silence over the little performance increase(s) i could gain.","i'm sat next to it all day, every day kinda thing, so i think you get the picture?!","that's also the justification why i went for the non-k variant, i knew i wouldn't bother with overclocking & would much preferer sheer reliability.","even under full load, the machine is as close to silent as one could hope for.",":)

anyway; with my throttle, i'm still able to score 14,728 on multi core & 1,502 on single core.","though keep in mind i was also able to obtain these scores while running a ton of other stuff, the typical 100s of browser tabs, my ide's, database running locally & connections else where, compiling code, screen sharing, etc.","so even with the throttle on, i was able to achieve these scores whilst doing my work & browsing the web.","with the throttle & dealing with work, temps didn't exceed 65â°c.",it's safe to say that my specific work load benefits from a larger core count as opposed to increasing them ghz.,"in my real world used case, i can't tell a difference between unlimited performance configuration vs my cool & quiet configuration.",":)

and at last; this brings me on to my set of questions.","**tldr; questions**

have you tried tinkering with the bios at all?",have you tried maybe tinkering with intel extreme tuning utility?,perhaps your bios is set to some low power/eco mode by default?,xmp?,"looking at my bios, there's honestly an option for best battery mode, or something like that.",i'm wondering if yours has something similar?,p.s.,"sorry if those are pretty stupid questions, but i thought i'd try to cover all grounds possible.",:),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sounds like it, mine does over [24k](https://i.imgur.com/io2btmc.jpg) with very mild oc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"since nobody bothered to ask, did you ensure you set your xmp profile?",youâ€™ll need to manually set your ram speed to 3200+ otherwise it will default to 2133. this is more often than not the reason for very bad results.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what motherboard do you use?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what motherboard are you using?,what power regime is the cpu operating under?,have you updated bios?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i wish you all the best.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"e-cores is enabled but honestly, i don't know about this power limits

"basically, the cpu has â€œstockâ€ power limits configured by intel, by default.","for example, the 12700k has a pl1 of 125 watts, and a pl2 of 190 watts.","this means that when the cpu gets a sudden high load and it turbo boosts to its highest setting, it is allowed to consume up to 190 watts for a short amount of time, and then it can only consume 125 watts for the remainder of the high load.","it does this by constantly monitoring its power usage and downclocking itself to operate slower, thus reducing performance - and power consumption, and heat output.","now, this is all rather important stuff in a laptop, but less so in a desktop where cooling is easier.",something you might have heard about is pl1=pl2.,"this basically means the bios allows a cpu to be configured so that itâ€™s lower power limit is the same as the turbo limit, allowing it to consume the full allotment of power indefinitely (190 watts in the case of the 12700k).","this allows for higher sustained performance, ie.",if youâ€™re doing a long render.,"with many desktop chipsets, you can remove the limit entirely and just let the cpu consume as much power as it wants, or your cooling can handle before it gets too hot and has to throttle.","this is usually done just by setting pl1/pl2 to a ridiculous number that will never be reached, like 2000 wattsâ€¦ or 4095 watts in the case of some boards.","now, just because thereâ€™s a power limit or youâ€™ve removed the power limit, doesnâ€™t mean youâ€™ll actually see such high power consumption.","most workloads on the 12700k will never reach 190 watts, so the limit - or lack thereof - is often meaningless outside of benchmark programs.","but elevating the lower pl1 limit is typically very beneficial, especially on lower tier chips with abnormally low limits, such as the 12700 (no k) which has limits of pl1=65 watts and pl2=180 watts.",getting rid of that 65 watt limit unlocks a lot of potential in that chip.,"now, if youâ€™ve unlocked your power limits and youâ€™re running a super heavy avx workload and you exceed your coolerâ€™s capabilities and the cpu gets too hot - it just automatically throttles itself and reduces performance to stay below 100c, in a similar manner to how it stays under power limits.",this does not damage the cpu; it protects itself and can run at the throttle limit basically indefinitely (not that youâ€™d want to).,hope this is helpful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if you are talking about chip quality, then yes, 12900ks is mostly worth it.","but if you are talking about performance/cost ratio, then no, it's not worth it.","if you run both chips at stock, the voltage between the two should be similar, and performance gain isn't $150 more.","if you oc your 12900ks to all core 5.5ghz, it'll probably need much higher voltage than ocing your 12900k to all core 5.2ghz.","i'm not trying to say 12900ks isn't worth it, it all depends on your perspective (chip quality vs. performance/cost ratio).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what i'm trying to emphasize here is that standard users didn't all get golden sps over 87 or so... and the ks basically guarantees that you'll achieve 5.2 all core rather than pushing a bad k series to it's limit.","the savings isn't in the chip price, it's in the time savings to achieve that performance.","total roi is important, because if you value your time at $50, you work on the overclock for 4 hours, your $200 savings is gone right then and there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

is everyone in this thread just forgetting temperatures or something?,8 cores running high clocks with another group of separate cores running at lower clocks for different data load at the same time is pretty intuitive.,having a full 12 cores juggling instructions with the same clocks would mean so much more excessive heat to manage.,my p-cores are at around 80-87â°c while my e-cores are sitting in the 60s with overall temps already potentially hitting 90â°c.,"with the same cooling system on 12 p-cores, it would downclock or throttle resulting in less performance for something like gaming while multitasking in the background.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

but those 'e-cores' aren't even *that* energy efficient (for the performance they give).,and you have to understand how these intel cpu's work: in general they will boost until it hits some limit (pl1/pl2 power or thermal limit).,"so, as these e-cores running your background task still consume power and generate heat, they will cause your p-cores to hit those limits earlier and that makes the p-cores boost less and thus give less performance per core.","to thinks the background tasks runs on the e-cores and still have the p-cores available for the game, but this is just not the case.","by utilizing your e-cores, the p-cores do become slower so you game performance does suffer.","also, by disabling the e-core, the ringbus can run at a higher clock, the memory latency becomes less, and you gain avx-512.","overall, those e-cores are just a dumb tradeoff imo.","it adds complexity to the scheduler, multiple instruction sets, and reduce the performance of the p-cores.",and for what?,"just use the die-space for more p-cores intel... but ofcourse, marketing is king ('14 core cpu' just sounds better than '10 core cpu')

maybe you have a mobo that enables avx-512 when you disable the e-cores.,at least that is the case for my asrock board with an older bios.,so the older bios stays and the e-cores stay disabled.,avx-512 can give a huge boost to tasks like transcoding!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean i donâ€™t see why it wouldnt be similar.,itâ€™s the same 8 p cores and weâ€™re running the same ring clock the only difference is you have two p cores at 5.2 vs my flat all core 5.0 ghz.,the 12900k has a supposedly (on paper) higher all core frequency and boost clocks than than the 12700k.,theyâ€™re the same otherwise though (besides e core difference maybe ring clock difference).,if p cores/ring are at the same frequencies i wouldnâ€™t expect any significant difference in single core between the two.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"long story... 

i went from a 4770k to that 9700k which was upgrade but not always that noticeable.","there was a pick up in some games, and the lows.","my 4770k ran perfectly, but was missing nvme, faster usb, and type c... those were noticeable.","the 9700k was fine, but needed decent cooling (d14).",i had to do a bunch of builds the last 2 years and ended up selling my 9700k itx rig because i was stuck with an extra dell after buying them for gpu's.,that dell with a 10400 was fine too lol.,not like the cpu's are doing the heavy lifting at 1440p+.,"i didn't notice much of a drop at 4k, but that's true with most modern procs until they need more threads.","missed my itx rig, and decided to build one with an extra 10700k i had lying around.","checked prices on itx mobos, and found out i could get 12400+mobo for the price of a decent 10th gen itx mobo.","i don't have direct comparisons between the 10700k, and 12400, but 3rd party reviewers have them close in performance, and the 12400 runs much, much cooler, which is what sealed it for me.","i bought the cheapest itx mobo available, asrock b660m-itx for $120, and it's pretty bare, but it has that front type c header, and has my ballistix 3200cl16 ram running at 3600cl16 which should give it a slight edge over that 10700k in gaming because it was already close.","so that 12400 should be a few % faster than the 9700k i started with, but much cooler, and more threads if needed.",you will get some gains due to ipc alone.,"the 12600k also oc's well, but that doesn't all translate to fps.",just a small fraction.,gaming gains will depend on resolution.,less noticeable the higher you go up.,"here's a review, and it compares some cpu's at different resolutions.","your 9700k isn't on the list, but it basically performs closely to the 10700k.",like a couple 1-2% worse in most games.,check the actual fps at the resolution you game.,"12600k is an upgrade, but might not give you a real noticeable fps boost.",https://www.techpowerup.com/review/intel-core-i5-12600k-alder-lake-12th-gen/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i went from a 9700k to 12700k, big performance leap, especially in multithreaded workloads.",pretty happy with the decision as even the 9700k was holding me back in games and it drastically reduced the work time i spent waiting for batch operations to complete.,"the 9700k wasn't a bad cpu for it's time, it's just that the last few years we've seen a lot more performance uplift than normal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

should i jump on the 12700k if i find a good deal?,i think i can get one for $299.99 new from microcenter if i go in-person (technically $279.99 because theyâ€™ll take $20 off for the combo with a motherboard.),or should i wait until 13700k?,iâ€™ll either be going 12th or 13th but iâ€™m sure 13 is close.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"conclusion:

""we believe intel has been able to significantly accelerate their process development at a time when the foundries are struggling.","although we donâ€™t expect intel to regain the density lead over the time period studied, we do believe they could retake the performance lead"" 

i really recommend you check out the article itself, it explains, node by node, density and performance estimates, and puts it all out in a nice graph.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
people donâ€™t seem to understand the foundry business model at all.,itâ€™s not just about being at the leading edge.,"90% of tsmcâ€™s customers have products that compete directly with intel, so its an extremely bad business decision to feed your competitor with $$$ and your ip by using them as a subcontractor.",tsmc being a pure foundry is their greatest asset.,30 years ago there was a sea of equal sized foundries.,tsmc managed to pull ahead not because they were the most advanced but because they were extremely disciplined in not competing with their customers.,others who got greedy (like umc) ended up stagnating.,10 years ago samsung and tsmc were almost equal technologically.,tsmc managed to pull ahead b/c apple wanted to weaken samsung.,in the foundry race not competing with your customers and earning their trust is bread and butter.,"given two foundries, the one who understands this will win every time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"doubtful, mobile chipsets accelerated development at tsmc.","i can see intel maintaining parity and maybe getting a small edge on a specific metric every so often, but the era of intel dominance is over.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">figure 1 only illustrates the â€œnodesâ€ from intel, they werenâ€™t standing still, for 14nm they released 5 versions all with the same density but with progressively improving performance

successive versions of 14nm were less dense.",which they tried to counteract off with optimized libraries.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you mean catch back up but not necessarily pass them, then yes that seems very likely.","actually, short of quitting the fab business entirely i don't see much of a way they would not catch up.","overall node scaling is slowing dramatically, meaning that it's hard for anyone company to really race ahead.","at the same time, 
intels delays have mostly been about adopting euv and fixing their last non-euv node.","once that is over i expect them to be more or less on par, if only because progress is slow enough that no one gets ahead.",in general i think it's really hard with euv for any individual company to get more than 20 or 30% density ahead of another.,we will probably see some gaafets work better than others year to year but i doubt any of them fail completely or leave the others in the dust.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""unquestionable leadership by 2025""

\-intel",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
kind of an oddball question.,intel had process problems so they partnered with tsmc to stay alive and work out their fab issues.,intel isn't bringing everything back in-house and will continue to work with tsmc.,will their fab quality catch up?,i think yes.,will they be as large as tsmc?,not sure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
highly speculative article when nobody actually has hard data and they say things â€œintel said double now theyâ€™re saying major we interpret that as 1.8xâ€.,if theyâ€™re just guessing on half this stuff itâ€™s just that: educated guessing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just because it's what worked for tsmc doesn't mean it's the only viable strategy.,.,intel has (and always had) more than enough in house demand to justify dumping billions into leading edge processes.,"unlike samsung, they're not *really* dependent on the foundry business to keep developing, if intel has good nodes, that's compelling enough as is for most partners.",idm is supposed to operate more or less independently anyway.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
apple and tsmc and samsung together ?,letâ€™s be subtle?,apple dropped samsung when they started competing directly on smartphones and literally stealing their ideas.,"hard to have your biggest competitor also be your critical component supplier, especially an untrusted one.",it is also why intel will fail as a trusted foundry.,"the biggest hpc customers of tsmc are direct intel competes against; amd, nvidia, and others like microsoft or fb and others look to displace intel high margin chips with their own.","apple competes with intel now too with superior design, scale and technology.","how many other companies can afford to pay for the value and cost of leading edge, not many.",intel foundry dream will be a distant third and thus wonâ€™t have scale and without scale canâ€™t get economies of scale and compete with tsmc nor invest line them.,nah intel wonâ€™t ever recover.,look they canâ€™t even get the euv tools they need for themselves.,"so they at get a working process but you need volume to get yield and scale, they will never get either.","this wonâ€™t be a popular post,  intel is going the way of ibm.","competing against the foundry ecosystem system or tsmc, apple, mediatek, nvidia, amd and so many more and from behind in both technology and scal le is destined to fail even with german and american tax payer subsidies.",the economic truth is painful.,maybe a war or earthquake or drought maybe be intels only chance.,i am sure that is what pat prays for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> i can see intel maintaining parity

that would be ""catching up"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is actually exactly what intel has started doing.,an example is loihi 2 on their intel 4 node.,"here is a quote [directly from the intel website](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-unveils-neuromorphic-loihi-2-lava-software.html#gs.x9x0tz)

""loihi 2 has been fabricated with a pre-production version of the intel 4 process, which underscores the health and progress of intel 4. the use of extreme ultraviolet (euv) lithography in intel 4 has simplified the layout design rules compared to past process technologies.","this has made it possible to rapidly develop loihi 2""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel is leading in density per node compared to samsung and tsmc, their next node jump to 4nm will most likely be superior in density to the competition, also samsung node has the least density and least yield.",in the near future intel and tsmc will fight for the crown while samsung will become the new intel by the looks of it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thereâ€™s a massive amount of fab building going on - intel has 2 new ones in az and announced fabs in germany and ohio.,tsmc is building in az and other locations as well.,thereâ€™s gonna be a whole lotta capacity 5 years out.,i suspect somewhere a few years out intel would prefer to be in-house if they can match tsmc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it is highly speculative i agree, because of course foundries don't provide all the hard numbers all the time, so you do have to speculate and guess sometimes.","that's why i also recommended checking out the article where they explain their estimates- because that's what they are, estimates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"10 years ago that was the case as x86 was enough and far more volume than anyone else and that is why intel crushed motorola, ibm, amd and many more during the last two decades .",it was volume and market driven innovation.,well they missed the mobile pivot and today samsung and tsmc have far larger scale maybe 5x more volume.,that drives far large economies of scale increasing learning.,"intel is finished as a result, you simply have no shortcuts to make up the volume advantage.",it is why pat is pushing hard on foundry.,"sadly he is behind on technology, has no ecosystem and all the users of leading edge are competitors, broken strategy, lol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
source?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's an odd mix for sure.,"i could see it shaking out like this:

highly recommended if you ask me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is there a compelling reason *not* to do a fresh install?,"all things being equal, i would start fresh every time, clean os, clean driver installs, no garbage data on the boot drive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

microsoftâ€™s settings have always been a mess.,"even in windows 10, how many completely separate places do you have to go to find all important settings?","and then even between everything scattered around â€œsettingsâ€ and â€œcontrol panelâ€, thereâ€™s still the utterly archaic â€œcomputer administrationâ€ section where you have to go for basic tasks like partitioning a disk.","apparently you can still do local accounts on 11. easier on pro, more convoluted on home.",but not forced to do an online account.,"since windows 3.1 i canâ€™t say iâ€™ve ever wanted to put the taskbar anywhere but the bottom, but i know others differ there.","they really should change that, but for now something like startallback will let you put the taskbar anywhere you want, fixes the missing context menus etc, and basically adds back everything that microsoft really should leave up to user customization.",but even windows 10 has a ton of crappy user interface ideas that they never â€œfixedâ€.,"both 10 and 11 try to be a middle ground between mouse and touch interfaces, but i find they both lean too far towards touch efficiency.",like the scrolling program menu on 7/10 is actually crap for mouse efficiency.,"on 11, i find the little button to bring up the full program menu oddly difficult to hit with a mouse (like it registers that i clicked the button, but apparently not exactly on the actual text so it decides not to do anything).","anyhow, 10 has bad ideas, 11 has bad ideas, i donâ€™t find 11 any more egregious in this regard than 10, but since itâ€™s new, itâ€™s easier to hate it and live with the bad ideas weâ€™re already used to.","but for a new system where thereâ€™s a good reason to want it (proper task scheduler for alder lake), might as well get used to it now.",itâ€™s really not horrible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i found one intel core i7-3740qm with 16gb ram really really cheap, i know it's older but the base frequency is much higher and i like a lot the laptop, what do you think?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the thing with the different generations of cpus is that often the newer generations can process faster at the same clock speed so you have to be careful about how you compare.,the base frequency doesn't really mean anything on intel cpus.,max turbo is what is important so long as the system can keep itself cool enough.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nice to know that, i was considering computers with higher base frequency but lower turbo but is a really tricky thing all this haha",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">given how an 8-core rocket lake die was about 30% larger than a 10-core comet lake die, what if the extra die space was used for more l3 cache?",you can compare the single core ipc of the 7700k (8 mb l3) to that of the 10900k (same core but 20 mb l3) to see how the cache scaling is on comet lake is from 2.5x more l3.,"there is in general some improvement from the larger cache, but it's not huge.",for games i think it would have been a winner but probably not most other things.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you going to chance mobo completely, just go for a 12400. given the 610+12400 price there's close to no reason to go to any other platform.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you can get a good deal on that i7-7700 for ~$100 than sure go for it, otherwise just wait with upgrading and get i5-12400 build, that will last you for quite a bit.","main problem with 7700 is that it's still 4c8t which may be a bit dated this days (i3's have that much cores now), especially when multitasking, and in games that uses all the cpu power they can.","i'm running e3-1230 v2 (i7-3770 equivalent) and as going from i5 -> i7 was a huge relieve, with my load (youtube 1080p60, twitch source etc.","with cpu bound games and running vm's in background) it really hinders the experience, and going to even 10400 (had it for a bit, gave it to my wife) was a really nice upgrade, and i suddenly had a lot of extra power and my fps improved too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the i7 7700 will pair perfectly with the 1080 ti when playing most games.,"[my previous 7700 + 1070 sc rig](https://i.redd.it/4pz7sqrisft41.png) was more than enough for games today, and the 7700 can easily pair with a 2070 super if needed.",certain newer multiplayer battlefield titles will run the 7700 very close to 100% but the 4c/8t with hyper-threading is not going to let you down.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
got a 7700k installed when it was new back in 2017. oc'd to 5ghz.,still a beast.,does everything it's supposed to do.,only things like win11 for example you need a workaround.,i would say go for the i7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're right.,i can get them for like 200â£.,i think might as wel...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or even 12100f + h610.,it will outperform that i7 and i5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you can also get an 11400f for â£133 + a â£59 msi h510m-a pro right now, which would still get you pcie4 for future gpu upgrades, and a 6 core for â£40-50 less.","it'll be 15% slower for, 20% less money, but you're going to be gpu bound in modern titles because of how graphically demanding things are anyways, and won't notice the difference.",but it probably is worth spending â£40-50 more for 12th gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12100f or 11400f?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i see...ive seen people running 4th gen i7 and the game runs fine... i just use my pc for this game and nothing else.,will sell after a year,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how about 12100f?,like 90â£ only,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's a trade off.,"the motherboard is more expensive than 11th gen. you get 4 cores, so it might be the case that in the distant future (like 3 years from now) it might be slower than a 11400f in some titles (but not most), and in the very, very distant future i'd guess 5 to 7 years, it might not be able to run a couple of games at all anymore.",but right now the 12100f is faster pretty much all the time i think.,at least in games.,"the question is, what's better having 25% faster cores, or 50% more cores.","right now, faster cores.","and if you do get a 12100f, you can always upgrade in the future to like a 13400f on the used market maybe in 4 years time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is what i picked in the end...coming in 2 days lets see,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yesh i just got it.,the mobo is like 20â£ more expensive but the cpu is like â£50 cheaper and from what i've seen it does very slightly better than 11400,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

better than a â€œgoodâ€ air cooler?,240. better than something like the d15?,280 or 360. i really would not go less than a 280 for the 12900k.,"also, the radiator surface area of a 280 is only 9% less than a 360. but a 240 is 26% less than a 280.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's a pretty impressive uplift for some games tbh.,i'm a lot more interested in zen 4 after seeing this which will have an even larger and more refined 3d cache.,something like a 7800x with a massive cache might be appealing in the fall if i pull the trigger on building a new system.,probably will decide between that and a 13700k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thatâ€™s equal gaming performance at 100w lessâ€¦they deserve the credit over this.,"someone can drop this into a 2017 platform and get 2022 flagship gaming performance, thatâ€™s amazingâ€¦interested to see what raptor lake vs zen4 match up looks like!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"alder lake on ddr5 beats this, but this is still_x000d_ an impressive jump from zen 3 to zen 3d.",ddr4 isn't getting any faster while faster ddr5 kits keep coming out.,amd should have launched this last year.,zen 4 won't be impressive in gaming compared to zen 3d and might even lose to it in some games given how reliant on l3 cache the zen architecture is.,"amd is blowing up all their cards too early, lol.","zen4 will have less cores, less l2 cache per core and less unified l3 cache than the raptor lake i9.",it's over.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so- sacrifices in general productivity and even some games for an overall up lift in gaming but barely beating the 12900k.,have to say im disappointed.,benefit of the doubt maybe tpu had a bad sample.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> interested in zen 4 after seeing this which will have an even larger and more refined 3d cache.,"i think the first ones are supposed to have just the regular 32mb of l3, and no 3d stacking, from what i've heard.",maybe zen4 refresh could have 96mb again.,actually kind of weird how amd has made no changes to l2 cache amounts in 5 years with 512kb since zen1.,"intel was stuck on 256kb for like a decade from 2009 to 2020, but since 2020 they went from 256kb to 1.25mb in just 2 years, and will be at 2mb with raptor lake.",so 8x the l2 cache increase in 3 years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm not surprised to see some uplifts.,pepperridge farm remembers the i7-5775c and its 128mb l4 cache.,it held its own against the 1st gen skylake cpus and only fell behind when compared against the 6-core coffee lake cpus.,"(edit: looking at the reviews again, it only held up against haswell cpus that had a ~700 mhz higher clock rate and higher tdp.","skylake's ipc was too much for the 5775c's extra cache)

sometimes i wonder how comet lake would have performed if intel gave it extra l3 cache instead of going with rocket lake.",rl in its 8 core config used about 30% more die space than cl in its 10 core config.,a 10900k with doubled l3 cache going up against the 11900k would have been interesting.,"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-rocket-lake-delidded

> by way of reference, using similar measuring techniques, the 10-core comet lake chips are around 22.4mm ã— 9.2mm, or 206.1 mm2.",(intel didn't disclose the actual die size.),"that makes rocket lake about 34 percent larger than comet lake, despite having two fewer cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"zen4 according to rumors will have 20-25 % more ipc doble l2 cache, more frecuency,  rdna2 integranted gpu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my guess is because the 12900k is slightly better on avg at 720p (100% vs 100.4%) than the 5800x3d in this particular selection of titles.,this review paints a more favorable picture for the 12900k/ks than the other review.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean its an interesting comparison given it goes h2h with the 12900k.,nothing really wrong too see what the other party is doing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why are either of these here.,it's just the other sub brigading.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's not how this works.,the 100 watts less is for 100% all-core loads.,"in which the 5800x3d performs a lot worse, around 12600k performance.","a 12900k uses like 70-80w in games, same with the 12700k, 5900x and 5950x use more, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"tpu is using the fastest ddr5 kit available in the market, which is more expensive than a 5800x3d + motherboard ddr4 ram.",the 12900k is still slower than the 5800x3d for gaming.,"when we are seeing that a two year old architecture, running on 5 year old motherboards, with 10 year old ram, winning vs the most modern intel chip, and it does it with using less power, saying that amd is finished makes no sense.","i rather see intel in a pretty bad position, they have done everything they could with alder lake, and in the end, amd has won again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>actually kind of weird how amd has made no changes to l2 cache amounts in 5 years with 512kb since zen1.,it isn't that weird.,the optimal amount for an architecture is the amount that gives the lowest average access latency.,until they do some major redesign of zen to change what is optimal it isn't going to make sense to change the l2.,the size will be essentially correct for what they have.,">intel was stuck on 256kb for like a decade from 2009 to 2020, but since 2020 they went from 256kb to 1.25mb in just 2 years, and will be at 2mb with raptor lake.","ice lake was a major change, making their cores a lot wider but also giving them much more ability to reorder instructions around cache latency, so probably after that it made sense to rethink their cache layout for the new, wider cores.",same for alder lake which got even wider.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i always wondered why amd didn't just add an l4 cache to the memory controller, instead of stacking v-cache.","i would have thought it be cheaper, but maybe it's just too slow.","last i heard cache is notoriously hard to shrink anyways, and making it on 12nm glofo would have been affordable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i expect it to be a huge jump for amd.,don't really care about the igpu since i'll probably be pairing it with something like a 4080 but that will be a nice selling point for some people.,"i hope they sell an ""f"" version similar to intel at a little cheaper price.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the ram used for the adl system costs as much as the 5800x3d itself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i am currently on an 8700k, if i had to upgrade now (i mainly game), then the 5800x3d is a no brainer, almost equal performance (in gaming) to the 12900k/ks and quite a bit cheaper (plus cheaper board)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don't post facts into redditors.,they will downvote you to hell.,"no, the 12900k consumes 350 watts in gaming

why are people downvoting you.,ryzen 5000 cpus use more power than all 12th gen core cpus in gaming.,this isn't news; idle and light load is amds weak point due to the io die.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it doesnâ€™t win in productivity or gaming at less power.,only in maximum load is it lower in power and that doesnâ€™t mean anything other than it uses less power at maximum load.,the intel chip would be almost identical using ddr4 as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wrong.,they used 6000 cl36 which is not even close to the fastest and uses shitty samsung ics.,it's all about that sk hynix this gen (for now).,fastest stock xmp kit is 6400 cl32 for $449 at newegg.,i am using that kit on my 12900k at 6800 cl32 and it's a beast.,significantly faster than the 6000 cl36 shown here.,"you can buy a 5800x3d for $449 or buy a 12900kf for $579 and have double the multicore performance and same/better gaming perf, an upgrade path, pcie 5.0. easy choice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hahaha.,ddr5-6000 cl36 is not the fastest ddr5 kit on the market buddy.,amd is clearly beaten in most games.,they used 50% more silicon to produce that additional cache layer and still managed to lose to intel who simply binned a 12900k into 12900ks.,the 5800x3d loses to the normal 5800x in cs:go and who knows how many games will behave like that.,it's worse than its normal zen 3 counterparts in everything except gaming.,it is not the world's best gaming processor.,it's a piece of trash stuck on ddr4 and the buggy am4 platform.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"around the time when the 3d stacking was first mentioned, there was an article that analyzed the zen 3 cpus' die design and noticed that there were extra connections located around where the stacked cache were depicted as being located.",i'm curious of how long they had been planning on the stacked cache design for them to have preliminary support for it before the first batch of zen 3 cpus were even produced.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
moving data over fabric itself is slow.,once you start heading over to the iod you've already cost yourself a lot of cycles.,probably still faster than system memory but maybe too slow to matter.,"also these chips are just repurposed milan-x dies, so they kind of double dip here by giving hyperscalers what they want and selling leftovers to consumers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

dude your memory alone costs as much as the 5800x3d by itself lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think they say it's like 3-4 years from planning to production for something like this.,so they probably planned v-cache 3 years ago.,"they have zen5 all planned out, and that won't come out until like 2024, or maybe even 2025 if they do a zen4 refresh first.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

do you need a hedt based system anymore?,the very high core count or many pcie lanes?,if you only need 1 or 2 pcie devices and 16 cores is plenty than latest gen parts will be faster for you.,if you need the high core counts or pcie lanes then at the moment the only option out there as an upgrade is a thread ripper based system or wait until the sapphire rapids-x systems show up.,rule of thumb for intel based is normally their platforms will support 2 generations of cpus then get flicked for a newer platform.,"amd consumer line has lasted longer with am4, but their threadripper line has been pretty terrible for any sort of future proof mentality.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

your point?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a 10980xe with a 3080 and play at 1080p.,"for a year, i only oc'd the core clocks to 4.6ghz all core.","recently, i learned to oc the mesh and ram and it gave me more gains that i thought.","in shadow of the tomb raider, i went from an average fps of 200 to 245 in 1080p lowest benchmark, that is a 22.5% gain.","from other benchmarks online, this new result is on par with a maxed out 10900k, a 12900k will definitely beat that but at 4k..it would depend on what games you're playing, you might see a big difference if you're playing esport titles like csgo, if, however, you're playing triple a games like god of war, then you might see little to no difference.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"z690 ddr4 is only good for alder lake so far, because we haven't heard confirmation that intel will allow raptor lake support on z690 ddr4 boards, but z690 ddr5 seems to be scheduled to support both; intel has a tendency to force motherboard changes on their platform, whether they are warranted or not, so i wouldn't buy anything with the expectation of an upgrade path.","with that said, raptor lake is not going to be a momentuous shift; it's still an intel 7 cpu (10nm) with the same golden cove+gracemont cores (p+e cores), with the top sku looking to be 24c/32t (8p+16e as opposed to the 12900k 8p+8e) and more cache (a little bit more l2 for p-cores and more l2+l3 for the e-cores).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you don't need it wait till 13th gen. ddr5 is not amazing right now and for most users pcie 5 doesn't do much at all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 12900k is only a 24 thread processor.,the 10980xe is 32 threads like the 5950x.,"depends on the applications you run, but all three can trade blows (10980xe does need some overclocking help, but that was back when overclocking had a bit more headroom).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your cpu isnt old and you probably dont need an upgrade,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"10980xe has 18 cores and 36 threads :)

yes in all core workloads they indeed can trade blow with each other, i personally meant in gaming.","for productivity where you  need as many cores and threads as you can get you are most likely have upgraded to threadripper hedt, especially recent pro 5000 series which is insane for that stuff.",i meant mostly for enthusiasts who buys hedt for gaming or mixed workload(yes those people exist :d),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"pcie 3.0 is slower, but compatible with 4.0 in both directions.","most gpus are fine with 3.0 speeds with the notable exception of the rx 6500 xt, which is limited to just 4 lanes and that's not good with pcie 3.0.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i would stay away from 10th gen, since most 11th gen is only slightly more costly, and still works on the same motherboard.",unless you're really desperate.,i'd get an 11400f over a 10600k any day for example.,"if you're getting a gpu that has 8x pcie4 support like the 6600xt, it'll run at 8x pcie3 on a 10th gen cpu.","if there is a future gpu that has 8x pcie5, it'll still run on your system, but be 1/4 the bandwidth, and you'll loose a lot of performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"your question is confusing, but i'll try to answer.","a 10th gen cpu will work in a pcie 4 motherboard (by pcie 4 motherboard i assume you mean a z490 or 500 series motherboards like z590 or b560) but the pcie slot will not run at gen 4 speeds, it will be limited to gen 3.

if you should be worried by that or not depends on your gpu, most gpus do not need gen 4 speeds.",pcie gen 4 gpus still work on gen 3 and at basically the same speed.,"there are a few gimped to gen 4 x8 that run a little faster on gen 4, but if you mean the one amd gimped to gen 4 x4 (rx 6500 xt), then it's absolutely something to worry about.","if thats your gpu, absolutely get a pcie 4 supporting cpu and motherboard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can run a pcie 4 gpu at pcie 3 speed if needed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

intel iris xe is better.,but there are two types of iris xe - 80eus and 96eus.,"the more eus, the better.",but i don't think it's enough for apex legends,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"anything with a gtx 1650 or 3050 will crush any of those, including the mx350.",the cpu matters less than getting a proper gpu.,"i'd still get something relatively recent (10th gen or above intel, 4/5000 series amd) and six cores if possible.","(amd has some mobile gpus as well, but some launched back in january and may not be in laptops, yet.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so would it be better to go with a amd ryzen 7 5700u with amd radeon graphics or intel i7 10th gen with nvidia geforce mx350?,( the nvidia is a dgpu but runs on intel i7 10th gen and the amdâ€™s cpu has 8 cores so not sure which one i should go with),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
