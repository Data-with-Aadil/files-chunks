"is it better than amd radeon graphics on a amd ryzrn 7 5700u cpu, the intel cpu is i7 11gen (i know its not an intel cpu buy just wanted to know)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the one with the mx350 will perform way better in games.,the extra cores will only be useful if you need them for stuff like coding or simulations so i wouldn't worry too much about that unless you're going to study something that requires heavy computation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
amd gpu is better.,some game won't even launch in intel gpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so would it be better to go with a amd ryzen 7 5700u with amd radeon graphics or intel i7 10th gen with nvidia geforce mx350?,( the nvidia is a dgpu but runs on intel i7 10th gen and the amdâ€™s cpu has 8 cores so not sure which one i should go with),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

where did you see thar?,the 12900ks is a guaranteed above average 12900k.,a random ks will overclock on average a bit better than a random 12900k.,infact the ks is guaranteed to do 5.2 all core.,there's a fair number of 12900ks that can't do that.,"many can, but alot cant.",whether or not that is worth the extra $150+ is subjective.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

filling out all the slots won't net you the best performance increase and limits your overlcocking ability.,better to get 2x32 rather than 4x16 (don't know why you need 64gig of ram lol) find the lowest latency ram over 3600mhz speed and that'll be the best.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the cpu power cable is not called pcie, that's the one used for the gpu, but eps.",the confusion is understandable side they are similar but it's important to not confuse them since they aren't the same thing and if swapped around they will cause damage.,"having this said using just 1 is perfectly fine, the second one is useful only for sub-zero overclocking.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

12600k is not 8 cores.,it's 6 p-cores (12threads) and 4 e-cores (4threads).,this is not equal to something like 5900x that has 12 of the same cores.,the e-cores are not really that powerful as far as i know.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"you're better off with the 12700f, really.","it has 8 p cores, and i don't care about e cores at all.",you can even turn them off because some games give extra fps with e-cores turned off.,"also, you can get cheaper board and cooler with the 12700f.",a b660 will suffice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"**some** games don't properly utilize the e-cores, and the windows 11 alder lake scheduler can mess things up sometimes.",there are **some** games that might actually crash with e-cores enabled.,"for this, intel has put a ""legacy mode"" in the bios, which you can enable.","with that enabled, pressing the ""scroll lock"" key while in windows, puts the e-cores on stand-by.",so you can launch the game or get better frame rates.,"some games do benefit from e-cores, tho.",but not many.,not yet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"looks good, and gives room for interesting articles.",compare with the 5800x to see to which extent games are cache limited.,"of course compare with the 12900k, and then also compare with the ddr5 config to see to which extent it can mitigate lower cache.","anyway, this is the final upgrade for those of us with an am4 board.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

increasing l3 cache to absurd amounts only benefits certain games at certain settings (1080p and lower).,"basically if you play those competitive games like cs go at 1080p then this is great, anything else it is a dead weight.",i would rather have super high clock speed that intel offers and massive core count increases rather than being stuck forever at same core number.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all of the games tested here launched during the ps4/xbox one era.,these were made with slow jaguar cores in mind.,i'm not sure to what extent they actually stress the compute power of modern cpus.,the only post ps5/xsx era game amd showed on their slides  was far cry 6.,5 out of the 8 games tested during hardware unboxed 12900ks review were launched in the ps5/xsx console cycle.,i'll wait for day one reviews.,i'd also like to see ddr5-6000+ numbers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why are the benchmarks in 720p like wtf?,who buys a 5800x3d /12900kf to play at 720p?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think people are missing the point because the normal 5800x wasn't included.,the 5800x was on average slower than the 12900k.,this appears to close the gap to tie at least in less cache sensitive games and turn it into a lead in more sensitive games.,in any case its a very fascinating technology and its gonna be interesting to see what amd does with it in the future.,but the most impressive thing here is the compatibility angle.,this cpu is a drop in replacement for pretty much any semi-decent amd board since 2017. someone that bought a x370 board 5 years ago along with some decent ddr4 ram can get this cpu today and get flagship performance on their 5 year old platform.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'm curious about 12700f (the extra turbo speed on the k is really not meaningful)+ good ddr5 vs ddr4 3800 1:1 5800x3d.,"the intel combo will be more expensive, but i'm curious if it will pull even",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
technically you're correct.,not sure how that translates into the real world.,never seen anyone even mention running it with ddr3.,quick google nets nothing as well!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i doubt it seriously.,it's a pain to support both and makes nobody rich.,"also ddr5 proven to uncap the performance in games, so likely even if it does support ddr4, it won't be faster than 12900k /5800x3d with ddr4.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

roughly 80% more than 4x8gb ddr4 3600cl14 kit.",so what i really want to see is 12700f with e cores turned off versus the 5800x3d.,"the marginally higher clocks of the k really doesnt mean much, so it depends how much the 5mb less l3 cache hurts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sorry not up to speed with ddr5 yet as i run ddr4.. but yeah with ddr4 you didnt need to buy expensive memory since many cheap kits could be overclocked - samsung b die -.. dont know if something like that exist for ddr5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not to mention most have better 1%lows.,it's like almost 50/50 that fps avgs are significantly higher.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"except there is no way the 5800x3d is going to make up for the clocks speed deficit and the missing 8 e cores(moar cache or not)............it should be compared to what you can get at the same price, which if you can live without the k you can get alot out of intel right now.","edit 12700kf is $377 on newegg, the next jump is way over $500 so at $449 i still lol, no way this magic cache is going to be worth only having 8c/16t and no overclocking.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you seen what intel wants for the 12700f?,it absolutely destroys the 3d in everything (st / multithread / socket longevity) and it only loses by 3-4% at 720p gaming.,yet the 3d costs 50 freaking % more.,that's a freaking joke.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah well, doesn't matter.","for the price of the 5800x 3d you could buy a 12700f with a motherboard, lose 3-4% in gaming performance but completely destroy it in everything else, be it single threaded or multithreaded performance, with a new mobo that supports modern io and is still upgradable.","it's a terrible deal for 450â‚¬, if it was priced at 300 it would be fine.",now it's just a joke.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

high quality ddr5 kits are not cheap.,a 6400 mhz 32gb kit goes for more than the cost of the 5800x3d itself.,the lower quality ones (e.g.,"~5000 mhz) might be clocked higher, but they also have much larger latency timings which makes them worse than a well tuned 3733-4000 mhz samsung b-die",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

but isnt that supposed to happen?,"the 12900k is like 100+â‚¬ more expensive and to me it looks like an in between of the 5800x and the 12900k, exactly where u would expect it,  no?",i love that the 5800x3d is beating /is up to par with the 12900k.,"but it shouldnâ€™t even do that for the price point, should it?",please point out if im completely missing the point here lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

based on the benchmarks it overall matches 12900k performance in games so i don't know what you're talking about.,it's a cpu intended for gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you look at the benchmarks?,....depends on what you are doing.,e cores are currently useless or even detrimental for gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"another way to look at it, is that it matches or surpassed the 12900ks in gaming while being 50% cheaper.",it also doesn't require fusion power station to run.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's \~3 quarters.,intel claims a [q1 start of production and q2 ramp and general availability](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intels-timeline-slips-10nm-sapphire-rapids-to-enter-production-in-2022) for  sapphire rapids.,if you have any newer/more recent information about the launch of sapphire rapids please do link.,"also emeralds rapids isn't supposed to be a huge improvement over sapphire rapids anyway, same node just more cores, same socket, and a small step up from the architecture of golden cove (should be using raptor cove, or a similar architecture) , [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g44zqii9gv4&t=907s) .","on top of that it also matches up with what happened with alder lake, golden cove cores in consumer launched first, and 2 quarters later we should be seeing sapphire rapids according to intel.","similarly, raptor cove in consumers first - raptor lake, and then 2 quarters later, we could see them in server- emerald rapids.","not saying it is definitely going to happen, this is all just speculation of course, but those reasons, and mlid also saying this was planned to be an q1 2023 launch, makes me think it certainly is plausible.",though ig i could also see it being pushed back to q2  because of what happened with sapphire rapids delays.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"off course there will be overlap, but how else will intels manufacturing road map work?","i didnâ€™t pull this out of my ass, intel 4 is manufacturing ready by 1h 23, intel 3 2h 23, and so on and so on.",that is from official intel roadmaps and announcements.,look at anandtechs roadmap for confirmationâ€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"definitely realistic- remember intel themselves said meteor lake will be shipping in 2023. and honestly, i won't even be surprised if meteor lake was a mobile-first design, with intel specifying 'low power' and 'next gen igpu'.","add onto that the leaks supporting a mobile focus, with some leakers claiming it might be mobile only.... though how believable a mobile only launch will be is debatable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to be fair, their [intel 7 and intel 4 teams are different and work separately](https://www.anandtech.com/show/13683/intel-euvenabled-7nm-process-tech-is-on-track) so the delay faced by the intel 7/ 10nm team doesn't mean intel 4 will face any additional delays.",one of the main factors that caused intel to delay intel 10nm/intel 7 so much was because they did not move to euv and projected much higher density estimations and goals for their node.,"this is solved by intel 4 because they 'simplified' the process (less dense) and also i[ncreased their use of euv by more than 100 percent](https://www.nextplatform.com/2021/03/24/the-once-the-future-and-the-fabulous-intel/), fully embracing the requirement for euv for denser and smaller nodes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because the nm doesn't mean shit anymore and intel's 10nm is comparable in terms of density to tsmc's 7nm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
true,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"emr is a ""bugfixed"" spr, from what i know, but that's beside the point, the issue is launching two server lines so close to each other, it royally pisses off partners, idm, oem, odm the whole bunch, validation , marketing, design for a new line take more than 3 quarters.",so i'm skeptical of this timeframe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm not saying you made this up, this a good piece of info (thanks for it, btw!).",it's that seeing how samsung and tsmc are struggling with a node every 18 or so months (or more even) i have a hard time seeing intel just getting 3 nodes in a year and change.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i know that the transistor density is comparible, i just wish there was an industry standard marketing term for comparison.",companies having separate systems so you have to check raw specs every time makes it very anti-consumer.,"they know full well that a consumer will see 7 and assume its 7nm, so i technically see it as disingenuous.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's because you're making the wrong assumptions about the quality of intel's launches up to this point.,icelake was broken for years.,"hyperscalers quite literally purchased 14nm parts rather than icelake until 2021.

spr was going to be a completely broken q1 launch before their new ceo correctly made the decision to stop bullshitting people.","it was never going to hit that deadline, ""real"" launch is q2 for contracts they can't delay without fines like their doe test builds.",actual availability q3~ according to inspur.,"that said people still want the cores even if its missing full cxl support, amd is sold out for milan and booked up for future genoa chips so there's no alternative if you want high volume of chips in 2022~2023.","emerald will presumably be a fully functional spr with features that were promised and socket compatible, so it's not surprising that it will drop so close to spr.",may as well just call it spr 1.1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they just redefined ""node"" to match the bs node naming the rest of the industry uses, so if you look at them as custom tweaks or node iterations it makes more sense.","no area targets, only perf/watt, so intel can hit the target with wider designs and improved interconnects.","they're not planning on selling those nodes for ifs, 18a is apparently their leading ifs node, so no customers asking questions if ppa is low on intel 4/3.",only one that seems unrealistic is intel 4's timeline.,euv purchases are booked up for years so intels going to need to eat some margins on wafers and stockpile chips or pull out some real process breakthroughs to get those chips out at volume.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ye if they do pull it off i would be amazed.,"intel 7 seemed to go well (don't think the node was the reason sapphire rapids was delayed- mlid even said they might enable more cores on the cpu the way yields are going), so that does lead me to believe there might be hope for intel 4 as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think the important thing here is that intel probably has a lot of unrealised experience from their work on trying to get their original 10nm duv node working, and whatever else they were working on during that time period.","this probably won't help ramp up much, but this probably gives them a solid groundwork to get these nodes up and running relatively fast compared to the competition, which didn't really experience the same stagnation and thus don't have a backlog of years of (presumably useful) rnd.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s better than other companies just calling something 7nm when itâ€™s really 10nm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ye no i completely agree with the euv point, intel has like a handful of euv machines (ian cutresses video showcased atleast 4 and he said there were some 'additional' euv machines else where in the d1x) but idk if it would be enough to have a healthy ramp.","i think this also was partly why the moved granite rapids onto intel 3, gives more time to get more euv machines and produce chips.",something that i find interesting is that part of fixing their intel 4 process was [increasing euv use by more than 100 percent](https://www.channelfutures.com/galleries/9-takeaways-from-ceo-pat-gelsinger-s-intel-idm-2-0-strategy-briefing-gallery) which makes intel even more reliant on having enough euv machines than previously thought a couple years ago.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel really only ever powered on console wich was the og xbox.,unless something happens to amd i donâ€™t see microsoft or sony leaving since the amd specific apis and both companies leaning into backwards comparability.,nintendo seems pretty set to continue with arm/nvidia.,so really the only place you will probably see intel is in the handheld pc market.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are consoles the reason intel is working on gpu's and igp?,absolutely not.,could intel power the ps6/next gen xbox?,"sure, but that's years out.","it actually wouldn't be a bad goal, console margins are shit, but with intel ramping up fab production, having an extra place to dump excess chips would be beneficial, and it would starve amd of a revenue stream.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"rdna 3 will smoke intel, makes no sense why msft or sony would switch",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
god i hope not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
true when there's only three players with long relationships it's a tough nut to crack.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's weird that you frame ""starve amd of a revenue stream"" as a positive, given intel is a massively bigger corporation and has abused it's market power before to stifle competition.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thought came from another thread where the discussion was along the line that pc ports might be better optimized for amd architectures over time.,if margins are bad (i'm completely out of my depth here) then it makes sense if it's never a significant focus but the thought occurred.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if you want a cheaper alternative than going with the 4770/4790k.,is to get the xeon equivalent which for you is the xeon e3-1231v3/e3-1241v3.,its cheaper than both the i7.,it's also a bit slower but its neglible but a heck of a lot cheaper than getting the i7.,also the xeons that i have mention have hyperthreading which is what the i7 have.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you will definitely see an improvement with the 4790. but it is dated and really just delaying the inevitable upgrade in the future.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"you can get a 12600k + mobo for the price of a 11900k, and it's much better than both i9s for gaming",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with triple 1440ps you should be working that gpu at 100%.,"itâ€™s hard to know though, is your cpu pegged at 100%?",are things running hot?,"my opinion is the 11900k shouldnâ€™t exist, itâ€™s not enough of a tangible performance uplift to justify going backwards to 8c/16t.",so i would do some more investigating before making a cpu swap.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11900k is actually a downgrade.,it's a waste of everyone's time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
try disabling hyperthreading and overclock your 10900k.,you will see an increase in single core performance which is key for racing sims.,"also, faster ram definitely helps too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do not go from an 10900k to 11900k.,not worth it.,you'd have to havily oc and tweak the ram to make it worth while.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12600k is faster that 11900k in mt and better in gaming.,i would get 12700kf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don't even bother 10900k tuned>11900k tuned.,id look into overclocking cpu and getting a decent b-die kit.,much more efficient ways to boost gpu usage.,"it'll take time to learn, esp ddr4 ocing.",but for most people the initial time taken to learn and tune for better performance until you upgrade for real is a good deal.,psa: oc your ring clock too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"reading the comments and the original post, i would not recommend ""upgrading"" to the 11900k.",sounds more like a gpu utilization issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
get a 2x16 gb kit of samsung bdie and tune the memory.,my old 10900k was an absolute beast.,3800 c14 - 4600 c17 is doable depending on ur cpus imc and mobo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, no, *no*.",donâ€™t upgrade to the 11900k.,"an eight-core should never be $500 in 2022, and the 10900k genuinely beats it in the majority of workloads.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'd argue that the 12700k is better overall value.,i'd further with wait for the 13700k to come out and make all the above look silly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
unfortunately no!!,cpu usage is between 30 40% only that's why i'm losing my mind!,!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so you mean that simracing games take advantage from the single thread performance more?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12700f + b660 is my value pick,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"gaming is often bottlenecked by a single thread, which means cpu usage statistics are deceptive.","if you have only a single thread pegged, but are on a 8 core cpu - that would show as 12.5% cpu usage.","change your overlay to show the maximum single core usage, it's much more useful for determining gaming bottlenecks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, my gut would tell me there's something more there.","unless you've down scaled your resolution, or have low refresh monitors, that amount of usage on a 10900k should still have the gpu pegged at 100%.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the cpu will often never bottleneck to 100%.,there will be another location where the bottle neck occurs before the cpu hits the limit.,even 50% to 70% cpu usage is considered a bottleneck.,at least from my experience.,it could be some memory bottleneck or whatever.,how you can tell that you have a cpu bottleneck is to just lower the graphical settings.,try your triple sim monitor racing setup and report your maximum fps and maximum cpu utilization with the 32inch monitors set to a resolution lower than 1440p.,maybe try 720p then 1080p on the triple monitor setup and report back.,my understanding is that the 10900k is still a great performer.,11900k is an even better single core performer but it loses in multi-threaded productivity and it does run a bit more hot/use a few watts more.,it doesn't go insane like 150 extra watts over the 10900k.,"it will be more like if you were at 60watts on 10900k, the 11900k would now run at 100watts or something.",thats like less than a 60watt lightbulb.,or 8 - 5 watt led light bulbs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

|msft: fs2020|1080p \[5%min,avg,5%max\] fps|1440p \[5%min, avg, 5%max\] fps|

|11900k vs 10900k improvements by %|42.85%, 23.80%, 19.38%|24.11%, 09.07%, 05.21%|

so overall not much improvement for 1440p resolution.","however for 1080p resolutions, the minimum frame rate improves by quite a large amount!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'd skip b660 and do a 12600k and cheap z690.,with 10th gen the b460 wouldn't take an 11th gen so no upgrade path.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
will do that thanksðÿ‘,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a,aging how many people don't understand this.",single threaded performance plus memory latency is the most important metrics for high refresh gaming.,the higher the desired fps the more single thread performance you need.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

youâ€™d have to check the manual and/or service manual for your laptop to see if it had dual m.2 slots.,as a 15â€ itâ€™s very possible.,and hp is very good at publishing that information.,which optane module is it?,a separate optane-only or one of the combined ones?,"one of the catches of the combined optane/ssd modules is itâ€™s technically two devices in one module, and each only gets 2 lanes.",so the ssd is pcie 3.0 x2.,"if you do a lot of work with very large files, your maximum sustained sequential throughout will be lower than the 980 pro.","but if you have to lose the optane, then your latency will definitely go upâ€¦ but for â€œnormalâ€ users you probably wouldnâ€™t notice the difference.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"okay, i did the work for you.",looks like it is the combined 32gb optane/512gb ssd.,"looks like the system only supports pcie 3.0, so the 980 pro is overkill.",get the 970 evo plus if you want to go that route.,"thereâ€™s only room for one 2280 so you would have to completely replace the intel optane/ssd, or buy the 1tb version (not that easy since itâ€™s not a retail product).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on what you're doing.,"for general use you won't see difference, if you're constantly moving large files than the 980 pro will be faster, assuming you're not limited by the transport method (internet, usb, etc) and other source/destination.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh wow.,i bought the ssd because i believed it was pcie 4.0.  i am kind of disappointed.,thank you for looking that up for me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i really hope this holds.,looks impressive!,i still wonder if powervia is an underrated feature here.,that should allow higher (safe voltage) clock speeds than we have today as well as much closer threshold voltages on mobile and server chips for much better efficiency..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i am feeling good about pat fixing manufacturing woes.,one is getting it on top of priority list and 2nd is hiring the right team for the same.,i have no doubt they will have leadership products to follow up.,need to catchup with apple on performance per watt metrics and that wont be easy.,on datacenter they need to improve efficiency dramatically as well.,let us see how granite rapids does with intel euv and new performance core.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah right, gimme a break.",they will deliver 3 new nodes within just over 1 year ?,q3 2023 to q4 2024 is 3 new nodes.,two of which will only be for 2 quarters.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

intel powervia alongside ribbonfet are 2 key things to intel dominance.,those 2 technologies will be responsible for biggest advancement in cpu technology in last 15 years or so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably because they can't get asml to make more machines.,"if they're executing faster than expected, they'd have to stick with regular euv.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah?,they will do that because intel 4 was delayed half a year.,intel 4 is ready and work on intel 3(intel 4+) is probably close to be finished as well.,"and as shared by andreas schilling on twitter, they have a internal only testing node for intel 20a/18a.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ppl can downvote all they like.,"given the roadmaps shared by intel the past years and the delays that every single one faced, why do people believe that suddenly this time will be any different.","managing such a tight schedule as presented would be challenging for a company that was working like clockwork, which intel has not.",it will be interesting to re-visit this post 1 year from now to see what happened.,"a bit of healthy skepticism should exist when reading such aspirational roadmaps, especially given the history.","but i guess, the downvote button is easy, cause i guess doubting the roadmap goals is...",bad??,this sub....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think there are two main nodes on the roadmap.,"intel 3 is an improvement on 4 and intel 20a is apparently a short lived first version of the gaafet node with a bit slackened requirements, 18a is meant to replace it quickly.",basically they are at the same time improving on the last finfet and running production on a prototype of the first gaafet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wouldn't get my hopes up for that.,"raptor lake is coming out is coming q3/q4, and on top of that intel 4 is intel's first euv node, and because of it's relatively few amount of euv machines i think the ramp for meteor lake might be longer than their previous 14nm and 10nm superfin/ intel 7 products.","something interesting to note on intel's roadmap [from anandtech](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16823/intel-accelerated-offensive-process-roadmap-updates-to-10nm-7nm-4nm-3nm-20a-18a-packaging-foundry-emib-foveros) is that intel 7 was highlighted for the q3 21 to q2 22, yet raptor lake is supposed to launch q3 22. using that same logic, intel 4 is being highlighted until q2 23, meaning i would think a q3 22 launch would make sense.","i also think you got that timeline for early q2 from raichu, who is a really reputable leaker, but he also tweeted that a while back, and many things have been shifting with timelines at intel.","i would think a q2 launch is possible, but i think a q3 launch is more likely imo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"srry for the late response but here i go:

**changing culture at intel**

there have been many new hires and restricting of the way the company is run.",pat gelsinger has promised- and has shown- to be a lot more transparent about what exactly is going on at intel.,there has also been a resurgence in old intel workers returning to the company.,"lastly, we see the reimplementation of  okrs which help people hold responsibility and stay accountable.","**simplification of intel 4 and embracing euv**

intel 10nm and intel 7nm (now intel 4) teams have always been separate- a delay in one team did not mean a delay in the other (other than having to wait to ramp the newer process node).",the design teams were separate.,the delays of intel 10nm does not mean intel 4 will face the same problem.,"additionally, intel 4 has been massively simplified and increased the use of euv by more than a 100 percent.",part of the problem of intel 10nm was that they had much too high expectations for a node and did not think they would need euv to achieve those.,that problem gets solved in intel 4 where intel has recognized the ability of euv and has started incorporating it more and more.,"**rekindling innovation - alder lake**

alder lake helps show us that intel has the potential to innovate and step up from the same old, same old.",it is a huge step away from their traditional designs.,"the architectural rehaul with golden cove, incorporating big and little cores, and collaborating with devs and microsoft to work on the scheduling shows that intel is willing and has shown people that they can innovate.","**pipe cleaner products**

a part of the reason why tsmc has been successful recently with their nodes on schedule (other than 3nm) is because before releasing huge desktop and hpc chips, they would work with apple and other companies on releasing smaller mobile chips first.",this helps them improve the yields and maturity of the node before releasing higher clocked and bigger desktop chips.,intel has replicated this strategy recently with intel 4- using loihi 2 as a test chip to test the condition of the intel 4 node.,"lastly about the downvotes, it's not the fact that you expressed doubt about the health of the nodes and roadmaps but rather the way you said it, and also the lack of reasoning behind it.",notice how your second comment has no downvotes.,"i have expressed my own doubts about intel 4 before on this sub and not been downvoted like you have, i think yesterday actually you can check out my comments (about meteor lake releasing early q2) because i said it cordially and also explained why i thought so.","edit: not last response, late response, brain fart lol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

equipment limited if anything.,"meteor lake's architecture seems to be on track, with power on completed a month or two ago and 'on track' according to pat gelsinger.",the problem imo is euv machines.,the intel 4 process was already going to be euv based- but gelsinger also stated that they had increased euv use in their intel 4 node by more than a 100 percent- to try fixing it.,intel has become more and more dependent on euv machines while also only having a few relative to tsmc.,"i honestly think intel can pull their node roadmap off- the confidence under the new ceo is simply outstanding, and they are so confident in node health that they pulled intel 18a from 2025 to 2024. who would have expected intel to pull in a launch date?","but the lack of euv machines imo limits their ability to ramp and get their products out the door quickly imo, atleast for intel 4 and a bit later.",maybe by then they would have gotten more euv machines.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in that case, is it a possibility that they might have intel 4 and intel 7 concurrently depending on the sku?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm gonna say no most likely not.,"to do that would require having raptor cove on the low end skus and redwood cove on the high end skus, or different architectures on different skus.","that would be way to complicated....

another option would to have the redwood cove architecture backported, but that would be even more complicated and expensive, and could cause substantial performance drops, as seen with rocket lake.","another option would be to have 14th gen and 13th gen co-exist until 14th gen stock improves, if meteor lake stock ends up being a problem.",i see this as the most likely possibility if stock is bad.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm very interested in the numbers on this.,how many euv machines does intel actually have vs tsmc?,what is their numerically quantified euv capacity?,how many high-na euv did they order at asml and to what volume are they planning to scale up by 2025?,"i know intel is late to the euv game, but it is in their advantage that intel 7 is  duv (afaik at least primarily, they may use euv for some layers?)",- but either way it doesn't eat a lot of euv capacity and is performant enough for now.,so it gives them a way to spread capacity and continue to produce at scale.,"i know these are more or less trade secrets, as ian cutress had to beep out the number of euv machines he saw behind him on his tour of the intel fab.","but at the same time, intel is a public company and they have some fiduciary duty to be transparant about their investments and & r&d.",so it should be possible to be more precise than 'tsmc has more' .,"it is certain that by the time high-na is in production mode, intel will have more of that, as they're the premium partner of asml for high-na and both the us and the eu will be very interested (if not outright pushy) about asml serving intels needs first (the us outright tried to ban euv shipments to china from asml).","as asml is a european company, i think this pressure will likely somewhat influence them, even though of course tsmc is a very important customer.","i think one shouldn't underestimate in general how good the ties are between asml, intel, tsmc and samsung.","at the technological level, they cooperate a lot.",they don't hate one another.,and if tsmc ever had to move (part of) its production to overseas (for example as a mitigation to political instability) it would need assistance from intel for the transition to be succesful.,no one should underestimate how important a thriving semiconductor industry is to society and the degree of brotherhood that exists in the sector.,"i'm not saying competition isn't real - it just is way less pronounced on the manufacturing floor than it is in the news, where animosity is always magnified for theatrical effect.","even jen-hsun huang from nvidia said as much, in that they rely on amd and intel being succesful to ship their own products.",i also have zero doubts that apple would consider working with intel on 18a if it turns out as a class-leading node.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hey look it's the unreal engine!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"both fsr 2.0 and xess, interesting.",i kinda have a feeling that xess will end up as unused tech while fsr 2.0 launches with big support as companies already know about fsr and this being an update.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not really news?,"during intel's arc event they announced several games that would support xess this summer, and ghostwire tokyo was one of them.","sorry for amp, but on mobile:https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.pcmag.com/news/what-is-xess-understanding-intels-game-boosting-supersampling-technology%3famp=true",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can someone translate it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
will be interesting seeing the perf/iq difference with nvidia's dlss when we can use this with intels gpu's.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"what happens if you change ""upscalingtechnique"" field to something valid.","can't test xess yet, but i wonder if you could force fsr2.0.",maybe they accidently already leaked a version in this.,but i wonder if maybe it also needs driver support or it just won't work at all.,"if you enable a upscaling, what does that ""none"" field change to for ""upscalingtechnique=""?",is it like a number ranging from 0-3?,"or is it like ""tsr"" or ""dlss""?",would be hilarious if it let you enable fsr 2.0 through this backdoor.,maybe try launching it with fsr2 in place of none.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
agreed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can it go higher than that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"im having the same problems, i used to have randome fps drops to single digits but realized it was my 8gb vram on my 3070 that was limiting, pity that nvidia decided to handicap the 3060ti all the way up to 3070ti like this even the 3080 got the aame treatment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
set the texture streaming to auto.,that will fix every stutter in the game.,"somehow if you set it to other than auto, it won't free up vram until you are down to 20-30 fps after 15-30 minutes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it really is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's not an update though , despite the name.",it will be a completely different implementation using motion vectors and will have to be coded into as a taa replacement instead of a basic sharpening filter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i hope not,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what's wrong with amp pages?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah no that doesnt happen.,"and even if it did, why would i use fsr 2.0 when there's which is the same thing?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it goes all the way to ten, but you don't get to just pick that value, they call your exes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so vram is the issue?,i have an rtx 3080 12gb model and it runs with a lot of stutters and input lag.,it seems to be more optimized for consoles and not the pcs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have tried that, but it still gives stutters and the gpu is not being utilised fully",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/accelerated_mobile_pages,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fsr has been released for awhile now.,it's just that game devs are finally incorporating it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just to see if it works.,it be pretty big news if you found amd and these guys accidently leaked software that was not supposed to go out for another 3 months or so.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"vram is the issue where the fps just tanks for several seconds and then it kinda stabilizes, still gpu usage is low so had to turn ray tracing off completely because i could only play at full ultra+rt at 1080p and the resolution hit wasnt worth it.",the game is just terribly optimized.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fsr 1 yes.,but amd also announced fsr 2 very recently which will instead be a temporal solution just like dlss.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well it would retarded of them not to release it when it's ready but later, considering xess releases in q2 as well as fsr 2.0",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, even i noticed low gpu usage.",the only thing that decreased the stutters was increasing the fov and putting everything to medium - high at 1440p resolution.,"the stutters decreased by a lot and i have higher fps, the game still looks good at these settings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, still sucks that we have to turn down settings on out pcs, im a few hours from finishing the game tho i kinda get used to the ocassional stutters every few seconds, but i swear devs are being lazier",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"how did you increase the fov, there's no slider in game?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i used [flawless widescreen.,](https://flawlesswidescreen.org/) it is an app that can change certain settings of some games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"legend, cheers!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hardware wise:   
peripheral = unplug & replug, sometimes in different usb slots.",reinstall the game  = this is what i suspect might fix your issue.,nvidia gpu = long story but you need dch drivers + the window store nvidia control panel.,look up ddu & reinstall from clean.,windows 11 = funny enough some people run into random issues & find windows 10 solves them.,"i personally don't think this is worth doing, but hey the options there if you want to.","psu = long story, you'd be surprised, usually notice posting issues before freezing issues so probably not related.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not normal no.,i assume you have a desktop right?,"if so, try removing the cooler.","checking if the thermal paste seems good, also make sure you didnt forget to peel the plastic from the cooler.",then put the cooler back and make sure you do all that correctly too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

100 degrees celsius in kind of idle applications is definitely not normal, even with a stock cooler.",make sure your system is free from dust and consider checking the thermal paste condition.,"br, ecom\_trading",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is not normal.,it seems you've already checked your thermal paste.,"if you haven't already, ensure all bios settings are on default and that you don't have any software applying an overclock.",make sure there is nothing using up your cpu in the background as well.,"to be honest, the most common problem i have seen with these older intel cpus is the tim looses contact with the headspreader after only a few years.","typically when i get an older intel cpu in and it's running very hot even with a good cooler i just go right ahead and delid, repaste, and relid.",100% success rate so far.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i tried all of that a few months ago and no difference,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i reapplied the thermal paste and cleaned the heat sink and no difference,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah i did all that a few months ago still no diffence, ill see if i can get another cooler but im still thermal throttling on even the most basic of games",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i hope it fixes your issue :)  having a pc that doesn't function properly is a headache.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you have top up the oil from time to time.,oil pan is leaking or a gasket,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah unfortunately it happens from the fan bearings!,buy a cheap cooler like a hyper 212 variant.,better performance and less than $60,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this oil is non-conductive and really doesn't hurt anything.,"and while stock coolers are bad, they aren't nearly as bad as they were 10 years ago.","that thing has a copper plug running through the middle, so it cools as effectively as some of the slightly larger cheap-o options.",i wouldn't upgrade unless you're willing to spend at least $40+tax.,"otherwise, ignore the leaking oil - it's fine!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looks like sweat to me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably a blessing in disguise.,"i got a 12400f and the noise from this thing was a deal breaker, whatâ€™s the point of having a decent cpu like this if it sounds like itâ€™s strained whenever you do anything on the desktop?",i got a $25 cooler (id cooling 224) and idle temps went from 50 to 25c.,cb23 multi core went from throttling to 55c sustained while remaining very quiet.,"admittedly i was running it without limits and thus out of spec for the boxed cooler, but even with limits on it was still spinning up while doing minor things on the desktop.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"at the end of the day, itâ€™s a shite cooler by a company that should know better.",what is the tdp of that?,20?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you have to close the case before you play with yourself.,"â«oilâ», rightâ€¦",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you see they probably stripped the drain bolt from the factory, you might need a new oil pan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don't use it anymore.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe spend 40 bucks and get a beefier cooler while you're at it.,those intel stock coolers are scraping the bottom of the barrel most of the time when it comes to overall performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel cooler the worst in the world, we need more options without cooler and less expensive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this is why you donâ€™t keep stock coolers, though thatâ€™s a very small amount of time.",imma hope this is just unlucky and not a mass issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i'm going to say no, not a huge difference.",it may depend on the application or game though.,try hold out for next gen at least if you can.,"my guess next gen + semi high speed ddr5 would have a higher chance of giving you an improvement... may even bring some ddr4 improvements if you wanted to stick with ddr4 (if for example you can slap a 13900k into a z690 d4)
4x16gb ddr4 isnt easy to clock high.","my experience with a 12900kf and the strix d4, couldn't get 4x16gb bdie to boot over 3600, settled with 2x16@4100c15.","i have a few different types of 16gb dimms, some micron and some hynix, most wouldn't even go above 3200 easily on a 4x16 config... haven't tried since  around january though, potentially bios improvements would have helped but i doubt it.","i'm actually super mega boring though and pretty much exclusively use a 11800h+rtx3060+2tb980pro laptop, only play destiny 2 and a few other lighter titles and it's super convenient having work+personal stuff all on the one laptop, can use it anywhere and take it to work (way faster than the workstations at work)... i notice zero difference in load times for any game or application i run compared to the 12900kf setup.",raid0 may actually make load times longer.,depends on the application/game though.,finding info or benchmarks on this is kind of hard/impossible.,"keep in mind for the future, when or if directstorage is actually widely used, it will not work with raid or custom storage drivers (eg the samsung nvme driver)

most of the time game and application files are small files and there is little to no difference at all between a pcie gen4 or gen3 drive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thereâ€™s a pretty big differenceâ€¦.,"1340 single core r23 cinebench 9900k

1980 single core r23 cinebench 12900k

"always check reviews multiple on everything, and get multiple opinions.","you can always check like 10900k reviews, 11900k reviews and 12900k reviews and you can see how your cpu stacks up to the latest obviously.","if the 9900k isn't shown on a review, you can refer to whatever is the two closest if needed.","(eg you could look at a 10900k review, see that the 9900k performs about the same as x and y... if the 9900k isn't on the 12900k review you can check x and y and assume it's about that speed)

check out pcie gen4 ssd reviews, i'm sure there are a few around that benchmark windows boot times and application/game load times.",gen4 to gen3 comparisons.,"(970 evo versus 980 pro for example)

as far as i know, game and application loading wise, you should be mainly looking at the 4k random read and write at a que depth(qd) of 1 ( maybe 1-4 but i think mainly qd1) 
access latency can also be important but all high performance drives should be fine and close enough to each other.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the performance difference is not worth the hit on thermals and battery life.,go with g7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
battery life and heat management will be worse on the model with 11320h.,"h-series are tuned for performance, while g(u) series are tuned for battery life.",i would go with the i5 1135g7 given the realme is a ultrabook.,the g7 also has a better igpu if that matters.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

120mm aios for 50 dollars is the very entry class of aio coolers.","in most cases, air coolers in the same price range have a significant advantage regarding both performance and noise.","if there are no restrictions in pc case dimensions, you should choose a air cooler.","br, ecom\_trading",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12700f comes with a box cooler sufficient for gaming.,the 120 aio would probably help it handle apps a bit better but i'd say try the box cooler first.,"(12700kf does not include a cooler but f only does,)

i would have but in india it's almost double the price of the cooler i mentioned above,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah this.,i have a noctua d14 from friggin 2010 and they still provide free mounting kits for 1700 sockets.,"this thing cooled everything i've ever had (almost), from a 5820k over a 2600k to even an fx 9590 without a single problem.",fans are still good too.,"try to get 12 years out of an aio of that price (~60 bucks back then) 
everybody going with those flashy aios nowadays, i don't understand it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

nothing wrong with the f or non-k versions.,i just built a 12700 (plain) for a flight sim rig for my dad.,itâ€™s 95+% of a 12700k in games..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
idk scythe isn't really a known company in india so only few retailers have it selling at 110usd amazon sell that particular model at 160usd in india,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ain't available in india tho,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how much temps are u getting in the box cooler?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
international shipping from amazon or something available?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i havenâ€™t measured my dadâ€™s system specifically - he has a big case with good airflow (fractal define) so he should be fine.,(will see how the cooler is doing in a year or two and upgrade later if desired).,"https://www.techspot.com/review/2391-intel-core-i7-12700/

hereâ€™s a review that covers typical temps and performance with the box cooler on the 12700.",12700f will of course perform about the same on the box cooler.,look for the â€˜rm1â€™ results.,he also benchmarks with a large (corsair h170i - 420mm aio) cooler so you can see what kind of difference youâ€™ll get.,the spoiler is not much difference in games at all vs. high end water.,applications are a bit of a different story but the rm1 does surprisingly well here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes but shipping it to india is like more than it's original priceðÿ’€ w8 lemme check newegg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"damn the stock cooler was giving similar performance in gaming compared to thr h170, ty broâ¤ , one last question which motherboard did u go with and wat do u recommend for 12700f if i won't be upgrading for 3-4 years ( i'll end up replacing my system)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's a really good question - i don't have any specific recommendations for boards.,i only recommend getting a board with 1 or 2 usb-c ports (i.e.,1 rear and 1 front if you have a case that supports it) since more things are using usb-c over time.,"i don't think pci-e 5.0 is a big deal for the next 3-4 years-- so you can just go with a cheaper b660 board which may lack pcie 5.0.  lastly i'd recommend a board with 2 x nvme slots (most have them) just in case you want to add more ""super fast"" storage later.","i do know there are a few boards to avoid though:

"i thought the whole point of making separate, e-cores was battery life?",but intel disappointed me here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 9hr battery life is probably for an i3 or i5 chip.,"i7 and i9 are power hungry for sure, can't expect them to last that long unless the laptop has a much bigger battery",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends what you are doing.,same laptop can have 40min battery life playing games with full settings and 8 hours watching a movie,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
alder lake-h does appear to have pretty poor battery life so far.,i donâ€™t believe we know about the u series yet though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was thinking about making this same post today.,it seems as though golden cove cores don't scale well downwardly towards lower power limits.,"golden cove cores take massive amounts of die space, around 2x a zen 4 core.",maybe tiger lake had better battery life given it was designed exclusively for mobile processors.,i feel as though the two core architecture r&d would've worked out better for intel if they designed one desktop core and one mobile core rather than two types of cores that went on both.,or perhaps the poor battery life is attributable to the amount of cores they've packed in thin and light processors being too many.,hopefully raptor lake's voltage regulat can help in this regard.,the bigger worry for me is that the benchmarks posted by these respective laptops aren't that impressive relative to tiger lake or zen 3. it seems like intel may have a did generation based off of early reviews.,it really doesn't bode well for them given they're already on the back foot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
expect alder lake to have a bit less battery life than tiger lake.,"it's just a huge chip with a lot of shared cache and many cores so that's probably why, at the lower end we will see a slight increase of the baseline power which plays a big role for battery life",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have an i7-12700h in an alienware x14 with an 80kwh battery and 1080p display.,"when i am using the laptop for non-gaming and unplugged the gpu is 100% off, so it's only using the cpu similarly to a dell xps 15. with that being said, no matter what mode (battery saver, quiet, balanced, performance), i have not got more than 3.5/4 hours of screen time.","rather it be web browsing, watching video, any tasks with 50% screen brightness, 72 or 144hz, never get more than 4 hours of battery life.",edit: with some recent bios and windows updates i am now averaging 5-6 hours of screen on time with the same conditions.,edit on 9/19/2022.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you cant really trust youtube tech 'reviewers' that dont know how to actually review products.,most of them just unbox and give an overview and do terrible testing.,"i just watched several videos after googling those models and most of them simply say 50% brightness, or 2 notches down from max, which is meaningless since different laptop displays all have different max brightness and brightness sliders, and screen brightness is a large factor in battery life.","another was streaming movies from netflix as his test, where wifi and movie selection (dark movies=more battery life) also play a big role.","digital trends is not the first place i'd go, but they are one of the few somewhat reputable sources for reviews on the two laptops you posted, since they are new.",them even using a colorimeter to check color quality and actual brightness immediately puts them in the .1% of laptop reviewers.,"https://www.digitaltrends.com/laptop-reviews/lenovo-yoga-9i-14-gen-7-review/


they are claiming 12.75 hours on local video test and then 8.5 hours of pcmark 10's application battery test, both seem like reasonable, but average, results.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it is worse because 12th gen has 3 types of mobile chips, u, p and h. some of the laptops ship with p series which are basically binned versions of 45w h series.",last year's tiger lake only had a single quad core config that ranged from 12w-35w.,this year's p series boost power is also quite a bit higher at 65w vs 40-50w of tiger lake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but didnt intel marketted 12th gen to have huge battery life especially due to efficiency code?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
exactly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got the i5-1240p so hopefully it has a better battery life,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would tiger lake-h have comparatively better battery life?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, that's understandable.",but do you think laptops should get the evo certification if they don't offer the promised battery life?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
making me think i should hang onto my 8th gen another year until 13 comes out.,"i keep seeing this in all the reviews, good performance, terrible battery life.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's good to hear!,i've also been averaging 3.5/4 hours for web browsing and video playback.,currently have an i7-1280p on my thinkpad x1 yoga.,hopefully we can also get a bios update to address the horrible battery life.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the information!,i have purchased x1 carbon gen 10 and waiting for it to be delivered.,"whatever the battery life is, i m going to be using the laptop.",i really hope it has around 8 hrs of battery life.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is the h series good in terms of battery life?,should i go for a laptop with i5 11300h (63wh battery) or i5 12500h (70wh) ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
am i right in thinking that an i5 u series should have significantly better battery life than an i7 p series?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
let us know.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah it should be good for a 6-9 months before the battey starts going bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how is it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
certainly not.,but devices with 55+wh batteries based on the evo platform should be able to get the 9 hours of battery life once properly optimized.,"however with energy consuming displays (oled, higher res, 90hz) the runtimes might drop to not-so nice levels of 7hrs...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well i just had some alienware bios updates as well as windows updates and now i am able to get 5-6 hours of screen time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so did it live up to your expectations of 8 hrs?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how has the battery life been?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
will do!,"my order should ship by early next week, but it's not guaranteed.",can't wait to get my hands on it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well that's promising news.,thanks for the update.,i'm trying to find a powerful ultrabook that can do over 8 hrs.. my x360 i7 4k 8565u could do it 3+ years ago but finding something like that in a 12th gen is proving harder than i'd have thought..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i ended up getting a 11th gen intel cpu so i can't really comment on the battery life in real life usage, unfortunately.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hey, it's been 2 months, anything to report?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not personally.,lenovo kept declining my payment because of high demand.,i think it was a blessing in disguise.,12th gen mobile cpus are more power hungry.,i ended up getting dell xps 13 with the 11th gen cpu and i am really happy with it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nice, the xps series are like the gold standard for windows machines.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no, a cheap air cooler is plenty.",an aio would be fine if you prefer the aesthetic though.,"> i read somewhere that, you can remove the power limit on that cpu is it the same as overclocking and can this be done on h610m mother board.",i believe it was b660 not h610.,i wouldn't count on being able to do this.,iirc intel cracked down on it and it should be removed in newer revisions.,best you can do now is run the cpu at max boost on all cores.,> shall i go for 12500 instead or its not worth the money.,no.,the 12400(f) and 12600k(f) are the only alder lake i5s worth buying.,"the 12500 and 12600 are fine if you get a deal, but they don't offer a significant upgrade over the 12400 to be worth it normally.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1. no the stock cooler can get you by, but a $30 air cooler is plenty

2. you can run it at max pl2 forever, this isn't overclocking but is dependent on the board's vrm and bios.",most motherboards allow this but like a $70 h610 will cap the pl2 lower.,"bclk overclocking locked chips is another story and basically not worth discussing as the boards that allow that start at like $180+

12600kf will certainly give much better performance even on cheapest motherboard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
be sure to get a board like the msi pro b660m-a.,itâ€™s your safest bet for a) actual good vrm performance (so your 12600k doesnâ€™t throttle) and b) relative affordability.,"the 12600k, though, is *massively* faster than the 12400, to the tune of about 50% in multicore.",keep it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah it will perform better than a 12400f.,if you did get a 12600kf and a b660 then you wouldn't get an unlocked multiplier.,i have a 12600kf on a z690.,if your looking gonna budget look for gigabyte and msi morherboards.,they have some good budget z690 motherboards.,"but if your willing to go a bit extra look at the following:

asus strix z690 a gaming
gigabyte z690 aorus elite
msi mpg z690

a 12600k will outperform a 12400 on any board.,regardless of no overclocking 12600k still has better boost clocks and 4 e cores for much better mt performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

even though overclocking isn't possible on b660's?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,it doesn't matter really.,12600k has good stock clocks.,12400f has 4 cores less and worse clockspeeds,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

> which ratio is valid?,all of them.,10th gen doesn't have any synchronized frequency domains.,"there are no multipliers which work better or worse than others, and base clock can run at anything from 80 - 200 mhz without issue.","&nbsp;

from 11th gen and onwards, the memory controller introduced gear ratios, where the memory runs at a 2^n multiple of the memory controller's frequency.",you generally want to run the lowest gear ratio possible for the memory controller.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i guess you missed hardware unboxed.,he shows many possible tests in graphs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can find overclocking results on sites like techpowerup so your statement is just wrong.,"oc results vary depending on motherboard, cooling, silicon quality, etc.","i don't think a blanket statement of ""i5 overclocked is x% faster than stock and y% faster than i7"" is that useful anyways.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

also big factor is that you'll have to buy more expensive motherboard for overclocking and more expensive cooler as well.,so in the end you'll pay same or even more than while buying b660 + 12700.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>you can find overclocking results on sites like techpowerup so your statement is just wrong.,"i know there are oc results out there, i just can't seem to find one that compares oc'ed 12600k to locked i7 12700.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i care,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that site is just a joke man.,it thinks 9728kb > 12mb because the number is biggerâ€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you even read the post ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for 12700 specifically, you can check hardware unboxed's review.","multi-threaded application performance is slightly worse than 12700k, so should still be ahead of an overclocked 12600k.","for gaming performance, you can check 12600k overclocking results on techpowerup.","gaming performance is similar to 12700k regardless of overclocking, so it should also be similar to 12700. nobody is comparing the two head-to-head yet, but you can still draw some conclusions from the available results.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they are the same for gaming, in the video that i've watched from a taiwanese reviewer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's not the point.,check benchmark comparison.,that's all that matters.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i did read it firstly.,it's up to you whether you buy a b series or z series motherboard.,just remember of you buy a 12600k and a b series then you cannot overclock.,and of you buy a 12700 and a z series motherboard you won't be able to do any overclocking anyway and youd be wasting money on a high end motherboard.,that's why i'd suggest getting a 12700 non k and a b series or a 12600k and a z series motherboard.,i posted that link to show a comparison between the cpus which answered the first part of the question which was how do they compare to each other.,overall the motherboard wont affect the stock performance of each other.,however with k series chips if you buy a b series board you wont be able to get any more performance than stock since the b series does not support overclocking,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it should.,it wasn't rare in that generation to use a xeon e3 instead of a core i5/i7 since i recall that some people liked to purchase igp-less xeons to save 20-30 u$d (similar to current f series).,"heck, it is even on your motherboard cpu support list: https://www.asus.com/supportonly/p8h61-m%20lx3%20r2.0/helpdesk_cpu/

this was a decent cpu about 8 years back.",computers like squirrels age badly.,(squirrels have average life spans of 5 years to 10 years).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very low end.,"2cores 4 threads, cpu score of 3200.

 my 4800u scores 18000 and that i consider being a 'higher'middle to higher end these days.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that cpu is 8 generations old and it was mid-end when it was released.,it is definitely very very very low end these days.,nothing is produced anymore that is even close to that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
does your laptop perform well enough for what you want it to do?,that's probably the more useful question to ask.,"by modern standards it would be considered low-end, but only because it's several years old.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
low end.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

bruh dual core ftw.,surely you can afford an upgrade ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
definitely not similar to pentium g7400,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
trash you should have at least a 12900ks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
low end.,upgrade to a 12900k to be middle end or 12900ks for high end and best future-proofness.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
extreme low end when compared to amd.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,that is also 8 generations old.,get something current if you need a new laptop.,"if you have no performance issues, just keep the current one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's like slapping a racing stripe on a model-t.

it's time to move to a modern laptop.","even the lowest end modern mobile cpu, a *celeron* is substantially faster, cooler (fanless) and more efficient.","throw it on ebay for some sucker who will spend $100 on it, and put that towards a new laptop",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, if you can find one for a cheap price( 50$ or so), but double check that your cpu is replaceable, a lot of laptops arent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thinkpad t440p i assume?,"if so, that's not recommended, its cooling isn't really equipped to handle a chip with a tdp that high.","a 4710mq or 4810mq could be a *decent* upgrade, but you'd really be better off just looking at a new machine entirely.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also have to consider if your laptop can handle it.,it can draw a lot more power.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i upgraded my t440p from a dual core to a quad core (4800mq) and the difference was night and day.,"quad core, 8 thread, 16gb ram, an ssd.",it keeps up with most modern laptops just fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the current generation of cpus start with a 12. for example **12**500h or **12**15u (yup in the second one they chopped off a number)  


the **4**600m and **4**940mx start with a 4. so they are roughly 8 generations behind; at least 8 years old.",the cheapest current generation processor will definitely blow the top end of the 4th generation out of the water.,"eg see for example this benchmark: https://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare/intel-i5-1235u-vs-intel-i7-4940mx/4765vs2186
more performance at a quarter of the power consumption.","if the 4940mx laptop is totally cheap, less than $100.","why not, it'll get you running a bit faster.",but if there's a different option such as getting a cheap new ultra thin laptop take that instead.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah it's way worse,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably nearer to celeron,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
he's asking about upgrading the cpu not buying a new laptop with that cpu in it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"lol, you actually think op can replace a laptop cpu when he doesn't even know how his current performs?",right.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
he's wasting money for a very marginal upgrade.,hence the recommendation of getting something more current.,you shouldn't upgrade any cpu in a dead *socketed* platform - desktop (or even laptop).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2c 4t -> 4c 8t is not a marginal upgrade,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
here's the thing.,*that* generation of quad core doesn't hold a candle to modern cheapo quads.,"power usage, battery, heat, weight, performance, feature set, and most importantly price.","laptops that old doesn't have good resale value, and price doesn't keep like old cars does.","laptops aren't engines, they will be slower as time goes due to program bloat.",cars don't need to worry about program bloat.,"**throwing money at something that's obsolete is money that can be saved towards a newer, more modern system.","** this is why i'm highly against this - sure, you got the cool factor of socketed system but that's not the main point of this conversation no?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
core count difference does not tell the whole story.,you have to consider the money being spent in comparison to the performance gains.,it is an old platform and like someone mentioned there is a power difference that heavily influences laptops.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
went from i3 4130t to i7 4790t.,night and day difference.,could finally play some games where i couldn't before.,"yeah, it's not the same cpu op is talking about but going to 4 cores and 8 threads from 2 cores and 4 threads was hotttttt.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the problem with that comparison is that you are jumping i3 to i7.,what helps you in most games is the single core performance which there is a clear difference between those 2. op is going from i7 to i7.,their new cpu will be better but it won't be better enough to justify throwing money at an old architecture when they could simply save that money towards something newer.,"of course the price of the ""new"" cpu they plan to buy is an important factor of the decision.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i do have a proposition.,you should provide more information.,"besides that, you are listing parts that are about three years old at this point so unless you're buying used you could do a lot better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

at the same price i would go i3 12100 b600,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the thing is that the motherboards that supports 10thgen are almost on the same price lvl and the cpu is i5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as others have mentioned before, the 12100f is the way to go.",the i3-12100f beats the i5-10400f in many/most production and gaming workloads.,"i don't know the pricing situation in your region, but if the price of 10th gen and 12th gen motherboards are the same, then go with the 12th gen motherboards paired with the 12100f ( i.e.",b660 ).,"you're also overlooking many of the advantages of going with 12th gen. 

1) going with b660 motherboards also gives you the ability to upgrade to 13th gen cpus when they release.","with z490, you're locked into 10th and 11th gen chips.",2) you also won't be limited to pcie gen 3.0 speeds with b660.,"if you find that you want to upgrade to a gen 4.0 nvme ssds, b660 will let you use the advertised read and write speeds.",hope this helps :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
theres just no reason to buy a 10th gen intel cpu there are so many other better options.,go for an i3 12100f and a b660 board.,or go with a ryzen 3600 and a b450 motherboard if its significantly cheaper,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"itâ€™s merely a formality, their support team doesnâ€™t actually care.","they know if you have a k sku youâ€™ve probably been running xmp and at least a mild overclock, just say no and youâ€™re fine.",their customer support is actually quite good.,"as far as the original topic, itâ€™s user error, people are over tightening their coolers.","if the ihs or the cooler is slightly convex, somethingâ€™s going to give if too much pressure is applied.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's a good question, i wish it was on their ark spec sheets.","i wish intel had profiles which specify guidelines that allow for safe operation (i suppose it's reasonable to expect that running at maximum frequency these ""should"" operate at default voltage and be safe from degradation.",i expect it's an awkward one as safe can vary with maximum/typical operating temperature and different frequencies/module configs will require different voltages.,i guess from intel's perspective they've made it clear > x mt/s is not supported and will void warranty so that's their bit done as going further probably adds liability with minimal benefits to intel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they may not be able to trust mobo manufacturers to not crank unnecessary voltages for xmp, but could have some kind of certification process i suppose.",what cpu are you using?,iâ€™d think standard/stock sa/vccio v with 1.35v for dram should run that w/o issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
these accessories are made for people who want top-notch cooling.,"if the 0.1mm bend is such a huge problem, then why doesn't media trash intel for it and push them to solve this issue with a threat of telling people not to buy alder lake because it's intentionally faulty ?","all reviewers tested alder lake without modding, so it must've been bent for them too.","why did they say the chips aren't hard to cool except the 250w ""gas guzzler"" i9?",why even a 30$ cooler is enough for every alder lake except i9 if there's such a huge thermal problem?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's what we like to call ""anecdata""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
find a single case of an ihs bent badly enough to make the cpu uncoolable instead of a max 5c improvement that's been demonstrated.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7700k.,i have all 4 banks occupied and it's 32gb total.,"the motherboard defaults to insane voltages, like 1.3v each, but i can't go much lower than 1.2v or things become unstable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for me, it's not about the thermal problem.",it's about the longevity of the alder lake.,and the socket.,that is yet to be revealed.,whether it is or is not the problem.,go read anandtech review.,they had premium aorus board.,it bend like crazy.,they also expressed worry about this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm all about preventing misinformation.,i'm not particularly on anyones side.,but if you have a claim you should at least be able to prove it.,the burden of proof isn't on me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so it's useless to report to others what your overclockable cpu does at stock settings

just buy a 12900 non k - stop wasting your money if you can't even be bothered to toggle a simple ""auto oc"" switch, or learn a bit and try out overclocking manually",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you sound very interested in the matter, why don't you go create some statistics to counter out speculation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""however in cinebench the cpu scores were perfectly on par with other 12600k's/kf's"".",\^\^\^,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
surely of it did perform on par in one test it would perform the same in another test,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you sure you comparing apples to apples cpu/memory combo?,my cpu score jumped 2k from going from 3200 c16 to 3600 c14 memory.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hmm that is a fair point.,most of the cpu scores i was seeing had either ddr4 3600mhz or even ddr5 7000mhz.,i think the ram speed is the bottleneck in my system.,i'm hoping to do a ram upgrade this year so we shall see.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
does 3dmark rely on fast ram speeds,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ram speeds absolutely affect your cpu score,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok. that maybe my issue.,most were on 16k whereas i was on 12k so now i know my issue,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"for me there was an issue with resume from s3 sleep with 4 sticks of ram, went away completely with 2 sticks.",all 4 identical ddr4 3600 cl14 8gb modules.,perhaps try to re-insert the sticks and make sure they are installed firmly.,if this won't help then check with just one stick.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
place the ram in the correct slots as shown in the manual.,set sa manually when using xmp.,auto is way too high.,bios 807 and 901 work perfectly.,"the later versions have no avx512, so obviously worthless.",memtest86 is an insult.,its the free version.,what the hell.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
quick question would be on windows 11 & a razer mouse would it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
xmp 1 or 2?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that configuration is actually unsupported.,intel doesn't guarantee speeds that high for quad channel configs.,you might need to up the system agent voltage slightly (perfectly safe) to like 1v (from .900).,btw next time you upgrade ram: 4 slots of ram is really bad speed wise (more slots in use = more electrical interference and less speed).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i wish it was that simple, unfortunately nope.","new pair of ram seems to have removed most of the lag, iâ€™ll see if that lasts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"but it's still a dual channel setup, not quad.","i assume you meant 4 sticks, but this (meaning 4x8gb sticks) is also listed on my motherboard's qvl list as supported, although it doesn't list 3600 cl14 modules (just 3600 cl16 and higher).",i've tried increasing the sa voltage already and it made no difference.,"as for the ram purchase, i got the first pair for my 11th gen setup, then switched to amd and added another pair when i've read having 4 single rank sticks should produce some gains even with daisy chain topology mainboard.",my msi b550 board had no issues supporting 4 sticks with their xmp profile enabled (3600 cl14).,now i have one pair of sticks in the intel 12th gen build and another pair in the amd build and both are rock solid.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks, just asking to check boxes on a unrelated issue.",thankfully by your answer it remains unrelated.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
aight thanks.,i put a new pair of ram and seems to be working so far with xmp 2. crossing fingers it stays like this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it looks like the pro e can handle about 90-95 watts.,"(edit: from a chinese test, might not be tested in a case though.)","i think you can get 85-100% of the 11400f's performance ***excluding avx512, or it may use 160 watts apparently, then 90w will be about something like 3.2-3.5ghz***, depending on the cpu lite load setting in the bios (most workloads should be around 40-90w?",correct me if i am wrong).,"if you get this board, i personally would underclock it to maybe 4.0ghz, then you should get about 100 watts or so in cinebench runs (not the heaviest test but should be decent for showing a reasonable max daily power draw...)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the b560m pro can run a 11400 at full speed (judging by the power draw on 65w vs unlimited, it looks like default 11400 is using somewhere between 140-165w.)",then you can get it a bit lower by adjusting the cpu lite load setting mentioned above (msi usually seems to have the voltage on the higher side?,"), and/or disabling avx512 if you want.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12100 will be better than 10400 and allow you to upgrade to an 13400 in a year for less than 100$.,"this is when you want multiple generations on the same mb, when you are on a budget.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"https://nanoreview.net/en/cpu-compare/intel-core-i5-12400f-vs-intel-core-i5-10400f

see for yourself.","+50% in single core
+40% in multi

that's on you to decide if extra $70 is adding +45% cpu perf worth the cost.",10400 was awesome when it released.,it will do fine.,but if any component is gonna add that much of performance for $70 then i would take it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you play competitive fps game then you will want those extra frames i5-12400f, those extra frames from alder lake is really worth it, not to mention you get less stutters too because 0.1% and 1% lows is improved much in alder lake.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
unless your really constrained by a maximum budget i think the 12400 is the way to go.,while the difference between the two is $70 because of the motherboard is a small amount to pay when looking at the total cost of a system.,if your total budget is $1000 vs $930 i think the extra $70 is well worth the performance gains imo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12100 = 10700k in gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12400 with msi pro 660 motherboard or msi pro z690 if you plan on upgrading to overclock cpu in the future.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the i3-12100/f is also an option to explore.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i5 12400f is great,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12400f is around 15 to 25 percent better than 10400f.......go with 12400f or go for i3 12100f  if you are only playing games on pc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"eh, just get the 12100f instead.","it has the same multicore performance as the 10400f, vastly better efficiency and a better upgrade path.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably not worth it unless youâ€™re a competitive player.,"you lose pcie 4.0, but both 3060 and 3060 ti will do fine without it.","some terribly optimized games may not fully utilize your gpu, though, like maybe far cry 6 or ac: valhalla.",but you should still be able to get around 60 fps.,have you considered the 11400?,of all the awful 11th gen itâ€™s not a bad cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not even close.,the 12100 is really only slightly better than a 3600 on average (and can be worse in heavier games).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yea i mainly play fps games, especially warzone which uses like 50-60% cpu.",also ill play at 1080 and aim at 100+ in competitive games.,the 11400 is not available in my country.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the benchmark tell otherwise
the 12100 eat 3600 for breakfast.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, it would be best to try to get a 12400 if you can.",competitive games really benefit most from the great single-threaded performance of the 12th gen. but of course you can always look up benchmarks and see for yourself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
these system builders purposefully limit the performance so they can use cheaper coolers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"becaue i5 11400f  have two phase, 65w and 65w+.",you accidently unlock 65w+ mode in bios or sth like that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2nd picture is using more power, maybe the prebuilt manufacturer put a limit on tdp so they can get away with cheap coolers?",you can always put the tdp limits back if you dont want to upgrade the cooler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what system did you buy?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hej hunden, i work at inet in sweden.",sadly lenovo doesn't want you to change your cooler to something that actually works.,and if you do: the warranty will be void.,the holes on the motherboard are not standard for an intel 1200 chip and the bracket is glued on the backside.,you will need to remove the bracket behind the motherboard using a fork+credit card or something like it.,afterwards its actually the 1151 socket bracket that needs go in in order to make it work with a new one.,if you happen to live in 08 i can show you at our store what/how to do it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in the first case youre running at whatever power limit the prebuilder set so they can get away with trash cooling.,in the second youre not running with the power limited,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah, the included cooler is not great...

but the system is using standardized components by the looks of it, so if you want to swap the cooler that should be possible.",something like a hyper 212 or bequiet pure rock would do really well without being expensive.,there is a good chance replacing the cooler will void your warranty.,looking at the manual lenovo also provides replacement parts and upgrades directly.,"i don't know how these stack up price to performance wise but you might be able to install those without voiding your warranty, which since the system is only a month old might be in your interest.",otherwise it might be wise to lower the powerlimit on your cpu a little bit because 95 degrees is higher than you'd want it to be.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"your windows 7 is likely a 32-bit installation, you'll need the 64-bit installation.",processors these days are x86/x64 for legacy compatibility with 32-bit programs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"x64 is an addon to x86 which is the main ""family name"" 8bit 16bit 32bit and 64bit are all x86 which refers to the old 8086, 8088, 286 386 486, 586(pentium as intel called their version, amd/cyrix was 586) and so on...

so x86 is the architecture... just as arm, powerpc and so on was other architectures...  


so long story short, it doesn't really matter... your cpu can run both 32 and 64 bit and the version of windows dictate that... the 32bit can only use up to 4gb ram, 64bit can use up to (a lot more) usually like 128-256gb for personal versions, where server versions are up in the terabyte of ram",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

is the 8600k oc'ed?,"...
just buy a z690 d4..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i absolutely love mine.,i got the 12700k of an absolute beast.,wish i had paid more attention when i ordered my z690 motherboard and got one with ddr4 ram instead of expensive ddr5.,i have a evga 3060 xc and i'm gaming in 4k/2160p.,this fall i'm going to get the new 4080 when ada lovelace is released to get my fps above 45 on ultra settings.,i run most games at 3840x2160 and i get 45 fps average.,mines air-cooled no fancy water cooling or anything and intel tuning app is simple to use to overclock.,i got mine etymology at 5.0 ghz and temps aren't an issue as nothing i've done has even phased it except stress tests where a liquid cooler would prolly keep me from thermal throttling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most companies that make coolers do have brackets available for lga1700 sockets.,my son has a 12600k and it's an awesome processor for the price.,i got him a noctua nh-u12a cooler on his and it doesn't go much above the mid 50s when he plays games on it.,that had the lga1700 bracket in the box.,you can certainly use a decent air cooler to keep it cool - so yes if you already have one just order a new bracket and keep an eye on the temps for a bit at first.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea 12th gen is awesome!,i'm a budget minded mid level gamer and i have a i5 12400f and a rtx 3060 ti and it's a great combo for 1440p.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would've said return even if it was a 8700k but a 6c/6t no so keep the 12600k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
return it.,you are going to be gpu bound.,a better cpu should not make a difference unless you plan to play games at low quality settings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's what i'm leaning towards.,"like i said, i'm currently on 1080p with no intention of going to 4k anytime soon.",1440p will be fine for me for a long time so the 12600k should last me through that.,thanks for the input!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"still no release date on those yet though, right?",i'd need a new motherboard regardless to fit the lga 1700 slot.,"do we have specs on the new lineup, is the change between 12th and 13th gen that big it's worth waiting?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
eh the 8600k can get hit pretty hard easily as its a 8th gen 6c 6thread cpu.,it doesn't take all that much if your playing games at higher hz to have it be your limit.,i'd say keep the 12600k at least in ops situation of wanting to do 1440p high hz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
highly likely it will be out in q3.,it's predicted to be a more mature series with chunky gains over al.,"you could indeed start slowly updating components that cross over if you're in no hurry, and make the cpu purchase last.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1440p should be gpu bound and the 8600k is capable of high fps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as i said in another comment, i think i'll just upgrade to fit the 12600k.",it should last me for a long time as i'm planning to stick with 1440p for a while - having the new motherboard will mean i can always upgrade at a later date if needed.,thanks for the help!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
highly depends on the game 1440p is not all that hard to drive in alot of shooters and you will still end up cpu bound.,some games definitely have ultra max settings that will put you in gpu bound realm though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no worries, glad to have helped you make a decision and you can't really go wrong, it's a great cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
he should measure gpu utilization to get an idea if he could benefit from a newer cpu in anything he plays rather than pre-emptively spending money.,i replaced a 3600 with a 5800x only to realize that the cpu upgrade was not improving things by very much if at all.,:/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ah that's a rip and i agree checking gpu utilization would be a good idea since op didn't particularly list what games he plays,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you're right, i did check this prior to upgrading - hitting 100 cpu usage across all cores in lots of the games i tested.","gpu usage would rarely cap out, usually sitting between 50-70 depending on the game",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you check it on 1440p?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just did a quick check now, you're right - gpu usage at 100 but cpu was sitting at 50-60 at 1440p.",i'm going to do a fresh windows install when the new stuff arrives and hopefully that makes it run a bit better but i won't keep my fingers crossed.,"thankfully the upgrade wasn't out of my budget, and i'm happy to do it for 1440p anyway.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
welcome to the club.,i made the same mistake when going from 1080p to 4k (and a 1070 to a 3080) and went from a 3600 to a 5800x.,the cpu upgrade was very underwhelming in games as nothing really was  changed by it.,:/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its called cpu lottery for a reason.,i can do 5.1 on 1.39. friend of mine can't get past 4.9 without crashing.,same mobo and fan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1.4v and only 4.9 with that cpu?,"i don't think you can't be that unlucky, i'm pretty sure you messed up something on your settings",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so if i change the motherboard same thing ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i guess im just unlucky:(,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i mean i tried everything my settings are just fine
maybe i should put it back on default and do it again can you tell me which settings should i use",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
actually now itâ€™s not stable anymore tried to raise it up to 5ghz and didnâ€™t go well went back to 4.9 with 1.4 and its not stable anymore :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sometimes motherboards can also have better or worse vrms ect or there is also the factor of does x voltage you enter and see as a read out equal actual x voltage as there is variance there.,but getting 4.9 vs 5.1 in the real world is not huge,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you also changing the cache freq?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you mean cpu cache fre yeah i did put it on max i believe itâ€™s something like 255,75",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
like changing cpu cache clock if you left it on auto your good.,i've found some cpus don't take well to cache oc so if your trying to set that to 4.9ghz also it could have been part of the issue,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the m5 should be better on paper (feature wise) compared to the a pro, give it a shot.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is the reason for what?,the bsod?,the overclock is not stable.,and if youâ€™re hitting 100 the chip is throttling and not maintaining the maximum clock speed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it seems you are noob overclocker.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes but no.,originally the chip was hitting 100 degrees all core and no bsod in cinebench.,i realised that my fans were not running at full rpm because each time the pc restarts they go back to low.,however when i ran it at 5.0ghz all core and fans on max it bsod.,it clearly was stable originally because it managed to complete it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
correct.,never done it before and this is my first k series chip,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if youâ€™re hitting 100, the chip is having to slow itself down to not go above 100 degrees.","so that test may have completed, but it may have completed at an average of 4.8ghz, or 4.5ghz.",but if youâ€™re hitting 100 the one thing you can be guaranteed is that you were not maintaining 5.0ghz for the duration of the test.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so it is a bad overclocker then,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
overclocking is complex.,"if an overclock is unstable you probably need to provide more voltage to make it stable at a given frequency, which in turn will generate more heat.","but to begin with i would reset everything back to stock settings and get the temperatures and cooling system working properly under stress tests like cinebench and prime95, and then look at going faster.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i donâ€™t know anything about msi software but i have the asus ai suite installed with my asus z690.,it has a setting to to unlock low power states for the cpu so effectively is automating an under volt.,you can change the mode from a click on the taskbar.,itâ€™s awesome.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes i have undervolted my i5 12600k, went from ~140w full load to ~115w full load.","i just went to the bios, and set my cpu voltage to adaptive (auto) and started with a -60mv offset.","tested stability and kept going trying lower offset values (with cinebench r23 10min all core loop, you could run prime 95 small ffts if you want rock solid stability)

can i undervolt 12700k in msi b660 tomahawk?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so i've brought my i7 12700k down to 88 watts while under load in cinebench.,the highest temp in  cinebench was 52 â°c.,since i'm currently not gaming i set the cpu multiplier of the p-cores to 35 (3500 mhz) and e-cores to 30 (3000 mhz).,"cpu voltage offset: 0.130 v

really none of the above best to save for b660.,but if it only one of those three it would be the asus if you plan on using a aftermarket cpu cooler as you can use previous generation mounting hardware.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 12100f will run on anything, vrm wont be a concern unless you plan to upgrade in the future.","same deal with bios options, no overclocking, so no big need for a good bios.","i'd go with the gigabyte, it has 3 total fan connectors compared to 2 on the other two boards, tied with msi for usb headers (see internal for front, where asus falls behind) hdmi and display port out (i realize youre getting the 12400f though), twice the bios rom size as asus (shouldnt matter though).","only thing id check is the realtek dac, its not listed on all of them and i cant read the chip.","but tbh, they are all very very similar.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i would never recommend an h610 board unless that was all the budget would supportâ€¦ and since the op seems to be in that very specific case, then i respect that.","of those three, i would go for the msi mainly because it comes with intel gigabit lan, and theyâ€™re a pretty good brand.",otherwise theyâ€™re all very similar.,the gigabyte has more total usb ports and video out options.,the asus may have a better bios and comes with serial.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i believe the msi one has the best vrm, but not sure if the gigabyte one's heatsink is enough to make that up.",in the really low price point b660 bracket asus has the worst vrm.,but given that you're running a 12100 it might be close to irrelevant anyways.,doesn't really matter if the vrm is running at 70c or 85c.,"i would look at number of usb, and m.2 slots and other features to see which has the most.","the msi board has two m.2 slots, so i'd probably get that.",edit: nvm the gigabyte one doesn't have a heatsink.,msi would be best i'd say.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
*cheapest* b660 is $30-$40 more than the cheapest h610.,and op said he's on a strict budget.,"performance wise b660 will be basically identical since its a low power 12100, and op almost certainly is using 3200mhz (sweet spot) or below ram so ram overclocking is moot too.","there wont be an upgrade path for him, and he's going to have less i/o but someone looking at an i3+h610 is clearly on a tight budget, and a nice b660 board is out of reach",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"might work with the i3 i guess, the only concern i have right now is if the power limit is changeable to set to 150w+- for these motherboards?","if so, i can maybe unlock power limits for the i3.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"that's true, i don't have  the budget to go for even the cheapest b660, and i know it won't be worth it.","since i'm on an i3, i'll go with the h610 motherboard.","and yes, the ram will be 3200mhz.",what i'm actually thinking is that if the i3 12100f is given unlocked power limit will it perform better?,does h610 chipset has that ability to atleast power up to 150w?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> what i'm actually thinking is that if the i3 12100f is given unlocked power limit will it perform better?,not really.,the quadcore is unlikely to use more than the 58w base power in any scenario.,so you can set the power limits where ever you want but it will make no difference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

maybe the benchmark you are referring to are not accurate.,single threaded performance is up quite a bit which was already better than ryzen.,"for multi threaded performance, there is a good improvement and matches 5800u, but compared to ryzen 6000u (not released yet) i expect the multi threaded performance will be lower.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

since you are looking for a p series processor i'm guessing you dont need a lot of performance in your laptop.,if you dont need extreme performance amd is the way to go.,they offer much better performance per watt and the overall battery life should be better.,5000 series is very good when it comes to battery life but you can also wait for 6500u or 6300u which will most definitely do all your simple tasks extremely well and get you better battery life.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

really?,where did you get your benchmarks from?,to be honest i was struggling to find a reliable source.,"also there is a ""rumor"" i guess since i dont know if its confirmed, that says that the power efficiency of alder lake processors is still much worse than amds 5000 series under 35w",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

dg2 is intel dedicated gpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
honestly i cant tell you much... ive never had any of these laptops so i would strongly recommend looking up peoples experiences with each laptop and decide for yourself which is best for you.,but heres what i would say from the specs if i had to tell you something.,zenbook is by far the best deal here.,i dont know about yoga slim because youre essentially paying extra for a gpu you wont use.,the ideapad is an ok middle ground.,"cant really tell you more, you just have to look up a couple vids on yt and see peoples experiences, and the 5000 series is pretty old so you can see if anyone has had problems with burn ins which i doubt but its worth checking",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there are many more like cinebench, which is arguably one of the most important, if you want to know raw performance.","but again, you need to inform yourself on many different sources.","avoid tech tubers and read sites like anandtech and computerbase for most accurate information, if they got them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it isnt.,"but it gives a good example, how high the computing power of the chip is.",your point is?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"geekbench is a much better benchmark than cinebench, which only stresses a very tiny part of the pipeline.",geekbench at least is a collection of various operation.,"itâ€™s not great, but itâ€™s better than cinebench, which really only tells you how good a cpu is at running cinebench.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if it is for office uses, i will go with i3-12100, because:
- 12th gen intel is architecturally better (better ipc, etc.)","- itâ€™s cheaper
- i assume because of newer generation, it is stronger in term of single core performance, and itâ€™s what office apps need

there was a discussion on this topic the other day.,and to my surprise builzdoid came through with data from hundreds of cpu's.,"**tldw;** old 2021 12900k and new 2022 12900k have basically the same sp rating averages, when weighted the 2022's are slightly better on average.","so 12900k bins are as good as ever, so all the good bins arent going to the 12900ks like rumored.","12900ks have quite a bit higher sp ratings on average, but due to the way sp ratings are calculated you cant make a direct comparison to the 12900k sp ratings.","and sp ratings arent the end all be all, leakage is another big factor.","someone doing xoc will be fine with a high sp that's leaky and runs hot, but an average user would have a worse experience with that chip because they are more likely to thermal throttle.","like der8auers sp 97 12900k runs 4c hotter than his sp 80 12900k, same voltage and everything.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice.,newer batches of cpus clocking better over time is finally happening now that we're off 14+++++.,this also prevents the drought of good cpus like what happened with the 9900k/ks with intel skimming the good parts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> and sp ratings arent the end all be all, leakage is another big factor.","someone doing xoc will be fine with a high sp that's leaky and runs hot, but an average user would have a worse experience with that chip because they are more likely to thermal throttle.",i'm curious what the source is for this?,"on finfet nodes, usually leakage is not a major factor, typically a few percent of total power consumption for ~100w class cpus.",did someone actually measure it for intel's node and find that its worse than other nodes?,or is this just speculation?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's not specific to 14nm;  it's just that there was virtually no margin left with the top end skus of that generation.,14nm went even faster than 9900ks later on with the 5.3 ghz 10900k..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's speculation afaik.,"der8auer ran two different 12900k's (""golden"" 97sp and typical 80sp) at identical settings and found the lower vid chip to run hotter and pull more power.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, 10900k's were thermally enhanced with lapped dies and ran much cooler per given w used per core, and we know that running cooler = clocking higher.",i wouldn't attribute that to 14nm running faster.,"what we're seeing here with early/late 12900k's are either sampling differences, or actual improvements to yielding faster chips.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they'd run a few degrees cooler but not enough to add 300 mhz.,you can see this by looking at silicon lottery's voltage and yield tables - 10th gen clocked higher at the same or less voltage than 9th.,the lapping was to try to deal with the heat of two more cores and some additional frequency the process improvements unlocked.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i strongly disagree with 10th gen being 300mhz faster.,they're about 100mhz better at best but they are 200mhz better on average due to tighter binning (10900k's were in lower supply vs 9900k).,you are greatly underestimating the effect of temps on v/f scaling.,just look at any delidded 9900k's and you'd see that the better thermal transfer decreases the vcc needed at those high clocks and pushes the clock ceiling 100-200mhz.,a great 9900k isn't inferior to a great 10900k in v/f scaling.,"but at those high-end clocks, temps determine your clock ceiling and thus 10900k's had an advantage there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hereâ€™s the binning chart i was referring to (that shows there were process improvements for 10th gen): https://siliconlottery.com/pages/statistics

for 9900k â€” the top 30% of cpus could hit 5.0 ghz all core (sse frequency) stably @ 1.300 volts.",for 9900ks - the top 28% could hit 5.1 ghz all core (sse frequency) @ 1.28 volts.,we also know this was a limited sku.,"10700k - the top 22% of cpus could hit 5.1 ghz, same conditions @ 1.23 volts
10900k -  the top 21% could hit 5.1 ghz (10 cores) @ 1.19 volts , or top 68% could hit 5.0 ghz (10 cores) @ 1.17 volts.",thatâ€™s a pretty huge voltage drop for the higher end skus at the same or higher frequency - thatâ€™s the process improvement at work between 9th and 10th gen.   if you raised the 10th gen to the same 1.28-1.30 volts as the 9900k/9900ks ocâ€™s there youâ€™d see more frequency for sure.,if youâ€™re comparing a cpu running at 100c vs 70c - i agree you could see a 200-300 mhz (6%) increase in frequency.,though if youâ€™re talking comparing an ~ 80c cpu to something cooler youâ€™d have to go a lot cooler (30c?),to see another 6%.,"from what iâ€™ve seen around 75-80c cpus definitely lose frequency, but the gain kinda flattens with further drops until you get much colder (then it curves up again).",those gains though would be above the process gains above.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"80c is well within the safe range for intel and amd, nothing to worry about there.","the real issue is if you do a more intensive cpu workload like encoding, its probably going to thermal throttle.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the temps you are seeing are to be expected when using the cooler that came with the cpu.,"there is no real reason to worry, since 80c will not cause any throttling.","if you are not willing or able to buy a better cooler, which would most likely also lower fan noise as well as temp, try running your case fans at higher rpms.","if needed, maybe even add a case fan or two.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the stock cooler is horrible.,"buy literally any other cooler and the temps will go down, nothing else to do sadly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would recommend capping the fps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm not sure but i think there's something wrong, enough thermal paste?",cooler seated correctly?,really bad airflow?,"i have an i5 10400f, stock cooler, running valorant on mostly lowest settings (1080p) never went above 60c (lower the settings and resolution higher the load on the cpu).",also seen some cases when undervolt makes things worse.,"(not your case but the temps you had before, 90c as you said, if still on valorant 1440p, aren't too ""normal"" so you should definitely check/ask and see about the first 3 questions i wrote.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
check the cooler is mounted correctly and that you have enough case fans and air flow.,"if you do, them maybe buy a better cooler.","also calm down, 80 degrees is nothing for a modern cpu, it's impossible to damage it by running it at 80 lmao.","i have an nh-d15s cooler, and set the thermal limiter to 85â° on my 5900x, it's overclocked so it hits the limit in certain scenarios.",the chip is absolutely fine.,"there is nothing to worry about at all when getting 80â°c temps, unless it's 80â° at idle.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80c is normal you should worry if it goes over 95 in normal circumstances no need to close your game,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cap the frame rates.,"unless you have a 240hz - 360hz monitor, this will not improve your skills and will only generate more heat.",if you can not afford a better cooler try capping your framerate to 144.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you don't have frin and back pc fans i guess it's normal.,maybe your cpu cooler isn't installed properly i had same issues with my ryzen 3600,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
try playing around with case fans.,i was getting bad temps in my nzxt h510 until i bought some better fans and adjusted speed in bios.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my i9 9900kf goes around 65â°c with deepcool gammaxx 400 with around 50 or 45% workload.,you should really buy an aftermarket cooler for the safety if your cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"valorant is rather cpu intensive, itâ€™s nothing to worry about with a stock cooler, as theyâ€™re meant to cool the cpu just enough that it doesnâ€™t explode lmao",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"using the stock cooler and only hitting 80c is not bad, but if it was 95c then it would be a different story.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80 degrees is fine.,"in fact, your cooler may be slowing down its fan in order to reduce noise while maintaining a nice safe 80 degrees, for a more pleasant computing experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you may want to reseat your heat sink and reapply thermal paste.,"if your cpu is still high, itâ€™s the cpu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
temps under 99'c are 100% safe.,"these chips thermal throttle at 99'c to protect themselves, so you have *nothing* to worry about.","the stock cooler is 100% effective for a 65w power limit (pl1, short-power, whatever your bios calls it).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the guy who built it put thermal paste right,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
horrifying?,xd not even close to tjmax.,"don't expect any cooler temps unless you get a quality air cooler like a noctua or arctic, or an aio water cooler.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nah looks good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
buy a cheap aftermarket cooler it doesn't have to be something super high-end any aftermarket cooler will be better than the stock cooler.,i suggest getting a cooler master hyper 212 or a noctua nh-u12s redux.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
on a side note since you showed a picture of valorant turn on packet send rate and see if you are stable mid game i find anything other then 128 results in a non stable send rate.,but on the note of the cooler if your case fits it a 20 dollar air tower cooler will greatly improve the temps,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

maximum load is never defined and for how long?,you should run some load you think is the maximum you will ever need and see if the cooling is sufficient (=> does not throttle more than you are comfortable with)  given the temperature condition you live in.,it may be that if you live in a climate where it is quite hot and your regularly run punishing loads that the stock cooler will not be able to keep up and throttling will be inevitable.,then you might consider a beefier cooling solution.,though i would not worry about 80c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i thought valorant was pretty cpu intensive, just like most competitive games.","it doesn't put much load on the gpu even at 1440p, so it should put quite a load on the cpu unless you cap your frame rate.",50% usage probably means 100% load on half the cores.,"which is what i'd expect from most games, as they aren't very good at using many cores.","and with 30 c in the room, i'm not surprised at all.","you're still within the safe limit, so probably nothing to worry about.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are bounded fully on the cpu side since itâ€™s valorant and you donâ€™t have a max fps cap.,utilisation at 50% only means your best single cores are loaded fully since thatâ€™s how games work in utilising cores.,just get a better cooler like a cheap hyper 212 and you will solve this temp issue.,"save a couple of bucks every week, it canâ€™t be that unattainableâ€¦",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50% load during a game=cpu intensive game.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the key point here is that 80 isn't a bad temp, and it won't harm your computer.","sure, there might be something you could work on if you're undervolting to get down to 80 - case air flow, better cooler, bad paste job, socket bending - whatever.",but you could also ignore all that and game away at 80.  you don't need to close your game in a panic.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you need better case airflow and a better cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the stock cooler on 12400f shouldn't need any undervolting and it won't reach 100. it either poorly mount or poorly paste job.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
80 is not bad... 100=bad.,enjoy the game,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i work at a computer store where both the 11400f and 12400f are common in prebuilds.,"we get back about 50% of the prebuilds with the same problem, ""heat and noise"".","sure, the prebuilds have severely bad airflow but the cooler itself is just utter trash.","hence ""any other cooler and the temps will go down"".","[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukjut6gyaog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukjut6gyaog)  
reaching around 75 degrees after a 28 second test.",i dont see where the cooler is anywhere near enough to cool a cpu after 30 minute usage.,"at higher tdp through bios it reaches 85 degrees, still after short usage.",room temp at 20 degrees which is considered low.,so yeah.,my honest opinion still stands: any cooler is better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's better to cap it at 141, if you have a freesync or gsync display, for input latency reasons.",locking at 144 means it enters vsync mode which has more latency than freesync.,you won't notice or suffer the difference between 141 and 144.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
screw it a little bit tighter if possible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's alright, just noisy.","full speed or variable speed, you won't own the pc long enough for the fan to die.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i didn't think about when i posted but i'm using liquid cooling.,think that makes a huge difference with case temps etc.,but my fan setup is kind of weird.,i really liked the thermaltake ring fans.,so 3 of my 4 fans are static pressure.,the 2 fronts and 1 rear.,i have regular fan for the top.,all are 140mm in size and the one front is attached to the aio radiator.,in order for my lights to be fully illuminated had to go into the msi bios and set fan speed voltage full.,its not overly loud but probably more then what most people want.,though if you wear headphones doesn't really matter.,its possible with the restricted air intake in the front that static fans work better in that location.,also i'm not really sure if the top fan is necessary but doesn't seem like there's any negative pressure though haven't really tested.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's how often your pc sends your inputs.,it seems to be buggy with valorant where anything other then 128fps will have your send rate lowered and not stable.,you can try 128fps lock and sew if your shots feel more consistent or if unlocked and high enough the fluctuations may be worth it for the fps.,but for coolers just make sure it includes a lga 1700 bracket you don't need much for your cpu any 20 or so usd if your in usa will do,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and now you have and will have a bad, overheating experience with intel.","not to mention, that your system can fail at any point, thanks to constant thermal cycling and the danger of getting cracks in cpu and motherboard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it is more cpu heavy yes, as long as you're pushing all of the frames.",my r9 fury could be bottlenecked by my i5-9400f at 4k lmao.,my 8700k does not tho.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
valorant works 60fps on 10y old cpus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this.,no fps cap meaning maxing used cores.,hyper 212 or even like a quiet brand cooler is what $30.,man's could make that mowing 2 lawns,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i donâ€™t understand why everyone is like â€œwho cares it wonâ€™t meltâ€ and downvoting the op.,i think the issue he has is this isnâ€™t even running stock.,itâ€™s undervolted.,"gotta wonder whether the case has good air flow, if the thermal paste isnâ€™t applied fully, etc.",whatâ€™s case look like?,enough system fans bringing in air and venting?,cabling clean?,"considering stock coolers just pump air into case, could be the person that built this isnâ€™t skilled in airflow and picked a unforgiving case to boot.",he could have missed some basics in that department although if he knows enough to undervolt seems unlikely.,still some people donâ€™t understand air flow at all and manage to get by with big cases or beefy coolers.,still some suggestions on what to consider other than â€œjust deal with itâ€ would be helpful right?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it doesn't really matter.,what matters is its gpu requirements.,"and these are pretty low too, if i'm not mistaken.","what happens here, if it can run at 60 fps, it can probably run 300 (600?",800?),"fps on a modern cpu, and if you have a gpu to match, it'll just keep pushing those frames happily at 100% load.","unless you cap them, which you probably should, unless you're some kind of superhuman competitive player.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah sounds like you're pretty worried about damaging something.,we're just reassuring you that you don't need to worry about damage.,"you'll find a lot of people here and in various forums who take pride in getting temps down as low as possible, but that's only because we're a bunch of nerds who enjoy one-upping each other.",it's part of the fun.,"so you absolutely can work on getting your temps down, but you can rest easy and enjoy it.","(also, you might get tired of listening to a fan at full speed, and that would be another good reason to work on it.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you need to but a separate bracket for your socket.,a lot of companies do not ship coolers with lga1700 compatibility right now because it is new.,a set costs $10 or less.,you can even get the socket for free with certain brands.,i know noctua sends out upgrades for free.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not a real apples to apples comparison but this guy had a decent ddr4 setup (4000 dual rank is pretty good) at the same p-core frequency.,my bclk is adjusted downwards by .5 so my p-cores are at 5.08. this trend goes for geekbench 5 though favoring decent ddr5 by a fairly wide margin.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

interesting and impressive!,which memory kit were being used ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the memory kits used does bring up the question: should reviewers use the best kits possible when comparing and then factor in ram price in perf/$ comparisons or should they use ram that's priced the same?,because perhaps better ram on the intel machine will close the performance gap but then might add $500 to the price.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
165 fps should be enough for everyone,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
general rule is that the more single thread bound  and badly coded a game is the better it responds to memory and cache latencies.,this works especially well for games with mods like skyrim,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most fair would be to test both with the same ram kit.,not one with good kit and other with the worst one available.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

in this situation it's not about whether or not the best memory kits were used.,the issue in this case is that ddr5 4800cl40 is both more expensive and worse (for gaming typically) than ddr4 3200cl14.,"my opinion is that memory kits should at least be comparable and representative of what people buying the cpus tested would be using assuming they are informed and rationally trying to ""optimize"" their build.",i'm not seeing a scenario in which a rationally and informed user should actually be looking at a 12900k build with ddr5 4800cl40 vs 5800x3d with ddr4 3200cl14 build.,in this particular case it would've made more sense for both to be using ddr4 3200cl14 for a gaming focused build.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea this is an interesting challenge.,"imo since 12th gen supports ddr4 too, the base test should always be using the same ddr4 settings.","if ddr5 is going to be tested, then it should at least be a kit where it outperforms ddr4 3200cl14 (this is a great set for most people without extreme tweaking).",this should be around 5200cl36 for ddr5.,"i am personally running a 5600cl36 xmp profile, this seems to be doable for everyone too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"my understanding is that intel improves performance with each successive cpu generation, (pretty much like all silicon companies).","this can be attributed to things like improving the core/uncore architecture, instructions per cycle, (ipc), and cpu cache algorithms, as well as supporting larger memory, and faster devices, (pcie and ddr).",these are performance gains for any/all applications.,"intel also improves performance by including the ability to accelerate certain instructions,  avx is an example.",however these performance boosts usually require the application software be written to take advantage of the newer instructions.,"this can be accomplished via compilers, or through software frameworks/libraries.","when intel released their third generation xeon scalable cpu last year, (code named ice lake), they stated that users should expect about a [46% performance improvement](https://www.sdxcentral.com/articles/news/intels-icelake-xeons-deliver-20-performance-uplift/2021/04/) for general workloads, over the second generation xeon, (code named cascade lake).","however, i read that with your specific simulation you saw better performance with the older haswell servers versus the first generation xeon scalable, (skylake).","if that's the case, i'd encourage you to reach out to your local intel team and see if they can offer some suggestions as to how to optimize your simulation for the newer intel capabilities.",good luck..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

basically just higher boost.,2 to 5% more performance for 25% higher price.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the ks is guaranteed to be a decent tier 12900k or better.,however they aren't as good as most people might think.,a shit tier 12900k might only do 5.1 ghz on cinebench r20 depending on voltage or cooling.,but i'd say as long as you're running a custom loop 5.3 ghz all core or better could be reasonably expected on the ks atleast for cinebench.,but if you're just running an aio or an air cooler you're likely going to have to reduce clockspeeds a bit to compensate.,the ks runs even hotter than a regular 12900k which already basically requires a 360mm aio at a minimum to prevent downclocking at stock.,there is very little oc headroom without a custom loop.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 12900ks is a ""perfect"" versiã³n of the 12900k.","there are several problems that are unavoidable when making the cpus, it's up to luck (also called silicon lottery) how well the dies end up being at the end of the process.","the ks versions are the 12900k silicon lottery winners being found by intel itself and then sold as a guaranteed ""perfect"" versions.",they're also oced.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
binning.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
binning.,"from a real world perspective, there is mo real reason to go with the ks unless you absolutely need to shave the seconds off of a render.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
imagine someone bakes 100 cakes.,5-10 of those cakes might turn out to be slightly prettier.,that's the 12900ks.,"it's the same chip, it just came out of the  factory slightly more perfect, meaning they can push it 100-300mhz higher.",resulting in like 3-4% better benchmark results.,for a stupid amount of extra money.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12900k is like buying lottery.,12900ks is like buying all the number for lottery so you will surely win the price.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
s = slightly binned other than that all depends on silicon lottery,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
factory oc for 170$ more.,"absolutely no difference over than that and this video proofs this: [https://youtu.be/2jhbs8hj5rk?t=544](https://youtu.be/2jhbs8hj5rk?t=544)  
possibly the worst computer product of 2022 so far.",what's the point in paying huge premium price if 99% of 12900k and ks do max out at 5.2/5.3ghz before they start to melt.,it's much better to invest that 170$ in a better motherboard or ram.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

update: confirmed pump failure.,i came back to my pc tonight and reached 90c after getting back on my pc.,"i tapped it a few times firmly, hoping to free up the pump if it was bound, and sure enough my temps dropped 50c and pump started up again.","it still appears to be running poorly, but at least i wont damage anything until a replacement arrives.","2nd lian li product i've had issues with out of 3 (3rd being the case) :( i love their designs, maybe i'm just unlucky, but so far in 3 months, this will be my 2nd cooler, and 3rd lconnect fan controller for my unifans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"something is definitely not ok, check your thermal paste, reseat your aio pump, make sure your bracket fits ok and the cooler have enough pressure on the cpu.","temps are way too high for just browsing, i got 23-25c while using chrome and that is with 280mm aio.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you take the sticker off the cpu block on the aio?,my guess is you may not haveâ€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
repaste thermal paste maybe?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so i think it's my aio... usually my radiator gets hot and the fans blow out the hot air... well they're cold and the radiator is 80f.,i shot my pump with a laser thermometer and the cpu block header was 180f.. damn thing is only 4 months old...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
custom loop time!,go big or go home!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"update again: no pump failure, pump had poor soldering for pump power internally.",i re-soldered it and temps are stable around 80-90 under heavy load.,in short - don't buy a lian li galahad aio - their soldering appears to have been done by a blind mand with parkinsons,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i tightened the block up  a little and now my idle temps are bouncing between 37-54, i tried cenebench just to see and all cores immediately shot up to 100c again.","closed it and they dropped, but im still worried sitting at 90-100c during gaming... maybe its time for a custom loop lol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, i did not remove the giant piece of plastic on the back of the block....  
yes... i removed the plastic lol.","my temps have been below 80 since december, this just started about a week ago - no changes made to pc during that time",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
aio pump dead.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've always wanted to but never had a reason until i owned a 12900 ðÿ˜‚,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"scratch that, idle temps are fine until its under load.. once the load is closed the temps still wont drop below 90c.. sadge",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah but it's vibrating and making noise like normal which is weird,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i don't believe they natively do, you can buy an adapter as a workaround though.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"have a predator helios 300 with a 7700hq which should get much hotter... my advice is: learn to do undervolting on your processor using throttlestop, open up your laptop and repaste it with kryonaut and then replace or add thermal pads if there aren't any if possible.",i get ~80 to a max of 86â°c on max load while gaming at max turbo boost on all cores.,you should be able to make it cool down by a bit more as you have a newer cpu/ laptop model.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"use throttlestop and undervolt (should require a bios mod), if you don't want to do this there's not much else you can do except from going to the throttlestop tpl tab and limit the maximum clock.","&#x200b;

so you're just wasting the dude's time right... you probably don't even own a gaming laptop.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"gaming laptops get hot, but you also can't really compare between different laptops as they have different cooling systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"a stress test will be the worst case scenario for thermals, and also, the engineers who decide the thermal limits aren't stupid.","if 95c would harm your chip, they'd make it throttle before that point.","it's definitely not optimal, but especially in a laptop, it's nothing to be super concerned about.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
max fans lol + buy a cooling pad and set that up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no it isnâ€™t.,95c is normal operating temperature.,you can go to 100c safely with the latest intel chips.,amd chips canâ€™t run as hot as intel.,itâ€™s an architecture difference.,"they need to run a bit cooler, not much but some.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
will do that.,also how's undervolting?,"i've never done that, saw a couple of videos.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
add details to the post.,don't bury it in comments.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

12100f.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12100f.,it's way more efficient and if you need more cores later you can upgrade to 13th gen instead of being stuck in the same generation or shelling out $200 for another motherboard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12100f because it is not on a dead platform.,you can then upgrade to a rocket lake when you get the budget and intel releases it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12th gen is quite a bit faster.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
invest to i3-12100f and get a decent lga1700 motherboard.,"12th gen intel is way better in term of acrchitecture and the socket itself is futureproof, meaning next gen cpu will use the same socket.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it may have less cores but the cores are much more powerful and efficient.,https://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare/intel-i5-10400-vs-intel-i3-12100/3737vs4687,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12th gen 12100f .. 11th gen made a leap over 10th and 12th gen was a bigger leap over 11th gen intel so 10th gen when compared to 12th gen is a joke,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"12100f, i got 10400f and wish i had something like 12100f or 12400f",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"on paper the 10400 would seem to win, but in practice the 12 series has some real black magic fuckery inside it.","they have the same boost speeds, same size l3 cache... 10 series has lower base speed but with any luck you'd hardly ever be at the base speed regardless of which one you choose... and yet in spite of the 10400's 2 additional cores (12 vs. 8 total threads), the 12100f is notably faster in gaming.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12100f.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"even with fewer cores, i'd get the 12100f for pcie4.","after motherboard cost, they'll both be roughly the same price, as even h610 isn't cheap.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in future even dual core will beat current 16 core.,https://nanoreview.net/en/cpu-compare/intel-core-i5-10400-vs-intel-core-i3-12100,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"only gaming get 12100f

if u planning to do any other work or need a bit powerful cpu go for 12400f",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12100f = 10700k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe i9 12900ks?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"jokes aside, choice depends on the game really.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"get a 12600k, and watch your performance go to the moooooon!!","processor ain't something to cheap out on: better to pay more once and be able to keep it for 5+ years, than to buy several processors over those 5+ years, and live with lower performance the whole time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pretty sure those 2 are on equal footing in regards to integrated graphics performance...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i was looking into it the other day, and i don't think this is true.",the 10400f can still pull ahead in productivity all core workloads.,"for instance, the 10400f is like \~13% faster in blender according to numbers from hardware unboxed (i had to use numbers from different reviews of theirs because i couldn't find a direct comparison, but cpus in both benchmarks numbers didn't change much, so an actual head-to-head comparison should get a similar number).",although i want to say i definitely think op should get a 12100f assuming they don't do something like blender on the side because it's better in the majority of ways like you said.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all i can say is f.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"also not bad, the upgradeability is way better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think at some point future celerons, pentiums will have 2 large p-cores backed up by 4 small e-cores.","this is already the case with mobile alder lake celerons, pentiums and i3s and e-cores will likely migrate to the budget desktop chips in 2 or 3 generations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wouldn't expect silicone to last enough to see that happen.,there's only so much you can die shrink and optimize the same technology.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not exactly.,"10700k is an 8c/16t part with unlocked multiplier, and ~18% higher boost clocks.",the ipc improvements are great on alder lake and single threaded performance they'll trade blows no doubt but multi-threaded workloads but the 10700k will leave it in the dust.,all this prior to ocing.,the 12100f is more efficient and has ddr5 support which offsets some of that but overall i think the 10700k is the more powerful cpu.,i also can't imagine many people pairing ddr5 with a 12100f at the min due to memory pricing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"haha, i wish",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i dont think it wil make any difference with 1650 and im on budget so the max i could go for is i5 11400f since prices in here are pretty high,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.... 12100 = 10700k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nah i'm pretty sure they are absolutely equal.,look at igpu comparisons between 10400f and 12100f.,"it's cool, i'll wait.","edit: in fact, you could say the gap between them is *non-existent* wink wink.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is quite clean.,i hadnâ€™t seen any decent matx boards for z690 til now.,"i donâ€™t suppose itâ€™s hiding another 1-2 m.2 on the bottom, does it?","iâ€™ve got my 12900k, some high speed/low cas ddr5 from gskill and a psu, but i just canâ€™t decide on the mobo and case.",part of me wants to go small cause itâ€™s fun.,and part of me wants to go with like.,"define 7 xl and a giant mobo and then fill the drive bays with icy dock nvme bays (probably 4x2.5 for some optane goodness (i already got a stack of 905pâ€™s, but i wonâ€™t like that i wanna buy the pcie4 enterprise ones unrealistically badly).","they are mad overpriced, but that low latency, especially when it comes to the sustained speeds while moving tons of small files is just magic.",i tried plenty of drives faster than them.,pci-e 4 ones that still managed like a million iops.,but optanes are just so responsive.,i canâ€™t quite imagine how nice the ones that that remove the speed bottleneck must be.,iâ€™ve also considered like raiding them or w/e but iâ€™m pretty sure that can only make them slower.,cause the multi disk logic is always gonna be slower than the optane drives from what i can tell.,the most viable option so far seems to be broadcomâ€™s pcie4.0 switch card.,which if i recall can run 8 x4 drives on an x16 slot (and i think it can negotiate to x8/x4).,"canâ€™t help writes much, but i figure itâ€™s plenty of bandwidth for at least 3 905p drives to go full speed at one thus at least reading off 3-4 of em at once should at least improve the read speeds.",i am curious about samsungs psuedo optane memory too (is it z-nand?),"iâ€™ve contemplated getting a 3080 or above, but it just seems like a waste for me to upgrade from my titan rtx this late into the cycle.","4080 (or perhaps 4090, the model doesnâ€™t matter i just donâ€™t wanna reduce my ram) canâ€™t be that far off and ideally will be pcie 5 (i know it doesnâ€™t need 5.0 x16, iâ€™m interested because i wanna run in x8 x8 with the other slot being used for a storage card or fast nic (i have a unifi pro aggregate switch so everything that can uses 10gb, and then my main pc rocks 25gb.","im still sad i missed out on the leaf or else i would be using my 100gb nic :p. that said, i bought almost all my nics during various amazon price mistakes lol, the 100gb chelsio card i got for 400 is ~900 normally).",tbh iâ€™m still annoyed you canâ€™t run game drivers on the enterprise cards the way you can do studio ones in gamer cards.,iâ€™d totally spend the money for that more advanced tsmc chip and ideally some even faster hbm cause yolo.,the one i want most tho is the crazy mellanox/gpu hybrid thing that is a dual 100gb nic and a beast gpu (i believe itâ€™s the same core count as a 3080).,"just because even with the nicest of the z690 boards, my biggest bottleneck is enough io for a gpu, a properly fast nic (i want rdma cause smb direct + smb multichannel would make my plex fast as heck and help me further advance my war on buffering and latency).",but iâ€™m crazy which is also why i have an fs1018 loaded with 12 7.68tb ssd and a 25gb nic.,"sadly linux still hasnâ€™t fixed their smb multichannel support, which even apple has working.","i believe only windows natively supports smb direct, tho you can technically get it on linux through ryussi: https://www.mosmb.com/editions/#1561631416304-771bb8dc-0de4, but, the fact that their site doesnâ€™t even mention price and you have to request a quote, i assume it will price me into the stratosphere where as i can get win server datacenter licenses from work as a microsoft employee.","since it would also serve as a home lab and i am not hosting any â€œproductionâ€ things, iâ€™m pretty sure itâ€™s within the terms of use of whatever they call msdn now.","the main problem is just the hardware needed to run a beefy enough server to take advantage of the benefits and actually max out the links (with dual 100gb ports and rdma, it should be possible to essentially max out the full 200gbps which of course would crush any local ssd).","now i want it for lots of reasons aside from plex, some are fickle like running games from the smb share, others are reasonable like managing video projects from my red komodo, as well as host some hyper converged vms on the storage machines (rdma basically allows you to skip talking to the cpu of the server, the nic itself moves the data from storage to memory and then transfers it to the client and the cpu is basically idle all the while sharing at 200 gbps (technically the fastest nics are either dual 200 or dual 400, but getting any switch that can make use of that would cost more than all my computers and cameras and keyboards and my now sorts old gti (1st year mk7) combined), so naw.",mostly though i just wanna play and see what â€œthe cutting edgeâ€ can actually do.,"even with just dual 100gbps, it works out pretty close to 4x the speed of the absolute fastest 4.0 x4 ssds.","so far iâ€™ve had good luck with asus, asrock and gigabyte pcbs (well the gigabyte died, but that was because i was a lazy genius and tried to add fluid to my water loop without shutting downâ€¦ and spilled it directly on the pch).",upside everything else survived so i sold it the 9900ks and the ram kit to a friend who had been running an 8800 and had a mobo that could direct swap it.,only msi has ever failed me on its own.,"to what people were saying about the 1gbps intel nics, i am fairly certain itâ€™s because the super common chip is super old and doesnâ€™t like uefi or win 10 and especially win11.",but the z690 has native support for intels 2.5gbps nic chip which is new and quite reliable.,unless they cheaped out and still used an ancient 1gb nic to cut costs by like $3.,either way it should be viable.,plus you can always add a nic.,"if you ever need a 2.5gb usb nic, the killer one has been the fastest and most reliable of the ones i own and tested (remember killer stuff is all just intel stuff with speshul firmware).","for 10gbps thunderbolt, i had been most impressed with my caldigit ones.","the owc one isnâ€™t bad, but the cooling design of the caldigit just destroys it.",blaaaah choosing pcbs is like the hardest step.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the x570 taichi only has one lan port, the 1gbe intel i211-at (possibly the most drama-free adapter on the planet).","i definitely don't want to discount your experience, but it's the first time i've heard of someone having an issue with that particular chip.","usually it's realtek's 2.5gbe, the still broken b1-3 i225-v 2.5gbe or occasional killer 1gbe nic (and with killer, it's almost always the old software stack).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

clear case of bad contact between cpu and cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seeing a bunch of cores hit 100c instantly with only 200 watts of power leads me to believe there's a contact problem.,"when you removed the cooler plate from the cpu each time, what did the spread of the thermal paste look like?","i noticed with the aio i'm using, the arctic liquid freezer ii 360, the included 1700 mounting hardware was confusing to figure out because some of the parts were mixed up with the other mounting hardware & the instructions were very bad.",it would have been easy to accidentally use the wrong offsets with a 1 millimeter difference.,i wouldn't be surprised if the kits you got had similar issues.,"also even with the 1700 mounting hardware parts being correct, i found that many times it seemed like maybe i had tightened things enough, but eventually i discovered that everything needed to be tightened all the way until it bottomed out.","granted, maybe that's not the case with the mounting systems you are using, but it's something to consider.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i had similar issue before , i would recommend trying different case fan configurations !","airflow plays a big role in this, particularly when a gpu with 300+ watts sitting in close proximity to the cooler and dispensing huge amount of heat into the radiator or the heat sink",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"unfortunately it's not just the cooler, it is the ihs/cpu that is bended/concave and it's difficulting the contact with the heatspreader.","it's complicated because even if it's making contact, it doesn't have pressure, so the thermal paste become the main medium (instead of just filling the cracks between the ihs and heatspreader) and the thermal efficiency drops severely.","you can try to apply even more pressure, but there's risk to damage the socket/mb.",or..... you can...... lap the ihs....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

well it's a laptop.,have you opened it and checked the condition or the fans/heatsink.,this just sounds like enough dust has built up that the heatsinks aren't as efficient as they should be.,hotter temps lead to lower clock speeds on both the cpu and gpu.,also it may just be more services/programs running in the background since you got the laptop.,even apps that seem simple to use in rhe background like spotify will use some cpu resources.,that usage adds up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a slow deterioration is very symptomatic of a heat issue like you said.,background processes will further exacerbate the issue with heat soak but shouldn't otherwise majorly affect his performance.,"op needs to clean out his fans and if that doesn't help call acer's support line, he might have a faulty heatsink application.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think i have my 12900k with an undervolt of .07 and pl2 restricted to 125w.,"it will hit 25k on the cbr23 bench, which i'm happy with as i doubt i will ever need the all core performance.",have a look at https://www.techpowerup.com/review/intel-core-i9-12900k-alder-lake-tested-at-various-power-limits/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just running a 12700k stock i was impressed that in some cases it will idle around 6-10 watts.,"on the desktop with 6 monitors, 2 of which are attached to to the cpu igpu, with a video playing on one screen (video card, not igpu), dozens of chrome tabs open, hwinfo running, msi afterburner with 100ms update time on like 30 different graphs, and process lasso running, is hovering between 10 and 22 watts on the cpu.","this is quite impressive, although the system itself is drawing 103-105 watts from the wall, with the video card drawing just under 23 watts.","however, there are two hard drives adding to this as well.","i would estimate minus the hard drives, cpu, gpu, there is 40-50 watts being used just to run the system.",when i'm not playing games i underclock the video card to the point where it hovers around 12 watts.,this thing will draw 230 watts if running max settings prime95 on all the cores.,"i haven't really put it through its paces yet in terms of the crazy forex charting software single thread bottlenecks that caused me to upgrade to begin with, but so far i'm finding that in general, i'm shocked at how efficiently this processor does stuff.","of course, most of the time it's the e-cores that have any type of load at all, and even that isn't really being used much.","this is what it looks like when running the things i described:

[https://i.imgur.com/ibbkwdj.png](https://i.imgur.com/ibbkwdj.png)

i don't know how this stacks up against amd procs or the last few intel generations, so maybe this is just normal these days.",i plan on undervolting as much as i can without losing too much frequency.,i really want to cut down heat output to the bone due to my room heating up a lot in the summer.,"chances are i will be spending a lot of time both playing games and at the same time running some semi cpu intensive software that might load up a few cores, partially or fully, so the undervolt will probably greatly reduce wattage draw if these things end up being very cpu intense.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it is impressive, in general they run more efficiently than amd but once they speed up they also draw way more power.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
any idea where to limit pl2 on an asus motherboard?,can't find the option anywhere on the bios.,edit : found it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
btw one further thought.,"i believe the 12900k has more efficiency potential, because it has double the e-cores.","and it seems that in most cases, e-cores are just about all that is needed until you start breaking out the games or really heavy duty stuff.","in fact, i'm almost kicking myself for not getting it, just because by forcing certain games/apps onto the e-cores i could probably end up pushing those load watts down as long as i don't run into any bottlenecks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for taking the time to post.,that is exactly why i choose the 12900k i just did not expect windows 11 and thread director to work as well as they do.,p cores rarely see any use in daily productivity tasks.,e cores are barely ticking over and boost up so quickly when you need them.,i have not seen much over 150 watt draw playing flight sims in 4k when all the p cores are singing.,iâ€™m happy others are understanding the benefits of this generation of chip.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looks and see if they ever sold a version of that laptop with the newer processor.,"if so, maybe you can get a bios update that supports it.","if not, probably it won't work.","regardless, that is a 10 year old laptop and both of those processors are totally obsolete, so i'm not sure this is worthwhile unless you get a free processor given to you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i agree with the earlier comments.,you could wait for intel 13th/14th gen when ddr5 and ddr5 mobo prices should start to drop to a more reasonable price.,the i5 8400 is still a very solid ~~6c/12t~~ 6c/6t cpu at the moment.,especially if you have a decent cooler on it to let it clock to its ceiling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that gpu + cpu is a pretty solid pair and shouldnâ€™t cause any bottleneck iâ€™d imagine.,upgrading could be beneficial if you do any multi core workstation type workloads but iâ€™d say youâ€™re fine to wait a couple more generations before worrying about upgrading for gaming,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah go for it, really good upgrade over your current cpu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'd keep the 8400 and put the money it would cost for cpu+mb towards a better gpu for running 1440p uw,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6c6t.,"not entirely sure about the power draw, but i suppose it should be 'only' 70 watts at most even with older 14nm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good catch.,for some reason i was under the impression all of 8th gen had hyper threading.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
technically even now we haven't reached the point of 'all cpus have hyper threading' as there exists a certain celeron... haha,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why only an nh u12a?,i'm looking at an nh d15 for my 12700k build and already concerned about cooling!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"unlike 12900k, this cpu behave differently when under volt, with 12900k -120mv, i would get package power of 220w and it's manageable by nh u12a (max 86c).","but with 12900ks -120mv, the power shoot up the pl2 limit (288w) and dropped to 260-250w and the hit the tj max ceiling at 100c

overall with nh u12a, this cpu still perform well and 5-6% better than 12900k.","cb r23 - mc 28849 sc 2109 

most application and games cpu clocks at 5.2 ghz and stay there under load comparing with 4.9 ghz on 12900k

in some cpu intensive game (horizon zero dawn) the package power while gaming hover around 135-150w (80-85c) but in other games it usually hover around 100-120w or less.",so the fan noise is noticeably louder than 12900k.,in my opinion it's not worth the extra for the ks for gaming.,but when i use with cad application the extra 300 mhz makes different.,note: my ambient temp is 27-30c when testing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
far too many people in this thread are mistaking the u12a for a u12s or worse; the u12a manages to get very close to d15 performance (basically 280mm aio) thanks to it having seven heatpipes.,"if the u12a can't deal the heat generated with it, then neither can d15 or 280mm aios.","i don't understand the reasoning behind buying a 12900ks, but to each their own.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"you're being downvoted, but you are correct, long sustained workloads don't do any better on water than with air, it comes down to the ability to transfer heat away from the cooler.","water has a high thermal mass, but that means that it's also harder to cool, requiring larger radiators to reach the same equilibrium temperature as an air cooler.","i moved from a 420mm (3x140mm) radiator to a dark rock pro 4 and my equilibrium temperatures are roughly identical, but the air cooler reaches it in a minute whereas it took 30 minutes on water ..  but i was running weeks-long computations and the risk of a leak or pump failure meant water really gained me nothing but stress.","you, however, need a more capable air cooler for a 12900ks... even the dark rock pro 4 i have would struggle.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah bc i got a system rn with 750 w gold + and i some time get crash from battlefield 5. the i9 is 5.1ghz with rtx 3080 oc but when i downclock the rtx 3080 then i get no crash so i think i ha e to low w + thinking about building a custom water loop so idk if i need more than 850w to supply the system with w,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no you bought a cpu that will definitely clock higher than the average 12900k but there are still gonna be some 12900k that will clock as high or higher than the average ks.,"if you paid those extra 350 expecting noticeably more performance you are a fool, if you got it to avoid a ""bad"" chip for toying with oc then you got what you paid for.",is it worth the money?,only you can say.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the ks will hit the clocks specified on the box.,the k may or may not hit equivalent clocks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"12900k is a lottery, 12900ks is guaranteed to hit the minimum of the higher clocks mentioned.",a 12900k could run all-core 5.3ghz if you won the silicon lottery.,also if you didnt know this beforehand you shouldn't have bought it in the first place if that really bothers you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the average 12900k is worse than the average 12900ks.,but if you want to dig through 100+ 12900ks to find one that matches the chip der8auer's go for it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pretty sure they're binned exclusively for the capacity to run 5.5/5.2.,"whether that's at 1.3v or 1.5v, at 50c or 90c, is determined by luck of the draw.",basically a cash grab by intel.,"sucks, but i'm a sucker for cash grabs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
agreed with everyone here.,"by way of comparison, iâ€™m using a 9900ks that i was lucky enough to win the silicon lottery on, as it runs 5.3 ghz stable on all cores under a nzxt kraken x62.",i knew it would hit 5.0 out of the box and thatâ€™s why i bought it.,hitting 5.3 was just icing on the cake.,"as with the 12900ks, it is guaranteed to hit the clocks advertised on the box.",anything beyond that is just another draw in the silicon lottery.,iâ€™ve just bought an i9-12900k as iâ€™m upgrading my system to z690.,"iâ€™ll be selling my 9900ks on ebay, as hard as it is to part with it, but itâ€™s been a great chip.",i need the additional cpu performance for running a cpu intensive flight simulator on three screens for real world flight training.,"i thought about buying the ks, but the reviews showed an average overall 2% performance improvement over the k in the 12th generation for disproportionately more power usage, as compared to a 10% performance increase of the 9900ks over the 9900k chip.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
answering your second question with a question.,do you think he paid 500 for that  high sp chip used in comparison with the 3 fresh out-of-box kses?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
think about this.. what are the odds of having a really good binned 12900k out in the wild?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well yea, you could get a better 12900k than a 12900ks, but thatâ€™s a very rare occurrence.",the ks will on average overclock higher.,but you are only guaranteed the speeds that are written on the box.,what youâ€™re paying for is the privilege to say â€œi have the bestâ€ itâ€™s a crappy value product that nobody should buy if they actually have a budget.,"throw that money anywhere else, buy a steam gift card instead.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"12900ks is a product mainly for taking extra money from people who always buy the ""top"" current product and don't care about money.",same sort of product as 3090ti.,"it's your own fault that you fell for it, if not happy, don't you have the 14day free return policy?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it would be super nice if reviews scaled the power down and tested it to see how efficient they can also be.,like testing the 12900ks at a locked 95watt to see how the different skus fare.,"if iâ€™m buying one of these thereâ€™s no way in hell iâ€™m letting it run past 200 watts

"i9-12900ks is totally fine, its far from disappointing cpu, the only people who disappointed with it is stupid people who expect the performance jump up to 10%+ from normal i9-12900k which is very unrealistic expectation since both cpu still have the same architecture with the same configuration too, except ks cpu got a bit higher clocks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
roman got horribly unlucky.,that or i got super lucky since my ks is about the same as his binned 12900k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
really excellent comments in this thread.,kind of speechless at how much effort some of you guys put in your responses.,amazing and also very much appreciated.,"i haven't had the time to comment until tonight -- but.. i do have one more question:

  
i have a 2080ti and a 11600k at the moment.",it's hooked up into a custom loop with 2 360mm radiators.,current temps at load get up toward 59c or 61 with fans on low.,i have two intake fans and one exhaust for a total of 8 fans.,the side panel of my corsair 5000x is off.,"i'm suspecting that this chip with my current setup is going to run much, much hotter than my 11600k system at 5ghz.","at this point i'm doubting that my custom loop will be able to keep up, especially since i do plan on overclocking this cpu pretty high (i play rust and this game is very very dependent on core clocks to achieve high fps).",with that being said i'm worried about exceeding the max temp rating of both my pump and the soft tubing that i'm using to cool the system with.,any suggestions or knowledge someone could drop on me?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to win the lottery you have to buy day one.,"this round is over, as they are selling binned themselves.",wait for 13900k lottery,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i thought that as well but a lot of people in the comment section were also reporting higher sp scores/clocks than i expected.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
me too.,i'm that guy that bought a rampage v edition 10 and a 6900k lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm in the literal exact same boat as you are just with a different game.,i'm upgrading from an 11600k to the 12900ks because rust is so dependent on cpu core clocks and my framerate while streaming just isn't up to par.,i'm literally just upgrading for higher clocks and slightly higher ipc.,don't feel foolish i know your pain all too well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
without silicon lottery (rip) we wont know.,"this is by no means apples to apples, but we can look at the last special edition, the 9900ks and compare it to the 9900k to see very roughly the binning.","keep in mind these are conservative figures since silicon lottery was selling them as guaranteed to run stable, they aren't clocks/voltages to just run one benchmark and crash after.","only the top 5% of 9900k's hit 5.10ghz (max they sold for 9900k), and required around 1.312v to do so.",while the top 28% of 9900ks could hit 5.10ghz and only required around 1.287v to do so.,so the normal edition would require approximately 20 cpu's to get a golden sample.,while the special edition only required 3 cpu's to get a better bin than the best 9900k.,they also sold an additional bin of the 9900ks at 5.20ghz that was in the top 4% and required 1.325v to do so.,"**tldr;** it absolutely makes sense to buy the special edition when you're looking for *the highest performing chips*, rather than gambling on the silicon lottery on the normal i9's.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
while the wording of your post is annoying aggressive i suppose i'd chime in anyway.,my concern (and the only reason i made this post in the first place) was to decipher whether or not i was paying more for less.,not to express buyer's remorse.,like the 3090 ti or not it still serves a purpose.,"high end market segments, while not as profitable as middle of the road, still make money and there's always people ready and willing to part with theirs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very interesting.,i also agree with you.. would have been nice to see this comparison in reviews.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that was my main thing with his video.,it seemed to me when i watched his review (maybe i interpreted this wrong) that he was saying you'd be luckier to get a high end 12900k that overclocks higher than your standard ks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the sp of a ks is different from that of a k because the v/f curve is entirely different on the ks.,"this is because there are actual points going up to 5500, rather than just 5200 of the k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12900ks sp ratings aren't comparable to 12900ks.,also more recent production 12900ks are worse.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i appreciate your response; however, for my use case i will have to strongly disagree with your tl;dr.  i'm a rust content creator.",rust is a game that is notoriously dependent on cpu core clock speed to get high fps.,"the game is optimized very poorly, but in order to get a competitive frame rate i basically am buying this cpu.",in any other situation i would never upgrade from my 11600k for at least another generation most likely two.,"call it dumb, but it's just the way it is.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3090ti - almost identical performance to 3090, 100w higher power draw, much higher price .","12900ks - almost identical performance to 12900k, uses more power, much higher price

you aren't paying more for less, you're paying more for the same chip with higher clock and higher power use.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
agreed.,i knew that going into it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so you knew you're basically just paying for a factory overclock and still went for it?,"then it's your fault that you did and intel's fault that they even release stuff like this, but it's a corporation so only thing they care about is money anyway.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes.,you're correct.,"the alder lake [cpu](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/134591/intel-core-i712700-processor-25m-cache-up-to-4-90-ghz.html) supports pcie 4.0, (as well as 5.0 but it was never [implemented](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-600-series-chipsets-no-pcie-gen-5)), while the h610 [chipset](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/218829/intel-h610-chipset.html) supports pcie 3.0. this means that the asus motherboard you [referenced](https://www.asus.com/motherboards-components/motherboards/prime/prime-h610m-e-d4/techspec/), has 1 slot which supports pcie 4.0 which is connected to the pcie lanes from the cpu, and 1 slot which supports pcie 3.0 connected to the h610 pch chipset.",so you won't have an issue using a pcie 4.0 card with this motherboard.,you just need to make sure you install it into the proper slot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"benchmarks do that, yes.","if youâ€™re skyrocketing to max temp and throttling, it means you should get better cooling.",thatâ€™s one of the things people use benchmarks to test.,"if it wasnâ€™t pushing it to the max in order to find out the max performance, it wouldnâ€™t be much of a benchmark",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it doesn't skyrocket to 100 degrees.,it gradually goes up from 20- 50 - 70 - 100. but what i want to know is will this have damaged the chip,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cinebench isn't max load it is a weak load.,prime95 draws 20% more power than cinebench.,i've had overclocks pass cinebench for 30 minutes but bsod starting minecraft.,if your pc can't handle cinebench something is seriously wrong.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, you wonâ€™t have damaged it.",and thatâ€™s good that itâ€™s not skyrocketing lol.,"but if itâ€™s going that high, it means your cooler canâ€™t handle going to max load.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah.,i'm thinking of going aio for 12th gen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"basically, iâ€™d say if your system is working correctly, cinebench r23 should not cause it to hit 100/throttle.","prime 95 small ffts with avx will maybe cause it to throttle or at least run a heck of a lot hotter than cinebench, but it should not crash to be considered 100% stable.",throttling (basically hitting 100c on an intel cpu) does not damage it; the point of throttling and not going past 100 is that the cpu is protecting itself.,laptops do it all the time and most people donâ€™t even notice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 5800h should be about the same price as the 4800h.,i would go for that.,"also, get a laptop with intel 12th gen or amd 6000 series.",they have much better performance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gaming performance would be dictated by the gpu and it's allowed power limits moreso than the cpu.,so it doesn't matter much.,but of the two the 11400h is the better gaming cpu.,while the 4800h is slightly better at multithreaded tasks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"according to [wikichip](https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/amd/ryzen_7/4800h), the 4800h is pcie 3.0 1x8 max.",that could affect performance with some gpus.,(5800h seems to have the same limitation.),"according to intel's ark, the 11400h is pcie 4.0 1x16.","i can't guarantee there is some odd motherboard/gpu combination that limits that, though.",amd has made gpus that uses fewer lanes but at 4.0 speeds.,i don't know if nvidia has done anything like that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah, this guy is also now asking for donations to support his ""work"" *cough* witchhunting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
now that's just low.,this type of nonsense should have grounds for legal action no?,trying to profit off spreading misinformation to damage intel's reputation.,sheesh.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why would it throttle?,"form factor only determines how many things you can put inside your case, it has nothing to do with temps.",as long as you are able to remove the hot air from inside the case you will be fine.,"in fact, many small form cases have much better airflow layout that larger atx cases and will therefore have better temps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"tl:dr, liquid cooling.","as long as you're moving all the heat to the exit and evacuating it, ""size matters not""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"coming from having a cpu that can routinely peak north of 325 watts and a gpu that pulls 400 watts all in an 18l chassis with a single 240mm (60mm thick, noctua ippc 3k rpm push/pull) with the cpu staying under 85â° and gpu under 65â° this doesn't really seem all that surprising.",the specific cooling solution is way more important than the cpu itself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it also doesn't throttle if you don't use it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well the case limited the radiator size to 240mm.,another video shows their 12900k throttled being cooled with one of those and 360mm and higher is recommended.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the case does limit the size of radiator / heat sink, so being able to fully run a top end graphics card and cpu in such a small factor is a feat indeed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12900k is only drawing less than 300w stock speeds so any 240mm radiator is more than enough.,the main limitation to temperatures with these new cpus is thermal transfer between the die to the cooler anyways so bigger radiator only marginally helps temperature after a certain point.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they usually only throttle when running benchmarks.,mine throttles in cinebench r23 with a 360 rad.,if i just regularly use it.,it's fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's really bad lmao.,"cinebench isn't a stress test and uses extremely reasonable amount of power (about 15-20% less than prime95 or linpack...) you need to be sure that you are using the right mounting bracket, thermal paste etc.",especially if you're at stock,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah exactly.,that's what i'm talking about.,the person in the video has it in a sff case with 240 mm rad and it didn't throttle in cinebench.,to all those smack talking alder lake saying it's a furnace.,there we go.,it can even bench in a sff.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the other thing with these alder lake cpus is getting the cooler tightened perfectly.,i haven't tried to reseat my cooler.,apparently that helps a lot.,it would be good to know what the power limit is on the mobo too.,with my z690i unify when i set it to water-cooling it removes all of the power limits.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this arc will definitely be interesting but it's going to come down to drivers and features that developers can implement.,it's going to come down to the software and how much support intel is going to give.,hate on nvidia as much as you want but seems they have a clear foot hold on supporting the devs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not sure what's so confusing?,it's a guaranteed minimum clock-rate across the batch based on binning.,more applicable to mobile environments/requirements.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the more i think about this the more it sounds like good news.,~1550mhz worst case scenario.,shown running at a base clock of 2200mhz.,could explain why all the media points to the top-end discrete card being comparable with a 3070/6700.,"couple that with a 6nm process, different logical core component counts and density and we may (will) have a 3rd player in the house.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'll be buying one of the new intel graphics cards for sure.,"i don't even care if their flagship is as fast as the 3070, i'll be getting one regardless.",i'm so tired of nvidia/amd bullshit price gauging.,"as an example, i bought a rtx2080 which was the second fastest card on the market at that time for $750 in early 2020. fast forward to 2021 and a fucking entry level 3060/3060ti costs over $1k and even now they're well over msrp.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think intel has bigger developer relations than amd and nvidia, it's also going to help that intel is going to be going the open source route for intel arc",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it comes from the fact it's a different approach than what was standard.,many people will read it like they used to read amd and nvidia chips.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to be fair once the card is out of amd's and nvidia's hands there's really not much they can say about the pricing.,"unless some sort of pre-existing arrangement exists that prevents it, there's nothing they can do to prevent their partners from price gouging.","even if they can, the cards sell out immediately and then show up on ebay with insane markups.",see: every best buy drop.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, because intel gpus will totally not for the amd/nvidia gpu pricing trends.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel gpus will be priced accordingly to their mining profitability, just like any other card in the market.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i hope you realized you're literally part of the problem, along everyone who bought any gpu newer than vega/pascal.","**you literally accepted higher prices than before**, yet you complain these cards are more expensive now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">intel has bigger developer relations than amd and nvidia

yeah in the laptop space they have a lot of partnerships(i think that's why they launch their laptop/mobile arc gpus first), and they're incentivising/subsidising using arc gpus with their cpus which means developers have a lot more options when it comes to test devices too",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
amd and nvidia also had base clocks where its almost impossible to get close to in normal games.,"imo intel should provide something like amd's ""game clock"" in the table as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they wont follow the current market trends, at least not for intel arc's 1st gen alchemist gpu.","intel arc is a new brand and alchemist is their first product, have to build up trust not only with their customers but also partners, and need to build an install base to get market share.","alchemist is going to be priced very competitively, and intel is going to try their hardest to try to get cards in customers hands (gamers, creators, etc) to get feedback, bug reports, to optimize drivers, the more +1 installs the better for intel so losing money is a none issue, 1st gen isn't for profits.","so as that ""people who get alchemist are beta testing for intel"" meme is right, alchemist will launch at a low competitive price and under perform at first but eventually reach it's potential with driver optimizations from 'beta testers' it will be a perfect opportunity to to get a good gpu (~3070 ti equivalent) with ray tracing support, ai super sampling, media creation, high vram, etc.",for a low price.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
huh?,"anyway, even if intel prices their cards similarly to their nvidia/amd counter-parts, some people will buy them which means less sold cards for nvidia/amd which will in turn force them to lower their msrp to stay competitive.",competition is always good for the average joe consumer.,"in either case, i'll be going intel as soon as they roll out their line up just for shits and giggles.",fuck the jacket man and his $2-$3k 500w cards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mobile is their strength but i meant isv relations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this is true, and honestly?","fuck polished gpus, i want value products.",give me a 5700 xt over a 6700 xt or a 5600 xt over a 6600 xt any day.,"intel says theyâ€™re willing to buy market share with alchemist if they have to, and if they stick to that, these will be the best gpus of this generation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the price gouging has nothing to do with people using these cards as gpus and everything with crypto mining.,"if these cards can mine cryptos, then they will be heavily scalped no matter how beta the product is.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and if those alchemist gpus are competitive, then the scalpers wonâ€™t do anything with it because they want intel to win.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah except crypto has been taking a nose dive for some time now.,why do you think the cards are getting cheaper?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, uhâ€¦ thatâ€™s not really all that true.",itâ€™s sure been volatile but it hasnâ€™t gotten to insignificant yet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
b\*$%h please.,unless it doesn't need 3 x 8 pin.,the upcoming gpus look power hungry.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thanks i thought that my laptop might overheat and possibly damage my cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no just sometimes it pops up while playing games,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11400h = laptop,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nope, cpus will throttle when they hit around 100c to prevent any damage.","intel and amd wouldn't offer a 3 year warranty and set the limit that high if it was damaging cpus, because then they'd have to pay to replace them",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in laptop is kinda okey( you need to clean up the cooling system and probably replacing the thermal paste with something expensive) but on desktop you need to improve the cooling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

> i wish he tested elden ring's stuttering with ddr5 vs ddr4.,"elden ring's stuttering is caused by shader compilation, the limitation there is that no cpu in existence today is capable of compiling the shaders fast enough on-the-fly to prevent stutters.","you'd need a cpu that's around 500x faster than the 12900k to fix the issue (no, i didn't mistype that).",the reason consoles doesn't stutter is because the shaders are already compiled on those systems.,"the steam deck has a similar fix, in that steam will cache and upload the compiled shaders to a server.","similarly for pcs, if you play elden ring primarily, each gpu, game, and/or driver update will force shader recompilation to happen, in turn making the game stutter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is one of your all-time worst takes.,/r/intel is not your emotional support blanket.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19% ipc with no node/ram changes.,intel already showed what they get from them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it was possible on the same node with no new ram ( zen 2 > zen 3 ) or frequency improvements.,but zen4 with ddr5 ram on a new node with improved architecture and 300mhz more won't even get 20% ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"doesnâ€™t alder lake have double the l2 cache of zen 3 yet with both using ddr4 it comes nowhere close to being significantly faster in gaming, what you should be worrying about is the massive gain in performance zen 4 will have over zen 3 due to doubling l2 cacheðÿ˜ðÿ˜(see what i did there) also a 16 core zen 4 is going to have more l3 cache vs a 24 core i9 and in gaming where only the p. cores are being used both will have same amount of l2 16mb for 8 p cores 36mb l3 and 16mb for 16 core zen 4, 32mb l3.",when looking at it from this angle raptor lake and zen 4 looks evenly matched,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep zen 4 is going to have 15% + ipc so i see raptor lake and zen 4 being evenly matched,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">alderlake is a significantly better cpu but a lot of the performance gap is because of amd not being on ddr5 yet as well

no, that's not true.",in the laptop space both alder lake-h and zen 3+ rembrandt have ddr5 and intel is still much faster.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is useful information for impatient buyers.,people really need to wait for amd to release their ddr5 ram supported cpus before buying anything.,"for all we know amd might pull something out of nowhere and the value comparison sky rockets, which happened with ryzen in the past.",intel just heard about the rumour that amd were releasing their ddr5 cpus this year and beat them to the chase by releasing their 12th gen cpu's before christmas 2021 and taking up all the impatient buyers that want more performance as quickly as possible.,"this also doesn't help due to older cpus still being able to run these games pretty well, so it's not that useful to buyers, it's only useful for buyers that want to buy new stuff.",you could easily run these games on a r7 3700x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ddr5 can be tuned as well.,techpowerup reviewed that 6400 c32 kit and was able to push it to 6800mhz.,ddr4 is on the rearview mirror for good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

rembrandt has low cache.,different to zen3 desktop chips with their massive cache.,not comparable at all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"well speaking of cache, zen 4 raphael will have half the l2 cache per core compared to 13th gen raptor lake and also less shared l3 cache than the rpl i9 (32mb per 8 core chiplet vs 36mb monolithic).",so ddr5 alone is not what will make zen 4 at equal footing with rpl.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

nothing?,are you sure?,the 6+8 alder lake laptop chip beats the 8 core rembrandt offering in both multi-core and single core.,intel doesn't need more p-cores (especially when these p-cores are getting increased ipc) to beat amd 16 cores.,":)

there's the issue that the 5800x3d has some limitations and the fact that it may be harder to cool and the price jump can screw it if the performance can justify it.,"in canada you can get the 12900k for 700 cad and the kf for 20 less, the lowest 5950x is 763. motherboards are a whole other matter since you can buy used cheap boards with good oc and vrm for amd but intel does have nice ddr4 boards",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
computerbase tested twice as many games and has the 12900k w/ddr5 with a 9% lead.,factor in another 2% for the 12900ks and you'll looking at a 11% lead.,they overclocked the ddr5 to 6200 and the lead only went up by 3%.,"tpu had similar results across 10 games at 720p(their gpu is bottlenecking at 1080p), 12.7% average lead for the 12900ks over the 5900x.","so across a larger number of games, the 12900k/12900ks's advantage wains significantly.","with an alleged 15% improvement from a company that has been overdelivering on their claims as of late, i can definitely see it sway in amd's favor.","also, sipping half the power and generating half the heat at half the price on far cheaper ram is pretty huge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which graphics card was cbase using?,and was the ddr5 also running at cl32?,"it looks like the gap is much wider on nvidia (3090+) than amd (6900xt) for some reason

i did -0.080 in xtu with adaptive voltage and it ran stable after multiple tests.,eventually set that in bios so i didnâ€™t have to keep applying it in xtu every time i restarted.,idle temps are 22c and max load was just under 50c after 10min with a kraken z63 aio cooler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hello.,i have a 12600k.,i undervolted mine to -0.115v.,i'm getting 26c as the lowest temp.,i also have the same cooler as yours.,"well, its the x63 but the performance should be the same.",how did you get your temps so low?,thanks!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26c is a great temp!,i think the only difference for me is that i have an open front panel so the radiator/fans get direct airflow.,also the room temperature is around 68f,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
23c when i have the ac on.,idle goes up to 30c when ac is turned off.,"well, having no front panel sure is helping with the temps.",haha,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the only thing this does is take out the good bins out of the 12900k pool, so probably anyone that gets a 12900k from now on will probably get a dud.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"he's ""disappointed"" because he paid 1400 euros for his super binned 12900k while 12900ks chips retail for ""just"" $740 and offer similar performance :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they will get what is in specifications for 12900k , overclocking result don't matter at all for intel and you can't complain either, so it's win win for intel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

then at that point all you need to get is the f. the point of getting a k was to have an unlocked chip with the hopes of getting a decent one.,"now that that's out of the question, what's the point.",now the k made a little more sense for the 9900k when the ks came out because you still needed a z board to oc memory.,but even that's been changed with new mobos.,"unless the 12900k is on a massive sale, it's pretty much dead.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

different between ddr4/5 is a lot.in some game over 20%.,ddr5 latency is worse than ddr4 yet this provides better fps so high bandwidth probably ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the increased l3 cache of the 5800x3d is likely to lessen the impact that memory latency has on performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not compared to 1440p or 4k because those resolutions have far better sharpness accuracy and definition than 1080p.,trying to tell me that 1080p has excellent brightness is the same as telling a 1080p user than 720p is excellent.,gtfo lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the entire game doesn't have to fit in the l3 cache, the larger cache just means that a higher percentage of the game can fit in the l3 cache.",not all games fit in the ram but there is still benefits to having 16 gb of ram instead of 8 or 4 gb.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's not how cache works.,unless games are programed to swindle the cpu prefetcher with crackpot access patterns then bigger cache sizes certainly help processing larger amounts of data.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"would love to try lm one day, maybe when i upgrade to the 13900k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i didn't bother checking the temps when gaming since the cpu usage never hit 40%.,"it idles at 2x c, sometimes at 3x.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just making sure because if you are using the lga1200 mount kit it will not make full contact with alder lake cpus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ah!,you are right.,i was looking at the test setup section in the 12900ks review which says they used a arctic liquid freezer ii 360 mm but now see they also list the noctua nh-u14s as well.,"https://www.techpowerup.com/review/intel-core-i9-12900k-alder-lake-12th-gen/4.html

that link is with an air cooler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you don't need an open loop with 12900k.,i've tried several aio's with my 12900k and roughly get high 70's low 80's in cinebench r23.,"i've used the corsair h150i capellix, xt and lian li galahad, and also an open loop.",these cpu's will hit 80's to 90's under long multicore stress tests but tmax is 100c before it starts throttling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why wait itll only be a higher price due to inflation if youre stateside,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's no joke , with aio i got same problem .","after i make custom loop , and now all so good",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"stock (stress test ) temps max 71 now 5.2 all p cores , temps 92 stress , games 55",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's par for the course for this cpu.,they are rated for 99c so it's within safe operating temperature.,"and it only reaches those temperatures under 100% load, which depending upon your use case may be rare.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
89c is fine.,yes it is warm but it is completely fine considering it will almost never get to that under normal conditions not running any stress tests or benchmarks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then there's no reason to get bent outta shape over something so insignificant like benchmark temps.,that's not real world usage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if you can get something with a decent vrm like the asus h610m-a (can just about handle a 126k) you can actually go for the 12600k.,"also i personally (you don't need to) will underclock it to 12400/12500 levels, for the extra efficiency(12th gen seems to consume a lot of power over 4ghz.)",while still getting the e cores.,"then you technically can go even cheaper on the motherboard haha

(i think i have seen something that shows a 12400 overclocked to 5ghz is still slower than a stock 12600k in games, so i will assume a 4ghz 12600k will still be faster than a 4ghz 12400...)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in benchmarks i saw 12600 did beat the 12400 + i think having the extra 4 e cores might help while streaming,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
remember the 12600 is a very different cpu than the 12600k.,"unless you buy a cream-of-the-crop h610 board known to have a good vrm, a chip like the 12600k is going to be starved of power and you wonâ€™t really see the improved performance.","frankly, there are plenty of b660â€™s that canâ€™t fully power a 12600k.",when you get a k-level chip you need something relatively beefy to sustain its power needs.,"most z690 motherboards had ridiculously overpowered vrms, but thatâ€™s all changed with the lower chipset boards.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if steaming is important to you i would have mentioned that in the first place.,"that said, i'm not sure how many folks still use cpu encoding.",quicksync or nvenc is much more efficient these days.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i meant the 12600kf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, i agree if you're not really particular on how good cpu encoding is, qsv, nvenc and vcn serves fine though vcn encoding quality is abysmal on low bitrate.","considering e cores are within skylake performance, if you can assign encoding job to some of them and leave some breathing room to os, it isn't a bad idea",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah you're prob only maxing out your gpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rdr2 is a gpu intensive game less on thr cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
use hwinfo.,also check cpu load.,rdr2 likely maxing gpu with cpu not even 50% load.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
package power 73w?,yeah totally normal.,games aren't heavy on cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i get about 50c on a 360, but im in a hot room.",this chip doesnâ€™t run nearly as hot as everyone was screaming about.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this data isn't correct.,look at your minimums in a few cores they are at 0 c unless you are running a phase change unit this ain't happening.,so my guess is the software is reading the temps wrong.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
go run battlefield  1 or 5 or instal shaders for war zone / mw 2019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as mentioned, the 0 degree thing is just a bug on 11th and 12th gen chips.",really not sure why they havenâ€™t done software/firmware fix for it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes since the game wont use all 16 cores let alone 4-5cores.,i'm on 12th gen and i sit around this temp,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yea, look at the usage.... it's not even peak clocking 45%, most of the cores are much lower.... so yea thats normal, the gpu has bottlenecked and the cpu is coasting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cores at 0â°c were shut off due to c-states.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a 12900k with these settings is basically idling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's totally normal, rdr2 is heavy on the gpu side, i haven't seen my 12900k going over 60c on 1440p 240fps gaming with a ryujin ii 360mm",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
youâ€™re probably maxing out your gpu.,not sure why youâ€™re worried about low temperatures though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
run cinebench with stock voltages and it gets hot.,granted my issue was mainly restricted airflow due to the glass front of my case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah that's why i was worried.,the thing is that i'm not getting very high fps in red dead 2. i even did a rma with my 3090 because i thought the graphics card was the problem but i'm still getting low fps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
unfortunately this is actually a temp sensor glitch within windows on newer gen chips.,"my 12900kf does the same thing, around every 30 seconds one of the cores reports a zero degree temp for like a second.",i hope this helps you kind of understand what's going on there.,it obviously can't update away from zero once it happens because everything else is higher than zero (higher than the current minimum reported),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because i was getting much higher temperatures with my 10700k and i kept hearing about the 12900k running really hot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"right, i do hear that, but i dont see the need to run it under any unnecessary bench when i currently just game/stream.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends what you define as low fps.,what rez and quality setting are you using.,cos if you are going off benchmarking tool in the game on max settings and ray tracing on max everything.... even 45fps is decent on a 3090 on the snow scene.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how is the ram performing?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my 11700f on a hp prebuilt h570 board does it too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm playing at 3440x1440p (i have a ultrawide monitor with a ratio of 21:9) and i get lower fps than people who play the game at 4k (i've seen benchmarks on youtube and i get lower fps with the exact same settings).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have 2x16 gb ddr5 6000mhz cl40 ram and an asus z690 rog hero maximus.,my games crash whenever i turn on xmp so i'm forced to run the sticks at their base frequency which is 4800mhz.,"i've tried updating my bios, but that didn't fix the issue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think it happens only on 11th and 12th gen chips.,that's if i remember correctly from when i looked it up anyway.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">and i get lower fps

don't use relative terms, those are meaningless to us, we need numbers to be able to help you

also are you using dlss?",windows 10 or 11?,what location in the game are you getting low fps at?,screenshots of the settings you're using could also help,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why pay the extra at all, even with the memory bandwidth differences...it can't be much faster at all in real life workloads, for the extreme price difference.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok well first off your using an amd 3950x for comparison so the numbers will always be different to some degree.,plus i'm familiar with that channel and he always heavily tunes and overclocks his systems.,"and i noticed the game is indeed running about 30 fps lower in my setups over a year period apart or so, due to system hardware updates on mobo/cpu side.","both tests were on my 3090 however,  one of said updates was ray traced shading and cloud rays for global illumination lighting being added to the game which is very heavy hitting and wasnt in the game at the time of the video you linked, and the same goes for dlss and various upgrades to that and the vulkan renderer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hmm if we compare this ddr5 6000 cl40 to ddr4 3600 cl18 let's see.,the former is running at a clock speed of 3000mhz with a cl of 40 clock cycles.,at 3000mhz thats 1 cycle every 0.33ns.,40 clock cycles is 13.3ns.,the latter has a 1800 mhz clock speed with cl of 18. comes out to 10ns.,you are spot on with 33%.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"so the main ""physical difference"" then between vsync on / limiting fps and off / no limit is going to be how much heat the gpu produces..  if the fps is limited, the gpu isn't running at 100%.. so less heat (and usually a lot less heat since even a 10% downclock also means voltage drops a bit..) 

what's the cooling situation in your case?",have you tried raising or lowering power limits on the graphics cards to see if it helps?,"you could also monitor the temperature of your gpu during stutter and non stutter scenarios (gpu-z,  msi afterburner, etc) and see if you find anything common there.",good luck.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

uncapped and no vsync - is that still limited to 144 via gsync or unlimited fps ?,"if the latter then it's pushing your cpu as hard as it can in that config..

[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and you've verified with software it's running at x16?,"gsync on should limit fps eventually - if you're vsync off, and gsync off, and seeing gpu utilization of only 60% then something else is limiting the gpu from hitting 100% and could be causing other issues.","this could be cpu (though 12700kf is really strong), could be software, could be not enough pcie bandwidth..  just thinking out loud.",other than that i'd look very closely at your software stack and/or accessories plugged into the pc -- something clobbering usb ports could be causing the cpu to pause in some scenarios.,i.e.,"a high refresh rate mouse (1000 hz rate) can cause stuttering or lag..  or some older controllers do weird things..

wait.,are you using wifi (wireless) or wired ethernet?,?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wow could be a ton of things

first thing i would check is speed when connected via ethernet, direct from the modem is possible.",then check speed from ethernet connected to the router.,that will give you the â€œbestâ€ speed you could possibly get as well as seeing if there is some problem with the router.,what adapters are being used?,what router?,what frequency?,how much â€œinterferenceâ€ is there between the router and device?,can you get faster speeds when you near the router?,are you in a house or close area where other wi-fi is and maybe need to select a different channel?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you could check if the router sits in a closed place...that could also affect the signal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no worries.,do you have a pc you can connect via ethernet cable to the router and see what speed you getting?,that would be the fastest speed you could get.,wifi will be slower then that but wanted to see if you have another issue outside of wifi.,are you in an apartment or similar close proximity with others and see their access points when you look for a wifi signal?,"something to try is to delete the wifi connection, power cycle the router, and then reconnect and see if something pops back in.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

for motherboards it depends on whether you want great or overkill.,in general though it appears that asus and msi produce the better boards overall for a z690 chipset.,more specifically the best for msi is roughly the meg line followed by the mpg and then the mag line.,with meg being the flagship and about the best build quality.,plus if youâ€™re in the us they generally have the best customer service and warranty.,for asus a similar type of quality levels are found with them.,"with rog being the top, then rog strix, then tuf and prime being roughly equal.","asus also has decent support and warranty, at least in comparison to gigabyte.","but overall the mid range and above do rather well, especially since some boards in a line are ddr5, which still isnâ€™t worth it just yet.","fans i canâ€™t necessarily comment on, but thatâ€™s more of a case issue too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if you need to consider an under volt to reduce temperatures it is likely you need to review your cooler set up.,if your cooler is efficient you can use an ai overclock to get the best from your chip.,when temperatures are under control the power consumption will take care of itself.,attempting to under volt to control temperatures is not addressing the underlying issue.,good luck.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can overclock and undervolt at the same time.,in fact it's the only reasonable way to overclock the 12900k without hitting 300w+.,the stock voltages are very conservative.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
under what conditions would the cpu draw 300 watts?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ryzen will be better this year, trust me.",it's obvious just from looking at manufacturing process already.,intel will be on their 7nm and amd on tsmc 5nm which is 80% more dense than intel 7nm and efficient.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

how are you cooling the vrms?",back or top of the case?,any air flow is probably going to be good enough.,depends on the motherboard.,not all h610 are the same.,going to have to look at reviews.,and there probably aren't a  lot of reviews.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"option 2 definitely, that gpu is better and the faster memory is gonna help a lot, option 2 with no hesitation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"option 2 way better

pros
faster ram
better gpu
a no so good cpu isn't much of a difference with a gpu like that

cons
wayyy slower ram
less cores
not the best gpu

same clock speeds",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
option 1 cpu is about 40-50% faster in multithread and a bit faster in single thread.,option 2 gpu is a about 3x faster.,https://www.notebookcheck.net/graphics-card-comparison-head-2-head.247598.0.html .,though at  the bottom of the games performance the mx150 does offer 60.5fps at 1920x1080 ultra settings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no chance for option 1, pick the second for sure.",wonâ€™t regret about it ^^,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
besides the lower performance due to power restrictions it should run decently.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a note, for extremely low power limits underclocking a bit should increase efficiency in multi core workloads.","because the turbo algorithm will pump up your voltage, even if you can't reach turbo clock speeds.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cool.,just wasn't sure if intel locked down on that kind of thing or if dropping that much power caused issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nothing in depth - but as basic idea, neither thread will have more or less performance.","you've got x number of pipelines (lets assume they're all the same for this thought experiment and we've got 4 pipelines per core) per core - a single thread could depending on the workload use as little as one pipeline, or up to all of them.","if processx is running a thread that's doing 2 equations at the same time, it'll probably be using half the cpu, leaving the other half either idle or with smt, free for use by some other process.","if processx is running a thread that's doing 4 equations, now you've used the whole core, so there is nothing 'free' for other threads, that won't stop things needing to run on that logical thread though, so now you've got slice up the time between two threads (this is where smt can get ugly, since this time slicing over 2 threads can end up worse than slicing it over a single thread)

in reality you've got more than 4 pipelines, but they're not all the same, some only do integer add, some do avx - but the genral idea is you've got a bunch of different work pipelines and they get shared across x threads, if you saturate it, it'll about as well as any other system, maybe a little worse - opposite if underutilised.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">very academic question, but i've been struggling to get a proper handle on the real world performance of hyperthreading.",lots of books on computer arch.,grab one that looks interesting off amazon.,>i'm also interested if there's a significant difference between hyperthreading on say i7 vs xeon cores as well.,there is no way to answer this since most intel cores are sold as both i7s and as xeons.,you need to pick specific cores to compare.,">for example, the xeon phil cores support up to 4 threads per physical core so there must be some architectural changes to improve performance.","the phi processors were a gpu -like arch composed of an array of simple, partially in order (depending on which specific phi) cores.","since individual cores had limited ability to schedule around stalls, they use hyperthreading to switch threads whenever one stalls, similar to a gpu.",having 4 means that 3 stalls can be threaded around without stopping execution.,"this is actually pretty tame by gpu standards, where dozens or hundreds of threads might be running concurrently on the same execution units.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
take this example.,1 core.,1 thread.,the thread gets 100% performance of 1 core.,1 core.,2 threads.,"each thread shares the core (nominally, each gets 50%, but irl they tend to get 60 to 65% each, adding up to 115 to 130% total performance of the single thread)

2 threads may benchmark a total of 1200 pts, but only be 600pts each.",how it works internally is basically slotting extra instruction calls into the lulls and empty periods per tick.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
xeon phi is a completely different line of processors compared to xeon and core.,xeon phi was designed with highly parallel processing in mind.,similar to what gpus do except they made it use x86 cores.,"comparing xeon to core, sometimes intel uses the same core design in those cpus.",for example alder lake's [golden cove](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/golden_cove) cores are being both used in alder lake and the xeon sapphire rapids.,another reason why alder lake's p cores supported avx-512 on launch.,that's used in the xeon line up.,benchmarks are a great way to see hyper threading performance in action; comparing a 4 core 4 thread cpu to a similar 4 core 8 thread cpu such as 6600k vs 6700k.,i private messaged you some benchmarks that display that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thanks for the reply.,so that number - essentially 30-50% is what iâ€™ve always used as a rule of thumb but never really been able to substantiate.,i also know that some code performs far closer to 100%.,was just curious if there was any better guidance out there for standard enterprise like software with modern xeons - whatâ€™s the rule of thumb these days.,tween 30-100%?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

for now it's fine.,plus it'll help cool the board.,but the cpu temps are more important than the board.,"also depends if you're running the cpu with the 65w power limit in place, or if you remove it, and let it turbo the whole time.","some boards i think enforce the power limit, and others ask if you want to run at max performance all the time when you first start up the system i hear.",the stock cooler has no problem running with a 65w load.,"if you raise power limit it might get too hot, and throttle itself down.","any kind of tower cooler for like $20 capable of handling at at least 100w should be fine when you can upgrade, if ever.","and i think for gaming you hardly gain much for removing the power limit anyways, if you do decide to stick to stock cooler.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hmm.,"your cpu idle fan speed is pretty low, which is normally okay, but more at rpms appropriate for 140mm vs 120mm fans.","especially since at 40-50 degrees, you should already be well into the fan curve.",i would probably get that up to 500-600rpm.,on the other hand your case fans are quite high and donâ€™t seem to have much range.,are they hooked up to motherboard headers?,you should be able to reduce noise by getting them down below 600rpm on idle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i can post my fan curves tomorrow and check the cpu ones.,i think the msi default profile thinks that the cooler is a liquid one.,yeah the system fans are pmw and connected to the mobo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"done some screenshot to the bios: fan profiles, cpu settings

i would bump your lowest cpu fan duty up to 25 or 30%.,"something to give more around 500-600 rpm, but you can experiment to see whatâ€™s still inaudible.",this will help your idle temps.,"also, i wouldnâ€™t tie your case fans into system temperature, as that does not actually change that much - as shown by the almost non-change of those fans during your benchmarks (and check the last screenshot showing your current temp and how far off it is from the curve).","certainly youâ€™re never going to see a 50c or higher system temp, making that whole curve useless.","i would tie it into cpu, and lower pretty much everything to more mirror the cpu curve.",personally i like the case fans to lag a bit behind the cpu fan in temp thresholds so they only start working audibly when they need to and donâ€™t ramp as much.,"my asus came with very different curves, but i spent a while tweaking.","in my case most of the curves start at 13-20% duty at 20c, and get up to 100% in the 80-90c range.",sometimes my case fans are around 300 rpms but itâ€™s still holding 30c idle temps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks, i'm giving it a try, 20% for the lowest on the curve (39â°c atm) and adjusted the system fan the same...now i can't hear them lol

works fine for me on the same drivers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you tried the official intel drivers?,"i've got a i219, but the drivers are 12.19.1.37. it might just be a bad cable though.",https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/15084/intel-ethernet-adapter-complete-driver-pack.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because it's usually not a $10 difference.,"if it's only $10, absolutely buy the regular non-f sku.",msrp is usually a $20-$30 difference and that can be a large chunk of money.,"for example the 12100f has a $97 msrp, while the 12100 has a $122 msrp.","however msrp doesn't always reflect reality, as often the more common, higher prices skus go on sale while the cheapest ones don't.",for example you're more likely to see a 12700k get a sale than a 12700f.,"anyways, even at $30 it's not a bad deal considering you can't even buy a low end gpu for video out that is capable of 3d graphics for under like $100 these days.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in the intel world, thereâ€™s almost no reason to.","except when the difference is more than $10, or when you simply canâ€™t find a non-f cpu in stock at the moment youâ€™re buying.","but all things considered, itâ€™s just a nice-to-have backup.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i will never buy a cpu without an igpu.,i've had gpus die on me before and generally don't have a spare sitting around so i can still use my pc while waiting for warranty/replacement because i do more than just play games on it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when i got my 12700kf it was on special and $100 less than the k model.,i agree if it's 20-50$ it's not worth it.,"but that $100 was another ssd drive, or better ram, or whatever i could spend elsewhere",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its there just in case if something happens to the discrete gpu or else you just dont have the need for a discrete gpu and just want to do the basic tasks like surfing and stuff,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in my country people usually buy those f processor because people try to save every peny (argentina), but i think is a no brainer, having a backup gpu for 10 bucks or so, even more right now, a time where gpu prices are very errã¡tic, because of that i made a huge difference selling my gpu, and also i'm a grown up, so any time i want i sell the gpu and focus on other stuff.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
f cpu are those that didn't pass igpu test that's why they exist to make moar money.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because it's not a 10$ difference everywhere in the world.,"here in my country, it's closer to 40$ between 12700f and 12700.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

>is it literally just a $10 off option?",yes.,"it will change with meteor lake, where the igpu is on another die, build by tsmc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the reasoning behind an f model is: why pay for something you don't use.,that's all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for the 1x900k its an easy reason to get an f over a k - as soon as they announce they will make a ks shortly after the launch they start hoarding all the good k skew silicon for their greedy ks product line.,"usually  shortly after the initial launch if they have a ks planned, which they seem to do for most of the resent lines, all the k cpus will be bottom bucket silicon quality.","humorous it's such a scumbag thing to do, you think you're paying top dollar for premo silicone quality but end up getting the intel shaft instead.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

right now in my country 10700f has 70 usd price difference in compared to the 10700. for me that's a pretty good chunk of a budget considering with it i can bump my mobo to something way better.,let alone the 10700kf vs 10700k has a price difference of 110 usd.,that's quite a good chunk of money saved not to mention the f goes on sale quite a lot.,even low-range cpu the i3 10100 vs 10100f is a 40 usd difference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the f cpus are a fair bit cheaper here.,i can see the value of wanting the igpu for troubleshooting but i've also been using a ryzen 2600 for four years now and haven't felt the need for an igpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

both of those are thermal throttling.,on stock settings with the z63 i was getting \~25-27k (if memory serves me right).,oc'ed i was getting 27-29k.,"i can't remember the stock temperatures as i left it oc'd for so long, but even with my aggressive settings it was never passing 90c.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

doesn't that cpu voltage seem quite low for those kinds of temps?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
any chance tightening it before going full remount is worthwhile?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what are your pcore and ecore settings?,do you have the equivalent of boost 3.0 or mce or are you forcing fixed speeds and voltage?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seems like stock voltage.,"like i said, it's not an issue with the cpu.",it's likely an issue with the cpu cooler being mounted incorrectly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it depends on the issue.,"there's a chance that it's just the thumbscrews that aren't tightened enough, in which case tightening may fix the issue.","in the case of my friend's build, the backplate was loose which was causing poor contact and thus thermal throttling.",i'd recommend a full remount from the get-go as you'll address all possible mounting issues right away.,but you could try just tightening it and see if that helps!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so i just checked the thumbscrews and 3 of the 4 were quite tight.,"those 3 i got a smidge more pressure (didn't go hog wild cranking, just super snug), and the 4th was actually looser than i would have expected.",probably got a quarter+ turn on it and snugged it up.,however temps still seem to be the same.,"same 4 pcores running hot, p1, p3, p5, and p7.","interestingly, the remaining pcores all run in good temps 78-84",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other aspect i've read is the asus bios settings (even defaults) are too voltage high and boosting can push the cpu to high temps.,although i find that curious on only some of the pcores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"about what we expected, just a few extra percent in most cases.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah i think that's fair.,for me it was battlefield v not quite being able to achieve 60 fps on a \~ 4.7 ghz 2600k that finally pushed me to upgrade (to 8700k).,"a 1080ti wasn't fully used by that 2600k... which means any modern \~3060 or higher would also be ""waiting"" on the 2600k.",vr games of course need more cpu too for 90-120 fps.,though i'd say a 2600k is still quite usable for a lot of scenarios..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

did you reuse your old memory and are you happy with the upgrade?,ive got an 8700k and im probably upgrading soon.,just not sure if itll be a 12700k or a 13700k and whether ill move to ddr5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
super lucky.,"i upgraded from a 3770k to a 7700k in february 2017. around 6 months later, the 8700k came to market for the same freaking price only with 2 additional cores and would have been a much better upgrade.",i've been holding off from upgrading ever since and i'll continue to do so just out of spite.,frankly things are still running fine for me so it's not difficult but man am i mad at how that year went.,at least i made out like a bandit with the 1080 ti.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i literally just made a very similar upgrade yesterday.,8700kâ€”>12700.,hard to believe itâ€™s been 4 years since i got my 8700k.,i too ran it at 4.8 ghz oc.,i did the upgrade mostly for 1% low boost as i game in 4k so cpu isnâ€™t really the limiting problem.,"needless to say despite the upgrade including a bit faster ram, larger psu, and unlocked 980 pro nvme 4.0 speed, benchmarks are only barely better.",games seem smoother though (probably placebo admittedly).,"iâ€™m tempted to test the bundled cooler with a maxed out power delivery, but reviews so donâ€™t bother as the power boosts you get when needed are just as good.","iâ€™ll keep the 8700k going by pairing it with my 1080 ti build (used for racing games) which means itâ€™s time to finally retire my 3770k, which still kicked butt at 1440p (despite being 10 years old!!)",except with a few outliers.,hope to find it a good home.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hey!,i had that exact same i7-8700k cpu/mobo combo and i upgraded to the i7-12700k + msi z690-a pro!,i had basically the exact same progression!,enjoy the new system!,!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just demoted my 8700k to a full-time simracing rig, where it continues to shine.",such a great chip!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice upgrade.,i'll be rocking my 8700k @ 5ghz for a while longer.,probably once ddr5 becomes cheaper.,so likely a few years from now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
their new box art looks worse,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is a solid step up right there.,i would probably select a 12700k today if i was still in the market for a processor.,check in with u/wezre if you need to line up a buyer for your 8700k.,u/wezre just landed an awesome brand new [3060 ti that would benefit from the 8700k if you donâ€™t already have plans for your cpu.,](https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/tusumo/over_a_year_on_the_evga_waitlist_but_finally_got/),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i prefer intel core i5 12400f,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"personally i dont see much sense with this upgrade, unless you used for something that is very single cpu threaded, 8700k is still fine especially if you combine it with good ram and decent oc.",now for 7700k users or older it would be great upgrade as 4c/8t gets overwhelmed in a lot of games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

sometimes it's always best to keep the hd graphics and avoid f skus.,you will need the encoders from the internal graphics (more than gpu at times) to properly encode/decode and run instructions for multimedia/design like photoshop.,"if this will be nothing but a pure gaming pc, then you better pray that you won't need those instructions/encoders from the igpu when you start editing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yes, i'm still on ddr4, ddr5 prices are ridiculous in my country.",i'll probably use this system for 3-4 years just like 8700k then ddr5 will be mature enough to switch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
raptor lake will be the last cpu built entirely on intel silicon.,next ones will be tile based and have some tsmc tiles.,i suggest going with a 13700k ddr5 if that's something that's important to you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was in the same boat.,went from 8700k to 12700k ddr5.,"the 12700k is easily worth it, the ddr5, not so much for me.",the ddr5 premium is not worth it yet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you want maximum performance go this year for zen4 with ddr5, it's gonna be the fastest and most efficient.",if you want high performance but not too expensive then i7 13700k and ddr4 with z690 motherboard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, i feel you while 7700k was a great cpu 8700k coming so close to its launch with a similar price kinda sucked.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there are a couple of reasons but mainly it's a financial choice.,"i don't live in a â‚¬/$ zone so here in my country prices aren't all that stable, i found these guys at their lowest price since their launch on top of that i got a good offer for my 8700k/z370 combo.","for the performance, i have an rtx 3070 and i game on a 4k tv & 1440p monitor so 8700k @ 4.8ghz daily was still enough but for the competitive games like modern warfare / battlefield that extra 10-15 fps is towards 144hz was a decent performance uplift also my %1 and %0.1 lows are also improved.",another small factor was that while my 8700k had a decent chip (1.24 for 4.8 without avx offset) it really needed to be delided which i was kinda afraid of doing.,at load it was hitting 80c in the same scenario 12700f runs about 20c cooler in pl2 mode.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"frrr, can't wait for a all corsair built xd",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it will since it's compatible with z690.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ive heard it will but im not 100% sure on that.,if ddr5 production and supply ramp up it will be a moot point anyways.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it will 100% support ddr4 although z790 motherboards might all be ddr5 but that shouldn't matter too much since z690 will be compatible with 13th gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes and you can put it in the same motherboard as 12th gen anyways.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that's only true under a very restricted price / performance view of the world though.,i would argue we should judge things by more than just that.,"(though in this specific case, the logic does applies anyway)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i can't think of any tech products that it really applies to.,the fx5200 maybe (where it was slower than software rendering).,"tn based displays, maybe (good arguments for their usefulness in cost savings for office deployments)

set single core turbo to around 4.5ghz, all core to somewhere around 3.6-4.0ghz.","it should be a realistic limit of the motherboard's cpu power module, while the lowered single core turbo keeps idle/light load temperatures low (not really needed though).",you may be able to go over 4.0 for a 10700.,"*it will only put you at similar multithreaded performance of a 12400 though, while using more power.",*,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

looks great to me.,did you disable e cores?,"from what i've heard they don't bin them at all, so overcloaking them could be huge for certain applications (not for gaming tho).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nope, running discord and such on them.","the only voltage setting i know how to use is override, would the other options be better for temps?",i hear my fan spool up on chrome.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes if you mod the cooler to actually fit, so no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, probably 720 low settings",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"lmfao, 1.385vcore and you wonder why it's thermal throttling?",that's literally like 350w.,never trust the motherboard with setting voltages for a substantial overclock.,in bios set 1.35v adaptive voltage with llc4 that should easily do 5.2 on the worst cpus.,from there you can set it downward.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don't do auto vcore.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most likely bad mounting of cpu waterblock,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which test?,"if it's p95, it's normal",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's definitely not the vcore when under an all-core load.,it's the maximum vcore which probable occurred when the system was idle/only boosting a single core.,can you report back when the the vcore when under an all-core load like cinebench multi as well as the maximum power draw.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
really think dropping the vcore .03 would really make that much of a difference?,i know thatâ€™s a high vcore.,for the most part itâ€™s on default.,just figured my cooling setup should handle it?,really just trying to troubleshoot.,again i have a decent cooling setup.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
alright i did some more playing around.,that is not the max vcore draw.,"not sure why that was showing, probably the vcore draw from the throttling.",the default vcore draw was 1.5. i can see temps hitting super high with that vcore.,the power draw was a lot more than last night too.,last night it was showing 290w.,this time it was showing 380w.,"again my concern was the super high temps with the 1.385. i took pictures, wonâ€™t let me post them though?",[screenshots](https://imgur.com/a/itmtr77),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're vid is literally 150mv too high.,it's the difference between your chip dieing in 2 years vs 8+.,you could be running an air conditioner on that cpu and it still would be in the 60s.,"400w+ is way too high for 5.2.
edit: just noticed your system agent voltage is 1.35.. are you trying to kill your cpu as fast as possible?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
vid =/ vcore they are entirely different.,use cpu-z to view vcore.,that's entirely too much voltage regardless.,you're so lucky there is temperature and voltage protection.,default v-core is not default when you set a fat overclock.,that frequency doesn't exist on the cpus voltage curve and it is interpolating the value.,"you are drawing more power than ln2 overclockers, and will degrade your chip if you don't fix it(that amount of current + high temps is really really really bad.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah 380w is obscene.,are you on stock settings?,maybe your motherboard tried to apply an overclock.,there's no lga 1700 water block on the planet that can cope with a sustained 380w.,"i'd try to reset to stock and make sure there's no ""ai overclock"" applied by the mb then tweak from there.",you may also want to set your pl1/pl2 to something reasonable like 230w or whatever your block can deal with (i've heard good things about the new ek you're using).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the whole system is basically on default.,"all i did was sync all the cores to 5.2 instead of 5.2, 5.1, 5.0, and 4.9. i knew something was wrong.",why i came here.,iâ€™ve never had this type of issue with any of my other chips iâ€™ve owned.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
again itâ€™s all what the system set it to.,more like intel is trying to kill their chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™ll look more into everything tomorrow.,the system is on default.,all i did was sync the p cores to 5.2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no shit, if you have it on auto vcore and you set all core to 5.2 its going to set a voltage that can handle 5.2 all core.",either set it back to a default multiplier or have your chip die in like a year.,if you really want to overclock your cpu for your p-cores to hit 5.2 then look up a guide on overclocking the 12900k.,edit: just realized someone said something similar before me.,but you should never have auto vcore and set your multiplier to 5.2ghz especially on a chip that already pulls 200w+ default.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh there's your problem.,5.2ghz all-core is an extreme overclock requiring high voltages.,you should leave it on stock or set the multiplier depending on the number of cores.,e.g.,5.3ghz for 1-core and 5.0ghz for 8-core boost.,5.2ghz all-core is achievable on custom loop but you should do a lot of research first.,you'll probably want to adjust your voltage curves as the stock curves are quite aggressive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
msi pro z690-a is a entry level z690 but is very well build and you probably won't have any problems with it.,i'm in the process of building a new pc myself and decided to go with msi pro z690-a too.,you can google some reddit reviews about this mobo and you'll hear mostly positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it needs to be the right board.,"the msi pro b660m-a is the best midrange board currently, and the only one below $150 capable of running the 12700/12700k at their full stock performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it depends on the board.,a good b660 board can easily beat a poorly build z690.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jze\_vc4i3wk,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, it depends on what you want to do with the 12700k, with a z690 board you can undervolt and get more performance, running the chip up to 10-20c cooler vs stock while get 5-15% more performance.",essentially touching the 12900k's gaming performance.,"with a b660 board, you can only unlock the power limit, making the chip run hotter for full stock performance.","still the difference is small enough unless you are talking about the same price for z690 vs b660, then you should pick z690 and tune the cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"are you getting the 12700k, too?",i have that chip and wondering about the msi pro z690-a - i haven't bought the motherboard yet.,"but, other boards are a lot more except for gigabyte boards (e.g.","gaming x, ud ax) and i'm reluctant to go with gigabyte.","those gigabyte boards supposedly have a better vrm but in benchmarks, the temps seem to be more?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am thinking about getting an asus tuf gaming b660-plus.,this board that you mentioned isn't avaiable in my region yet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it literally can't by design.,all current z-690 boards can run the 12700k at stock which is the b660s max frequency.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
those numbers are highly optimistic although undervolting is an option you should have just bought a decent cpu-cooler.,--most 12700ks can run 5.1-5.2 on all p-cores with a decent aio.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m planning to go with 12600k and iâ€™m sure this msi board will easily handle it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lemme check that one out.,"edit: canâ€™t find that one, but the tuf b660m-plus seems alright.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how much is the price difference and what is your current cpu cooler.,if your cooler is bad (any air cooler below a noctua-nhd15 or aio below 240mm) you might as well get the b660.,getting a z690 to undervolt is a meme when you could have spent that money on a proper cpu cooler(depending on how much more a z690 motherboard is) and ran stock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, he is right.",not all z690 can run a 12700 completely unlocked without throttling.,"most z690 will, but there are a few exceptions which are clearly underbuilt and will throttle with the i7 (even the non -k), for example the z690 phantom gaming 4: [https://youtu.be/ydgn4w97esk?t=1330](https://youtu.be/ydgn4w97esk?t=1330)

and i haven't seen tests, but i'm willing to bet that the gigabyte z690m ds3h is on the same boat.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what u mean bro i have 12400f and a gigabyte b660m mobo cantyi undervolt my cpu if temps are high,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i totally agree.,it will be absolutely fine with that cpu.,lots of people have that combo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's the same board but a little bit taller,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">(any air cooler below a noctua-nhd15 or aio below 240mm

nah, there are plenty of air coolers that are able to cool 200+w.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
op never mentioned buying an asrock motherboard.,"that is literally the sketchiest motherboard you could buy for z690, and is a cherry picked example.",that b660m motherboard also costs more than the asrock motherboard.,"op mentioned buying a asus tuf b660m which costs the same as this asrock z690 board(179.99), and has the same phase count(under the same conditions they would probably perform similar).",the mag is a 12 phase and is a top-end b660 board(while it has a decent vrm it cannot go above stock lol) it still is worse value than a asrock phantom 4 because you don't have the option to undervolt if you want only stock.,"(i still would just get a reg z690 mobo though) 
  
tldr: the most expensive b660 mobos are generally worse than entry z690 mobos at worse prices and you shouldn't pair them with a k-sku.","you'd get a better vrm, oc support, etc with a standard z690 for like 40$ more(asus prime-p, or msi pro-a).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the nh-d-15 from what i've seen can barely handle the 12700k or 12900k stock (temps in the 80's) it's doable but i have no idea why you'd get a noctua-nhd15 when they cost the same as an arctic 360 aio.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i prefer air coolers on my builds: simpler, most of the time as capable, never breaks.","there is a current craze for aios, but for most use cases they are not better.",i am running my current 5950x with scythe fuma 2 with pbo on.,it runs it at around 200w power usage.,"if it works with an air cooler, then that is it for me.",i am already pushing it quite a bit up on the efficiency curve and the diminishing returns for added power usage are real even at this point.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thanks!,"i do know that, however, 2.3v seems way too high for a chip of that era, i need to double check",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes that's correct but i just ran an old pentium 4 on socket 775 it's is was drawing 1.35 volt not 2.4

yes core 2 duos are more powerful but then you can raise current right - not crank the voltage because that's bad for other stuff like the mosfets - they could overheat",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's the crappy hp motherboard, not me!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ahh hahah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
figured i'd update this.,i ended up redoing the thermal paste on the cpu and reseating my cooler and making sure that pressure was evenly applied.,i also as mentioned before brought the voltage down quite a bit and verified stability.,"after these things i averaged 65c well benching and a high of 75 to 80

gaming generally sits anywhere from 40 to upper 50s on intense moments.",so overall an improvement.,"&#x200b;

when applying thermal paste i was a bit more liberal than last time being sure to make more of a large oval, almost a line to account for the 12900k longer length.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
voltage?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that is too high of a temp, if it reaches 100 in 3dmark then you canâ€™t actually do much without thermal problems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1.510; i just applied a -0.050 offset and that seems stable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i changed the fan mode to msi smart fan thing and that seems to have taken the temp down quiet a bit- it now averages 80c and a max of 95c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's way too much voltage to run all core.,my 12900k runs 5.2ghz@1.27v max load.,"unless you are running a custom loop or you have a very good chip, 5.2ghz might not be possible at reasonable volts and temps.",you could also try using the v/f curve offset instead of legacy offset,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for 3dmark that is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
alright i'll tone the voltage down a ton,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it will be compatible with 12th gen motherboards but will have new dedicated boards as well.,so far the only known changes will be increased pcie gen 4 lanes and improved ddr5 mem controllers.,could be more additions later but we don't know.,the 1700 socket has 100 unused pins (1800 total) that could be used in the new chipset for various reasons.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
okay.,"well, a 12100 would offer about the same multithreaded performance and much better single threaded.","but since your old cpu was 6 core, i woild likely suggest the 12600k as a good jumping-in point for huge performance gains.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the i7-1165g7 is a four core tiger lake cpu.,the i5-1240p has four performance cores plus those eight efficiency cores.,so you expect the extra mt performance as this cb20 benchmark shows.,"what is interesting to me, is the power the i5-1240p uses.",i can't wait to see alder lake inside surface pro tablets.,i'm hoping for a generous helping of efficiency cores that will aid multithreaded apps without sapping too much power.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i didn't think the 212 would be enough, but i'm glad i double checked.",thanks for the deepcool ak620 recommendation.,i wouldn't have known that and it's almost half the price of the noctua so i'll definitely do that if i go with air cooling.,do you have an opinion on air cooling vs aio?,i think i'm just being paranoid about the liquid cooling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oops,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
liquid cooling is more effective.,thereâ€™s no denying that.,"but, i personally, still prefer air cooling and am running a d15 with my 12900k.","reason for that is long-term reliability: my system will be on 24x7 for the next 5-6 years, and iâ€™ve never had an air cooler fail.","even if both fans fail, you still got a big honking heatsink.","an aioâ€™s potential points of failure are fan failure, pump failure, liquid evaporation, or outright liquid leak.","sure, you can find plenty of people who have been running an aio for many years without issue.","but you can also find a lot more reports of issues after much shorter periods of time, then you can air cooler outright failures.","now, for the average person not running their system constantly or who plans to replace it all in a couple years, it really probably doesnâ€™t make any difference.",so which is better depends on your specific needs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
running mine with a 420mm aio... as my 360 couldn't cope that well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in general, all aios from the major manufacturers use the same pump design from ek (iirc).",these pumps are rated for 100% usage for 7 years.,"since there's water, there is always risk involved from a leak.",all the big aio manufacturers generally cover parts lost in a leak but you better be well-documented in that regard.,performance is more or less similar with aios having an edge and any discrepancies can be solved simply by having good airflow.,so what does this come down to?,"if you're okay with the risk - remember they are rated for 7 years - and capable of being well-documented in case shit hits the fan, water is perfectly fine.","otherwise, go air as there's no ""risk"" relative to water.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that makes a lot of sense.,based on what you said i'm probably going to do air cooling.,however i still want to see if there is a cheaper alternative to the d15.,another comment recommended the deepcool ak620 which is almost half the price for example.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
front or top mounted?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what case and r23 temps?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sorry, no personal experience there.",i tend to swear by noctua these days.,"but, reviews of the ak620 seem quite promising.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"top, naturally",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for your input!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i prefer top too but it seems front is better for cpu temps and si ce the new ones are so hot.. though i'm not sure whether many cases even allow 420mm in the front!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
?,"there is zero evidence that would make front mounting lower temps, my radiator fluid doesnt even go over 37c at max load (it's about 30c idle).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there have definitely been tests that show this, you can find them in youtube.",think about it - front mounted means cool air is being pulled over the radiator.,top mounted it's air that has already been heated up by the gpu etc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so warming the intake and making gpu run hot, nah, cooler gpu is way more important",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah of course it makes the gpu hotter.,it's a trade off.,depends what you want to be cooler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

do you have a gtx 1080.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i can confirm this.,had 1070 since 2017 and i still get away with high/ultra at 1080pâ€¦canâ€™t imagine what a 1080 can get away with,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is a good card for 1080/1440p but mines always pinned at 100% in games so the temperatures arent as good as before when i had a cpu bottleneck,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 980ti itâ€™s still very good for 1080p also, i can play cyberpunk or others very intensive games at 60 fps in high",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
true.,then again i did go from a 4 core non overclockable chip to a 10 core overclockable chip.,the stutter is what bothers me most.,might have to get the 40 series cards when they get announced.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gotta say i did a double take on this one.,you mean in the sense of actually replacing the card and not trying to buy a decently priced one i recon right?,"&#x200b;

where im at gpu:s are still crazy priced while cpu:s arent so bad.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well one of your components will be working at 100%.,the other wont because it's faster than the other.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there will always be a bottleneck.,very rare to get both hitting constant  100% while gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

apply thermal paste into your graphics card,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
better frame consistency.,better everything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can always lower graphics settings and use post-processing graphic methods (e.g.,smaa instead of msaa) to maintain steady framerates on an underpowered gpu.,and upgrading just requires replacing the pcie card.,"it's much harder to reduce cpu usage, and upgrading cpus might not be straightforward.","one of my friends had an i3-7350k, and the 7700k cpus back in 2019-2020 were hitting over $300 on ebay.",he ended up having to replace the motherboard to get an i5-9400f.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you can always turn down shadows, motion blur, and dof, those tend to be intensive and/or bursty in terms of resource use.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
replacing a cpu can be more than just the cpu itself depending on when you change it.,"if you upgrade from a dead socket you're buying a new motherboard too, and possibly new ram",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

how do you even undervolt the gpu.,msi afterburner?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"rpl should bring some cache boosts, better efficiency from raptor cove and 2x e-cores.",that's about it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""up to double digit performance increases"" is a very very vague claim.",it means anything from 1-99% improvement.,"since ""up to"" means it some performance will be below double digits, and ""double digits"" are 10-99.

intel is being coy with numbers, because they basically never show off performance details or hard specs way before launch.","they showed the unnamed 13900k with 8+16 cores running, but havent really confirmed anything else since raptor lake is still another 5(?)",months away.,"we will probably see like 25% more multithreaded performance from doubling the e-cores and 12% more st from new architecture ipc gains and frequency boosts, cache boosts, as well as some power improvements and ram compatibility.","so it actually is a significant improvement compared to the history of generational improvements, just not as big of an improvement that it was from rocket lake to alder lake, but alder lake's performance gains are huge and basically the biggest generational increase in a decade, so that kind of increase is exceptionally rare.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

your thoughts seem rooted in possibility.,i've been waiting a while to build a new computer.,now that gpus are no longer made of unobtanium im starting to think out a build.,i see no significant reason to wait for raptor lake considering that i still have an amd 2700x and 1080ti.,before the 2700x i had the intel 2700k.,amd always seems to have its little quirks but i've never had issue with intel and am happy to be moving back over.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"okay, letâ€™s put it this way.",you have a huge swimming pool you need to fill with water.,"you can choose to fill it with one 5 gallon bucket, or with one 5 gallon and one 3 gallon bucket at the same time.",which method will fill the pool faster?,it doesnâ€™t matter that using both buckets averages you out to 4 gallons per bucket.,"the point is you can move 8 gallons of water at a time instead of 5.

itâ€™s the same with heavily multithreaded applications such as handbrake.",disabling 4 cores because theyâ€™re slower than the other 6 cores doesnâ€™t make those 6 cores any faster.,it just means youâ€™re now missing out on everything those 4 other cores could have contributed to the task.,thatâ€™s 90% of the reason why the 12900k scores significantly faster than the 12700k: itâ€™s got more of those slower cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

perfect.,thank you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
although i agree with the notion that op won't get a boost for their particular workload disabled cores.,disabling the e cores does make the p cores faster.,it increases the ring bus frequency and frees up some power headroom.,this is why it is sometimes recommended for gaming.,apparently raptor lake will feature some enhancements to lower the difference between enabling and disabling e cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the absolute only thing the base clock rating means is, â€œwhen the cpu is running at its target pl1 wattage, this is how fast the cores will be goingâ€.",the 12700 has 8 performance cores and 4 efficiency cores.,the 12600 has 6 performance cores only.,both chips have the same pl1 rating of 65w.,"when that power has to be distributed among 12 cores instead of 6, obviously compromises have to be made.","but as mentioned, itâ€™s meaningless.","what you need to look at is the pl2 numbers, which is what the cpu will actually be doing.","which is 4.8ghz on performance cores for both, but 180w power for the 12700 thanks to extra cores, and 117w for the 12600.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i've no idea why, but it's completely irrelevant for gaming.",you'll never run at the base clock when gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it just means they both have a processor base power of 65 w and therefore 12700f is specified as a lower base clock to stay at 65 w base power while having more cores.,"this base spec can be safely ignored, it's used by motherboard makers to define ""minimum specifications"" for support.","pay attention to maximum turbo frequencies, as these will be what your processor will be operating at.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wow thanks, what do u suggest if i just want to play at 1440p?",which cpu among them.,and is my 750 gold psu will be enough or i7?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice.,thanks i was worried,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> the absolute only thing the base clock rating means is, â€œwhen the cpu is running at its target pl1 wattage, this is how fast the cores will be goingâ€.","i would add *in the worst case scenarios*

just because it's under pl1 doesn't mean that it will be running low clocks, depends on the workload ;)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
either cpu would likely not be a bottleneck for gaming.,"the 12700 is obviously more powerful, but it would come down to your budget, what else you will use the system for, and how long you intend to keep the system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"either is enough, depends on budget, and the psu is more about what gpu youll use as those suck way more watts than a cpu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

btw the rgb on the memory does work,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what xmp profile did you enable?,3200?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"now i got booted in the bios with the message boot failure detected

i did enable that.,it did not work at first.,but now it works which is very weird,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's called memory training, at first the motherboard does not boot but after several attemps it gets the timing good enough and boots.",anyways this still means your systems ram might not be stable and best to test with some tool like hci memtest if that ram is stable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"quality (power, clock speed) varies widely between dies, but reliability should be similar.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no two cpus are perfectly identical, one will need less voltage than the other, but both are reliable.",i.e.,some 10900ks can do 5 ghz with less than 1.25v while others need more than that.,that's called the silicon lottery.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they can have minuscule quality differences.,this doesn't affect reliability.,if your cpu is unreliable you've received a broken one and need to exchange it.,it can affect performance mostly in the 10% margin.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you wonâ€™t find different grades of the same model of cpu available for sale - better chips typically become a completely different model.,"otherwise, chips are binned to meet a certain performance metric, and there can be a huge variance within that range.","which is to say, yes, there are much better chips than others.",but you canâ€™t choose to buy an â€œokay 1165g7â€ or a â€œgreat 1165g7â€ even though they technically exist.,"thatâ€™s whatâ€™s called the â€œsilicon lotteryâ€ - whether what you buy ends up being okay, good, or great (for overclocking purposes).",some overclockers will pay good money for rare examples of excellent quality silicon.,"now, companies can do their own internal binning if they so choose, but i canâ€™t imagine that any mass pc maker bothers since thereâ€™s no real motivation to do so, since theyâ€™re just selling a cpu that intel has already guaranteed to work to spec.",true military spec applications (not just consumer military spec marketing) may be a different story.,"like if nasa wanted an intel cpu to put in hubble, i would expect intel to provide a completely awesome â€œgolden sampleâ€.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there are no differences in reliability between cpus.,they are *far and away* the most reliable component of a computer.,"there are, however, differences in silicon quality, which might make one slightly more efficient than another, but these are usually worked into product tiers so the â€œgood 1165g7sâ€ just become 1185g7s instead.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my experience confirms yours.,"one cannot buy a ""good i7-1165g7"" or a ""great i7-1165g7"".","there is only one kind of ""i7-1165g7"" in the shops.","* then how can overclockers get a ""great i7-1165g7"", which can be overclocked safely?",or am i misunderstanding something?,"* do you imply that even hp, dell or lenovo do not have access to ""good i7-1165g7"" vs. ""great i7-1165g7""?",their business notebooks have mil-std-810h tests passed.,"i suppose, that there are good processors for the cheaper notebooks, and great processors for the mil-std-810h notebooks, which e.g.","withstand more shock, vibration, temperature, humidity, etc.","same for rams, ssds and all other components.","did you mean, that the components are the same in all notebooks (whether mil-std-810h or not)?","in this case the cheaper notebook's components also withstand shock, vibration, etc.",and the mil-std-810h standard is awarded only to the notebook's case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sometimes a company collects cpus and tests them then resell's them either cheaper or more expensive depending on their performance.,it's called binning.,"it's possible overclockers purchase a binned i71165g7 however i find it unlikely as who would be wanting to overclock one of these anyways, it's a laptop cpu.",not to mention it probably comes attached to a motherboard so it's more expensive to bin.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just sayin.,12400f beats 9900k in single core and matches in multi.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"with 350 bucks you can buy a 12400f, a mobo and you get better perf overall compared to 9900k.","if you can get the 9900k cheaper, yes, that will work ok.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just a thought and definitely not what you want to hear.,sorry about off topic.,"it you are wiling to spend 350 for a cpu, i'd try to find a new or used motherboard and 11th or 12th gen cpu for about the same price.",you could most likely sell your current motherboard and cpu cooler to finance a part of this upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
both are overpriced.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would do the 9900. but i also had a 9700 rig that was great.,that might save some money.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
none of those options.,12400f or 12600k and new mobo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well.,"i moved from 7500 to 6700 back in the day, and it was a massive change for the better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thank you, it's a tough spot to be in honestly.",the jump to getting a new motherboard (my build is mini-itx ) and probably a new cooler since my old cooler won't fit on 1700 is gonna be tough.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's a good suggestion honestly, and i've been open to just spending big and jumping to 12th gen. in terms of selling my motherboard and cooler, sadly it would be really tough to sell my mobo and cooler so they'd be relegated to a secondary build/backup build and in that case i'd get the 8500 to keep it alive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"given how old they are, i completely agree.","weirdly enough, ebay prices seem to hover around those numbers which is insane.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™ll sell you a used 9900k for 200 bucks rn.,itâ€™s just chillin in an unused z390 w/32 gigs of ddr4 3600 cl18 unused since my upgrade to a 12900k w/ddr5.,"less than 2 years of use, purchased in 2020. 

itll hold 5 ghz all core at 1.31 v llc turbo but i kept it at 1.28 v llc turbo 4.9 ghz for longevity/temps.",itâ€™s a solid cpu.,"not the best binned in the universe, but it works well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most cooler companies are shipping free cooler brackets for 12th gen compatibility.,check if yours is too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's the norm for old high end intel cpus.,because intel keeps changing sockets the best cpu for a given socket ends up holding it's value really well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

would guess that this is a mis-read/bug.,"i would consider (if you haven't already) flashing to the latest bios, unless this eliminates functionality that you require, and otherwise not worry about it.",keep an eye out for voltage and heat spikes though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when i had a i7 7800x it used to spike abnormally high in xtu as well.,or rather xtu reported a spike that never occurred.,ive ran msi afterburner to monitor my cpu usage and core clock along side it to see if the spike showed up on both sides but it never dit.,i suspect its just xtu incorrectly displaying data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s not that high of a spike compared to what you have.,it probably ran on one core for a fraction of a second if it didnâ€™t report wrong.,wouldnâ€™t be absolutely impassible unless itâ€™s unable to provide that clock speed but that depends i think it could,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i just got done doing diag on some funky video issues, so was just turning the over clocks down, and just sitting here in the desktop with xtu open, just notice it spiked to 6.3. is that normal?",is it normal to get spikes but this is above avg?,"not sure what info you guys would need to help but iâ€™ll supply what i can, when i can",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

letâ€™s be blunt: that motherboard canâ€™t handle either chip.,"the unheatsinked vrm on that board has a maximum power draw of 125 watts, and you really would not want to run it at that level for any length of time in a cramped sff pc.",the 12700k has a power draw of 190w in turbo.,you will not see that cpuâ€™s performance on that board.,the 12700 also has a power draw of up to 180 watts.,"again, you wonâ€™t see that chipâ€™s performance on that board.","if you think the gigabyte is a failure, i dare say this board is as well by completely whimping out on power delivery despite choosing to use the h670 chipset.","you would be best sticking to the 12400 for that board, or look for a better itx board (they exist, but you may have to go ddr5).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you donâ€™t plan to oc buy the 12700. by the time a 12700 wonâ€™t be enough an overclocked 12700k wonâ€™t give you much more anyway.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the differences between the two cpus are really minor - a 100-200 mhz difference in turbo speed.,it's in the realm of insignificant.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think you are very limited with choices, so wait for something better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™d consider waiting for 13th gen in your scenario.,its coming later this year.,only because you may have an easier time finding more capable motherboards in this next lineup.,i would steer clear of that board with that cpu.,it wonâ€™t be worth the hassle in terms of power delivery and heat.,"in your region, thereâ€™s nothing z690m?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

did someone downloaded it and try ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"im pretty sure the board is limited to delivering 125 watts, regardless of your extra cooling, meaning it will throttle a 12700 or 12700kâ€™s power needs.","if youâ€™re okay with that, then i would say the 12700 is a better fit.",(the z690 version has a much better vrm than the h670 version.),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i haven't because i have a lowly i5-12600 in my h670m-itx/ax and bios 6.06 works well for me.,give it a few days and hopefully someone will make a youtube video about it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"hi, thanks for the response!","&#x200b;

i did take into consideration that third-party tools might not provide accurate results, however this is why i ran multiple and compared them to the same processor (e.g.",performancetest 10.2).,i also ran a real test against my friends ryzen 5800x by compressing the same files.,on my system it consistently took double or more time to compress in both winrar and 7-zip.,"despite his cpu being year older and from a different manufacturer, the compression rate should not be half.","i have run the intel processor diagnostic tool, however the tool does not currently support my processor as listed at the bottom of the tools [website](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/15951/intel-processor-diagnostic-tool.html).","the forums say this causes it to fail the brandstring and cpufreq test, which my processor does fail.","edit: i have added the log - [intel processor diagnostic tool log](https://pastebin.pl/view/e0ca213d)

i was not aware that ddr4 3600mhz was out of specification for this cpu.",would you recommend then i set the xmp profile to ddr4 3200mhz?,i have not overclocked the processor at all.,"while i know how, it is something i prefer to leave alone ever since turboboost became a thing.","what i was considering in the future was undervolting the cpu as apparently that is good for the overall heat and lifespan of the cpu, provided it is stable.","i have not done this though due to only having just bought this system and first wanting to test everything thoroughly, hence why i am here.","you make a very good point about contacting winrar and 7-zip directly, i will do that and see if they have any suggestions.","i will double check with msi support to make sure everything is fine, though i do believe it is installed correctly as all tools including intel system support utility report it as being on the latest version.",i currently also have a ticket open with intel in case they can give me more clarification on my issue.,"again thanks for the response, i really appreciate it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the help so far.,"i did a clean install of the msi driver and also adjusted my fan curves in the bios to start ramping up when it gets over 70.
its still hotter and more noisy than before the issue.",the only i can try is to reinstall the 30.0.101.1960 driver again but i already had that one running anyways.,even if temps up to 100â°c are fine for the cpu it doesn't change the fact that i was running in the 40s in idle and max 80 on load and everything is just 10-20â° hotter now.,i still think there might be an issue with this particular driver.,"edit:
it seems like it spikes heavily when i start apps.",doesn't really matter which one.,"steam, discord, firefox, msi center, nzxt everything seems to spike temps to the 80 range until it drops down again.",utilization doesn't even go above 20%.,never had that issue before.,also loading times in games seem longer?,although cpu shouldn't really affect that if i'm not mistaken?,maybe just a coincidence.,could maybe be an issue that cores are not utilized correctly?,"although i'm just speculating at this point
if i can provide more test data lemme know",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"update:
im just running a few low load apps (steam, discord, lol client) and the package and p cores are at 100â°c the e cores are at 80. the air from the rad is not hot at all.",almost cool because the fans are ramping to 100%.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"hi, i have this issue with the latest driver from microsoft , it's getting better with 30.0.101.1960 driver, but flickering is still present, small but noticeable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in this case, first, make sure that the proper memory ram for the intel core i7-12700f is being used, which is up to ddr5 4800 mt/s / up to ddr4 3200 mt/s.","according to the [specifications](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/134592/intel-core-i712700f-processor-25m-cache-up-to-4-90-ghz.html) of the unit, the processor can reach 3.60 ghz when turbo boost is activated.","turbo boost works automatically depending on the load of work, [here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000021587/processors.html) you can find further details about how the feature works.","depending on the windows power plans or some options in the bios, like when intel speed step is enabled, it is expected from the processor to be below the performance-core base frequency.",for further aspects on this subject visit this [link](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000037863/processors/intel-core-processors.html).,"based on that, we suggest getting in contact directly with the [manufacturer](https://www.gigabyte.com/support) of the board to make sure the system is working at stock configurations with default bios settings, and to confirm that the latest bios version is currently installed on the computer or, if necessary, to gather the instruction on how to update it.","also, it is recommended to use the windows power plan on ""high performace"" to get full advantage of the processor's functionality, but as an option, you can additionally get in contact with [microsoft support](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us) directly for them to provide further suggestions on this topic.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"quick question, does 11th gen support ddr4-2666 mhz.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so i found out that the turbo boost frequency works only few seconds after booting up the computer and then it comes back to 2.9 ghz.,i updated bios turned high performance option on.,nothing i ve done seems to help so idk what to do,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">it is important to mention that, in this case, we are not able to comment on benchmarking and performance since, depending on the system specifications, the performance can be different even though the computers being used/compared have similar or equal specifications, due to the fact that the configuration for every system is always different.also, when using third-party tools, the results might not be that accurate.","in order to rule out a possible hardware problem with the intel processor, install and run the intel processor diagnostic tool, it does an overall test on the unit and if passes the test it means it is working properly.to try to reset the bios is a good troubleshoot to try, keep in mind that everything related to the bios and its settings is supported by the manufacturer of the board.","so, we recommend getting in contact directly with gigabyte support so they can further assist you with this matter and also confirm that the latest bios version is currently installed on your computer or, if necessary, to gather the instructions on how to do that.to update windows, as you described, is also another step that we recommend trying, so as an option you can also get in contact directly with microsoft support for them to provide further suggestions and additional assistance on this topic or any other setting related to windows 11.additionally, based on the fact that you are working with an rtx 3080, that device will support all the heavy graphics tasks on the machine, including games.","so, if you noticed fps drops then we recommend getting in contact with the manufacturer of the graphics card to make sure the latest driver and firmware are currently installed in your system.",and for further assistance on this subject.,it was a problem with the motherboard and temp.,the cpu cores were throttled down to 700mhz when multiple cpu cores were engaged at somewhat heavier tasks (e.g.,watching a 4k video).,"this could potentially be fixed in bios, but the manufacturer had made it near impossible to access bios, so that didn't work.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what if i don't use washer stickers not metal one?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i tried 2 mobo from msi z590 carbon and asus z690 tuf both had same issue with intel 1225-v.
 problem is it keeps dropping frames internet speed is not stable at all.",i called provider isp technician he said no problems with your connection.,so tried to replaced cable 3 times still same so what is causing ethernet issue on intel 1225-v?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

and what's the cpu usage during this time of 1 fps ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3 percent of usage on task mannager while playing gta v at 1 fps, while in wow(works good) its like 13 - 16 precent while playing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hmm have you tried switching to maximum performance battery mode?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yep, already tried that one but no luck :c",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you using hwmonitor?,and monitoring your frequencies and temperatures to make sure nothing is out of the ordinary?,did you try both while plugged in and unplugged?,"try running procmon to see what the heck the computer is doing during this time, maybe you'll see something that will give a clue.",maybe try to disable any antivirus auto protection for a moment while you try running the game.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i will try hwmonitor, procmon and the antivirus, i have already tried plugged and unplugged, thanks !",c: very appreaciated response !,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yay!,my first award!!,"thanks :)   


have you also tried the lowest screen resolution on the games?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep i tried that before with no luck,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would say unless you go up to the 3080ti it isnâ€™t worth the upgrade.,3070ti is a fair bit better performing but not by enough to pay $700+ for it unless you really want dlss.,"even 3080ti is a stretch for me just because pricing but if you felt the need for more perf, that is the route.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a 3080ti paired with an 8700k and it performs excellently.,i play on a lg c9 most of the time and the 8700k handles 4k 120hz no problem.,"iâ€™m sure a 12700k would have much improved 1% lows and a maybe a few more fps, but the 8700k will pair well with either of the 3 series gpus.",which one you get depends on your priorities,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why not 3080?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"recently upgraded from my 8700k, which was paired with my rx6800.","mostly play at 4k and 99% of games were fine but god of war was pushing past 80% cpu and had a bit of stuttering, nothing unplayable, but deffs smoother on my 12600k.","i reckon the 8700k is still a fine cpu for all but the most intensive games, or if you're going for very high refresh rates, especially if you've got it overclocked",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you can get one for a reasonable price, 3070ti will be the card to get.","just some info, there are rumours indicating that the 4000series rtx cards might be released this year so you can probably stick with your 1080ti for a bit longer.",be warned though that supply situation might be the same as the 3000series.launch so it might be advisable to proceed with the upgrade.,it all depends on you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3070ti cratered in price.,there are now some for under $800 on amazon.,[https://www.amazon.com/evga-geforce-08g-p5-3797-kl-technology-backplate/dp/b096wm6jfs/ref=sr\_1\_2?crid=1az7emvl9epu3&keywords=3070+ti&qid=1648772079&sprefix=3070ti%2caps%2c157&sr=8-2](https://www.amazon.com/evga-geforce-08g-p5-3797-kl-technology-backplate/dp/b096wm6jfs/ref=sr_1_2?crid=1az7emvl9epu3&keywords=3070+ti&qid=1648772079&sprefix=3070ti%2caps%2c157&sr=8-2)  this one is $830 but it was $1050 just last month.,i know my sister-in-law bought it for a build i did for her.,right now keep watching.,prices keep dropping and dropping fast.,you can likely get both a gpu and a new mobo/cpu for what you expected to pay.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"try to find a 3080 under or around 1k usd, it is nice balance of price and performance and a major upgrade to 1080 ti.","unless you are getting a very good deal on 3080 ti, you are overpaying for the performance upgrade over the 3070 ti.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had a 8700k oc'd to 5ghz and went from 1080 to 3080 for 1440p/165hz gaming.,"the cpu was definitely a bottleneck at that point with many fps drops, especially with anything notable running in the background.","i upgraded to a 12700k and now everything i play runs at pretty constant 165 fps with g-sync maxed out, even if i'm watching tv through xfinity streaming app through chrome on my other screen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"pretty sure this guy will be disappointed by the results, he probably wanted a confirmation to buy a new gpu and we didn't give that to him.","frankly, the truth is no, don't buy any 30 series gpu when 40 series are around the corner.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to be fair i went to a 3070ti from a 1070. but i got it at rrp so i was extremely lucky.,really iâ€™d stick with your 1080ti for a while.,itâ€™s still a very capable card,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3070ti is pretty nice, if you can get it for the right price.","i play at 4k on a 12600k, and its ranges from 53fps - 90fps, average 80fps on even the most demanding games at 4k (no rt, it can cause a bit of a hit).","but for you, i'd get the best you can, don't worry about bottlenecking in current system.","the 30 series has a good bit of life left in it, can go to your next pc if you ever ditch the current one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wait until the 40 series of graphics cards,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3070ti here but i have mine paired with a 12900k.,more than enough for 2k high preset.,can even 4k 60+ at high preset in games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"go for 3070ti if you have the urge to upgrade , it is the normal cycle to update the gpu every 2 generation , next time you upgrade it will be the whole systemâ€¦ 8700k is a good cpu but it is slower than todays cpu.. the 3080ti will be faster than your cpu and the 3070ti is a sweet spot â€¦ if you could also upgrade to 9900k and sell your cpu you should have a really balanced system !",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my vote goes to the 3070 ti 

1440p gaming will be solid with your 8700k + 3070 ti setup.",cyberpunk 2077 should see roughly 60fps at 1440p with dlss.,red dead redemption 2 should see 75fps+ at 1440p with beautiful settings.,"future games will of course demand more, but your 8700k has years left in the tank, and the 3070 ti will be a perfect companion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seeing your 8700k i think it would be a good idea to keep saving money and then upgrade to intel 13 gen/amd 7000 and nvidia 4000/rx 7000 in one go.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no point upgrading a 1080ti right now.,wait for the 40 series.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if i had a 1080 ti i would not upgrade until the next generation at least,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
get a new i5 or i7 and then it wont bittleneck att all with the 30 series.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just wait for the mcm design graphics cards, (multi core modules) which come out next generation for amd and the following for nvidia, then you can do a whole platform upgrade, and get nice features like ddr5 ram,  pcie 5.0 for faster m.2 ssd drives

with your current setup you are good for the next three year's at a minimum",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how about 3080 10gb/12gbðÿ¤”,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am still happy with my gtx 1070 and it still works well.,i dont think you need to upgrade,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you can get 3080ti for 1200+tax why not,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the one you currently have,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it will be fine.,but if you ever were to have a bottle neck you can always put a 9900k in there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gtx 1070 and i7-8700k here.,"i gotta say, itâ€™s a perfect combination.",been doing 1080p on high and ultra since 2017 and i still get away with ultra settings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it really depends on what games you intend to play.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am using my 2080 with it and i am fine with it's performance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3080 and 8700k here.,i stepped up from a 1080ti and play at 3440x1440p - i didnâ€™t notice too much of an uplift daily other than steady 120fps in the gsync screen.,"the 1080ti didnâ€™t ever underperform, the 3080 just shinier",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
keep your 1080ti.,take the money you would have spent on a graphics card and upgrade your fucking cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if possible skip this generation the scalping from nvidia is too much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the real question is what monitor you have?,if you use a 1440p with 144 refresh rate monitor i think 1080ti is totally fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"why are these options here, and not the intel arc alchemist gpu?",obviously i will be having an all intel system to compliment my all amd system.,that is my two sats.,have a wonderful week.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 1080ti should fetch ~$400.,so it's really only about $300 for a 3070ti.,if you can get a 3xxx at retail it makes sense to upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
donâ€™t forget ray tracing!,"but yeah excellent take, thatâ€™s a good point on the $700 more.",i would like more perf with the 3080 but just donâ€™t want my 8700k sprinting for its life at 80-90% usage all the time ðÿ˜…,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for your experience and take!,unfortunately there are things happening in life where i can only upgrade my card or nothing at all.,"thanks for this, i have a lot to think about.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you kind sir for your take.,may you have a suspiciously serendipitous day out of nowhere tomorrow!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wouldnâ€™t mind this option either actually.,so as long as my cpu doesnâ€™t become the bottleneck with it.,ðÿ¤”,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for your story!,iâ€™ve always wanted to try out the amd gpus.,god of war on 4k must looks amazing ðÿ¤¤,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the heads up.,i donâ€™t think iâ€™ll be getting the 40 series cards so thatâ€™s why i wanted to pick one last card for my build.,despite the overwhelming poll numbers of people saying to stay with the 1080ti it sounds like people have been saying good things about the 3070ti.,"thanks again, have a good one!",!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i know bro, exciting times ðÿ˜¬",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"dang now i gotta choose between a 3080 and a 3070ti ðÿ¥µ
appreciate the advice!","you sound like a professional ðÿ˜ 
yeah i just want a 30 series card that wonâ€™t suck the life out of my 8700k and have it running at 80-90 usage all the time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wow i see.. thanks for your experience.,that was invaluable feedback.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
haha i admit i was shocked - mostly from the overwhelming vote count.,wow.,this community is amazing.,"but yeah i didnâ€™t want to bore anyone with a long prompt, so i had to leave out not wanting to get a 40 series card for reasons i donâ€™t want to bore you with.",i imagine that is why a majority of people voted to stick with the 1080ti.,thanks nonetheless for replying and have a good one!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it truly is!,but with cards coming down in price i wanted to squeeze in one more card upgrade before i have to shelf gaming for a long time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for taking the time to reply.,wish you a good weekend!!,"and thatâ€™s great advice, hoping you can upgrade nicely one day too ðÿ‘ðÿ½",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sadly there are things happening in my life where i can only get one more card (a 30 series) or nothing at all.,"if youâ€™re planning to get a 40 series, hope you can nab one before the scalpers do!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice cpu!,"thanks for sharing your experience with it, hope you have a good weekend :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the advice here man.,"you rock, seriously.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i appreciate you man.,thanks for chipping in the frame estimates.,i hadnâ€™t even asked for that.,you rock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the advice.,"sadly, with some things going on in life, i can only upgrade my card one last time.",it would be nice to do a full upgrade though.,have a good one!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah thatâ€™s trending to be what people are saying now.,but alas i cannot get the 40 series.,have a good weekend!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for your take.,"yeah, that would be ideal for me but i have to choose between the 3070ti, 3080, and 3090ti now for my 8700k.",i wish i could tell you why i canâ€™t just wait for the 40 series but i donâ€™t want to put you to sleep.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lmao nice name!,yeah i wish i could get a new cpu but alas i cannot..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks bert.,i didnâ€™t need you making me drool from such a seductive possibility but i wish you a fine weekend nonetheless!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i hadnâ€™t even thought about this and i honestly should have.,if i can get a 3080 over a 3070ti without punishing my 8700k id totally go for it.,"i shouldâ€™ve have put an option for a 3080 in the poll, i messed up smh.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
perhaps i shall stay strong with you my 10 series brother!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
keep asking the hard questions!,:d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you kind sir for your input.,this is what the overwhelming majority also says!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks for the tip, yeah my options are limited but iâ€™ll keep that 9900k in mind.",have a good weekend!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is something iâ€™ve considered - going back down from 1440p to 1080p and sticking with the 1080ti.,iâ€™d have to think about it a lot.,thanks for your reply!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nice way of thinking, interesting analysis thanks for your take.",is your birthday august 6th 1992 by any chance?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah right now itâ€™s for halo infinite which i can barely run and ready or not which is terribly optimized and far cry 6 which i also have a hard time running at times.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i thought about getting a 2080 but they seem to be harder to find than the 30 series.,glad to hear youâ€™re enjoying it!,!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for sharing your experience man.,hope this helps other folks in a similar situation ðÿ‘ðÿ½,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sadly there are things happening in my life where i can only upgrade my card one last time or nothing at all.,your suggestion would have been my best case scenario.,maybe in another life.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we will never be free from scalping my friend.,as long as we have money people will come for it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yep, i use a 1440p with 144 and it does do well with the 1080ti for the most part.",iâ€™m just struggling to run with some of the newer games like halo infinite.,"also ready or not which has massive frame drops and which is unoptimized now, no fault to the 1080ti.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"first, because the intel desktop gpus haven't been released or even announced yet.","secondly, drivers could be a huge issue in the beginning because they're a new player here",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i sold mine like 8 months ago for $700 ðÿ˜³,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's not really an issue, they are perfectly fine running at 100% forever as long as they're properly cooled.",an unused cpu is a wasted cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i play at 3440 x 1440 @ 144 hz and i feel like my cpu doesn't catch up on aaa games with a 3080 ti and 8700k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would help if you could tell us which games you planning on playing.,there are games that are very heavily cpu-bound.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ehh even if it does, ir just gives you an excuse to upgrade later down the line ;) i sold my 7700k for a surprising amount on ebay amd used the finds to get a 12700k.",you could do the same and probably make out close to even with a i5- 12600k.,"but at 1440p, you def won't be bottlenecking.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have a 3080 paired with a 7700k, and i can still max out the gpu at 1440p or vr.","cyberpunk at ultra for example runs at about 65-75 fps, without noticeable stuttering.","so unless you are looking for 144+hz gaming, the 8700k is absolutely enough and i'd recommend to buy the best gpu you are willing to pay for.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i did in jan...

12600k, 3070ti... :d

dammit, that flex just escaped, was trying to hold it back ;)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ha okeh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i know itâ€™s not the same as the 8700k but thought it would help as reference.,just see the performance difference in cpus.,"i get about 160fps at 2k in destiny 2, id assume you would get over 100 with the 8700k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 3070 ti can handle most anything you throw at it these days.,"my 3070 ti + 5800x rig is way more than i was targeting back when i had my [4c/8t 7700 + 1070 sc rig](https://i.redd.it/4pz7sqrisft41.png) in service, and your beefier 8700k will be just fine paired with the 3070 ti.",my 7700 will be eventually paired with my previous 2070 super which is probably the upper limit for the non-k 7700 processor.,"your 6c/12t 8700k will crank out more than enough power to run the 3070 ti, and i would be very interested to see how that combination performs while running death stranding because it can benefit from additional threads all the way up to 24 threads.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not really.,a cheap i5 will do the magic.,"i recommend if y8u want it cheap, 11th gen. 11600k or a 11400 cpu is a nice cpu.",it could pair with the 3080 or 3070 ti (whats the difference)  6 cores is still a good and enough ammount for gaming.,we are making the era transition.,bonus: wanna know how i got my username?,my dad always liked making up songs and doing some random thing with a half built computer thinking it will work with half the parts.,"so, he made up a wierd but still a very dad ish song hence the name.","he died almost 4 years ago, i got over it pretty quickly, but when making a reddit account, i decided to name this account after his song.","many people when they run out of arguements try to poke fun at it, but they would apologize if they knew the meaning.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're welcome dude you too :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1080p on ultra and high graphics with a 1080ti will last you another 4 years or so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if you aren't going to play them in 2k or 4k, then stick with a 1080, it's more than enough.","we're probably not that far from the 40 series from releasing, so i would advise everyone to save their money for a bigger upgrade.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
damn.,this might be the one time i don't have a snarky comeback.,do what you have to do to keep your head up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe you should consider upgrade your cpu too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good point.,i still want an all intel build though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you win some, you lose some.",put that w in the bag before someone sees!,!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i sold my 1080 for $400 over a year ago so that doesn't seem too crazy.,a quick glance on ebay and it just looked like they were in the 400-500 range now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hmm.. i never thought of it like that and i should have.,well said sir.,happy friday!,!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not sure that is entirely accurate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for this.,this was exactly my concern and iâ€™m thankful you shared your side of the story.,hope you can upgrade your rig one day ðÿ‘ðÿ½,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mostly play siege and other ubisoft games like ghost recon and far cry.,but to be honest for you iâ€™ve asked for all of your times on this because iâ€™m having a hard time running a game called ready or not.,"i know itâ€™s an alpha game and has its optimization issues that will hopefully get fixed later, but sometimes the fps drops are too much for me and i was hoping to mitigate that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"where i live my 7700k doesn't fetch that much, and on top expensive mobos mean i cannot make the same move.","i am probably upgrade to raptor lake, and even though i was eyeing the i7, the i5 looks ever more appealing to me.","in my usage single core performance is the primary concern, plus i prefer air cooling too.","having said that, the 7700k holds up much better than i expected based on common wisdom!","i have a 75hz monitor, it never bottlenecks it, and in vr flight sims the 3080 has no chance hitting 90hz (though even that runs ok on the cpu), so it is 45fps reprojection.","however, some suggest that even at lower than 100% usage a better cpu brings tangible fps improvement, so there's that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the tip hehe.,sadly because of some things going on in life i can only upgrade my card one last time or nothing at all.,thanks again for your suggestion and comment!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

flex freely we should all be friends here!!,:d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you certainly did help because you spent the time to reply.,so thanks again!,!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks again for your generosity in making the time to type this.,thatâ€™s a cool project you have for your 2070 and 7700. what do you have planned for it anyway?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
awww thatâ€™s actually a really cool way to honor his memory.,youâ€™d see it every time you logged into reddit.,"thanks for sharing your story :)
blue is my favorite color too!",and yeah that is the next thing i have to do research on - 3080 or 3070ti for my 8700k.,thanks again for your assessment!,!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol swing and a miss!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hehe to be honest if you took out that one adjective itâ€™d be a pretty standard sentence!,and thank you.,we live our lives the best we can.,wish you the best on yours!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep thatâ€™s the thing most folks have been saying as well but sadly i canâ€™t for the foreseeable future..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that would be cool - wish you the best on that!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah.,i think it would be a bit hard with the first gen gpus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

comes down to cooling really.,heat is the enemy of the cpu.,i have a machine that is doing encoding all the time so it is running full bore on cpu almost constantly.,end of the day it is up to the user to use their product how they want.,i would rather run my cpu pegged and get better performance/faster results.,"by the time it dies, if it does, something better will be out anyway.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think they would be best off either working to scale nuc's to the point where the pricing is more affordable, or dropping the nuc line all together.","because currently nuc's are like a low volume premium prebuilt sffpc's, making them a pretty niche product.","i feel like it's more of a product line they make to show off what's possible, than it is a product that's profitable.","don't get me wrong, i like the design and engineering of nuc's and would happily own one but for me it makes more sense to build an sffpc, because i can, while nuc's seem more targeted at people who just want to buy a completed sffpc.","if they can scale the production up, and use arc gpus, they could easily have their own mac mini- mac studio type product, designed specifically around their chips and cut out the oem middlemen, increasing profits.",but i don't think intel is interested in doing that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

april 5th 6am.,newegg sent me an email after recalling mine last week and it is being reshipped to me on that day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"right on flow, i snagged one!!!",gotta chose a mb now.,any suggestions?,going for ultimate cad workstation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
newegg called me after accidentally shipping one early and recalling it from the delivery company.,they said the cpu will be resent on april 5th.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i just called newegg, they are saying that the release date was today but they don't have them yet.",and they aren't saying when they will have.,i wasn't able to preorder or get an notice when they are available...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i accidentally hit next without posting my story but i updated it now lol.,i know it says the 5th but the distributor says thatâ€™s not what they are being told,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for the reply!,iâ€™m so confused how blt can be the only retailer to still think itâ€™s the 20th.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mhmm i just show a review on the msi meg ace z690 motherboard and it looks really good.,itâ€™s a little pricey but nearly as bad as something like the aorus z690 xtreme or the rog strix z690 extreme,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m just so blown away by how a company like blt could be so far behind on all this stuff then.,"i emailed them the link from intel themselves stating the release
date and they replied saying that it was just a rumor",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
except it will not.,"they canceled and refunded mine, told me to get fucked and to  try to get it again on april 5th when all the purchasing bots are waiting.",thanks intel.,thanks newegg.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wow iâ€™m sorry to hear that man.,turns out blt ended up sending out the 12900ks today so iâ€™ll finally have mine tomorrow.,iâ€™m really sorry that happened to you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can buy them thru ebay right now for 819 which isnâ€™t too much higher than retail and itâ€™s coming from antonline which iâ€™m pretty sure is a decent company,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
newegg has the 12900ks in stock now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there was a person in this sub that already has a 12900ks in retail packaging.,"also another retail boxed one on ebay: https://www.ebay.com/itm/134066186814?chn=ps&mkevt=1&mkcid=28

 if there's delays its probably on your local retailer/distributor side?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"shopblt is a very, very weird company.",refresh newegg on launch day and grab one there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hilarious.,april 20th was the rumour.,because that's the launch of the 5800x3d so the tech news sites guessed intel would release the 12900ks at the same time to compete.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
damn iâ€™m sorry to hear that man.,hopefully youâ€™ll be able to snag one again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i shall try, thank you!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s exactly what i told them!,but they still say that is what intel told them so they are sticking to it.,i guess iâ€™ll try newegg on april 5th and hopefully snag one so i can cancel my order thru them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
knowing scumegg they will probably force it unto bundles or jack the price up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"apologies, i've deleted my original post.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my 9700k is delitted and watercooled.,i use prime95 for stability testing of oc settings and get temps around 80 â°c.,so my guess isgetting a better cooler could reduce your temps.,undervolting could also do the trick.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"maybe i didnâ€˜t read it, but is our cpu overclocked?",my 9700k is also quite hot.,@5 ghz mine gets above 95c easy with custom watercooling and delieded.,i wound worry about prime95.,try cinnebench r23 and if that is around 80-90 everything should be fine.,prime95 is not a very realistic scenario.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
those are ok temps but youâ€™d do better with a beefier cooler.,"you should not be running prime 95 with avx as a thermal test, itâ€™s dumping 125% of your tdp into the cpuâ€¦.that will never happen.",88-92 c for no avx small fft is pretty normal for a 9900k on a 360 aio so those temps on a 9700k with a mid tier air cooler are just fine (9700k=9900k no hyperthreading).,75 c in warzone is fine.,sub 80 c daily use for longevity is all you need.,youâ€™re allgood.,buy a better cooler when you can.,if youâ€™re not overclocking and these temps are bothering youâ€¦.itâ€™s because your motherboard voltage is set to â€œautoâ€ and itâ€™s flooding way more voltage than necessary to sustain your desired cpu frequencies.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
noctua nh-d15.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i canâ€™t get a better cooler at this moment.,so you think this is normal with my current cooler?,iâ€™m worried that maybe i built my pc wrong or my unit is defective,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
heâ€™s not only running prime 95 small ffts heâ€™s doing it **with** avxâ€¦completely incorrect for thermal testing with prime.,his numbers without avx are acceptable for a mid tier air cooler.,prime 95 small ffts without avx is perfect for thermal testing of intel cpuâ€™s.,all it does is push 100% of your cpu tdp through.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
donâ€˜t worry that sounds quite normal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yep, its normal and if you dont run prime95 on a daily basis you dont have to worry.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"probably, like, $250-300, given that the 12600k beats it in everything.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it will thermal throttle.,you should throttle whoever told you that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not throttle?,what does it do then melt?,ðÿ¤£,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, that's not true.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"any processor, be it cpu or gpu, will thermal throttle if it reaches the temp threshold.",otherwise it'll simply melt.,maybe they meant to say that the cpu does its best to never reach thermal throttling threshold by downclocking itself before that happens?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whoever told you those specific words is an idiot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think he means that it will stay in pl2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the die starts to fracture in a lightning-like pattern and it starts smoking.,theres a famous video from around when intel added throttling to their chips.,"there is a cpu and thermal thermometer shown, quake 3 playing in the background, then they remove the heatsink.","on intel you could watch the fps drop, they set the hsf back on, it sped back up.",amd went up in smoke per above.,"on mobile, can't find it quickly.","edit https://youtu.be/yyqshxnfvuk

of course everything throttles now, but yes, cpus used to literally fry themselves.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm not sure what they meant, i'm getting the information 3rd hand as they saw it in a video and remembered i had a k series.",that would make sense if that's how it does things.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe they were referring to one of the recent linus videos where they mentioned that the k skus don't have time limits on their boost frequencies (which i didn't know tbh).,"nothing to do with thermal throttling, cpus will thermal throttle.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that sounds very plausible, i'll see if i can find that video.",very glad to know my cpu will throttle if it needs to.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just had a look at linus' videos and i am doubting myself that it was one of his... it might not be one of his vids but i defintiely watched the k series vid this week... now it is going to bug me :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this person and i are both linus fans, so it likely originates in an ltt video but they didn't have the link for me which is why i didn't speciffically mention any videos in the post.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
found it.,"it's anthony's shortcircuit vid called: 

they're cutting it real close!",- origin chronos.,go to the 2:40 mark.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the part where he sais it has no turbo limit?,"cuz that just means it will keep pulling power right, not that it won't stop itself from overheating if i understood that correctly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not exactly.,cpus have base frequency and then a boost frequency (modern cpus will actually have more than one kind of turbo level).,what anthony said is that the k cpu does not have a time limit on the turbo frequency like a non-k cpu does.,all (modern) cpus thermal throttle.,"so while it may be able to boost to a theoretical max of 5ghz from a base clock of 3.5ghz (for example, not numbers of an actual cpu), it might hit 5ghz and realise there is not enough cooling.","at that point it still stays in turbo mode but lowers clocks to 4.9, 4.8, 4.6 etc until it finds that it can keep a safe clock speed.",if you try using a stock i3 intel cooler with a 12900k i am willing to bet that the cpu won't even be able to keep its base clock for long let alone hit turbo speeds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i see!,that makes a lot of sense!,thank you for explaining.,basically the cooler you can keep the cpu the closer it can get to that theoretical max clock speed in turbo mode.,but it is still protecting itself from overheating.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"12400-12600=5600x

12600k=5**8**00x",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you talking about the 12600 or the 12600k?,theyâ€™re two very different chips.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if it's the 12600k, yes it's better.","if it's the non k, get the one that has the cheapest motherboard + cpu (in your case probably amd).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if i remember correctly, even the 12400 trades blows with the 5600x in some cases.","it seems to me at least, that intel is in the lead right now, even though the motherboards are a bit pricey.","there's some other ""snacks"" on offer too, and room to upgrade later.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
donâ€™t get the 12600. get the 12600k+z690 or 12400+b660,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its the same price in my country.,i think the intel is better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if kf or k version of 12600 is not that much more get it as it has 4 efficiency cores too

otherwise get 12400",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5600x 365$ or more",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"x = -0,0357 and k = -0,0164?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks bro, 12600k is a beast it destroys amd so much even the 5800x
the only problem in this is that i have to spend more or less 300$ in just the z690
but if i.will have the non k i will have to spend only 200$ so its really a good deal for 12600.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 12600 sir.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you can get a board that overclocks the 12400 it'll shit all over the 5600x, problem is those boards are expensive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why is that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i changed into 12700f i think it will be good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no need to get negative....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"itâ€™s about equal in that caseâ€¦ but then why not get the 12400, or the upcoming 5600 instead if theyâ€™re both cheaper?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12600 is like 2 to 3 percent better than 12400 but costs almost 40$ extra hence not worth price wise.,if getting non k get 12400,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yup thats even better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as long as it's not asus, yes.",asus doesn't update many boards between cycles.,it's the only reason i skipped rocketlake.,asus couldn't be assed to update the bios.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i follow the leaks religiously, currently itâ€™s a maybe.","even with 3 generation support, look how much of s nightmare it was for amd.","you donâ€™t know what processors work on which boards, and it evens breaks down to certain vendors?",isnâ€™t like some cheap asrock board the only one that supports 5000 series?,"anyways, youâ€™ll at the very least get raptor lake support and wonâ€™t have to worry about buggy drivers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i guess if there's no news on it right now its hard to 100% tell, but typically it is 2 gens that these sockets support.",amd did the right thing by keeping the same socket over multiple generations.,hoping intel takes note of that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
unlikely,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
im waiting for upgrading my pc because of the new am5 socket.,i want to be able to upgrade cpu later without having to upgrade everything else.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,i hope this current situation will change - 2 cpu generations per socket.,it feels... outdated.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is a major selling point for amd.,on am4 we have from ryzen 1xxx to ryzen 5xxx on most motherboards.,i really like alder lake but there seems to be no upgrade path in the future.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in all honesty you just need to do what you want to do.,some people upgrade every other generation on both intel and amd.,some people wait like 6 gens before upgrading and some even longer.,"nothing is right or wring, its all personal preference and budget.","if you upgrade frequently, you can at least offset cost by selling the used components.",waiting it out is a fools game imo when it comes to pc hardware unless its coming out in the next quarter or so.,anything longer seems to be useless because you can always apply the same waiting logic over and over and get nowhere lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nah, are any motherboards that were released for ryzen 1xxx able to use ryzen 5xxx cpus.","the socket maybe same, but chipsets are not so its false upgradability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
while it is true that you can upgrade most boards from 1xxx to 5th gen now on amd platform that wasnâ€™t true until a couple of weeks ago.,so donâ€™t act like amd provided support all along.,they only recently added support because intel has likely been slaughtering them in sales again because 12th gen is so damn good.,instead they lied and so dot wouldnâ€™t work and forced their customers to go out and buy new boards.,now well over a year later they are backtracking and allowing upgrades.,this is shady af and many buyers already gave amd more money for new boards or moved to intel again.,you also are stuck on pcie 3.0 and whatever board features you had all those years ago.,"many buyers donâ€™t mind getting a new $300 board every few years as long as it comes with improved features like pci 5.0, better audio, wifi, and improved connectivity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's true but in my case for example... intel gen. 13 will be released this year, ryzen 7xxx also... so there will be more options :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there are now some 300 series mobos (launch zen 1) that can now support a zen 3 part if you are willing to go through what is typically a couple bios flashes.,"that support didn't exist when you wanted to buy a zen 3 part, though.","only in the past couple months have we seen support extended, in response to alder lake being pretty strong competition.","the runaround amd gave on this topic, when clearly the problem was just a business decision, still leaves a bad taste in my mouth.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13th gen makes me think of 3770k and the lower i5 variant: i would rather wait for 14th gen as that's where the money is (e.g.,similar when the 4790k was released).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can't say i agree with this.,raptor lake will be the refined version of alder lake that has been smoothed out and pushed harder.,"things such as heat dissipation, socket pressure irregularities & optimizing of the hybrid architecture.","raptor will be the architecture that is supposed to tide them over while they are working on meteor lake, which is once again a newly designed chip.",arrow lake is likely to be the chip you'd want to aim for if you are passing on raptor.,optimization is key.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a big pro of 13th gen is that its the last cpu series to support ddr4.,moving to ddr5 is 2x-3x the ram cost.,"ddr5 should be cheaper next year but will probably still be 50% more than ddr4, and most people already have ddr4 too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the other piece of this is the price though, so we can speculate all we want but if the pricing doesn't match the performance then you might as well wait... or not!",who knows anymore!!,!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you realize that msi has a â€œpro aâ€ motherboard model for pretty much every chipset?,"regardless, the answer is â€œnoâ€, itâ€™s pretty much guaranteed to be an alc897 with non-special dacs.","so, serviceable for anyone who just wants it to make noise, but nothing beyond that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[removed],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you're very concerned about noise, i would really just recommend a cheap sound card plugging into pcie or usb, then using thst for every build down the line.",you never have to worry about audio quality again (until the drivers stop working),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i recomend buying a sound card like the ""sound blaster z"" if you want to make sure to have very solid audio no matter what the motherboard you have/want",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same mobo i aim to buy for a new 12600k build soon.,"my current mobo is a x570 a pro and the audio is good enough, idk if they're the same audio though.",in any case you'd be better off buying a gaming headset that comes with its own usb sound card if you end up not liking it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks i just mean the stock audio for games and things idk if itâ€™s bad or good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would you need that if your headset is already usb?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks i just dk whether to get this board or not due to the stock sound,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks but i mean just by itself,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah iâ€™ll be using a headset but using it for other things tol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
technically a usb headset is its own self-contained audio device not reliant on any other audio device.,"just like if you use hdmi audio out on a pc, the video card is acting as the audio device and any other audio device on the system is out of the loop.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"by itself i'm pretty sure that you will have a good enough experience, sound cards is not really needed nowaday tbh",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>technically a usb headset is its own self-contained audio device not reliant on any other audio device.,that's makes sense since usb signals are digital and so the headset must have it own adc and dac.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s alc897 codec audio though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you've already asked this very question in this very sub.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, you need at least a 12900k overclocked to 5.5 ghz at the absolute minimum, and even then you barely pass.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hardware unboxed did show that even i3 alder lake is enough *for 1080p* which is far more demanding on cpu than 1440p.,practically anything alder lake that isn't dual-core is enough for any resolution and any gpu (they tested on 6900xt) if i remember correctly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"an as of yet unreleased 35 watt card beating a now 3 year old 50 watt card honestly doesn't sound that impressive to me, much less losing at 1080p which is the target resolution for this class of card.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 1650 has been replaced by the 3050 and 3050ti (35w and up) which have been shipping for a while in laptops now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nope, deep link only assist in creative stuff (hyper encode) and adjust power when needed a la smartshift (dynamic power sharing)

last time we had what you said is back with fusion and a-series era of apu.","in my case it works quite well, roughly almost double the performance in best case.",afaik works best when igp and dgpu shares identical sp count and generation (in a sense.,"near uniform performance just like how crossfire works best with identical cards)

in one of intel patents they are trying to do this on hardware level where a dispatcher distributes the load to individual tiles (not sure if os recognize one tile or all tiles at once, didn't read fully) while amd one seems to use master-slave relationship (only master chiplet is detected by os and it handle work splitting with slave chiplets).","regardless, it's a tough job when it comes to rendering as you need all chunks to be completed at the same time so you don't get microstuttering when one of the individual unit lags.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"oh, thought it was low power discrete gpu becquse they compared it to other discrete",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that rumored price is for the future desktop variant that will be faster.,the a350**m** is the slower laptop variant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's disappointing.,i wish intel would have just made its igpus better.,it seems like the discret cards are using a lot of power to hit those numbers as well.,30 watts for the low end seems high.,i don't plan on ever buying a laptop with an internal fan again.,"i'm in a post fan era, so i guess there aren't for me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
one does not simply dream.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no the comparison is also to 1650 laptop gpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
150 for something that beats the 1650 as the best you've been able to do in a sff bus powered card for years would be cool.,"ruled the roost for too long, amd and nvidia are more interested in higher priced silicon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

try with throttlestop,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can i ask why you want to undervolt it?,are there problems with the motherboard?,i want to buy the same motherboard and cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itx limits you too much imo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that motherboard will reduce the performance of your chip simply by having to power throttle itself.,"and, running it at max capacity with no heatsinks for any length of time sounds like a recipe for disaster, especially in a cramped itx case.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"since you won't overclock buy 12400/12500/12600/f, simple eh?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"should be fine, especially if there is some airflow over it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i can understand the desire for the itx form factor, but i wouldn't pair such a good cpu with a poor motherboard.","by the sound/view of it, this might be one of those.","the lower end boards seem more fitting with the i3s, in my view, or possibly a 12400 without the maximum amount of juice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not sure it's worth it.,get a better mb,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the intel 12 000 series are a bit on the hot side, i would not run a high end cpu on a small case unless you have very good air flow.","and if you do, the asrock h670m-itx/ax will run fine.","it has a pretty decent vrm heatsink on the main vrms, the others are v ram which is not critical for heat dissipation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is it ok to get 12600k for gaming with b660 mobo because i dont plan to over clock?,i dont want z690 mobo.,would it perform a bit better than 12400f for 1440p gaming?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there has to be a b or z series itx mobo, donâ€™t get an h series",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah the itx motherboards for 12th gen have not been great so far, if i can't find an alternative then i might just go back to atx",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's a good point, now that you put it that way it does seem like a terrible idea, thank you!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there are reasons to buy the 12600k even if you dont plan to overclock.,"the 12600k is 6+4 cores, 12600 is 6+0 cores.","the 12600k also has more cache, and higher power limit.","there arent many 12600 reviews, but comparing the 12600k to 12400, at stock settings the 12600k is 10% faster in gaming/st and 50% faster in multithreaded workloads.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 12600k is much more powerful than all of those at the same price.,"simple, eh?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for the comment!,do you think using a top-down air cooler like the big shuriken 3 would be better than using an aio in this scenario since it would also promote airflow around the motherboard?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah you may have a point about the board being more suitable with the i3s, probably should get a better board to be on the safe side, thank you",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah i'll probably keep looking, thank you",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sorry but do you mind elaborating on what you mean by the motherboard having a vrm heatsink on the main vrms and not on the v ram?,from what i've seen people say this motherboard doesn't have a vrm heatsink at all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"from what i've gathered so far, gaming performance between the 12600k and 12400 is not that big even in games that are heavy on cpu usage.",the extra 4 efficiency cores that you get from the 12600k compared to the 12400 mostly help in productivity workloads and applications.,there are many videos that compare the 12th gen cpus like this one that can probably give you a better idea of what you need.,and it is definitely okay to get a 12600k and use it with a b660 if you're not going to be overclocking since you'll still be able to utilize the additional cores and better stock performance without it.,the 12th gen intel cpus also seem to be quite powerful already at stock settings and without overclocking but do note that the 12600k does draw more power and has a higher processor base power of 125w while the 12400 only needs 65w.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
technically h670 is a better chipset than b660.,itâ€™s basically a non-overclocking version of z690 with a few less pcie lanes (but significantly more lanes than b660).,"now, this particular h670 board appears to have the vrm of a h610 board, soâ€¦",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thatâ€™s one option, yes, or just a traditional tower cooler with very good case fans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you.,i will give it more thought.,i also considered i7 12700f which is just little bit more expensive but it seems like a waste as i am going to be bottlenecked by gpu anyway (going with 3070 ti).,"i liked the 12600k because its near same performance as i7 and has integrated gpu if something happened, and of course bigger clock speeds that might or might not have impact on the games",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah the motherboard has most of the features i want but it does seem like the vrm might not be suitable for my cpu, thank you for the comment!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

a 75w card with that performance for $150-200 msrp range would be excellent if they don't gimp the pcie width like the 6500xt.,"perfect for an upgrade to an igpu build with low-end psu, optiplex retrofit, low-profile case, etc.",seems like the perfect 1650 successor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

how are you running 5ghz on that cpu?,lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the issue with the 6500xt is that by limiting the number of pcie lanes to x4, the effective bandwidth when in an gen3 slot is substantially less than that of the card itself, creating an unnecessary bottleneck.","this is likely a result of the 6500xt starting life as a mobile gpu that would never be used in anything but a gen4 environment, but the limitation greatly hinders it in a desktop environment on older system.","as long as intel doesn't make this same mistake with their low end discrete cards, a low power card like this will still fill a big gap in the market not well served by amd and seemingly abandoned completely by nvidia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"https://youtu.be/-edjxisd6ry

i meant that hardware unboxed already proved that if the vram capacity is higher the gpu will have not to rely on system memory via the pcie lanes as much.",if the 6500 xt was 8gb because of a 128-bit bus or 64-bit with double the vram density that would've been the single most beneficial improvement.,"vram is primary in the memory bottleneck the 6500 xt suffers, pcie lanes are secondary.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that definitely makes sense, but i doubt you'll see much more than 4-6gb of gddr6 in the sub-$200 price range due to gddr prices.","making the bus x8 instead of x4 would be far less expensive to design-in than doubling the vram... with the 6500xt, it was already a design limitation of a repurposed mobile gpu not originally intended to be used in anything other than a notebook/laptop with a gen4-enabled platform.","then again, i'm one of the few that doesn't think the 6500xt is hot garbage outside of the gpu market as a whole being extremely inflationary... reviewers just seem to cling to where a $200 card used to sit in the lineup compared to where it does now.","a year from now, i wouldn't hesitate to put a $125-$150 clearance 6500xt in a $500 i3-12100 build for a kid's gaming pc... but the pcie lane x4 limitation prevents it from being utilized with even more modest components that would otherwise be a good fit in terms of performance and price.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's a good point, i was only thinking about how the 8 gb would be more effective than the doubling in pcie bus width, but the pcie bus width increase probably improves the performance to price ratio with better scaling.","> i'm one of the few that doesn't think the 6500xt is hot garbage

kind agree with that, the gpu die itself is very good from a budget perspective, just mostly crippled by its memory bandwidth problem.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there will be bottleneck somewhere, regardless of what hardware you get.",the important thing is not to get a bad bottleneck.,"this is a really good combo, though, meaning  the bottleneck will be nice too.","you'll be bottlenecked either by the monitor or the gpu, depending on the monitor's refresh rate and a particular game.",which is exactly what you want.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

is absolutely fine.,here is the official spec for you to compare with.,***scroll down to the table for boost range at stock.,"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/processors/core/10th-gen-core-desktop-brief.html

the power consumption is in the normal range.,that chip pulls 150w +/- 10w to 20w.,odds of two 360mm aio.m being faulty are unlikely.,could be a failure somewhere on the motherboard.,try a new motherboard first.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
overclocking?,perhaps the motherboard is just putting out way too much voltage?,i really donâ€™t see how a 360 aio shouldnâ€™t easily cool a stock 12600k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if you already have the money for both and donâ€™t mind the extra expense why not just get the 12400f lol itâ€™s obviously more powerful and suitable for your usage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'd get the 12400f for the extra cores since background apps are being run,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"depends on your gpu if you are planning to get gpu which is 3060ti/rx 6700 or higher get 12400f

it's really a budget question.,"the 12100(f) is perfectly fine for the majority of people, at this time.",you can pair it with a cheaper motherboard since it doesn't require much power.,the 12400(f) is a bit more capable now and in the near future.,you should probably pick a slightly better motherboard for it.,"cheaper motherboards might limit your ability to upgrade, if that is relevant.","for games, your number one priority is a good gpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3. set wattage  long running to cpuâ€™s ark recommendation unless running hot.",i have mine set to manufacturerâ€™s 125w.,4. same as 3 except short duration: 140w.,intel recommends 150 but iâ€™m trying to just cool off cpu a smidge by preventing it from spiking too high.,"5. set dynamic offset to -, mine is set to .04. if i set to .06 it freezes during benchmarks.","so iâ€™ve done all of that, and during heaven 4.0, a moderate benchmark, i am getting temps in the low 80â€™s; which is way too hot.",iâ€™ve tuned sff before very successfully on airâ€¦.,but a larger case with a larger air cooler.,maybe i am just expecting too much at these levels?,"looking for adviceâ€¦

oddly, the gpu, an rtx 3060ti, with an undervolt and over clock set via afterburner, sits in the lower 60â€™s during same bench under air.",so thatâ€™s more on par for me.,and thus why i think i am totally missing something here with alder lake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you making a barebone system with a -k cpu?,why are you so hung up on using coolers that just aren't sufficient?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if even a undervolt is too hot for your cpu then you probably dont have sufficient cooling....i know these processors run hot but unless you have a 12700k or 12900k then honestly the 12600k should be somewhat easy to manage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol.,good question!,i like the challenge.,"and, with all of the tunable parameters that alder lake has, i am confident i will be able to dial in settings that retain performance at lower voltages / watts / tdp.",i have had great success in the past..: this build is just being stubborn; plus alder lake is a seriously new platform.,there is a fair chance i did poor in the silicon lottery.,"if thatâ€™s the case, i can move the i5 to my previous gen sff and try my i7-12700k in this platform!","on the surface that sounds crazy, but if the silicon is good, i can pull it off.","as a last resort, i can switch motherboards with another build that has an i9-11900.","(non-k, 65w low tdp).","if anyone has suggestions other then h2o, iâ€™m always open to learning new things.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

totally agree; i have a thin 120mm noctua over the fin array thinking it would be both quieter and thermally more efficient; however i can put the oem fan back on and re-bench.,and i still have to say iâ€™ve read alder lake is just a totally different beast to undervolt and ocâ€¦.,"so while my thermals did improve the 10c cooler with bios now taking my slight undervolt, thereâ€™s gotta be other parameters that are specific to alder lake i can totally tune and get this machine back to decent thermals.",i have heard of others successfully using previous gen procs with cryorig no problemâ€¦ leaving me to believe itâ€™s just missed settings.,"as an analog, my rtx 3060ti which technically has more tdp than the i5 settles at a very decent 60c under same benchmark.",(heaven 4.0; cinebench doesnâ€™t stress gpu).,the new ampere gpus undervolt exactly the same way as predecessors; so thatâ€™s another reason i think itâ€™s something iâ€™m missing with alder lake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah, this is the catch: b660 is an unmitigated disaster of a chipset, as far as vrms go.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if you're not overclocking that thing, maybe you should save a few bucks and get the non-k model.","the differences are really minor, on paper (100-200mhz turbo).","that motherboard has been proven to be a solid board, but there are some b660 boards that are a bit cheaper, but still perform alright.","here are some of them tested, with a focus on vrm: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pea0vcj0lry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pea0vcj0lry)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you should look into the 12700f then, $310 no overclocking or igp, but 97% of the performance of the 12700k",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah iâ€™m just going for the k thoigh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so functionally you have to spend about three-quarters of the price of a decent z690 board to get a decent b660 board.,what a scam.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

apparently the asus h610m-a can basically run a 12600kf.,it's not exactly cheap but at least you aren't paying for expensive yet underwhelming trash.,it looks like the vrms are just about capable for that (circa 125w) but undervolt and/or lowering clock by 0.1 or 0.2 goes a long way.,like on my 11700f 3.8 and 4.0ghz with 8c8t (not even 8c16t) is a 20 watt difference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

for matching hardware from 2020?,this needs to be for below $500.,demand is already fading for current gpus and prices have fallen in comparison to rising stock.,"who wants to beta test for hardware that is essentially 2 years old, selling for anywhere approaching $700, and will be replaced in a few months by the rx 7000 and rtx4000 series?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they need to be cheap to break into the market tbh.,i'm glad they're adding competition but for me personally i won't be interested in one until they catch up to the high end of nvidia and amd.,"after a few years if they gain a decent market share, have good driver support, and offer performance on par with nvidia 80 series then i'll seriously considering one and at that point intel will be able to charge more of a premium.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

pricing is an impossible thing to get right when it's months away.,because as we all know current gpus are being sold way over their msrp.,for example my evga 3080 ftw3 ultra cost me $810 in 2020. it's still being being sold for $1200+ for the worse lhr model.,"that's 50% over msrp...

the flagship arc gpu is supposed to be 3070 ti levels of performance, that gpu has an msrp of $600 but is selling for $800-$900 these days.","if the flagship arc gpu launched today, intel could definitely charge $700+.","but it won't launch today, so i think intel should be expecting to slightly undercut nvidia msrp, so aim for $550 for their flagship, assuming prices continue to trend back to msrp.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel arc has a 0% install base, they are going to sell these at a loss and they don't care about that because this is only their 1st gen graphics card.","they have to build up an install base, with an install base comes feedback and bug reports, with feedback and bug reports comes better features and more optimized software like drivers, and with those then developers will start optimizing for arc.",then they can start pricing products similar to their competitors equivalents.,"so yeah, alchemist cards are going to be practically given away, you're going to see core+alchemist bundles... intel is just going to be like ""you're buying a core cpu?","here, take this alchemist gpu with it for free!""","not obviously $0 free but it might as well be, because it's going to be for the low.","but yeah, like i said... it's about building an install base and a community before profits in these early stages.",the top arc dgpu will have 3070 ti performance in some games for the price of a 3060 ti... so ~$449,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if it matches or beats 3070ti performance, it needs to be significantly cheaper than 3070ti's msrp.","so, maybe around $500 for the fe card, slightly more for aib?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"at this point, they'll practically give them away if necessary, even 4mil produced will be a drop in the bucket revenue-wise.",i expect they'll be the cheapest option for the performance by a decent margin (15-20% under amd?,"), with obvious caveats like variance game-to-game and amd/nvidia having new generations coming out soon.","gpu markups are dropping fast right now so predicting exact numbers a few months out is impossible, but i think amd/nvidia will be much more reluctant to kill their margins than intel here, and there's plenty of reason not to buy one of these arc cards anyway.","laptops will surely continue to be the focus though, it's the best way to sell them for cheap without miners and middlemen jacking up prices.","the focus will also have to be on efficiency anyway instead of performance, which is more suited to mobile applications.","if lovelace ends up too close to arc availability, i wouldn't be surprised if desktop ends up getting very few units.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
honestly i foresee $599 cost if itâ€™s really there with a 3070ti.,other models likely $549?,i donâ€™t see a huge gap between others companies and intelâ€™s own.,call me pessimistic but people always overhype pricing and competition of new gpus and frankly i donâ€™t see intel needing to undercut to such a degree in pricing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16gb of memory on the highest-end arc 7 laptop sku.,so i assume the highest-end desktop sku will have at least that much.,that memory would be wasted if it had a performance of less than 3080 or 6800xt.,there is no reason to have that much for 1080p gaming.,this means these cards are shooting for 4k.,"so i think it is almost guaranteed the top-end desktop sku will outperform or match a 3080, though perhaps not a 3080ti or 6900xt.",they alluded to the possibility of the integrated gpu working with a dedicated gpu.,"if you have integrated graphics, you may get more performance than just having the gpu and a non-integrated graphics cpu.",as for pricing.,"$1000 for the limited edition top sku, $850 for the standard top-end sku.",with the only difference being swag and design.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, given that it will be so close to lovelace/rdna3 , it is quite a tough spot.","i mean, shorty after this launches (unless more delays...) , it will be followed closely by next gen nvidia/amd that by all accounts will bring huge perf increases.","this arc gpu will be competing against the low-mid tier gpus of nvidia/amd, and will have to be priced accordingly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if it matching 3070 performance or better than im ready to pay 400$ just for raw performance assuming it comes with good day1 drivers.,features and driver optimizations will take time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'd like to see 100-150 for the top 3 model or lowest 5 model.,"for the 7 series, it depends on what the performance is.","if it's close to a 3070 or 3070ti, then that's where it'll be priced.",would be nice to see the top card at 499.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why is the writing upside down ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if they make this generation cheap enough to get their foot in the door and prove they can make some good gpuâ€™s iâ€™d be happy to see what intel can do and having another competitor in gpu market will help drive prices down.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"someone from intel, i think raja, said in a interview they could price it at break-even or less because they have 0 marketshare (although the letter, as far as i know, is prohibited by law).that said, i expect incredible pricing and i can't wait to grab the a780 and upgrade to a celestial card in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a touch under amd prices, so they can cannibalize the low tier and if they have a good product, maybe mid tier.",nvidia is untouchable in the high-end for now.,and i don't see intel being able to be of any threat in the first attempt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think performance will be a driving factor of price.,will have to see how the first generation performs with driver updates.,"could be a great gpu architecture, but lacking in driver support.",intel may have to undercut amd and nvidia's price points in order to be competitive or build superior products to compete.,i have faith intel could build well-performing low end gpu's.,"on the medium to high end, i'm not sure.","if intel's gpu lineup competes on the low to medium gpu performance range for a decent price, i think they can outfit the pre-built market with gpu's in the $300 range.","i'm still thinking in pre-pandemic amounts, because that's what people still want.","with prices relaxing, spending $600+ on a gpu is still excessive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

about 3.50.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
totally on board.,i would even go below 500$ for all the reasons mentioned above.,too slow too late to the game.,they had a shot if they would have come out in q1.,now - not sure who will really buy them tbh if all 30 series prices normalize and 40 series comes out in parallel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the top arc dgpu will be 3070 ti performance in some games for the price of a 3060 ti... so ~$449,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably cheaper than that i would hope.,3070ti msrp  is $600 and since the time it was launched i would hope that the same level of performance got cheaper.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
beats 3070ti performance for $449.99,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think with gpu prices dropping, it will be launched at a cheaper msrp.","3070 ti was launched in the middle of the gpu crisis, therefore it made sense for nvidia to cash in on more profits since aib and scalpers were taking it instead.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm still really skeptical their top end gpu in the first line will even match a 3070. i think they need to sell these things at a pretty large discount at first to gain market share.,like $200 cheaper than the competition.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
totaly agree buddy.,well spoken and well it's as you said.,"im sure it will all be like this :)

"i don't think this was ever intended to be ""high end"".",the chip is a lot smaller than the high end chips from nvidia and amd.,i think they went for more chips from limited wafer supply.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'd be surprised if the top end card is listed at any more than $400 msrp at launch.,obviously it will be selling for more than that just like everything else on the market right now but intel can be competitive at that price point and ensure the prices in general are lower than nvidia and amd to start.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i honestly don't see an intel card being competitive, at least in terms of ray tracing performance when even nvidia and amd struggle.","that means that if they are aiming to sell to gamers they have to compete at price to performance, rather than graphics features.",if they aren't significantly cheaper (20%) compared to an equivalent nvidia / amd card performance then i don't think they are going to have much success.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"at that price, it would be an attractive option, but it'll all come down to its performance.","if drivers are spotty and performance isn't even up to mid-grade competitor cards, it won't gain much market share even at that price.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

arc control seems to support iris xe.,going forward iris xe will be using arc control interface instead of igcc?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you should have pointed out that it is an arc driver, not regular.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>8.,"this driver, which includes optimizations for ulâ€™s 3dmarkâ® time spy and port royal benchmarks, has not been approved by ul.","by the end of april, we will be adding a toggle so that end users can turn the non-generic optimizations on and off.","with these optimizations off, there is no impact to integrated graphics performance and no impact to game and content creation performance.",oh good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gosh i wish the intel hd's got the arc control panel as well.,it looks so much nicer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that seems to be true based on their online kb articles.,"however, i can't find a way to actually install it.","i've upgraded to the latest driver on an iris xe (11th gen) chip, but i still have the old panel.","i've looked for instructions on how to install it, but while the description says it supports any 11th gen cpu or later, they only mention how it gets installed with arc discretes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it can't be worse than 6500xt..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh it can.,remember that this is the mobile sku.,"6500xt in mobile is always paired with rembrant apu that has the media engine/encoder, so that's not an issue .","also, the mobile intel/amd apus are all pcie gen4, so the issue with gen3 motherboards on desktop gpu is not present.","these are the two main issues of 6500xt desktop issue, which are not present when installed in a laptop.","plus, if you watched the video, given intels own benchmarks vs their igpu, this thing will be barely (if any) faster than the rembrant igpu (lol)  .","so yeah, much slower than 6500xt .but, wait for 3rd party benchmarks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no account required unlike geforce experience!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i don't see hardly any controls in that software for things like resolution, color, scaling, 3d settings etc.",is this supposed to only be like geforce experience or nvcp as well?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you know, seeing intel control panel evolved to this is really pleasant.","i used to despise graphics panel in gma 4500m, still hating it on hd era and finally gives it as passable with igcc.","this nailed what i had in mind on how radeon settings should've evolve which radeon software is a major letdown minus the relive reworks

they really targeted radeon software weakness primarily and just throw ""no account needed"" just to throw some jab to gfe.",i don't think it'll win in terms of 3d performance against nvidia and amd so the only way to get some market share is to sell it cheaper.,"a370 could've win against rx 6500 xt if priced right

oh and to spawn arc control is via alt + i, obviously copying radeon software of spawning overlay via alt + r. let's see if it's as problematic as relive that for whatever reason refuse to spawn when you press alt + r in-game or recording hotkey.",that irritates me when i tried to save some instant replay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its a shame that this is a feature today.,we live in a society.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is pretty exciting to me.,you can simply use the software features of the gpu you purchased without making an account,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
any performance reviews out yet?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other than first party benchmarks?,(which show the a370m as weaker than amdâ€™s rembrandt integrated graphics) no.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you really gonna spend money on a first gen gpu?,you are evolving backwards,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i wonder if av1 encoding is the same performance on all the arc skus, if so, it becomes really realistic to just buy a low-end arc gpu to do the encoding and leave the other gpu to do the game play.",since nvidia and amd still don't have any hardware av1 encoding ability.,i wonder if that would be possible...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my body is ready for 1440p 120 fps twitch streams.,about damn time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"considering my upload speed aren't great, this is a game changer to archive my footage at a much better quality in 5mbps",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well intel may have just sold me a gpu, av1 has been my goto for video rendering, but arc has its limits it says up to 8k resolution at 10-bit hdr?","i can't find any data on this, so i think this would work fine for me as i like to do 4k @ 45 mbps, software encoding has been better but i guess only time will tell.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">if av1 encoding is the same performance on all the arc skus

this is probably true.",edit: this is true.,"source:

hardware unboxed's video",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it should be very possible.,if i'm not mistaken most broadcasting software like obs already allows you to use secondary hardware for encoding.,"if twitch adds support for av1 intake, and until nvidia and amd also support av1 encode, it would be a great idea to pick up one of the 50w a350 or a380 and slot it in as an encoder for streaming.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or 1080p60 that doesn't fall apart with foliage or particle heavy scenes would be a start.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i agree.,"i think for non-partners twitch has an intake limit of 6mbps, this would massively improve the quality of streams if they added support for it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/rtx-30-series-av1-decoding/ they said they are working with twitch on av1, and if twitch support it, obviously it would take any av1 source, not just nvidia.","so, hopefully soon.",1440p 120 fps stream would be pretty sweet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love this aesthetically.,i canâ€™t stand hardware dipped in leds and racing stripes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i want this edition.,that's a very slick and nice looking dual slot card.,tired of those triple/quadruple slot monstrosities.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why limited edition?,do they have like super limited supply?,"thing will sell out in seconds, not even making a dent in the market.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the slim two slot design and average length makes me think this card would be in the rtx 3060 ti or lower performance range.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"looks good, performs ?",??,?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you still need to buy a triple and quadruple monstrosity if you want to get 3080+ performance levels.,you can get a 3070 or 6700xt at dual slot as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel hasn't clarified yet, but i think the reference design shown in this video is a ""limited edition.""",the aib versions won't be limited editions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the rtx 3070/ti fe model is also a dual slot card.,"this is made on tsmc n6, not samsung 8nm.",the power draw and heat output should be reasonable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wished aibs stay close to founders edition like designs as much as possible but that never seems to be the case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it actually is just informing the user that drivers provided from lenovo may have customizations to ensure compatibility with hardware included in the laptop such as mux switches for example.,intel drivers would not have those customizations but in ops case it makes no difference since they have a u sku processor without a mux or dgpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's probably a china exclusive cuz it has a backdoor the ccp could use if they wanted to lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there are much faster chips coming in q2 - a550m, a730m, a770m should beat 1650.   a550m about 2x performance of what was shown, and a770m \~ 4x performance.","(4x units, 4x ram+bandwidth, higher clock speeds).",the top chips will definitely beat 1650.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

cache is a place where data might be for faster access.,it is still accessed like it was in the main memory.,each cache line is associated with some memory addresses and when you try to access the memory the system checks if the data is in the relevant cache lines and if it is the cpu doesnâ€™t need to actually access the main memory.,in practice whatever has been recently accessed is in cache which makes sense since itâ€™s likely that same data will be accessed again.,the system also tries to predict what data is needed and use â€œprefetchingâ€ to get data to cache before it is needed.,that is on general.,i didnâ€™t check what the instruction you mentioned actually does.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">it's said that ldr loads data from ""memory"" into a register.","but if there is a cache hit, does ldr just load the data directly from the cache?",cache is part of the memory subsystem.,the ldr instruction generates requests to cache and if those fail it sends the request to the next level of cache and eventually the memory controller.,"conceptually it should be clear that this has to happen since if data is in cache it may not be in ram, so if you checked the ram address first you might get invalid data.",">similarly, if there is a cache miss, does ldr load the data into the cache first, and then to the register?",thank you.,"this is an implementation detail, but virtually all processors choose to do both in parallel to save time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

try tearing everything down and cleaning everything.,"in this process:   

- remove the cmos battery.",- clean the cpu's lga copper contacts with rubbing alcohol.,- clean memory contacts with rubbing alcohol.,- ensure there's no lint in cpu & memory sockets.,"be careful not to damage pins

i've seen the issue before (won't turbo, won't overclock if you try) in different cpus.",it's always been caused by electrical connection somewhere not making proper contact.,"- twice due to bent pins 
- a few times due to dust bunnies
- on notebooks with loose power plugs prevented the notebook from identifying adapters power capacity, which disables turbo
  - in some cases (particularly dell) they'll even go into limp mode and lock themselves at minimum frequency.",that's 800mhz or 1600mhz for mobile chips.,"- desktop chips usually limp at the base frequency, which i believe you may be observing.","however,  that frequency should be either 3.6ghz(regular limp mode) or 1.6ghz(power fault) for your cpu model.",odd that you're seeing 3.78ghz.,- perhaps you have the bus overclocked?,"if so, revert it and see if it starts boosting again.","- on compliant mobos, limp mode is supposed  to ignore custom bus speeds and run at the base 100mhz.",so that would be odd if it's allowing 105mhz (105*36=3780mhz) custom bus clock.,"however if the high base clock of 105 is causing limp mode, i suppose the mobo would just ignore the cpus request to limp, and the cpu would just disable turbo as your seeing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

they aren't 'not recommended'.,people just see that the 12600k is unlocked and overclockable and think you need to buy a $180+ z690 board.,"if you're not planning to overclock and don't need the extra z690 lanes or common features, then yeah a cheaper b660 makes sense over a z690 board.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i would advice against the ""cheapest"" b660 boards, as some of them have been shown to be proper rubbish, but you don't have to get a z690 unless you actually want to overclock.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"must be something with the vrm quality, as hardware unboxed have said about the b660 disaster.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the vrms may not support the full tdp of the cpus.,https://www.techspot.com/review/2426-intel-b660-motherboards/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 12600k is capable of overclocking so naturally you'd want to get a board that can take advantage of that.,"since around 10th gen however, their isn't really that much extra headroom anyway.",personally i'd skip the 12600k and get a locked 12700. there are some really crappy boards though that will throttle higher end chips though.,check for reviews that go over vrm testing and see if it meets your own needs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"idk man,people say you should get z series to oc...even though there's not that much headroom  in it,i still recommend a 12600k on a b series chipset as overclocking kinda just increases heat output,but i still recommend you get the locked i7 over the i5 if you can and unlock the power limits on it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a lot of it probably has to do with the fact that in previous generations, it didn't make sense to pair a k cpu with anything but a z series board.","this is definitely still true with chips like the i7 and i9, but the 12600k is unique because it's the only i5 with e cores.","if you want the 10 core i5 you are forced to buy the k, but if you're not interested in overclocking b660 is fine.",it's just a bit of an odd situation that intel has created.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, i am running i7 12700k on my msi b660 tomahawk without any problem.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah i'm not into ocing cus of the reduction of lifespan, so i suppose i'll take the b660 boards with i7 12700?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes.,"2 extra p-cores is no joke, even at stock thermal limits.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the quality of the vrm and related cooling seem to be one of the most critical factors, aside from what needs you have in regards to features.",prices can vary a lot.,"a good starting point would be the following tests, which are the most in-depth and broad comparisons i've seen yet:

you don't have to pick the very best, of course, but you want to avoid the worst offenders.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you really worried about your cpu lasting 40 years instead of 50?,"whenâ€™s the last time you honestly heard of someone, who wasnâ€™t like a super extreme overclocker, with a mysteriously dead cpu likely due to overclocking?",itâ€™s really not an issue.,"you donâ€™t need to overclock a k, but it does give you more versatility on settings and tweaking for stuff unrelated to â€œgoing fasterâ€.","i personally think the 12700 is one of the most interesting cpus in the lineup, but you would need to remove the pl1/2 power limits to let it stretch its legs versus a k chip.","which, while not technically overclocking, does fall under the same category.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can also undervolt it for better temps and lifespan.,"and unless i'm mistaken, uv is only available in z-boards as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
reduction of life span?,not really.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean it's what $100 more expensive?,what is this system going to be used for?,"12700 is a great cpu for multitasking, but if you're just gaming the 12600k is ideal.",if you're willing to spend the money the 12700 isn't a bad choice though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"very cool, i shall then take the 12700 instead",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"good to know, thank you, but i will go for the 12700 route",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intriguing, could you further explain?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in my place it's 60$ more but in gaming, will 12600k beat 12700 or no?",(i'm gonna mainly game but might also do video editing and more),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"without any mention of requirements or budget, this isn't a particularly useful advice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you'll probably have to do very serious overclocking to significantly reduce the life of a cpu down to a time frame that is likely going to matter to you.,"in practice,  after years you might have to just reduce the overclock to reach the same stability as before, or you might not.",you'll want to keep the heat under some level of control.,"how meaningful it is to overclock, is another matter, and varies a lot.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what do you do now?,"to be honest, most process engineering centric roles (i.e., stuff that is sort of ""unique"" to the type of work done at intel as opposed to a company in a different industry) will probably require an engineering degree.","i think a good entry point to work in semiconductor manufacturing for people who don't have as much formal education is in the ""equipment engineering"" side of things.",these are basically the folks who make sure the equipment that makes the chips is working as expected.,"it's a common landing area for people who have worked on large complex mechanical systems before with tight specifications (e.g., folks who did this type of work in the military often move into this area in the us).","there will typically be roles available in this area at both intel and its equipment suppliers (e.g., tel, asml, lam, applied materials, etc.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my friend went to intel at gdansk, poland (as a software developer).",initially he did write some code but overall it become more corporate weirdness than codding later on so he moved to a local small company to again have software to develop and maintain.,you can see their job listings so you can see what they would require from you.,also i would not be fixated at working at a big tech-corporate company (and even if 9 out of 10 times they will not hire juniors so you will need years of experience).,"ml, math, networks, gpus that what's likely the hottests right now for them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm a recent hire at intel so i can give my two cents.,since the ohio facilities are semiconductor fabs a lot of the jobs are going to be for process engineering and manufacturing technician jobs.,process engineering for a semiconductor fab can entail a lot of different engineering disciplines.,"device physics, chemical engineering, industrial engineering, all of these offer relevant skills.","the other role that will likely be employed a lot at such facilities are product development engineers, which is the role i was hired for.","these engineers are the ones responsible for sorting die, determining failure modes, and collecting and analyzing data for the foundry.",i can't go into specifics about how we do those things but what i can say is most pdes have a masters degree in ee or a bachelors with several years of experience in semiconductor engineering related roles.,dunno if that helps at all but i can try to elaborate on anything that's unclear.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i don't work for intel, but have been around the industry for a minute, specifically fab with a background in microelectronics.","there are a wide variety of roles that you can work at a fab, even if you don't have an explicitly engineering degree.","fabs need people to work in it, systems, manufacturing, engineering, cleaning, etc.","assuming you want direct fab involvement, there are two main branches - equipment and process.","those two branches are broken down into subbranches of engineering, or technicians in the respective equipment and process.","then there are owners, and sustainers.",process/equipment technicians don't have as aggressive of an educational requirement.,a lot of the equipment technicians that i have worked with in the past are former military but not exclusive.,"the process technicians that i worked with ranged from former nurses, chefs, etc.","as much as a lot of people like to crap on technicians, they are some of the smartest people i've worked with.","if you are wanting to go into the fab engineering be it process or equipment, you are likely going to need an actual engineering degree.","be it ee, cheme, microe, meche, etc.","you can be a process engineer with a meche degree, just like you can be an equipment owner with a cheme degree.","imo, what is really important is an ability to think, solve problems, and often times be like - yo, i am completely lost, please help.","some people like owing processes/equipment, while for others, they're cool with working their shift, and going home.",it often depends on what your goal is.,most roles (company to company) are going to be similar.,"a lot of fabs use similar tools as others (there are a few big manufacturers, such as amat, tel, lam, asml, etc) and while fabs have generally unique processes, the concept is similar.","in the end, the role is to grow/implant the transistor, and wire them together.","that being said, software is going to vary significantly from company to company, so you are going to need to be able to learn and adapt to different software packages.",fab work can be very demanding.,"1st shift guys work long hours, and many of the shift guys work 12 hour shifts on days/nights, and split weekends (divided into front/back half days/nights).","you get a lot thrown at you and you need to prioritize what needs to be done, especially when your department might own multiple bottleneck toolsets.",if you want to get a job tomorrow.,"you can probably leverage your current experience and tailor your background for the complexities (adaptive, teachable, able to handle multiple things at once, driven, etc) to get a job as a process technician.","if you want to get a job as an equipment technician, you're going to show that you can work on equipment and are pretty driven (a lot of techs fix cars, work on their houses, etc).",prepare to spend time doing what some would consider more menial jobs (all experience is relevant in my opinion) before working your way up the technician ladder.,"some of the techs i know live very well, and have multiple cars, boats, etc.","if you are looking longer term, and are willing to go to school, most forms of engineering are probably good.","for design, probably ee/ce and the like (don't work in design so i don't know what they do all day - probably drink coffee and stuff).","for equipment/process engineering, most forms of the common engineering disciplines are probably pretty good.","take classes on chip manufacturing, etc, so you know sort of what you are getting yourself into.",the key is to get your foot in the door.,the semiconductor industry is a shockingly small field and it's not uncommon to know people that work at all the major fabs in the us.,"i have never worked for a vendor before, but that is also another way to get your foot in the door.","this is getting long, so if you have any more questions, feel free to hit me up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"absolutely nothing tech related, tbh.",the opportunity seems like it could be rewarding but i just need to really debate if itâ€™s worth starting engineering education basically fresh at almost 30 since minimal credits i have would apply.,"thank you for the input, this sort of thing is exactly what iâ€™m looking for because thereâ€™s no one answer, i know there are so many different positions all requiring different things which i think is what excites me.",iâ€™m in a government position with no forward motion and a big tech career just sounds better.,especially living so close to the new location.,"iâ€™ll continue to research, but hearing input from those in the industry is better",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
makes total sense.,sounds like making it more of a hobby than a dedication is the best choice at this point.,"it wasnâ€™t necessarily fixation, more opportunity/convenience since iâ€™ll live near the new location and theyâ€™re promoting massive position needs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you have an idea if a person with an ms-thesis degree in cheme can upgrade from process development (module engineer) to design engineer inside intel?,i recently go interviewed for a module and integration yield engineering position at intel and i was wondering if i could shift to the design aspect?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

so i've been here for a little over 4 months.,from what i've seen lateral movements happen all the time.,so if you have a desire to become a design engineer at some point in your career you can certainly take steps to make that happen.,how drastic of a change you're looking to make will certainly impact how long and difficult of a transition path you will have though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whatâ€™s you position at intel ?,and do you mind if i ask you more questions by dm ?,i would appreciate your insight on how things roll,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it depends.,it only has 2 cores and 4 threads.,"anything moderately resource intensive, like running android studio, will most probably suffer or just freeze, specially if you try to run the integrated android emulator.",you won't have the best experience if you want to run vms.,"but simple programs, like iterating throught dynamic arrays on c, maybe some basic java gui programs... should run more or less.",i had an i3 7100 and that was my experience.,"i would go for something with 4 cores and 8 threads, at least",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that cpu is only good for web browsing and writing an essay.,it will struggle to run a full fledged ide.,if you're comfortable using vscode or notepad++ for your web development then that's all it'll be good for.,wouldn't say it's good for programming by any means.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"depends on what you program, how big the source code is, how often you compile, etc, etc.","3520m is a 2013-2014 product, so it is quite a bit outdated and for 200-300 bucks you can find laptops with ryzen 4500u or ryzen 5500u that are 3-4x faster.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it should work for front end web dev just fine.,"if you are going to do backend programming, it depends on the language.",that would be slow for java or .net stuff but might be ok for basic node apps or php.,the other factor is what editor or ide you use.,you will likely be more memory constrained than cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no problem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i believe intel doesn't use a cowl because they want air from the cpu cooler to also help cool the vrm's.,"it's not a big deal when you have a nice diy build with a good power delivery design, chunky vrm heatsinks, and ample case fans, but it's needed for prebuilts running on the bare minimum.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"what a silly, yet cool hack.",i think i would've used some adhesive though!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did that years ago to mine in a usff build in an antec isk110 case.,also shrouded the mesh top to stop air from the heatsink deflecting off the mobo back out the mesh and straight back into the fan again.,by shrouding the mesh it also meant positive pressure inside the case pushed air across the ram and out the side vents.,https://imgur.com/a/xgv0kdk,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that might be, but if this guy's experiments results with the height/distance has merit, it might as well have been a case of material use and/or packaging volume.","really though, i think they were just making a cooler that was sufficient and could be considered ""cool""-looking enough.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there's still going to be just as much air exiting the bottom.,why they don't make a half decent stock cooler is beyond me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
get a used rx470/480/570/580 if possible.,it will slightly bottleneck a 1060 for sure though.,my friend ran one on a 2600k @ 4.2ghz and i was getting slightly better fps with an rx570 which is a weaker card.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
really depends on the game and resolution youâ€™re playing at,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gtx 1060 or rx 580 should be pretty good.,gtx 1070 is the most powerful gpu i would ever pair that cpu with.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
unfortunately i will run the thing without external power since the oem psu doesnt have an external gpu power cable.,so gtx 1650 is the highest i can go.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1080p, i play a lot of different games.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this now also depends on which settings you want to play at.,"a 1060, 970/980 or even a 1070 if you have some extra cash but at that point you might aswell upgrade your whole platform",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well i was told on another forum that 1070 causes significant bottleneck, so im thinking about a gtx 1650, is it ok?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"depends on settings, if you want to play dying light 2, bf2042 or cyberpunk for example at max settings, no.",but you're gonne be fine on medium settings on pretty much every game.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"im fine with medium settings even at 40fps , i am so tired of lowest settings with 10 fps anyway.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then the 1650 would be a good paring.,look out for the super variant too tho especially if they don't cost much more than the normal one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah already did, except that it costs more than a 1660 super here which i dont understand.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah idk all the market and commerce stuff but one possible reason is that nvidia released a bunch of new low end quadro cards that go in tons of office pcs and they all use the same underlying chip as the 1650 so the 1650 chips are probably in much lower supply now.,while the 1660 chips are still really only used for budget gaming cards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 12600 has no ecores, it's a regular 6core cpu.",the 12600k has 6pcores+4ecores.,the 12400 is a better deal than 12600 so the real question is 12400vs12600k.,"i'd argue that yeah, it's worth the price increase but perhaps you don't need it and the pure gaming performance is enough.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

12600k definitely.,it will last better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
either get the 12400 or the 12600k.,the 12600 is basically a better binned 12400 since it doesnt have the ecores.,only difference between the 12400 and 12600 is the igpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the 12600 has a somewhat better igpu than the 12400. when intel releases that feature that allows it to run along the gpu then you might seem better performance.,"so yeah, if all you do is gaming an it's only 20 bucks more, then it's worth the 12600 non-k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's called intel's deeplink but i'm sure it's only for alderlake and posterior cpus.,and we're still waiting for it.,it's an directx12 encoding software that was first seen in 2014 but it's just now being taken seriously.,"though amd already has crossfire and can make amd apu and amd gpu work together, the performance boost is not noticeable.","only case where using both is easy, doesn't give diminished returns, and can be done as of now: it's to use the controllers to make the igpu render the background, desktop and multiple monitors, meanwhile the gpu processes the applications.","though apparently the ""how to"" varies from case to case, dyor.",i think it's a double down in the big.little architecture that's honestly very interesting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

12600k is really nice piece of metal but as of benchmarks from recent months i would probably give it a second thought.,12400f can costs 40% less while having almost same fps (usually less than 10% difference) in games so purerly for gaming i would probably aim for b660 board and 12400f.,than can save you serious money which can go into better psu or graphic card.,second option would be buying 12700 (non k) again with b660 board.,will cost the same as 12600k with z690 board but you get more cores and for rendering it might be alot faster in the end.,i would aim for k processor only if you can uzilize it and possible do some few tweaks (overclock) it to squeez every little but from it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

very interested in the raptorlake vs zen 4 matchup.,seems amd has got a strong hand again from the leaks in terms of ipc also with avx512 officially supported.,amd clocking to 5.2-5.3 on tsmc 5nm vs intel superfin at 5.2-5.5... looking forward to full reviews and power draw comparisons!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

â€œdram controllerâ€ - alder lake imc certainly didnâ€™t help us realize the promise of ddr5.,"itâ€™ll always be odd to me how we buy ram based on xmp speed, but when the sticks you bought canâ€™t hit those xmp speeds, itâ€™s all â€œxmp is overclocking!",you didnâ€™t actually expect to hit the speeds listed on the packaging did you?!,itâ€™s probably your mobo/cpu/anything but the ram itself thatâ€™s to blame!,voltage tuning!â€,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how is this raichuâ€™s leak when heâ€™s simply stating  whatâ€™s been already leaked?,this makes zero sense to me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel has traditionally had the ringbus in different clock domain mostly due to power savings and sharing it with the igpu as far as i understand.,alder lake ring is comparatively slow (and at the same time makes l3 slow) compared to what amd can achieve within ccx (afaik amd cache always runs at the highest core clock speed).,now with alder lake the small cores force the ring clock low.,so where i see possible improvements is how the small cores are handled in the ring and how the small core clusters work with their shared cache.,i don't think frequency increases will happen in general.,we are so far out of efficient zone with current speeds that it makes little sense.,cache size increases probably have some minor effect but raptor lake doesn't increase l3 per core.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"never claimed raichu is the original leaker of all these parts, nor does even raichu claim he leaked it first (unlike mlid who has to be the first person who leaks everything lmao) on top of basically summarizing all the areas where he thinks raptor lake will be improved- which is helpful for people who don't follow everyone in the 'tech leaks' area.",what part is really confusing?,perhaps i can explain it...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the ring got separate from the core with haswell because the ring needs more voltage to hit the same clocks as the cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it was separated because they needed it to clock higher when playing video with cores at idle.,"this could be solved by placing the gpu next to the sa, and having a dedicated ring for that connection.",that would also allow them to drop the dual ring us introduced in tiger lake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yes, which is exactly why with node maturity and perhaps the new architecture, we could see higher clocks for the 13900k.","we already know it's possible for intel to hit 5.5ghz, and if hitting 5.5ghz on raptor lake means they will be able to compete with zen 4 st or even keep the crown, you know they will push it that far.","at the very worst, i highly doubt your take of frequency increases not increasing at all is realistic.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

these are my own opinions.,here goes.,i9 is the high end enthusiast line of intel cpu.,you should purchase this chip if you are a tweaker and are into performance.,what i mean is that this line of chip is the best for overclocking.,"users would typically install custom water cooling, use high end aio, and even consider exotic cooling methods when considering using an i9 in their system.",the i9 line are relatively new cpus.,"before this, the i7 was intel's high end line of cpus.",thus you semi fall into this category.,"some users even consider ln2, direct die, or tec coolers for these chips!",they are usually the better/best binned chips that intel will put out.,some users also buy this chip because they have money to burn and a 600 or 700 dollar chip paired with a 400 to 800 dollar board is not a lot of money for those users.,and which is why there are tons of motherboards that cater to this category of user.,they just like the features and like the control and to tweak settings.,its honestly kind of fun sometimes.,and there are some good games that can really take advantage of this extra boost in horsepower/performance.,shooters come to mind often along with nvidia g-sync and the large availability of modern high refresh rate displays!,"for the amd line of things, i am not as familiar with their ryzen 9 line of chips.","from my understanding and observations, it sounds as if overclocking on that platform is limited to the infinity fabric and often the pbo is better than manual tweaks.",i think direct die is a lot less normal on that platform along with the other tec cooling solutions.,i think their ryzen 9 series has crossed into the prosumer/consumer line of things rather than intel's i9 extreme/highend/overclocker line of chips.,that's my take pretty much.,"i am on the 14nm intel side of things currently, and i don't think i will upgrade until intel gets to the intel 4/3 side of their process technology!",i don't want to be an early adopter of windows 11 big.little but i rather wait and see how this new windows direction will proceed before i pull the trigger!!!,"that said, i5 is for regular gamers, i7 can be for a prosumer/consumer, and i9 is pretty much now the professional/extreme/highend/overclocker line of chips.",24 threads is a lot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm currently running an i7-3770k... it's served me well for nine years!,"that's why i was thinking perhaps staying at i7, even though the nerd in me says **you want _all_ the power** ðÿ˜†

i used to spend hours fine tuning stuff, but these days not so much.",can you  not undervolt non-unlocked processors?,"i was under the impression that the k-series just unlocked the multiplier, and thus you'd theoretically be able to undervolt even a ""locked"" processor.","that said, i also plan on running a corsair liquid cooler like the h115i so that should take care of *any* non-oc cooling needs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fair point.,although one thing my i7 proved itself for (back when it was cream of the crop) was longevity... hence why i'm still gaming on it nine years later ðÿ˜†,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, i9 didn't exist back when i built my current rig ðÿ˜… i'm thinking that i'll probably go for an i7-12700kf.","someone else (less than kindly) pointed out that the base tdp isn't a terribly useful comparison any more, and the turbo tdp between the 12700f and 12700kf isn't that significant -- nor is the price.","i'll be picking up a new aio cooler (corsair h110i) for it, so that should keep it cool and quiet.","i don't intend to adopt win 11 just yet, i'll probably disable the e cores if they give me performance headaches in my games.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would say stay with the i7 and get the k version !,for i9 you are getting a diminishing return!,the extra money can be saved or used for other stuff to improve your experience!,"the whole thing of future proofing does not depend fully on the i5 vs i9 , it depends on the generationâ€¦having i5 then upgrading in shorter cycle is better than having i9 and upgrading in longer cycleâ€¦ i honestly think it is time to upgrade you cpu â€¦ the thing with tuning the cpu is that it wonâ€™t work easily, undervolting and having access to manipulate avx load is usefulâ€¦anyway if you donâ€™t want headache get the normal version but i would recommend the k version as you could want to play a little with the cpu then you have the option â€¦ just my 2 cents , also a big deciding factor for you is which gpu are you going to pair with the cpu â€¦.","and try to match them in a sensible way, like high end gpu requires high end cpu and vise versa !",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea tdp is a really weird number.,none of the current aftermarket cooler makers even report their cooler's capable tdp numbers.,i think it is more used/useful for the cooler manufacturer to know the chip tdp number than it is for the actual consumer.,i think 12700kf is a fine cpu.,it has a lot of what the 12900k has just less e cores.,"it is also on intel 7 which is very comparable to tsmc n7, so a cutting edge node!",every chip available for you to purchase today is an excellent chip.,"intel 7, big.little, pcie 5.0, ddr5, and more.",there is also the ever looming 12900ks (5.5ghz first consumer chip) that is available for purchasing.,"[https://youtu.be/rwt1tmqvkmg?t=1081](https://youtu.be/rwt1tmqvkmg?t=1081)

only thing that you should know in your purchasing is that there are two alderlake cpu designs.",if you pickup the kf or f or k you will likely have the first design.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, i'm leaning towards i7-12700kf right now.",i've got a 2070 super already that will be going in there.,"not the best, i know, but i've gone through three graphics cards upgrades since i last built my system, and i expect that i'll be doing another one within the next 2-3 years anyways so it's good enough for now ðÿ™‚ i usually don't go for the flagship (unless i happen to get a fat tax refund, which is what's funding this build!)","but instead a step or so down, and since i'm not always playing the ""latest and greatest"" games, it takes a while for me to feel the cards' age.","god, listen to me, i sound like an adult, not a gamer.",kill me now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel flagship cpus used to be a whole different pricing ballgame.,"like, extreme series or hedt.",even the 12900ks is cheap compared to those.,"happy with my 12900k i got almost 5 months ago, but if i were buying nowâ€¦ i would be super tempted by the ks.","otherwise, iâ€™m more interested to see what the 13900k brings, since i do have a spare z690 motherboard i could always populate with my current cpu :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no need to be tempted with the ks, almost all 12900k can reach 12900ks performance (all core 5.2 ghz) through overclock with the same 260w power limit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"perhaps, but i didnâ€™t exactly win the silicon lottery and only have an sp82 (sp91 on p-cores).","itâ€™s just fine at stock, no issues with temps on air cooling, but reaching those speeds would likely need too much voltage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
doesnâ€™t seem totally out of line for an affordable gaming laptop?,"couldnâ€™t really find any reviews of the 12th gen version with actual useful numbers, but the 11th gen seemed to hit high 80s regularly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tried intel xtreme tuning?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"actually that's the reason why i am posting in different subreddits, because normally i would find solutions online, but 12th gen is pretty new and there's not much online about it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"keeps prompting me to update it from interl.com even though i have downloaded the recent one from the website, so don't know what that's about.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what gpu?,how much ram?,which games?,how much cpu usage do you see in those games?,"similarly, how much gpu usage do u see in those games?",please give us all this info,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
checked your component usage?,odds are is that your i5 is being pushed to the max,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
run a known benchmark on your cpu.,are the temps and scores as expected?,then itâ€™s not your physical cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sry for the lack of info.,gpu.,"rtx 3050, vengance 16gb, 1666mhz ram, god of war, for honor.",gpu usage:60-70% on high graphics.,cpu usage: 100:%.,the games have ran very well before but now its much worse.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the thing is that my games have ran fine up until this point.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i ran one earlier and it's said that the cpu was performing way under expectations.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your cpu is just bottlenecking.,get a new cpu lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well have you checked your usage though

iâ€™m just trying to see cause knowing the 4670k it can be pushed very easily to the max due to its limited thread and core count

perhaps youâ€™re running something in the background which is ramping up usage but idk",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which benchmark was that?,"run something you can compare the numbers to from actual reviews of that chip, not just random online submissions.","if it does show poor performance, then there will be a cause - like heat, bios settings, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah that's the first thing that came to mind but i wasn't sure.,thanks for the help!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was checking that but it was just the games themselves,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i  ran userbenchmark,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also like i said.,temps are fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'll never understand the logic with the alder lake i5s.,"the 12400 is the value chip (great), the 12500 adds slightly better graphics (niche, but ok), and the 12600k adds e cores and overclocking (awesome).",why on earth did they not make the 12600 locked with e cores?,"there are plenty of folks interested in the multithreading advantages of the 10 core, but have no interest in overclocking.","it seems so obvious to me, but who knows.",it will be interesting to see whether or not they do something similar with raptor lake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 12600 is the odd man out.,the 12700 and 12900 didnâ€™t change the 12700k or 12900k core countsâ€¦ so why did the 12600 over the 12600k?,"the actual 12600 should have just been a lower power 6+4, and whatâ€™s currently called the 12600 should likely have been the 12500.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"even though they do write that you can't normally overclock it, they still include overclocked results in the graphs.",it's a bit silly.,"also, overall, i think they went to great lengths to reach a conclusion that doesn't surprise anyone.",you're better off picking the 12400(f) or the 12600k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they should make an unlocked 6 core, something like a 12500ks.","it would have lower memory latency, and higher clocks with less power.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"absolutely baller chip if your use case is 100% gaming (without oc), at the right price, and availability, which may be a giant caveat for most of its useful life.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i can get this chip for almost the same price as 5600x in my country lmao.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12600 is performing like a beast 2c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there was no reason for intel to when amd was being greedy and selling a worse 5600x for $300.,"the 12600k was cheaper and better than the 5**8**00x, while the 12400 was $100 cheaper and matching the 5600x.","and amd provided no competition below the 5600x for budget buyers, so why would intel make a 6c+4c 12600 that would only eat into 12600k sales, when the only competition at the time was with their own cpu's.","amd has now cut prices and is going to release some cheaper cpu's, and guess what?","12600k prices are already below msrp to stay competitive, and i wont be surprised if the 12600k ends up closer to $250 in the next couple months.","dont get me wrong a 12600 6c+4c that launched at like $250 msrp wouldve been amazing for consumers, but business wise it made no sense with what amd was offering at the time and intel already offering better price to performance with the 12400 and 12600k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"arguably even the 12600k(f) doesn't make a whole lot of sense when you can get a 12700f for $43 more, you can get the difference by just dropping by from z690 to b660 (although i have seen quite a few people this gen go with 12600k(f) and b660, which just seems like a weird combo for a cpu that can overclock).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
traditionally intel has rarely directly responded to amdâ€™s pricing structure like that.,"otherwise they could have charged $600 for an consumer i7 that beat the construction equipment, and even more for hedt where amd had no hedt.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's a fair point.,that said i think a 10 core 12600 non k would have done well with oems (which intel cares more about than enthusiasts).,"you don't exactly see a lot of say, dell computers out there with k sku chips.",right now they don't even have the option for e cores unless they use the 12700 or 12900.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's a weird combo because the 12600k(f) doesn't fit neatly into a single category.,"it has 6 p-cores like the rest of the i5s, but also 4 e-cores otherwise present on the i7s.","on top of that, they unlocked it.",it's like a hybrid.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i'd upgrade to a new board and a 12th ""gen"" cpu if wanting to stay on intel, or a b550 or x570 board and amd ryzen 5000 series if wanting to go amd.","either way, yeah i wouldn't stay on that board.","you can re-use the memory though, no need to swap that out yet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> when i am playing games, even on low setting, and not at full screen the cpu is running at 100%

so you lower the settings and resolution?","of course that's gonna start to create a cpu bottleneck, especially on a 3070.

also, you haven't mentioned what resolution you're playing at or games you're playing, you should edit the post and include that, also include the settings you play the games at (high resolution/settings you play at the more the bottleneck will end up on the gpu, however certain games can be very demanding).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have 34 duo with 12700k.,"gaming wise it works out of the box, but for cinebench r23 i undervolted a bit but kept the normal clocks.",now with a quite silent cpu fan profile the temps stay under 75c while gaming (pubg).,can recommend.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have it, the single fan version.","it's 60 above ambient in cinebench r23, pulling 165w and being very silent.",it's 12700f.,"when i tried prime95, it throttled in 10 seconds and went to 100c, pulling 205w.","in gaming it's quite cool, only 30-40 above ambient.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so that should probably mean that with non k version would work slightly better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you use the lga 1700 mount?,- my build is almost ready and i'm eager to use my pc but i have to wait for the mount\* but since you said out the box does this still apply?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you using the default mount that came with it?,(the non lga 1700),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"unless you oc the k part to the moon, the difference between the stock non-k and stock k boils down to power limit, which you can freely scale on both.",you can run a non-k at 200w.,you can run the k at 65w.,"at any given power limit they will both perform basically, within a margin of error, the same, with similar heat outputs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably.,though my 12700k usually doesn't consume much more than 60 watts while gaming either.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the new mount was included only with the black and white version atleast in the shop that i bought it from.,(finland),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, i bought the lga1700 mount, but it did seem to me regular mound could work.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"damn, i guess it hasn't reached me yet, might have to check the box again to be sure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"did you order it directly from them, if so, how long did it take?",i just placed one through them because the ones on amazon where only for their other products despite looking the same.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i bought it from the local shop.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i mean, is kinda easy to beat that record, all the processors i've put to run haven't moved an inch after days",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"no ty, gen 13 all the way, 13900k",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my guess is raptor lake 13900k or 13900ks will be the most powerful cpu for lga 1700 since meteor lake probably requires a new motherboard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that bottom row is confusing to the layman.,8 performance cores no wait 16 on performance cores,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean is it tho compared to like xeon's or threadrippers?,"or does fastest just refer to ghz, cause... i mean that's not all that matters?",i want one tho.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12900ks + rtx 3090 ti is the perfect combo for bragging the next couple months until new releases come out in september.,but i still think it's not enough to run cyberpunk 2077 in decent 4k 60fps in quality rtx on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

may i ask what are you using for the pc?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"12700k, not the cpu i wanted to have (long story), its a great processor but i'm looking to pick a processor i actually want in my pc now, as long as my nh-d15 can perfectly handle it.. which i have real doubt for the 12900ks",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's nice to hear!,":) 

btw i just saw the price of the 12900ks on my country and its 980â‚¬ - 1000â‚¬... where the classic k is ""only"" at 595â‚¬

not a huge problem as i have the money but i don't feel spending that much compared to the normal version for only a 300mhz bump with no gurantee that my cooler will 100% handle it, i'm just gonna pick up a simple 12900k and be happy with it for years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,"[the 12900k overclocked can easily reach 300~400w](https://wccftech.com/intel-core-i9-12900k-overclocked-to-5-3-ghz-across-all-cores-with-1-44v-voltage-hits-insane-400w-power-consumption-in-aida64-stress-test/), and a nh-d15 is simply not going to handle that.","if you read the article, even with the radiator immersed in ice water, the 12900k was shutting down due to excessive temperatures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
glad to hear that!,:d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah i see, no doubt that the 12900ks will be faster for lower voltage than a oc'd 12900k but in my country the ks version cost 400â‚¬ more than the regular k (595â‚¬ k / 980-1000â‚¬ ks) so it's simply not worth it in my end

that's said, i should have a regular k very soon and try to see which oc i can get with it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

intel almost always does 2 generations per chipset/socket.,so its not really a surprise that raptor lake will be on lga1700 too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
am i wrong?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah i think the main difference in ~~less l3 cache than 9900k but~~ better heat dissipation due to a thinner ihs on the 10700k

 ~~so lower l3 cache~~ but better thermal conductivity means that they are more or less the same

idr differences in clock speed atm but i think 9900k had slightly faster maximal boost or something

edit: they have the same amount of cache apparently my b",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
basically; though 10700k outperforms the 9900k because 10700k has more of the spectre/meltdown type mitigations in hardware instead of microcode/software,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's no different than amds claim that their new processor is the ""worlds fastest gaming cpu"" just weeks before this intel announcement.",in all games?,really?,they tested all of them?,at least intel's claim is objective fact.,it has the highest factory boost speed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

how are thermals on your 12700k right now?,i'm looking to upgrade to it soon and i was worried how my nh-d15 will handle it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's a fairly extreme oc you'd only do under extreme cooling methods anyway.,"""oc"" can be anywhere between extreme or mild and a mild oc doesn't use much more power than stock.",you start oc'ing under a d15 you're gonna naturally run into the thermal limits and cap your oc off there.,you wouldn't oc it under extreme cooling and then just swap out to a d15 and try to rock it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10700k had much better performance under spectre and meltdown mitigations than the 9900k did due to some changes intel made.,"https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=3-years-specmelt&num=9 this gives a highlight, where the 9900k loses a lot of performance under mitigations while a 10900k loses almost no performance (as would a 10700k)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"or you could run without the mitigations, and get superior performance on the 9900k",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it is different because when you say ""it's the fastest"" people expect it to actually *perform better* in something.",highest clock speed doesn't actually make the slightest bit of difference to anyone except maybe extreme overclockers who like to set records.,"it's not like it would have been difficult for them to get some data to back up a more meaningful claim, it's not like there are actually any faster gaming cpus right now.",maybe they didn't want to illustrate how little of a difference a small clockspeed bump actually makes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

apparently its max 240tdp lool,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i believe that had to do with whether you had the r0 or p0 revision of the 9900k.,"if you got an r0, you had hardware level mitigations.","if you had p0 (the original 9900k), you had the option of software level mitigations but you could turn them down.","also, 9900k and 10700k both have 16mb l3 cache.","they aren't identical cpus, as p0/r0 (cfl) is an 8c die, while q0 is a 10c die, but they are pretty much the same in terms of usable performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

but performance you get at all running w10 is lower than running w11.,of course you can disable e-cores and gaming performance will be similar like on w11.,but youâ€™re turning off 12600k features and run like standard 12600. so itâ€™s waste of money,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"upgrading to any lga1200 cpu while you're already on am4 is a bad idea, especially with cheaper zen3 cpus and zen3 on 300 series motherboard support supposed to be coming out in the next few weeks.","if you're dead set on intel, then a b660 and either a 12400(f) or 12700(f), however it would make far more sense to wait for the 5600 non-x or 5700x and support for it for your motherboard to come out, if you were to consider the 12700(f) then it would make sense to jump over to intel, in multi-threaded performance it's very similar to a 5900x while being cheaper, you can get a 12700f with a good b660 motherboard for the same price as a 5900x, however if the best gpu you plan on going with is a 3060ti then a 5600(x) or a 12400(f) should be more than sufficient.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lga1700 and 12th gen. 11th gen is crap.,12400f is almost 2x in multithread performance vs ryzen 1600 and the single core boost also is quite huge.,so i would buy a b660 + ddr4 + 12400f.,it should do well with the 3060 ti.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can get a 12700k on sale for $350 in the us which is a great deal.,it pairs perfectly with a 3080 for seamless gaming with no noticeable drops in frame rate on a 1440p/165hz monitor using g-sync.,i'm running both mildly oc'd with air cooling just fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you're running a gtx 1660, it's not the cpu holding you back really, and a cpu upgrade alone won't gain you a lot.",upgrading to a z590 board an 11th gen is bit weird as well.,maybe wait until a similar style of motherboard comes out for intel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'd just get a 5600x and that's coming from an intel fan boy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm assuming you have a decent motherboard which can handle ryzen 5000 series processor.,that will be a much better plan imo.,"i know gundam series from asus is quite compelling but spending money on z590 platform may not be the best choice, seeing we already have 12th gen and new amd processors just in few months of time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
any specific one you recommend from 12th gen?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"there's also the new 5500, 5600 and 5800x3d coming out in a few weeks.","if you game at 1440p, any of these cpus will be good upgrades with a 3060 ti assuming mb capability.",(you can drop the 5500 if at 1080p).,i'd wait out a gen or two now and wait until ddr5 matures.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on your budget i guess,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12600k or 12300. these are the best.,i paid $240 for my i5 12600k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"id first see whats bottlenecking your build, depending on what type of games, settings, and framerate, maybe have some monitoring programs up to see whats holding you back, if its cpui agree with looking at the 5600x, if you have a budget of $300, you can get that cpu after support is added, for (usa) $229 amazon or $209 microcenter and no need to get a new motherboard, then add that money to whatever your gpu purchase will be.","&#x200b;

edit: another option too maybe a ryzen 3600 used if you can get it for like less than $150, saw some listings on ebay going for like $130 or lower, and might get cheaper once support for the 5000 series comes to the b350s and x370s",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think the $300 range is okay.,maybe below or a little bit above.,something that would pair well with a 3060,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

definitely, at this point people just want to get halfway affordable gpus, even if they're above msrp, if they can release a gpu that's more powerful than the 6500xt that isn't bottlenecked by pcie pcie (has at least 8 pcie lanes) then it'd do very well for the budget market (which is lacking right now, hasn't been any decent budget offerings in about 4-5 years).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">take a normal 12900 and lower the pl2 in bios to 35w and lower the max clock speed by 100 mhz

i believe you actually need to do slightly more than that and lower turbo ratios for multiple core further, or the boost logic will mess up your efficiency (far too much voltage) if all core target is like 4.8ghz, instead of somewhere around 3.7 like a 11900t.","from my testing you can gain up to 20-30% performance by underclocking a lot, if the power limit is extremely far off the 'target clock' power draw",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i wonder if some of those kits have already shipped with coolers.,"it sounds like they are implying on their website it's a slower rollout, and maybe you can get lucky depending on if it's a new shipment or if it's been on shelves for 3 months.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
shipping was pretty fast.,you just email them on their site with proof of purchase of the 12700k and drp4 and i think they approved it within like a day for me and shipping only took a few days to arrive after that.,the drp4 might include an lga1700 bracket with it now though i'm not sure.,when i bought mine it was right when 12th gen had released so it wasn't included in the box yet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"gaming which is all i go, my cpu stays in the 60s.if i we re to fire up a stress test, it would go up to 92c.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that might be true, but i have yet to see an air cooler with three fans on it, so i don't think it's the best comparison, and yes, an aio has very different mounting and airflow requirements.",there are both pros and cons to this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they rate it for 180w.,"i can't say it'll run under 90c when you're stress testing with like cinebench or blender for 10 minutes+, but in like gaming workloads it should be in the high 70s, or low 80s.",pretty average temps.,"as long as your case as good airflow, and not a totally sealed front panel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i havenâ€™t actually done any overclocking with it.,"it does have higher base and boost clocks, which does mean higher power consumption and more heat generated.","honestly you could probably get by fine with a cheaper cooler, but i love how quiet noctuaâ€™s 140mm fan is.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i always like to build outside the case first, and did run into some difficulty getting the everything in with the cooler already installed.","was especially tough because the case i wanted was on back order, so i put the system into a cramped case and then had to get it back out.","didnâ€™t have any issues in my new case though, so ymmv.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i pull around 155-160 watts.,i also set my cpu cooler tuning setting to 'boxed cooler' in my msi bios setting.,this ensures the power draw doesn't get out of hand.,this in tandem with my offset keeps the power draw low.,"i also don't oc at a since i don't really see the need for marginally better benchmark results and fps gain, if at all.",edit: i basically run my kf like a non k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no i didn't have the patience for that.,i just bought it for 5 â‚¬.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes you are correct, a slow rollout started so if you have a 2022 stock yes you may get 1700 kit.",otherwise getting kit seperately from deepcool was not hard for me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah man, it's likely to go that route if you want to use it like that, but if you do video conversion for example it may throttle by much.",i think gammaxx 400 pro with double 56 cfm fans should run better though.,"at least you'll be looking at 3 to 5 degree improvement, but why risk it when you can buy neptwin for a little more?",it's your central processing unit after all...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ye that's def fair, my new case was pretty big.",working around things wasn't terrible (phanteks p500a).,but i would always check the mobo screw spots because i had like a cm of room to screw one in once the cooler was on.,"also, good idea to check for system fan ports on mobo as one of them for mine was kinda blocked by the cooler for me (luckily the board had more than enough ports).",it comes down to preference and the parts you have forsure.,"for me, putting thermal paste on and putting the cpu cooler on was the most stressful part so once that was done i was good to go",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ah ok, thanks for the info.",80c at that wattage is right in line with my findings with the vetroo.,im on 11700k instead though.,are the cinebench scores competitive with other 12700k users with the power draw being contained?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes its good definitely.,"although i'm sceptical my mobo is bending as the plaque of lga 1700 , because of that it may be not touching ihs properly.",but other than that even in my 30â°c ambient temperature.,its able to maintain 80â°c while stressed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you need it now?,buy it.,you don't need it?,don't buy it.,"you could wait for the next gen indefinitely, there will always be a newer product to wait for.","there are worse or better periods of time to buy something, but you can't always predict and know everything.",if there's a massive technological upgrade right around the corner and the current tech is on its deathbed you'd want to wait.,otherwise just buy what you need.,right now the 12600 is a solid pick and will be enough for some time.,that being said right now the biggest shift in pc is ddr5 and pcie 5.,12th gen supports pcie 5 so you won't miss that.,"it's to early for ddr5, do you want to wait?",ddr4 is still fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there is no good answer, but i would buy now, unless you want to get all the frames you can get, wait for 13th gen or zen 4. considering you are keen on the 12600k, you are looking for something mid range.","so yea, i would buy now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was at a 6700k and upgraded to a 12600k on release.,"with a 3080 and 1440p, yes your 8700k is the bottleneck.","you could go z690 + 13th gen for ddr4 as z790 *may* be ddr5 only, but you could still run raptor + ddr4.",expect end of the summer around the same time as zen 4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

h670 is not â€œbetterâ€ than z690.,"itâ€™s not very popular with manufacturers because it kind of fills a non-existent void for something slightly cheaper and slightly less feature-filled than z690â€¦ but by the time you load it up to capabilities that would actually exceed a good b660 board, youâ€™re about at the same cost as lower end z690.",so why not just get a z690 and have the best chipset and more pcie lanes to go around?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

h670 has memory overclocking.,seem really the same as b660 for the most part.,"maybe it has more usb, pcie, or sata support or something.",it's probably not worth it over b660.,"not much point in getting a z690 board since you generally can't overclock the 12400f itself, only memory.",except for a couple of super expensive boards that found a workaround on cpu overclocking.,"there have been rumours that the b660 steel legend supports cpu overclocking through bclk, but i can't find any confirmation.",no idea if h670 would also have that then.,but being able to oc a 12400f to 5ghz would make it a great deal if possible.,but no one seems to know for sure.,"asrock has a bad reputation because their low end boards really suck, and throttle some more power hungry cpus down quite a bit on purpose.",the temperature is not really a concern when you're using a 12400f as the total power draw is a joke.,the super cheap boards might not have that effect on the 12400f.,no idea about the more mid end boards you mention.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"everyone basically answered your question, but i want to add the intel integrated graphics have never really been that great on desktop.",it's mostly for basic stuff or old games at lowest settings.,"if you're looking for something to actually play a lot of newer games on, you'll have to look elsewhere.",it's fine for basic things though.,i wouldn't buy a whole new cpu just for the intel integrated graphics on lga1200.,your money would be better spent on something else.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol i have the 10100f,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
youâ€™ve got your sockets mixed up.,lga 1200 is used on x4xx and x5xx motherboards for 10th (comet lake) and 11th gen cpus.,"12gen uses lga 1700. the answer to opâ€™s question is that yes, there are many comet lake (10th gen, lga 1200) cpus available with integrated graphics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hey at least now you know what the f stands for.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is the nh-lgi?,"do you mean nh-l9i, the slim low profile 90mm cooler intended for low power cpus in tiny cases?","if so, then no, i donâ€™t think thatâ€™s adequate (or a good choice as a cooler in general) unless youâ€™re running a micro itx case and thatâ€™s all that will physically fitâ€¦ in which case, high temps are to be expected.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're probably either looking at a poor mount or you didn't put on enough thermal paste.,i suggest remounting before you try and play anything on the system.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i can suggest going for an aio, there are also cheap ones on amazon.",i have a nzxt kranken and itâ€™s really good i have the same chip as you.,"idle iâ€™m looking at 30c and under normal load for example game iâ€™m at 60 or so, but your room temps do count a lot too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
try running with the case side panels off to eliminate case airflow as a possible problem?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the nh-l9i is rated for 65 watts of dissipation according to noctua.,the 12700k can draw over 180 watts under load if there's sufficient power and cooling.,if you're ok with reduced performance and can't fit anything better in your case then you should set the pl1/pl2 power limits to 65 watts in your bios to avoid thermal throttling and inconsistent performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i use a noctua nh-d15.,huge boi but idle at 35 and under load around 70ish.,overclocked @ 52/51/50/50/50/50 by core usage ( i followed a guide),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nh-u12a has been real quiet for me, not sure how that compares to what you have currently",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i believe that proc pulls 300w at full load.,"gaming loads are much lighter usually, but that's not enough cooler.","figure out how much space you got, and grab the biggest air cooler you can fit if noise is an issue.","those baby nocs are only really good for maybe 6 core procs, and in situations where you cant fit a bigger cooler.","people make all kinds of claims, but they might no realize they are being throttled.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
far too weak of a cooler.,i use nh-d15 and wouldnt want to try any smaller.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"lol yeah the l9i one, i read it wrong xd",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hmm i always used a air cooler and had no problems but i will look into it.,my room temp is pretty low so that shouldnt be the problem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the motherboard he lists is full atx so i donâ€™t see how something bigger wouldnâ€™t have fitted.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on a cooler.,"i've been using cooler master ma612 for my 12700k, and found it... lacking.",even though it's rated for 250w.,"had to undervolt the cpu, which solved the problem.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how big are these spikes?,we need numbers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have same issues with 12900k, im blaming mobo (asus prime z690-p d4).","i noticed those even at idling, i believe its 100 ms reading intervals and sometimes temps jump up by 10-15 degrees all of sudden, which triggers my coolers.","same happens during gaming, no matter how much i play, whenever i alt-tab to hwmonitor i see maximum temperature at around 77-78 degrees, but maximum temperature logged as 82-84. odd!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also check to see if you got the win 10 power bug.,on idle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'd guess your cooler is far too inadequate, and it's hitting the temperature celling, throttling back hard to cool back down, than boosting again to temperatures it can't handle.",you need a cooler rated for handling at least 150w i'd say in order not to keep running into this.,probably more like 200w.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so big im scared to talk about it.... 

ideling at 40-50c and breaking 100c for cool down.",this all just started after running some 4k renders in blender along side a 3060ti.,nothing insane,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we might be in the same lane my friend.,i believe i have that same board as well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the upgrade is on its way today!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but thats underload.,the nzxt app was giving me these wild fluxes that was making wonder if it was right.,so i checked with another cpu temp app and confirmed they were around the same range.,"strange thing is, all of this just started.",everything was find until started pusing blender alittle harder.,all drivers are currently updated btw.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
makes cpu idle much higher then it should ever be.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why were using a low profile one?,is that all that fits?,you sure what you bought fits?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it does, its a noctua, came with the 1700 bracket kit.",it works well for basic things and light gaming.,"blender however at 4k causes my cpu to start sweating lol

&#x200b;

the replacement is coming today, about 4 times the size.",ill post temps when im back up later,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hahaha currently browsing at 80-90 f underload peaks around 150 with 4k renders,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
those numbers look right.,the stock all-core boost frequency on the p-cores should be 4.9ghz.,5.2ghz is the stock single-core boost frequency.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as another poster already said, 4.9ghz is the stock p-core all-core boost.","5.2ghz will only be hit on a single core (when other cores arenâ€™t boosting), and i think 5.1ghz for two cores (again, only when other cores arenâ€™t boosting).",e-cores will hit 3.7ghz all-core boost.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if you are hitting 97 degrees, you are most likely thermal throttling.",i would say your cooling solution is either not correctly installed or not sufficient to cool that cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cooling solution being insufficient is out of the question here.,knowing whether op is using lga1200 or 1700 would help determine whether mounting is fine.,"given the range in core temps, this is the likely culprit.","that said, op should probably use a more updated hw monitoring program (i.e.",hwinfo) and check the voltage/wattage as well to see if adjustments need to be made there.,core speeds are as expected.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

out of curiosity what are your ambients and what case are you using?,"besides toning down the voltage to do an undervolt, everything looks normal to me considering the kind of stress test you are doing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your vcore is above 1.3v in these images.,it's pushing the cpu package to 100c and thermal throttling your cpu.,first thing you want to do is turn off the asus multi-core enhancement in your bios.,set your pl1 and pl2 to 241w.,it's currently unlimited.,then you can use intel xtu to try a simple all core of 5ghz p-core and 4ghz e-core @ 1.277v to see if you can sustain the clocks below 99c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"most asus alder lake motherboards have holes to mount lga1200 coolers, but knowing that the mounting z-height (height from surface of motherboard to top of cpu heat spreader) is different between 1200 and 1700, i would only use a 1200 mount as a temporary solution until you had proper lga1700 hardware.","well, if temps were really good i might not bother changing, but if i had any concerns that would be my first thing to â€œfixâ€.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">the instructions indicate socket 1200. will this work with the 12900k i just ordered

no, you need a lga 1700 bracket.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it depends on your motherboard.,"take a look, if you see an almost pill shaped pass through then youâ€™re good.",if you only see 4 perfectly shaped holes then youâ€™ll need an lga 1700 bracket for your cooler.,on a side note.,"if your cooler includes thumb screws tighten them by hand, donâ€™t use a screw driver.",itâ€™s not necessary and lga 1700 cpuâ€™s have a slightly taller z height than lga 1200. tightening the cooler too much can result in bending your cpuâ€™s substrate/pcb.,good luck!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm using an x63 with a 12900k and asus tuf ddr4.,temps are good.,"[10-minute run of cb23 is scoring over 27,000](https://i.imgur.com/km10ztl.png).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mounted the 1200 bracket and temps are fine for the moment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it'll fit.,any cooler using the asetek gen5+ retention mechanism will have some degree of adjustability with screws that are able to slide in the backplate.,"the in-built adjustability easily covers the difference between 1200 and 1700.

check this out, shows an nzxt cooler being mounted on alder lake: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boon1znlica&t=221s

> lga 1700 cpuâ€™s have a slightly taller z height than lga 1200

no it's actually backwards.",lga1700 is lower z-height so using an lga1200 cooler might not give enough mounting pressure.,"lga1200 z-height: 7.312mm to 8.249mm

lga1700 z-height: 6.529mm to 7.532mm",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so looser is a better than too tight?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

define 'good' on the temps?,i have an x63 still attached to a backup system running a 3900x because i'm too lazy to swap the wraith cooler back on and i've been wondering if my 12900kf would even benefit from going to the x63.,it's running the dual fan noctua dh-15 chromax right now and does pretty damn well with that.,just wondering if it's worth the hassle to find the old fan / tear the machine down etc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ideally you want to get it hand tight enough for your cooler's cold plate to make good contact with your cpu's ihs.,if it's too loose your temps will be negatively impacted.,"too tight and it puts unnecessary pressure on your cpu, socket, and motherboard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"iirc ~~high 80s to low 90s~~ through a 10 minute cinebench run, with ambient temps around 29-30c.",the important bit was it didn't thermal throttle.,i'll see if i can bench it again while keeping hwinfo in the background.,edit: after re-benching it turns out i was wrong.,the temps were actually high 70s to mid 80s.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

also even with the undervolt it shoots from 30 idle to 80-90 instantly.,should it be jumping that quickly?,is that normal to spike so fast?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it should be near your vcore you adjusted but not 100% sure on your moyherboard i'd hope it's not being crazy but from my experience the higher clocked xmp can be quite aggressive on the system agent and io voltage or short hand vccsa and vccio seems the names have changes to vdd and vddq but there should also be a system agent voltage.,i'd say get the normal cpu temps sorted first and then maybe check on this.,xmp should have much less affect in cpu thermals since ddr5 has the voltage controller on the ram,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you could try 1.25v make sure to run a ram test after tho as your ddr5 may need thay 1.35v.,one thing you can also do is adjust your pump speed if it's not already set to go to 100% at like 50c or 60c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i bought the washer mods stuff.,going to reinstall with those tomorrow and see what happens,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all stock settings?,you have the same cooler it seems.,ugh this is so frustrating,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i dont see those settings.,should i turn xmp off?,i just updated bios and no fix,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i cant find where to change pump speed.,icue software does nothing and in the bios it wont let me change it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea the head its plugged into just says pump prettys ure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seems vccio changed but there should be a vccsa or system agent voltage in there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it may be pre set to max not sure on that mobo but if it's in a header that was labeled aio or wpump something like that it may be auto 100%,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so i downvolted -.06 and it will go from 35 or so degrees to 90 instant but it doesnt hit 100c anymore or throttle.,thats only for xtu benchtest though.,cinebench still makes it hit 100 instant.,is this still abnormal?,my xtu score is like 9200 undervolted at those specs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's definitely abnormal.,maybe the washer mod will help you out out as i have heard issues there on the 12th gen. i'd give the washer mod a try.,if you want to push much past -.06mv i'd make sure you have your using high performance mode in windows as much past that idle voltage will get in a dangerously low voltage and cause issues at idle.,you can also test with and without xmp but i don't expect much difference,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have compared the 12600k ddr4 vs 10700 ddr4.,i did a lot of tests.,"gaming, renders and running heavy scripts for data analysis.","12600k (at stock clocks) always beat the 10700.

the thing that most amazed me is that 12600k at 100% ussage (no avx) (i repeat, at stock, no overclock) only draw 100w of power.",only 100w!,"(remember, less power draw, less heat).","so 12600k is much more efficient than the 10th gen. i would go for the 10600k 100%, even with ddr4 the 12600k is the best option",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the only thing that worries me about the 12600k is the reports of people that disable the e-cores to get better gaming performance.,"if that would be true, it would defeat the whole purpose of going 12600k over 12400â€¦",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i still use the same ddr4 memory that i used with my previous ryzen 5 3600 platform and what i have noticed is that on i5 12600k platform it seems to oc better with less voltage required.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had to replace my 12900k that died on me with a 12600k.,i also have a asus tuf gaming z690-plus wifi d4.,i have to say i'm totally impressed with it.,i have a 3080 rtx and a lg cx as a monitor and i haven't had any performance difference.,"it plays all my game with no issues, it also runs a good 10 to 15 degrees cooler.",i wish i would of gotten this cpu from the beginning.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
been running a 12600k on an msi z690 pro-a and have had a fairly enjoyable experience with it in gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
best cpu on the market,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've had  a i5 12600k ever since it came out and and i built my first system using it with ddr4 and it works perfectly for me i can  play games and do anything i want to on my pc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's great.,fast as fuck boi.,"much better value than any alternatives, great for gaming, great for programming not a bottleneck for me (data scientist who does a bunch of large scale machine learning, most of which i prototype on my local machine before offloading it to the cloud).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

looks like the best deal right now for a mid end system.,"alternative is a ryzen 5600x which would be like $50 cheaper, with a motherboard that would likely also be $30 cheaper.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've never managed to get my ram to work with xmp once i moved to this new system (on 4 stick modules.),that pretty suck but to be fair you're losing an inconsequential performance by running ram at stock,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am also on the fence to go i5 instead of an i7 alder or raptor lake.,"my primary concern is single thread performance, want to do air cooling and i'm not in the mood of upgrading my 750w psu at the moment.",all this makes me lean towards i5.,"i have a 7700k to retire, which to be honest still feels adequate as even on a 3080 i'm still gpu limited (in vr, or 75hz), but it would be probably still yield fps and much better consistency.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have both and my 11900k stats are 5.3 all core on gigabyet master the i5k 12 seires is about the same  also the i7 12k is almost the same as well.. it like 5fps difference.,also i built several i7 12k and they are about the same even with ddr5.,5200,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the pc i have my eye on has a 750w power supply paired with a 3060 i'm guessing it's a bit much.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in which tests did you get 100w on 100% usage?,"i ran my i5 12600k stock for 10mins on cinebench r23 and it used ~140w, went up to ~170w when running prime95 small ffts.",after that i undervolted it (-100mv) and it used 115w running cinebench r23 with 100% usage giving the same performance.,(i didn't test prime95 tho),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's all pretty exaggerated.,people were getting maybe a few percentage points more in gaming benchmarks after disabling e cores.,probably not worth the tradeoff of greatly reducing mt performance of the chip.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm using 12700k in gaming and everything ok in stock.,may be in some few games you have to disable e-cores but they fix them very fast.,"i've found only one software which works incorrect with the cpu, that related to video coding software and not wide spread.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you took all the advice from these forums the ideal i5 is with the ecores disabled, the original bios to keep avx-512, a few washers to level out the proc, underclocked to keep the power down and ddr4 because the cas latency is lower.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"its because if e cores and p cores work together on a game, there are background tasks needing some work from the cpu and will cause stutters.","if p cores for gaming but e cores for background task, much less stutters and also slightly better average fps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sounds like hyperthreading.,sometimes disabling it can lead to a slightly better performance.,but most of the times it is just significantly better to have it on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"with process lasso, you can pin core affinity.","so like...every time you launch fallout 4, it automagically only runs on only p-cores.",i also pin specific windows maintenance and background tasks to e-cores.,process lasso is basically just an extension of the windows scheduler with more user input for fine tuning.,"works really well, and while it is paid software, the only nag is at boot when it makes you wait 10 seconds to ask you to buy, otherwise the freemium is feature full.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i see on the black bar badge-thingy that you're using 3200mhz ram.,do you think it's best if i spend a little extra and get 3600mhz or should i wait a bit and get a new motherboard and ddr5?,the latter was my original plan.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my 8th gen motherboard died and i've just done the exact same board and cpu upgrade.,haven't had much time to play around yet but happy with my purchase so far.,the exact model of my ddr4-3200 g.skill ram wasn't listed as supported but it's working fine so far with xmp on.,windows feels more snappy and the cpu somehow seems to run cooler than my old i7-8700 (non-k) using a corsair h115i platinum with the corsair 12th gen retrofit stand offs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
from what i've read it beats some ryzen 7 5000 series cpus.,but i still wanted some opinions to make an informed decision.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can confirm.,recently upgraded from a 4690k because my psu failed and wanted to get an upgrade anyway.,this thing is flawless and just smashes anything you throw at it.,"with the kraken x63, it doesn't even to 50c when gaming.","highly recommended, especially at its current msrp.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nice, i need it for programming and gaming.",it'll probably run visual studio 2022 like it's nothing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you cant say anything properly if you havent said anything yet besides telling us you have a new pc..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah these boards dont really like when you use all 4 slots.,"you can manually set the ram speeds instead of using xmp, it will take some time but you should be able to get more performance out of them than defaults.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
750w psu is completely fine even for rtx 3080 + 12900k lol.,even if both run on 100% usage it can only pull ~650w from the psu.,and 100% load on both cpu and gpu only happens if you run some kind of power-virus on both.,prime95 on cpu and furmark on gpu probably.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in my case i need a pc because my laptop died, it was and old dell with a 4th gen intel.",that is a desperate need of an upgrade.,xd,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why?,you're in a pretty rarified space if you need more than a properly overclocked 11600k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 12th gen ipc improvement makes comparing clock speeds a bit apples and oranges.,the single thread improvement between 11th and 12th gen was considerable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
love how people downvote you when you've said nothing but the truth.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
750w psu is good!,the more watts psu is rated for the more quality components are likely to be used in it.,also optimal sustained load for a psu is up to 70% of it's rated power.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they also used to discuss disabling multithreaded cpu in older generation!,"which gained some performance in old title but still does not make since , if the one care about gaming only then the lower end cpus are great for that, going higher end then disabling features is just paying for better pinned lower cpu!","i donâ€™t make a lot of sense but i guess all i want to say, is that those features should not be disabled for 1 to 5 fps gain",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so, this is actually a more nuanced argument than ""maybe a few percent"".","coming with this data from some deep experience in game dev in an upcoming aaa open-world title designed to be next-gen and pc-only (no cross gen fallbacks)

haven't heard many people claim to underclock when disabling e-cores.,the main advantage is that you can overclock better with e-cores disabled.,"especially the ring bus, or whatever it's called now, can overclock like 700-800mhz higher with the e-cores disabled.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">i see on the black bar badge-thingy that you're using 3200mhz ram

that's because i only use shitty 2666 mhz ddr4 ram that is already 3+ years old, i was able to oc it to 3200 mhz too on ryzen platform, but with higher latency with i5 12600k, i was able to tighten the timings even lower than i could possibly do on ryzen platform, it is near impossible to do it on ryzen platform so, i stuck with stock cl16 timings.","as for ram recommendation, i suggest getting a decent quality 3200 mhz ram and ocing it to 3600 mhz or tightening the timings instead.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

technically the 12900k under the exact same continuous workload or power limits as the 12700k should produce the same or perhaps slightly less heat.,itâ€™s when you use the greater capabilities of the 12900k that the heat really starts to come out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's a case badge.,they usually come with with your motherboard cpu and gpu.,the purpose of them is to display them on your case to show what parts you used  in build.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

its a cool kid special badge,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's your useless stuff which allows them to charge premium.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
imagine flaunting a company logo on your case or fridge and being proud of it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's a metal sticker.,the metal ones give you an additional 5% more virtual horsepower over the regular stickers that just give you 5% more virtual horsepowe for your computer.,"after you put that on your case you'll see *up to 10% more virtual horsepower, and now you know... ðÿ¤“ðÿ˜žðÿ¤¦â€â™‚ï¸ðÿ¤£",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"wait, glue?!",not any adhesive on the badge?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"shhhhut up, it's a secret",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this will upset master,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
youâ€™ve said to much already.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
:d lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"maybe someone, someone out there still likes it and appreciates that msi atleast includes it in the box",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
minimalist aesthetic with 9000 leds and 400 rgb wires all over the place,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"asrock includes these with some boards too but not all my phantom gaming didn't come with one, but a pro4 motherboard did.",i personally like having stickers like these on my case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
everything is minimalist now.,i get that it looks good but sometimes it's so boring.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"honestly, they are way better quality than every other badge ive seen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that sounds like a horrible idea,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do they only come with $500 flagship boards?,"i got nothing with my $250 high end mobo, my 360 liquid cooler, or my rtx 3080. :(",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
youâ€™re welcome,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just think it's nice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that is for noobs, you take hot glue and make a blob and then press it in.",the best place to put it is in a mesh grill.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah msi is selling guitar picks for some reason they have something sticky on one side and they are very expensive.,and come with this computer component for free.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's been a thing for years and years.,"30years ago it was soooo cool to get something to put on your case, cases were buttugly back than.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes that person is me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a couple from noctua that i like.,"they're not on any pc cases, but it's still neat (for some reason).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm thinking back to when cases like the raidmax scorpio and samurai were big, and when alienware had their own custom windows xp theme.","i will grant that rgb is objectively more maximalist than when you had the choice of either red, green, or blue led case fans from xoxide (made of clear plastic and sold almost exclusively in 80mm).","still though, where have the cold cathode tubes gone?","we have truly lost our way if we don't know where to slap an unnecessarily large, gaudy case badge with a dragon on it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i feel personally attacked...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got a few with my laptops!,!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
only for people with less than 370ng/dl of testosterone,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"here, thatâ€™ll work for now.",didnâ€™t even have to use the sticky side incase i want to move it later.,https://imgur.com/a/xxavasx,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's true.,mine has been sitting on the shelf next to my pc since i finished it a month ago.,"every day or two, i stand up and look around for somewhere to stick it, and haven't found anywhere i'm happy with yet lol.",it took me way longer to figure out what the cmos battery stickers purpose was than i care to admit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"lol, the world we live in.",my computer went from still in boxes to running in bios in about an hour.,this was 3ish weeks ago.,i am still cable managing.,https://imgur.com/a/dqj9lcc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this sounds more like a windows 11 issue and you'd be better off rolling back to 10. something is very not right here if video won't even begin for many seconds or if your system is incredibly laggy.,i doubt rolling back to an unsupported beta driver would change anything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"4 heatpipes, tower, plenty of fins, and a fan?",yeah.,these things are practically commodity items that all perform in the same margin.,"not the best, not the worst.",perfect for 125 to 150 watts.,not much higher.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's 12 chipset lanes in addition to the cpu lanes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the b560m bazooka has an x16 slot from the cpu and two x1 from the chipset, leaving 10 lanes.","the board has 2 x4 m.2 slots, and it states that both will be from the chipset when using 10th gen, leaving 2. it also states that the first will be from the cpu with 11th gen, so iâ€™m not really sure where the x4 chipset lanes go when using 11th gen. regardless, remaining lanes will go to other board features, like usb, network, storage, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, i just wanted to know how they are added up",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yaa maybe, but when sata and usb start taking pcie lanes?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with addition 12+cpu lanes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hard to say.,they either have x2 or x6 lanes to split up.,the only shared resource seems to be sata2 is unavailable when using m2_1 with 10th gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"usb, networking and sata do not need pcie lanes.",they are connected over hsio.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how do 12 lanes are divided into each component?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yaa, sata 2 is connected to pcie lanes.. and all mobos of b560 one sata port is disabled when both m.2 slots are occupied.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes it will work, why it shouldn't just because it's not on updated list?","[https://pangoly.com/en/compatibility/g-skill-16gb-2x8gb-aegis-ddr4-3000mhz/motherboard](https://pangoly.com/en/compatibility/g-skill-16gb-2x8gb-aegis-ddr4-3000mhz/motherboard)

check qvl from motherboard website.,"every ram is intel compatible, but its safe to check qvl",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, i thought that there could be same problems with ram as it was when the first ryzen series came out",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel is generally less picky on memory.,"now, perhaps alder lake is pickier than their usual for overclocking or running 4 sticks, but it will pretty much run 2 sticks of anything at stock.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what does task manager show when you are running a game?,is there at least one core in the +90% utilization range?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is your cpu usage when idle and in valorant?,what are your temps when idle and when in a game?,are you running any kind of overclock or are you observing the chip boosting in task manager or something?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"firstly, make sure you restart your computer to see if the problem continues after a reboot.","secondly, click 'left control + left shift + escape"" to open up your task manager and go to the processes tab.",sort the list by cpu usage and see what programs are using the most cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not yet, not for gaming at least",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"technically it's better, but you wouldn't really notice it so not worth spending the money imo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, you are mainly gpu bound at that resolution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 12900k would be a noticeable upgrade for cpu performance (passmark 14546 multi / 2900 single on yours, to 40880/4208)â€¦ but as the other posters mentioned, it would only matter if gaming is showing that youâ€™re cpu bound vs gpu bound.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can always get a ddr4 motherboard with a 12700k.. i would go and do that..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i went from a 9700k to 12700k and was happy with the performance uplift as i was getting cpu bottlenecked in some games.,"but i also have a 3080.

i wouldn't recommend getting the 12900k+ddr5 in your situation as it's going to be vastly more expensive and barely net you any gaming performance over a 12700k with ddr4.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"what games are you playing

most games probably not worth it but i'm a flight sim guy and it's heavily cpu bound in many instances so i found a real advantage going from a 9700k to a 12900k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"traditionally, w is just z with unregistered ecc support paired with xeon w cpus which are usually basically just the same consumer cpus with a few extra bells and whistles like unregistered ecc support.",rdimms and 4x memory channels are usually reserved to server or c series workstations.,"unless you're doing important scientific research or something, you don't need ecc.","although alderlake and ddr5 sorta supports ecc, they will probably need w class boards but who knows, maybe asrock or someone will release a z690 ""workstation"" edition.","h670 is nearly identical to z but without cpu overclocking, the b series is the same but with even less io(pcie lanes, usb etc).",both are good for gaming.,h610 has no memory overclocking and even more cutdown.,this is fine for office pcs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
w is a z series but with ecc support enabled.,as far as i know that is the only difference.,"if you have to ask, you probably do not want a w-series chipset.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/download/details.aspx?id=17431 
try using this link if it dosent work then i think its a problem with your graphics card cause ive seen another case of planet coaster not running and the person had the same gpu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the hd3000 is limited to directx 10.1 so you won't be able to run the game.,intel didn't start supporting dx11 until the 3rd gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thats a powerpoint presentation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have directx12 says in my hardware in dxdiag,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no thereâ€™s a download now button below it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
directx 12 is bundled with windows but the underlying hardware must also support it.,your gpu only supports up to feature level 10_1 (direct 10.1)which is insufficient to run a game which requires level 11_0 (directx 11.0).,your only option is a new machine at this point.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thx,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're using your cpu instead of the gpu for video.,did you plug it into the gpu or the motherboard?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean it does look like you are bottlenecked by your cpu.,what cpu do you have?,try increase your resolution to shift more work onto the gpu might help.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it looks like your pc only uses the on-board graphics, not the rtx cause it draws no power, 0 watt in the screenshot, try the steps in the german link before",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would suggest you to use ddu to uninstall both nvidia and intel drivers and then install only nvidia drivers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
something like this happened with me once turns out my charger wasn't plugged correctly maybe you should check that too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm a pc user and i don't know about laptop, but this is what i do, press start and s to open the search tab and search: ""graphics settings"", 
after opening the graphics settings click on the browse option and find the game file and select it.","after that your game is added to list in the graphics settings menu, click on it and then click on options, there should be 3 options appearing, choose high performance which should have the name of your gpu under it.",i hope this fixes it.,"btw if you have trouble finding the correct game file, just run the game, then open task manager, you should see the game using your cpu, right click on it and open file location, that would be your file.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is definitely a bottleneck,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what cpu are you using?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"may be this helps if you can translate...

is your laptop plugged into the wall?,nvidia gpu's turn off to save battery when not plugged in.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
check your bios settings for gpu.,it might've locked your graphics to use onboard gpu instead of external,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™d disable the integrated graphics card and see what it does,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
raise it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
update : thanks yall for helping me out..the problem is solved..it was thermal throttling and changing the paste fixed it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"unfortunately, nothing can be done about a cpu bottleneck on a laptop.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
check cpu temps and frequency.,and don't forget to connect charger...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am on a laptop actually ..and ive set my games so that they use my gpu not the cpu....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s an i5-8400h and also 1080p is the highest i can go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"uhmmmâ€¦my laptop 
always shows its at 0w idk why and i got a gtx not a rtx but yeah ill check the link",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
alright thanks m8 i'll try doing that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
charger is plugged in dudeâ€¦works perfectly too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bro itâ€™s already on high performance but iâ€™ll try reinstalling and do it again â€¦ðÿ˜­,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok bu how do i fix it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i5-8400h,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is plugged in dude,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hey dude can i dm you my bios screen it's weird,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
?,?,?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's not a cpu bottleneck, the problem's that the game doesn't even use their gpu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my desktop 1050 doesn't even get bottlenecked with my i5 7400 so this is clearly not a bottleneck,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"check your settings and adjust things like: shadows, sight distance, vegetation,...
maybe it's to much work for your cpu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
usually runs at 91 since bought and charger is connected,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which game is this?,gta?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have u tried to set external gpu from nvidia control panel?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
check the cable that connects to adapter too if it's correct too then idk because i remember this same thing happening to me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hmm... that should usually work, my friend says don't mistake that with power options  
this high performance is different from that.","it should look like this:

[https://ibb.co/rggq8mv](https://ibb.co/rggq8mv)  
other than that and your drivers being up to date i don't know any other moves.","oh there's also this thing that you go to nvidia control panel and do, i don't know what because i never had to do that, but maybe search youtube or google for the nvidia control panel settings.",i hope you find a solution.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well um you can't because your cpu is less powerful than your gpu thus meaning that you might have to replace the cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is your memory usage like during this?,both system and gpu memory.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
exactly thatâ€™s the problemâ€¦sometimes it is using but the next time it is again using the cpu and both of them arenâ€™t even running at 100%,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s all set to either low or medium,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i would also check nvidia control panel and windows settings, it looks like your gpu is deaktivated or may be r. i. p.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nope it is forza horizon 4...it was working perfect a few days ago  tho...but since last few days i'm getting really low fps in games,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep it's on my gpu and not my intel gpu...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the help m8 ig tweaking some settings will help it and yeah my pc is o ultimate performer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not much..

system: 7gb out of 16gb 
gpu: 2gb out of 4gb",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i did everything even reinstall the drivers, i was getting good frames suddenly but with low gpu usage which was not happening earlierâ€¦it was running at 20fps with low gpu usage too",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you updated the drivers on the nvidia app?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"u can try going to graphic setting then add your game ,then options and select high performance gpu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes just got an update yesterday,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's done already..still doesn't work..idk if it's thermal throttling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
revert back to the old drivers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's odd.,do you have msi afterburner to check clock speeds?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ur temps are fine probably not thermal throttling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes sirr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ohhh, thank god but gotta see whatâ€™s the problem then",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
uninstall them and install them from the nvidia website,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
search for nvidia (insert graphics card name here) february 2022 drivers.,then download it and do a clean install when it asks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'd reinstall everything and verify your files through windows.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but how do i delete the current driver,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well iâ€™ll have to do that then when i get the timeâ€¦hopefully it will work out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ime is flashed deep inside the motherboard cmos/bios chip.,i suspect the current bios version needs to be updated.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

presumably the answer is all the wattage.,"btw, i see two 8s and a 6.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is this just a reddit thing to say or are their numbers to back it up.,"i know during last gen, gainward and gigabyte had the lowest failure rate of all brands and personally i've had more issues with asus but i don't try to generalise.",3000 series as a whole has something like a 0.7% failure rate (based on mindshare and purget data) so realistically any body that actually gets a failure is extremely unlucky irrespective of brand.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's ironic.,"i just randomly bought a gigabyte for my first gpu, and when i bought my second, i thought, ""well, gigabyte did good the first time.","i guess i'll go with them again.""","then i did it again with my third, fourth, and so on, and now i'm still running a gigabyte gpu.",not because i know anything about them.,"just because my last one (in a long line of ""last ones"") didnt crap out",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i know a few years ago, around 900 series time, there were some issues with some gigabyte cards.",but every brand has made mistakes from time to time.,until a couple weeks ago i had a gigabyte 1080 ti and x470 motherboard.,"the motherboard did crap out on me at one point, but gigabytes rma process was pretty good.","i did have to pay to ship it to them, but they actually repaired the board and got it back to me faster than i expected.",i think the biggest issue with gigabyte right now is the whole power supply debacle.,whoever does pr for them did a terrible job handling the situation.,also sounds like they cheaped out on oems.,from what iâ€™ve read they used a newer company called meic.,"they definitely canâ€™t publicly blame the oem, but they could have handled it without blaming the organizations that discovered the issues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lookup gigabyte rma nightmare stories and read through some of it.,i had a 2080ti for 64 weeks.,it worked for 13 of those.,not 13 straight rather a couple weeks here and there.,went through 3 rmas with the card and dealt with multiple people not telling the truth and supervisors making promises only to be told something completely different by the next.,in the end i had to get someone from the media involved before getting in touch with head office in asia before it finally got sorted.,it's sucks because i love their esthetics but can never trust them again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

a very late reply but i think any brand will have horror stories.,"i've had a lot of their windforce and aurous cards and they are all still going strong, same with their motherboards which i've been using for 20 years.",i feel the rma issues are more country based.,in australia it just seems a lot easier to have a hassle free rma.,you take it to the shop you purchased it from and they deal with everything.,if it's not resolved in a reasonable time frame you are legally entitled to a refund.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
still better then asus mobo it power color backwards rma,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ah, right.",those hadnâ€™t been invented yet the last time i pimped out a pc.,"i see them on the gpu cables, now that you mention it, smaller ones.",although this is an 8+8+6 setup so youâ€™d have to modify it slightly to account for only being 22 wires â€” but i kind of assume thatâ€™s fairly trivial.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
even i get that score but for comparison it shows 12900k as 11k something.,i think it's showing the wrong ranking?,maybe?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the scores on that page are wrong.,"[https://valid.x86.fr/ezsjpl](https://valid.x86.fr/ezsjpl) 

this is my 12900k for example.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's actually slightly lower then the average.,edit: googled the cpu-z score of the i7 and that's about the same.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what power profile do you use?,"balanced causing me stuttering and dpc issues and many more sound issues even some video or sound lag delay in games

i  need to use  1usmus amd universal that keeps the efficiency cores at 2977 mhz so everything is smooth  when watching a movie and desktop and no stuttering in middle of game and no dpc jumps to 1000. or do you just disable c1e state in bios?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"cinebench is a more reliable benchmark 

i wouldn't trust this one",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
weird.,i was just looking at your results and was wondering why your cache configuration is so different compared to my 12900k.,https://valid.x86.fr/phcp5g,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my 12900k is overclocked to 5.1 ghz all core and ,3.9ghz cache.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there was a post about this issue with cpu-z a while back.,"i thought at the time it was because one person was using windows 10 and the other was using windows 11, but in this case you are both using windows 11. very strange.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you should probably turn up your fans, or upgrade them.",that cpu pulls 300+ watt under full load.,reviews had them hitting 100+ on air.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is it boosting to?,i legit had to re-seat my cooler like 5 times before i started getting decent contact and it still gets hot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12900k is very hard to cool under full load and no undervolting or power limiting.,"94c is hot, but fine.","obviously could be better, increase fan rpm, try reseating it, undervolt.","but you can absolutely run 94c all day everyday for years, the biggest issue isnt 94c itself but if ambient temps get higher later in the year then you could push to 100c and thermal throttle.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"unless you plan on being a professional cinebencher or something similar, don't use cinebench as the yardstick for your cooling.",watch the temps while you use it during gaming or whatever you use your pc for.,cinebench is a *very* power intensive task for alder lake and doesn't really translate to other tasks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yep this is a defect of the z690 ilm over-bending the ihs

can be easily fixed 

google ""z690 washer mod"" and/or search my post history.",saved 15c doing the mod,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it was boosting to about 5.2, maybe i should try re-seating.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks, i did the washer mod and saved about 20c, while also having a better overclock.",mod does wonders!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what are your voltages like during the run?,if its hitting 5.2 and staying there it sounds like its at least making good contact.,edit: also check your bios revision maybe.,i had a bios from 9/2021 and the newer one seemed to drop my temps substantially.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"another happy customer ;)

glad i could help!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lower the voltage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is the voltage set to?,what does it actually get to when checking in windows under full load?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™ve tried lowering it but it hasnâ€™t seemed to help any,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s set on auto and is reaching 1.35v at full load,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
actually lower the voltage.,your motherboard is ignoring your inputs one way or another.,any modern i7 can easily overwhelm the best aios on the market if voltage isnâ€™t strictly controlled when overclocking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's not too bad, really, but at the same the temps seem kind of high for a pretty normal oc voltage and that cooler.","it's only getting to 1.35v while on auto and frequency is set to 5.1ghz, or is that the voltage at stock frequency?","you should never really use auto voltage when overclocking, though.",some boards will add way more voltage than is actually needed for a cpu if you push the clocks.,"if you had an older 8700k using the same architecture, and had it on 'auto', and put at like 5ghz, it would likely automatically put at least 1.4v into it.",i don't know how different the 10th series behaves.,"i would set voltage to manual mode, and put it at like 1.33-1.35v depending on what voltage you're comfortable with, and then push clock speed in 100mhz increments from stock until it becomes unstable in 10 minute benchmark runs.",then back it off if it fails until it's stable again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't have an 11600k but that does sound hot with that cooler.,"i do have an x63 on my 5800x and it keeps it nice and cool during gaming, only gets hot (80c or more) if i have to load up all cores for something.",did you set the pump to maximum rpms in nzxt cam?,by default it runs in silent mode at 50 percent rpm or less.,proper mount pressure on the cooler?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it really depends on overclocking etc.,regardless 80c is not thermal throttling so its fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"seems kind of hot for that cooler, but i also thought 11th gen is in general hot.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so i chnaged the pump to normal, running over 2000rpms 
i know i wasnâ€™t sure if it was tightened down enough, but i can check again.",i might try to reinstall to make sure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i know its not thermal throttling but i was surprised at the temps.,it should be no oc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2000 rpms sounds about right.,"maybe see if the motherboard is enforcing some of multi core enhancement or ""faster than stock"" behavior?","i could see 80c on a 11600k running with some sort of auto oc, or unlimited power limit, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
some motherboards use pretty aggressive default settings removing all power limits on those already.,"anyhow, i would not worry about those temps really, they are not on problem threshold.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks ill take a look,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yes , your elkhart lake pentium uses ""intel iris plus graphics"" architecture which is the same as ice lake processor (10th generation intel) , so your quicksync version is version 7",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the github links are far beyond my ken, but thank you for the summary!","i will probably end up on windows, but am going to try and get my toes wet in linux and will definitely keep your post in mind, thanks!","i might end up just going with a 10100 i3 that i already have, but the idea of a 6.5w cpu is attractive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that doesn't seem normal, no.",perhaps you should apply a bit more excessively the next time.,", or try another brand perhaps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
some pastes have 'cure' periods as some of the liquid part of the mix is evaporated.,"but also testing days apart, you need to control for ambient temperatures.","like where i live i've had 20c swings this week in weather, and my hvac hasn't been running, meaning the weather will affect my pc temps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
every few months?,"most quality thermal pastes should be good for 3-4 years, and iâ€™ve got systems much older than that (6-10 years) with original paste that donâ€™t have thermal issues.","(but yes, they probably should be repasted, and will likely see better temps because of it, but itâ€™s not like theyâ€™re throttling now.)","what paste are you using, and how much are you using?",tests have shown that about the only thermal paste sin you can commit is putting on too little.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
use a thermal paste that does not change consistency over time and remains viscous.,"a good and inexpensive choice is mx-4, it's an aluminium and silicone compound that does not break down over time and endures up to 250 degrees.","assuming good cooler mounting pressure (spring bolts), it will stay in there and will not require replacement over the life of the system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">if it happens again it could indicate that something power-related is beginning to fail (psu, gpu, mb).",but it was hardware related?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nobody can tell you this with it happening once.,i'd just ignore it until it happens again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it might be.,but software-only issues doesnâ€™t normally trigger a system to suddenly power off.,key is just to see if it happens again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

those are pretty cold temps.,"what's it look like in hwinfo64 (across all cpu temp probes, over time)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it is normal for cpu temps to bounce around when gaming, they don't really have a constant/consistent load.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52c during gaming (especially in a bf game which uses a lot of cpu resources) is a fantastic temperature.,"don't worry about the spikes, cpus tend to burst in temp more than, say gpus, because the loads can change very rapidly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm using id cooling se 226 xt on my 12700kf and also noticed this especially in bfv.,"for me it's mostly in high 50s and jumps to mid-high 60s, never above 70 and just like yours these are just spikes, most of the time temps are on the lower end.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> for example playing bfv temps are going from 38c to 52c.,those are extremely good temperatures and it's natural for temps to vary in gaming as the cpu load is not consistent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"one thing i hadn't thought about in regards to cooling on lga1700, is that some coolers might not fully cover the ihs.",maybe this could be a factor here?,"otherwise, i suppose windows 11's new thread manager could be a factor too, if threads are moved between p-cores and e-cores a lot.",i'm not sure though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
max at 55c.,if i run like prime95 i get 68c.,iâ€™m just stunned how temps are jumping every second with difference of like 10c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i remember when i had 4790k lol temps were kinda jumping couple degrees here and there and on alder lake itâ€™s like 10-15c jumping every couple seconds,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just want to make sure lol.,last build i did was with 4790k and fx 8370â€¦.. and they were pretty steady with temps couple degrees here and there but no major spikes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for reply.,i figured but need to make sure.,i guess more cores more spikes are each core works and responds differently,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just took cooler off to apply some different grease and block covers whole cpu and thereâ€™s still some clean copper on sides probably like 1/2â€ all the way around.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"is that from ""cpu package"" (an average of all temps) or ""core max"" (the highest individual core temp reading)

if you drop down the ""core temperatures"" carrot in hwinfo64 you can see each individual core temp as well.",some cores run hotter than others.,either way i wouldn't worry about it if it's that cold.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i saw another post mention that with lga1700 the height of the socket/cpu is different from previous generations and that people have had problems with coolers not having proper surface connection because of that, and that's the reason for the socket spacer hack/mod that people are talking about.",maybe that's relevant to your cooler also.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes thatâ€™s cpu package.,core temps are very similar tho,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am waiting for decent p line up laptops.,however i believe p line up laptops will be great value for money.,and with good battery life.,they will be perfect balance between power + battery life + performance.,however it all depends on laptop manufacfures.,i seriously hope intel releases a nuc based on p series or microsoft release a surface.,i cannot say how they will compare against amd.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
alderlake mobile beats rembrandt in single threaded performance regardless of power limits and regardless of if a laptop is plugged in or not.,that should be more important in ultrabooks.,on the other hand rembrandt has better igp so if you don't have a dgpu that's something to consider.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was sad to see the limited pcie bandwidth for the p line up.,otherwise i think they could be great for thin and light 1080p gaming laptops,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

when i rma'd my intel 7900x they gave me a chinese box one.,so possibly?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's weird.,"here is the intel's reps own words, ""the 3 year warranty will still apply however, if warranty is concern we have to go back to the place of purchase.""",do you remember where the rma was shipped it to and what documentation they required?,i wonder if they just use whats on hand and may actually accept this if it does fry.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its not weird considering the shortage and intel would have to give a equivalent newer cpu or original value refund otherwise.,they probably only had that chinese branded cpu on hand.,inside the cpu did have english tags on die,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"true, and frankly if this cpu does need a rma (which is super rare anyway, sorry yours broke) something similar will probably happen.","i'm calling my relative tonight and if he wants it more power to him as its a pretty great cpu, if not then i can sell it myself.",thanks for the help!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they base warranty off serial number when i did mine.,"i bought mine 2nd hand and it did work but then quit

the i5 sticker is put on by the shop not the manufacturer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i used to work at amazon.,those stickers are for inventory.,specifically third-party seller inventory.,"basically half the stuff in an amazon warehouse is owned by different companies and amazon stores, sells and ships the item.",what happened here appears to be three screw ups.,the first is that who ever did the receiving of a bunch of cpus from a third party seller mislabeled at least two of them (this happens all the time).,the second is that someone put a mix of third-party and amazon stock of the same item in the same bin.,the third is that who ever picked the order ignored the sticker saying i5 and just scanned the original upc.,"you got the right item, but for all the wrong reasons.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
film the entire opening thing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
where did you buy it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so did you pay for an i5 instead of an i9?,"what a deal if that's the case, keep it if everything is sealed",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

amazon don't put stickers on the items.,there is equipment in every amazon fulfilment center to scan the barcode of the original item coming to fc  and amazon knows what is it.,the sticker is only one the final box with detailed address for the delivery.,this is definitely mistake by shop or 3rd party labelling it wrong.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the guy on ocn received the cpu 2 weeks ago.,he tested it and it was sp 86 or 88 .,i dont remember exactly but its under 90.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the problem i have with this is the same i had with 9900k.,"when they started selling ks, you couldn't find a decent 9900k on the shelves anymore that could push 5.0ghz",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

people are also speculating that because the vid and v/f table are different from the 12900k that you can't compare the 12900k sp with 12900ks sp or that it might be incorrectly calculated,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that screenshot was invalid.,the sp rating was clearly broken and read 3 v/f points as the same voltage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

$800 is alright for a guaranteed sp95+ gold bin 12900k if you're into that kind of stuff.,the real winners here are the 12900k lottery winners who sold their sp100+ chips back a few months ago.,those went for quite a bit of money from what i understand.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"it's a feature in asus motherboards, some kind of overclocking potential prediction.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if i have to guess it's just indicating that there's a problem with the cpu but luckily in this case it's an overheating problem (not broken).,your best bet at this point is to get a new cooler (either through warranty or buy a new one).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the cpu led will come on when the cpu is thermal throttling.,also the freeze + crash with no bsod is exactly what happens when the cpu gets to critical temp and shuts down.,everything you're saying is pointing to the cpu getting *very* hot.,"as others have said, the cooler is probably poorly mounted, or the pump isn't working correctly.",use a fan monitor (or check in your bios) to see if the aio pump is reporting that it is spinning.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the chip throttles at 100c, and even if you maintain that temperature itâ€™s still working â€œas designedâ€ and so should not cause damage.","with that said, what cooler are you using?",and what kind of cpu usage in cyberpunk?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as youâ€™re using the stock cooler, these temps are expected.",stock coolers are just for basic use.,not for gaming/professional work.,"the tjmax for the 10400f is 100c, you should be fine.",itâ€™s working as it should.,"as they say, keeping a cpu cool may help it last longer, you can get a cheap aftermarket cooler like hyper 212, noctua u9s, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no need to spend a thing - those temps won't damage the cpu at all.,"if you want to lower temps a bit, see what happens if you increase the cpu fan speed to 100%.",if you have it on the default fan profile it likely isn't getting anywhere near the top speed and therefore not cooling at its maximum.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"buy better cooler for lower temps, anyway you are ok.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
any cheap tower cooler like the veetroo v5 will keep your cpu under 50c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks for all of the replies, got the info i needed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
normal for stock fan.,cyberpunk probably uses more cores than the other games you're playing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well i bought a new cooler not a tower one.,this is literally what i'm having rn.,any solutions you've been able to come up with?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, i went into bios and changed fan speed but it still gets pretty hot, when i have the money i'm going to try and find a cheap fan/heat sink that will fit in place of the standard fan.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no.,it will run anything just slower ( assuming it's not missing some needed instructions ).,"some new games might run pretty bad making them unplayable on crappy cpus that lack ht ( 8400, 8600, 9400, 9600 etc )

but, as long as you buy the latest generation available, mostly it won't.","intel has reached amd cadence ( new generation 4 core as fast as last generation 6 core, new generation 6 core, as fast as last generation 8 core etc )

and its not like you are buying a 99$ cpu to pair with a 1000$ gpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,i3 12100 is quad core.and perfectly fine for gaming on 3080. it's not only core count that matter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that depends what you mean by obsolete, but generally, as others say, the machine will typically just be slower.","many would call a single- or dual-core cpu pretty much obsolete today, but there are many such machines still in use nonetheless.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel still sells brand new dual core desktop celerons and pentiums.,"i guess intel has to do something with those alder lake dies that would otherwise end up in the trash bin, though 4 physical cores should be the minimum in this day and age.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am not sure why you are asking this question.,perhaps you want to buy pc with 4core 8 threads.,"if that is the reason, my advise, stay away from this config in 2022 unless you are tight on budget.",i will advise.. you should look for 6 core 12 threads and above.,they are quite decent.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and could it be possible that programs in the future wont run on eg.,"4c8th or will it,  just not so fast?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i want to buy a hp elitebook and that comes only with 4c8th (i7-1165g7),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there is nothing wrong with a dual core and hyperthreading in 2022.

now, iâ€™d future proof and get 4/8 but for low end stuff you donâ€™t need much.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
definitely possible.,far cry 4 wouldn't work unless you had at least 4 cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"4 cores and 8 threads will still work for a very, very long time.",just not so fast.,4 cores and 4 threads will show very bad stutter soon.,i think everything out there still works on 4 thread cpus today.,"so 8 threads not working at all, is probably 5-7 years away.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wouldn't worry myself.,thats a pretty recent processor and will run well for a long while.,4c 8th still will run games for a good while bar some outliers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok. i own i5-1135g7 and it struggles while recording videos.,i only wish i would have waited.,however i7-1165g7 is decent processor.,"if all that you want to do is watch movies and surf web and office applications, you are looking at more than 5 years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
possible but only due to really bad design.,i could write a program that spawns 200 worker threads and the os will just spread them out on however many cores/threads actually are present.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
those probably correspond to when the test finishes and itâ€™s still waiting for the last workers to wrap up (perhaps on an e-core).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is the 10 mins stress test made up of multiple then?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it just keeps rendering the same scene multiple times within the 10 minute window, and all workers have to finish their job (including slow e-cores) on one pass before it begins the next.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it would make sense,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, it essentially just repeatedly runs the normal test until 10 minutes have passed.",so there is a small drop in cpu utilization at the end of each test.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
perfect thank you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had no issues with that same mobo and aio combo on my i5 12600k.,even with the old hardware.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you having issues?,did you get the adapting hardware from corsair?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"12th gen has been anything but nightmare, expensive as hell mobos, similar shitty vrm issues as with 11th gen, and new mounting holes that are incompatible with old aois and it isn't easy to just buy a aoi which comes with lga 1700 mounting mechanism.","i should have 100% went with ryzen 5600x this time, would have ended up both faster, cheaper and less pain in the ass than a 12400f build.",i didn't expect to be screwed over so hard by incompetence on intel's part.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you have all figured out already, so go ahead.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"which one is curve, cpu or aio?",doesn't that mean it's defective and you should get a return?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"used back my acrtic 280 from previous build for my 12700, the spread pattern is better than the left aio in your photo, thermal paste are evenly spreaded.","temps while gaming sits at high 50c to low 60c (god of war, cyberpunk).",blender about 75-77c during rendering.,temp are better than my old 3700x so i didn't bother with the washer mod.,ambient 28-32c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what do you mean exactly.,can you be more specific?,did you use the brackets/screws/hardware that just came with the corsair aio?,i'm basically waiting for these to arrive - https://www.corsair.com/us/en/categories/products/accessories-%7c-parts/pc-components/cooling/lga1700-retrofit-kit/p/cw-8960091,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i put my order in yesterday so now i just have to wait as i can put anything together until they get here.,lga1700 required screws that don't come with brand new corsair aio - https://www.corsair.com/us/en/categories/products/accessories-%7c-parts/pc-components/cooling/lga1700-retrofit-kit/p/cw-8960091,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm looking at building right now, and i might go amd just because it seems a hell of a lot easier.","can't believe its may 2022, but i still can't find an aio cooler that comes out of the box with the lga 1700 mounting hardware.",can't say im interested in buying a $120 cooler then talking to customer service about shipping a $5 hardware pack separately.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i guess my point is that i find it hard to mod a brand new motherboard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yep, i actually reused the hardware from my previous build.",the retrofit kit came like a week later but i didnt see any issues or temp issues so i never bothered to swap out the screws.,got lazy.,lol the motherboard has the extra holes for the brackets and everything will fit just fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most people don't have issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so every cpu with lga1700 socket has this problem?,do you think it's a design flaw?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in general, positive pressure setups yield cooler temps than negative pressure

in your case, if you only have 3 fan slots (200 top, 120 rear, 120 front) your system would probably benefit most from 200 top as exhaust (hot air naturally rises), and both front and rear 120mm as intake.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"rear exhaust will generally be better but it depends on the fans, any intake fans and your cooler fan position - the flat ones just spray hot air all over the place creating eddies, a tower cooler will direct towards the exhaust only.","when under load though your exhaust fans probably still won't keep up with the cpu fan, also creating eddies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whatâ€™s your case?,and how many fans are you putting in your case?,also you should aim for a positive air flow in your case.,typically you would want intake on the front of your case.,and exhaust fans on the back and top of the case.,if i was you i would put the side panel fan below your intake fan.,so air comes in from the front of your case and is released through the top and back of the case.,but iâ€™m not 100% sure of your case layout so i guess do what ever you feel is right.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"firstly, it's a very old case hence why it has a side fan mounting.",it's an antec 900. the front fans no longer work when wired up to the psu (yes it uses molex connector).,i have side fan as an intake fan to combat the fact i don't have front fans as intake.,because it's such an old case it does not give me flexibility when it comes to replacing the front fans since the case has to come apart to get to them.,the 200mm top is an exhaust.,"however i was thinking about having 2 exhaust fans, one at the top and one at the rear.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why would you disable any ports?,thereâ€™s zero reason to do so.,"best guess, disabling the 3.0 ports isnâ€™t disabling them itâ€™s making them fall back to 2.0 and you didnâ€™t read the bios setting right.",doesnâ€™t fix the fact that youâ€™re playing around with pointless settings i wouldnâ€™t mess with.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you don't need them don't use them physically, no need to disable them in bios, are you some kind of pc noob or what?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
simply because i donâ€™t need them.,"https://imgur.com/a/gswc3bu
i guarantee i read it right.",maybe thereâ€™s something unwritten i donâ€™t understand here.,it seems very clear me to.,i believe that it could revert to a usb 2 but i donâ€™t even have 4 usb ports in general enabled yet 4 of my usb ports are working.,which i already said in the description.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no i just want the ones iâ€™m not using off as even if the power saving is not significant iâ€™m not using it anyway so.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very possible the feature is a legacy thing in the bios and msi didnâ€™t expect anyone to actually use it because thereâ€™s literally zero reason to turn them off ever unless itâ€™s a security issue (like government or business) which wouldnâ€™t use a consumer z690 board.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think you need to see a doctor for head.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean there is a reason.,usb ports do use minimal amounts of power.,i donâ€™t see a point in enabling the ones i donâ€™t use.,but other than that it does actually work because some ports did get disabled.,although it might not work well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what you want to bet that disabling them just puts a bios block on the resources and does *nothing* for physically depowering anything.,"plus, even if it did anything, youâ€™re pretty much chasing milliwatts for actual power usage of unused ports.","to your actual problem, ports are sometimes coupled in architecture so perhaps you canâ€™t disable an odd number (and if you can, and they are coupled, this just may be a bug for a generally unused feature).",what happens if you disable the next port?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>i mean there is a reason.,usb ports do use minimal amounts of power.,they won't use power unless you connect something.,i agree this is probably some legacy feature that is left over from when usb 3 was new that isn't intended to be used.,it is possible you're the first person to notice a lot of the toggles do nothing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
power doesn't work like you imagine.,for example turn of the wall plug switch of a not turning fan won't save you any energy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think you are right.,"i tried disabling all the ports and none work but if i disable one or three ports, 2 ports and 4 ports work respectively thanks man.","i got confused because it was usb 3 ports that were working, looks like it was just dual ports all along",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have selective suspend disabled (in windows)because itâ€™s buggy, does it use power in this case?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah but how much are you getting it for?,"it's still a extremely capable chip, but i don't think it's partially cheap used, and the motherboard board selection isn't great either (i think only a few are still sold new and motherboards often don't drop a ton in price like cpus when used).",you could probably get a lower end new chip like an i5-12400(f) for just as much or cheaper and i believe that should outperform it.,even an i3-12300(f) (assuming your gaming) could probably give it a run for it's money in most situations.,"those would also be on modern platforms and have modem features (such as pcie gen 4+5, resizable bar, and a viable upgrade path).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the c0 stepping is the one used by cpus with the hybrid architecture (with 8 p-cores and 8 e-cores in various combinations of what's enabled/disabled), and the h0 stepping is the one that only has 6 p-cores.",the i5-12400 and i5-12400f are two of the i5s that are being produced with both of the different steppings (i.e.,the different die designs).,the s-spec codes being used (as found etched on the heatspreader) indicate which stepping is in the chip.,"i5-12400:

most of the gains that are seen in gaming from disabling the e-cores has more to do with the ringbus frequency (which includes the l3 cache frequency).,"with the e-cores enabled, the ringbus typically clocks at 3.6ghz, and with the e-cores disabled it goes all the way up to 4.7ghz.","however, you can usually manually overclock your ringbus up to around 4.3ghz while leaving the e-cores enabled.","that gives you the advantages of having e-cores available, and reduces some of the performance loss from the slower l3 cache.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's measurable, proven, and widely benchmarked, though seems to be an unpopular opinion here because intel simps love their atom cores for some reason.","but for example my 12700k with e-cores off, and a bunch of background stuff and occasional screen recording etc, i never get close to 100% utilization, and frame-times are smooth as butter.","once the w11 scheduler matures you can check back in on common benchmarks to see what advantages you'd get from turning e-cores back on, but at ms's development pace that'll be a year or two.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"depending on your motherboard the option might be labeled differently, but for an asus motherboard (which is what i am most familiar with) you just need to find the option for 'ring down bin' and set it to disabled, and then set the 'min cpu cache ratio' and 'min cpu cache ratio' to the desired frequency like 43.","(100mhz x 43 = 4.3ghz)

you're doing a bit better than i am with my 6700k.,i would wait until raptor lake at the very least to get more desirable ddr5 speeds and prices.,cheapest ddr5 stick i could find is [16 gb for $150 cad](https://www.newegg.ca/adata-16gb-288-pin-ddr5-sdram/p/n82e16820215424).,"how strange, the same product goes for $170 usd on the us site.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there's aways something better on the horizon.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think if your 9700k is still offering the utility you need in your system there is no harm in waiting.,waiting until you are restrained by your pc's performance in a noticeable way will always get you better value and greater appreciation for your upgrade.,every new release will have greater clock speeds & ipc from not on as well as meteor lake having a greater transistor density.,i would wait until meteor lake given you'll be needing a new motherboard regardless and you'll have greater access to ddr5 as well as greater performance and or lower power consumption for the same price as alder lake costs.,"we've only started to scratch the surface of what the competition between amd, intel, nvidia, qualcomm and apple pc in the high end pc market segment will manufacture.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for multicore performance it'll be a large boost.,"for gaming, we're likely talking about performance you won't notice much for now.",i'd wait until you can get ddr5 for cheaper.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no details on the 13700k.,but the 13900k will double the e-core count.,if multi-threaded load are important to you and you're in not hurry to upgrade then wait it out.,if you're primarily interested in gaming/single-core loads the 12700k will do just fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"depends on your usage, purely gaming it's better to just spend your money on a highest tier gpu that you can afford if you want to see major improvement in your fps.","if you are bored and want a shiny new toy, i'll still recommend you to wait for raptor lake / zen 4, it's only months away.",for productivity it depends on the software you are using.,"for my usage, just upgrading from 3700x to 12700 and the improvements are very noticeable in productivity software like photoshop, blender,  clip studio paint, and hitfilm etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"meteor lake might get delayed, enjoy it now and flip alder lake.","tech is alway charging and youâ€™re always going to fomo, the next best thing is always around the corner.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i moved from a 9700k to 12700k (paired with a 3080) and am happy with my decision.,but it all depends on what you need and when.,raptor lake is like 6 months out.,then meteor lake is 6-9 months after that.,the arrow lake ends up very late 2023 or early 2024. you get the point.,if you wait there will always be a next best thing on the horizon.,"buy when you want to upgrade, not because you know a new product exists 6+ months away.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if u need to ask, you probably don't need it.",just hold off until it really starts bugging you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would say this entirely depends on your needs and budget.,"maybe you should ask yourself if your current setup does what you want it to do, rather that dream about what another one might possibly offer.","also, there's always something new on the horizon.",you could end up waiting forever with that kind of mindset.,i tend to wait for the more substantial changes.,"for me, alder lake was one of those occasions, although not to the degree i first thought.",ddr 5 is just not meaningful at this time.,"pcie 5.0 might not have practical meaning, but i'd rather err on the right side.","the e-cores are interesting, but ultimately not that meaningful in many cases.","alder lake did, however, offer a substantial performance lift compared to the previous generation while also being less power hungry.",the price was also fairly nice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you always wait for the next thing, you will never upgrade",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there's always the new thing on horizon, is it needed or just a nice new thing?","if there's nothing super intensive i'm sure the current gear will last, but i get that wouldn't it be nice feeling which comes with the latest stuff.","i'm on the gen before yours and suits my needs, i'm putting alittle money into an upgrade fund each month, so in few years i can splurge on an epic upgrade that'll last a good amount of time.",big leaps feels more rewarding to me.,ðÿ™‚,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if youâ€™re going to hold off donâ€™t get raptor lake as itâ€™s mobo platform likely wonâ€™t support meteor lake.,z690 supports alder lake and will support raptor lake.,but meteor lake may launch on a new platform.,"that being said, the 12700k will be a nice upgrade you should go for it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it might be better to hold off a couple of years and upgrade when the 14th gen drops.,then you can upgrade to ddr5 at the same time.,the 14700k is likely to be a massive increase in performance over the 9700k.,by that time ddr5 will be more mainstream and also cheaper.,if you upgrade to a 12700k and z690 now and stay on ddr4 then you might find yourself having to upgrade sooner.,at the end of the day if itâ€™s possible to hang on to your 9700k for that long then you should it.,but if you cannot wait then upgrade now.,i upgraded from a 9900k to a 12600k not because i needed up but because i wanted to.,i could have held on to my 9900k for a couple more years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i also have a 9700k running at 5.0. i'm going to wait another gen or so because the gains won't really out weigh the cost nor will they be substantial.,i'm also waiting for ddr5 to have tighter timings and more available,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on how badly you need an upgrade.,raptor lake will probably bring mostly mt improvements thanks to those extra 8 e cores.,meteor lake on the other side is a different thing entirely.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got almost the same setup i7-9700 with evga 3080 for gaming... im waiting for never cpus and then when prices of will drop a bit i will pull the trigger maybe on 12700 or 13700. we will see what the difference is there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would wait personally.,the 9700k is still a solid cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"hi, if you have the money ready you could wait for the new gen and in the while save a little more money to buy a better mobo or smthg else, saying this in regard that your cãºrrent cpu works so waiting for new gen and some benchmarks of it could left you to make a better decision in the end.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"interesting take, can't say i've really thought of that lol.","i suppose when i think about it, i don't really know what my needs are.",i think at this point my concern is future proofing.,i run my i7 with a 3080fe at 3440x1440.,the only thing that really makes my system chug is newer games like cyberpunk and what not.,i suppose my goal is just smooth 60+ fps gameplay for new games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"whoa, just looked it up and those suckers seem to hold their value amazingly well.",maybe i'll go with option 2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
changing cpu's in the socket and then selling doesn't usually have good returns.,"the fastest cpu's are those that keep their value their most, and trying to sell a lower alder lake model for a raptor lake upgrade might just be a significant economic loss.",and buying a higher alder model and switching it for raptor might be a waste of time.,"meteor lake might not be for desktop, so i wouldn't plan on there being a desktop upgrade significantly less than 12 months after raptor lake.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i think i might just go for it.,it seems like my current cpu and board flip for pretty decent prices.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's a good point.,i'm a little surprised that meteor lake is so close behind raptor lake.,do you feel like you got a noticeable increase in performance from the upgrade?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hmmm, do you feel like you noticed any change with that upgrade?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"""future proofing"" is bunk.","see, 3800x vs 5600x.","but, you're pretty much set for this whole console generation if you get a 12400/5600x, or splurge on a 12600k or 5800x.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cyberpunk is tough game to run regardless.,"my recommendation is to get a program like msi afterburner, which you can use to see graphs of cpu and gpu usage.",see if your gpu usage is staying around 100% while gaming.,"if itâ€™s staying below 100%, or dipping a lot, you have a bottleneck somewhere else (most likely cpu)

i just switched from a ryzen 3800x to a 12700k and am very pleased with the performance gain.",i generally advise against waiting if you feel the need to upgrade now and have the means to do so.,"there have been many times i was told to wait, only for the new thing to be delayed or perform far worse than rumored.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what about that juicy on-chip data integrity check though?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
from my little bit of research it seems ddr4 is the way to go and if you really want ddr5 then go with the lowest speeds.,the high clock speeds on ddr5 is causing memory latency and can end with a net loss over ddr4.,some chip/board combos can handle that but it seems even the higher end boards such as aorus master and the like can have issues.,i'm running a 9900k with 2080ti and decided ill wait until next gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

intel is accelerating its roadmap.,"they are going from intel 7, intel 4, intel 3, intel 20a, and then intel 18a by 2025 or 2026.

that's a process node jump every year.",alder lake was out 2021.  that is the first.,raptor is on intel 7. then 2023 meteor will be on intel 4. right around the corner.,so all the good shit is coming out soon.,grab what you want.,intel 4 means it will be equal to or better than tsmc n5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not a lot is known about meteor lake.,"all they said is that laptop launches first some time in 2023, desktop comes later or might even get cancelled.","meteor lake is a mobile focused design, with a small ipc uplift.","on the other hand raptor lake will be a modest 5-10% increase in gaming performance over 12th gen, and maybe 20% for application performance on average.",launches 2h this year,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in one game - far cry 4 - the 9900k was bottlenecking my 3080. with the 12600k i get an increase in fps.,but bear in mind this game is old and i hardly ever play it anymore.,in other games i donâ€™t really notice any difference.,one difference i do notice is that the 12600k runs a lot cooler than my 9900k with the same case and cpu cooler.,you will definitely notice an increase in performance vs the 9700k but only you can decide if the cost is worth it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah i forgot that a lot of what we play on pc are console ports.,"having a 144hz monitor, that's definitely a goal for me, but we all know that's not something that's easy to achieve.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
key note though the human eye can only see up to 60hz the frame rate and hz only help the game to look more realistic and run smoother.,you cannot really detect much past the 60hz anyway.,so the rest is money spent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, that's interesting.",i think the jump to ddr5 might be one of the last ones i make.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"at least for the time being you'll totally saturate a 144hz monitor with a 12400.

an oc 12600k with the e-cores off is even better, mostly for raising the floor on minimums and stutter, but a 12400 isn't very stuttery as is (nor would a 5600x be)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"shutdown your laptop (full shutdown, hold shift while clicking shutdown) or go into bios and disconnect battery (if you have that option, or disconnect it physically if you can.)","with battery off and laptop unplugged from power, hold power button for 30 seconds to dissipate any old residual charge.",then reconnect ac and boot into windows.,device should show up.,i made a reply about this where bluetooth/wifi wasnâ€™t showing up on someoneâ€™s desktop and doing this fixed it.,hope itâ€™s the same on laptops.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pretty normal lol.,processors have to process things.,lowering the clock speed will make it worse.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm confused why you thought downgrading from a 5600x to a 11700f was a good idea anyways.,not to mention you seem to have gotten confused with the cpu models as i'm sure you [actually wanted](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare/amd-ryzen-5-5600x-vs-intel-i7-11700f-vs-intel-i7-11700kf/3859vs4264vs4234) an 11700kf which is unlocked and not tdp capped.,turning off hyper threading or lowering frequency will essentially increase cpu usage because you're essentially downsizing a staff of 16 workers down to 8 workers.,"if you give 8 workers the same workload as 16, clearly the 8 workers will be more occupied hence an even greater increase in cpu usage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i see your temperature is a bit on the high side - what is your room temperature like?,i suggest you use hwinfo to see if your cpu is thermal/power throttling - which will cause lots shuttering in game.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bad switch not gonna lie,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fr?,cause i had an 5600x and when i look at other peoples benchmark with 11700 doesnt reach that high of usage and it kinda pisses me off when it has like overly high cpu usage and just stutters in game all the othergame perform fine but warzone just avg at 120fps or even lower cause the cpu keep running in 60-70 usage and i even used the adv\_settings to set it to half of my core count which its 4 and still manage to have high load,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"itâ€™s an upgrade (6 cores to 8, with similar single-core performance), albeit not one iâ€™d ever advise since itâ€™s within the same generation and only moving up one single tier.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the stuttering isn't normal but the cpu usage is.,esports games tend to be far more reliant on the cpu than gpu.,i would look at your clock speeds (cpu and gpu) when the stuttering starts and see if it's dropping heavily.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
kinda regret switching to intel if its normal then,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hadnâ€™t noticed that.,passmark shows 22100 / 3380 for the 5600x and 21460 / 3340 for the 11700f.,that is definitely a non-upgrade!,"even the 11700kf, non-overclocked at least, is a generally sideways change.","at $300 usd for the 11700f, he shouldâ€™ve gone for the $270 12600kf and at least gotten scores of 27100 / 3980.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
soâ€¦ your ryzen cpu wasnâ€™t used before while playing games?,what was performance like?,and why do you think that the solution to â€œhighâ€ cpu usage would be to hack away at the cpuâ€™s capabilities so that itâ€™s even less capable of doing whatever is being demanded of it?,"i mean troubleshooting system issues youâ€™re having, like stuttering or throttling or low fps is one thing, but iâ€™m pretty sure youâ€™ve misidentified what the actual problem is.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"idk whatâ€™s going on with passmark, but it seems thereâ€™s something wrong with it if it thinks an eight-core rocket lake part isnâ€™t substantially better in multithreading than a six-core zen 3.

the 12600kf also ought to be faster than that: all reviews iâ€™ve seen show a lead of 40-50% in multicore over the 5600x.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, sometimes passmark is weird.","i trust cinebench r23 a bit more (only within +/-500 points as it can be erratic too), but canâ€™t seem to find many reviews of the 11700.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
generally i consider it a safe bet to just find an 11700k review and subtract 2-5% across the board.,"as for cinebench, it seems reliable as a proxy for average performance within the x86 desktop and laptop spaces, but it behaves really damn strangely on apple siliconâ€¦ or maybe thatâ€™s just because apple are professional cherry-pickers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not sure why you got downvoted.,i think your reasoning is good.,"but, i guess, the thing is, the issues or complaints rather - have persisted through a number of intel and amd motherboard generations - with this intel lan chip - so, the large pattern of complaints or reports of issues - is somewhat of a large coincidence that is very hard to ignore?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, numerous small file copies in windows can be quite slow.",a single 10gb file or so should be adequate for a baseline.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think it would be suggested that you do file transfers as well - both small and large files - from  the 'problematic lan' pc to another pc on your network.,then note the speeds.,the speed tests are interesting but there's a lot going on - regarding speed tests and the file transfers and comparing to the other (built-in) card would be most useful in your comparison and evaluation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

just did some testing with iperf3 to another computer in my network.,"the speeds were completely identical with both network cards -> [results](https://imgur.com/a/xwj055m)

however, speedtest are still weird.",did several speedtests with the speedtest from my isp (and i made sure no one of my family downloads anything).,"heres what the speedtests look like: [intel i225](https://imgur.com/a/621tkks) and [realtek (tp-link tg3468)](https://imgur.com/a/sisnc9w)

sometimes the speedtest with the intel works fine, but most of the time the speeds drop heavily after being normal for a second",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

edit: ups nvm i just saw its a realtek, but im gonna leave the comment since it could help one or another",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wow im surprised, i have exactly the same issue, same nic(v3), same provider(vodafone 1000 mbit/s)  and the speedtest of the provider measures the bandwidth to router and says it can archive 1000+mbits and suggests to search for the problem in the local network.... router is fritzbox 6660

tried all kinds of settings to see if any setting is causing it but no success",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

how much are you willing to spend?,do you want to have an upgrade option for 13th gen?,"for your purpose, 12600k is enough.",you can slightly overclock it and get a good  ddr4 samsung b die such as 3200 cl14: 14-14-14-34 or better then overclock it to highest speed your imc supports and tighten timings.,that should give you boost in gaming fps,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the 12400f is the best value overall.,12600k just has 4 e cores and is not really worth it for just gaming.,12700k is the do it all champ.,i would go 12400f or 12700k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"honestly, the cpu doesn't matter for gaming and streaming.",stream encoding is also done by discrete gpus.,actually the 12th gen intel integrated gpu performs worse than the 11th gen integrated gpus.,so i suggest you to put this money into a new discrete gpu altogether instead of buying a new cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why is it good enough?","* amd 4700s (playstation 5 cpu) scores sc2402 & mc18225 in passmark
* intel i5-12400f scores sc3566 & mc19668 in passnark

12700k is a great cpu.,i have mine and get the same gaming performance as 12900k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hating is unreasonable, but they mean good i suppose.","the 12400f is the best bang for the buck out of those, just great value, the not so insignificant extra (\~ +55%) for the 12600k is not really worth it for what you get, but if you have more budget and want to get something a bit better and more ""future-proof"", the 12600k is the way to go.",the 12700k is not worth it for gaming; should be about the same performance while costing \~$100 more.,so: do you care about paying about $300 instead of sub-200 or does it not really matter?,do you plan to keep the cpu for a longer time (4+ years) or are you likely to change it every second generation?,"if you don't care about the price difference or plan to keep it for a longer time, go for the 12600k, otherwise the 12400f would really be the wisest choice - it's not a slow cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why not 12700 non-k then if not overclocking ?,"it's only 100 mhz down from 12700k, and it's got more cache, cores, and clocks than 12600k.",i.e.,better for gaming and streaming than 12600k and barely slower than non oc 12700k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, the main selling point of the 12700(k) is more cores.","speed-wise, they're practically the same, i think.",i'd probably pick the 12600k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if youâ€™re not gonna overclock get 12700f,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

itâ€™s barely better than a 12600k plus iâ€™d rather pay a little extra for better 12700k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"iâ€™m getting the 12700k, 12900k is the fastest gaming cpu on the market even if its for workstation stuff",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
â€œbarely better than a 12600kâ€ itâ€™s the same performance as the 12700k.,only difference is that itâ€™s not overclockable.,"donâ€™t look at the base clock, itâ€™s useless.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's a decent improvement over 12600k:

12600k:  6 p cores, 4 e cores, 20mb cache

12700:  +2 pcores (+33%), 25mb cache (+5mb).",comes with a box cooler too that is good enough for almost all tasks.,"games like cache..

should be ok with a 12600k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

itâ€™s literally the tiniest bit better than a 12600k itâ€™s not same as a 12700k either but i get where youâ€™re coming from,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

those specs look good for the pc you are upgrading.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the cpu using 260w is normal but those temps are not good.,even though you have a liquid cooler it still gets to those temps.,maybe you are just overclocking it too much which is making it get too hot.,if you lightly overclock it will it still get that hot?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
more voltage = more heat.,itâ€™s as simple as that.,unless you have some liquid nitrogen on hand then lower your overclock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
stock all core turbo is 4.5ghz on that chipâ€¦.,and youâ€™re saying that adding 1ghz to that is getting too hot?,strange for alder lake.,and itâ€™s worrisome that youâ€™re hitting 109c when the chip throttles at 100c.,sounds bad - thermal shutdown will occur at 115c.,you might want to look into liquid nitrogen cooling to keep that oc at good temperatures.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
youâ€™re gonna ruin your chip if you keep it at 100c+ all the time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i tried 5.2ghz around 210w and yet still very hot.,"(109 dg+, btw i didnâ€™t oc the e-cores same as above thread title",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the i3-8100 would be the closest.,a modern 12100 blows them both away though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i3-8100, the 8350k is a little faster though",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why not 10th gen i3 instead of 12th gen pentium?,sure pure single core would not be as good as 12th gen but you would still have the 4 cores 8 threads of the 2nd gen i7?,checking passmark benchmarks at [cpubenchmark.net](https://cpubenchmark.net) shows the i7-2600k got a single thread rating of 1744 while the i3-10100f brings it up to 2603 with the pentium gold g7400 would be 3080 then looking at cpu mark the 2600k would be 5494 while the g7400 with it's 2 cores 4 threads would be 6930 with the 10100f being 8854 with its 4 cores 8 threads just like the old i7.,"looking at prices, here in canada at least looking at the canadian pc part picker, the i3-10100f is on sale/discounted to $110 from amazon canada while there's only 1 (not preferred) store that shows the g7400 but it's out of stock there with a price of $104 so only $6 cheaper than the 2 gen older i3, then looking at prices for motherboards cheapest h610 would be the asus prime h610m-a d4-csm for like $115 from amazon canada while they have one of the cheapest h410 boards with the asus pro h410m-c/csm for $90 or for the same price from memory express there's the asus prime h410m-a/csm, if wanting to go up to h510 though it would only be a extra $5 up to $95 for the asus prime h510m-e.

therefore the older i3 platform would be cheaper by $26-31 (cad, situation may be different in usd) over the current pentium that may be harder to find and lacking when it comes to cores & therefore multicore performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

so glad i opted to take the i7 2600k instead of saving some cash years ago and buying the i5 2500k.,friends did the latter and were forced to upgrade much sooner.,i ran mine with only gpu upgrades for almost 8 or so years!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had the i7 3770. it aged really well.,i only upgraded because a friend gave me an rtx 2080 super for a good price and i wanted to match it up with an alder lake i5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah the ""base clock"" can be lower because the i7 has more cores and base tdp is measured by running prime95 at that frequency on all cores.",if the i5 and i7 have the same base tdp and the i7 has more cores then logically by specification the i7 must have a lower base clock.,in real world scenarios base clock never applies because the chip's turbo boosts come into play and have it running as high frequency as the vrms and cpu can support.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i normally start with a cheap pentium (which is always good enough for me) and upgrade to a used i5 5 years later.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"oh, it's been edited... this morning there wasn't any hint about the gpu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"then i'd go with the 13700k, lol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"11700k actually

also the 11400 performs more like a 3600 than a 5600x",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™d say theyâ€™re [pretty close](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bajvm01d2hw).,depends on the game.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"o i looked at this thing and they seemed similar / in between the 3600 and 5600x https://www.techspot.com/review/2232-intel-core-i5-11400f/

in the overall benchmark",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
quick sync is probably all the motivation you need to get the k version.,yea you can save a few bucks getting the kf but you dont ever know you need the igpu until you need the igpu.,better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™d take the normal k. i know you are not planning to use the igpu, but it sucks not to have it if you need it.",exactly why i just spent the little bit of extra on the 12700k over the kf.,"makes building easier too, as you can test, set up the system without adding the gpu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks everyone very much.,i've decided to get an i5 12600k.,:),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can you ever see yourself using the integrated graphics?,if not get the kf.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you don't need the integrated graphics, save the money",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why are you asking?,you can afford a 3070 you can afford the extra $15.,"useless post, just google your question.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i know i wont be using the integrated graphics.,but the problem is that im not sure if the quick sync in the k version would help anything with my after effects work while using rtx 3070.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
true.,i'd get the one with an igpu.,years from now he can use it for something that's not graphically demanding.,maybe a passively cooled micro system for house automation etc.,"when i was building a 4k editing pc for a friend, i failed to find info how much igpu helped in different task when paired with modern dgpu.",:(,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i really couldnt answer that.,my whole thing with k vs kf is troubleshooting.,when the gpu starts acting up you literally have no way to access your pc without another one just laying around.,thats the only reason i say go k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that moment your gpu craps out and a new one is impossible to find...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it will boost to the stated frequency as long as the motherboard can provide enough power.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all depends on the silicon lottery bro.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it will work exactly like on a z-series motherboard if you were not overclocking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as long as you buy a good quality one, meaning it has proper vrm heatsinks, it will perform fine.",the only difference will be you cannot overclock unless you go with z690.,"and the all core turbo for the 12600k is 4.5 ghz, 4.9 is for single core.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thats good!,i wouldnt use 5ghz and above since i saw in benchmarks will start getting rlly hot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it can be done through bios?,or a software,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hmm, but do u think it is ever possible for it to run at 4.9ghz on non-z motherboards?",i can test my luck,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it will boost to 4.9 by default.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
only z motherboards can overclock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it times out when i try to download it too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the ud gigabyte board pictured actually has a good vrm.,stay away from asrock as their vrm's and cooling are terrible (cannot deliver enough power so throttles cpu).,"if you are into vr, stay away from asus as asmedia usb controllers are notorious for lacking support & being generally unstable for things that require high speed usb.","additionally, if you like a good warranty asus has you *not* covered.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i got the prime z690 wifi version,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for 12600k get the msi pro b660m-a.,great for thermals and benchmarks speed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i say, charge your phone bro",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have the asus prime z690p ddr4 and i absolutely love it with my 12600k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the first one.,"if you purchase the second, you're just gonna make an asus of yourself... (drum roll\*)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i use the asus tuf z690.,i think itâ€™s midrange but ocs well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i like the msi tomahawk + 12700 kf.,good vrm cooling and value,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"im using a msi z690-a pro ddr5 with a 12700kf, and itâ€™s such a good board, fine uefi features, good stability, oc and temps.",i recommend it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have purchased a z690 edge ddr 4 with a 12700 k. can anyone suggest best memory to use.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

iâ€™m using this with my 12700k.,just make sure you check your cooler fits the new socket size.,rookie mistake and i didnâ€™t ðÿ˜,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yup iâ€™m using this too with my 12700k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
definitely get the msi board.,i had numerous problems with the gigabyte z690 ud.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thank you, iâ€™m unsure what cpu do you have do you have any of these boards iâ€™m stuck in between asus and the msi but someone says gigabyte isnâ€™t that great and msi has issues, iâ€™m unsure whether to get a 12600k and a better motherboard or 12700k and a okay motherboard like the prime or pro",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i second this.,the msi pro series boards are great if you want a no frills z chipset board.,i got a 9th gen one for my build and the price was more than fair.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah iâ€™d need the xmp,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wait, it won't run xmp with *ddr4*?","i had hell with one using ddr5, but... ddr4 has been easy mode for years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why what's the problem with asus ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"asus prime and yeah iâ€™d think msi is most popular iâ€™m stuck on what to go with lol, asus prime z690p or b660 or msi pro z690 or gigabyte gaming x or aorus elite someone said stay away from gigabyte due to bios",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what msi board,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah unsure iâ€™ve been debating what cpu to get and think am going to go for a 12700k with a motherboard but dk whether to asus or msi z690 or b660,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what about the z690 pro rs?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i want a 12700k with something z690 or b660 but idk what to go for iâ€™ve got a 360mm aio,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what cpu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1270k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what bios are you running,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice what about with a 12700k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
were you able to get ram oc working?,i cant seem to get xmp to work.,i read a post about raising the vccio but the menus a bit confusing right now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ðÿ¤£,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is it good yeah?,and people are saying stay away from gigabyte but someone else says gigabyte and msi is best,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah you wouldâ€™ve been better with the msi pro apparently compared to that the price is silly for what you get,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as with my other comment reply to whether you want z690 or b660.,"the k series and z690 are a combo for overclocking, giving you more performance in game.",if youâ€™re not overclocking and just using xmp and gaming then get a b660 and i7-12700 (non-k) version.,youâ€™ll save some $$$ for sure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not needing ocing but itâ€™s for gamimg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bit too much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah i wouldnâ€™t get a ddr5 because the prices of ddr5, donâ€™t know if ddr4 board is any good mostly heard the ddr5 one is",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what version did you have,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what one are you using?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what one?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what about the gigabyte gaming x or aorus elite,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"have the gigabyte too, xmp works for me, two ram sticks - 2x 8 gb",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at least not with the two 16gb corsair 3600mhz sticks i have.,to be fair i have put zero effort into making it work.,"edit\*

this is the kit if anyone has more insight",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i put some (minimal) effort in and found the xmp setting wasn't bumping the memory voltage to 1.35v as it should have been.,was showing 1.2v in one section of the bios and 1.3v in another.,manually set it and all working as it should now.,"going strong for a couple of hours, will see how it goes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,it's pretty much only the budget & midrange intel motherboards which have sub-par vrm's.,their higher end boards like the taichi are great.,on amd their budget & mid range boards are much better as the cpu's don't draw much power so you don't need really powerful vrm's to get the best performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i recommend gigabyte.,"can't say much about msi however, since the last time i had one was with a ryzen 5 1600, and the bios was pretty terrible.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for being honest.,i too experienced something similar with my purchase of asrock from years earlier.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
some of the very cheap budget asus mobos don't have the best vrm cooling.,again just depends on the brand.,"for warranty services, gigabyte and msi were always on point for me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for 12600k?,"pretty much anyone should do, i would try to go for gaming edge or plus.",i have gaming plus z490 msi mobo.,"with 10700k oc to 5.2ghz on all cores, avg 55c with 1.34avg during gaming.",https://ibb.co/vp12x3g,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i moved from msi/gigabyte to asus on my last pc (pre-build to get a 3070) and i really enjoy asus' interface to the older msi/gigabyte.,"maybe they've updated their software, but the current asus software is top-notch.",you do have to watch overclocking on the cheaper motherboards due to vrm quality but not the mid and top and would affect performance \~5% at the most and only top-end.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if youâ€™re going k then it makes sense to get a z690.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you're getting a k cpu, get a z690.","if you go b660, get a non-k; you're wasting money on features you can't use otherwise.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i know the price is inflated.,i don't approve of some of the sketchy things msi has apparently done in the past.,"plus, my last board was an asus, and i didn't have a single issue with it for the 11 years i had it.","i intend this build to last a long time, so reliability is key.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
apparently,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you don't need / don't want to oc just get the 12700 non-k and b660.,"12700k is pretty much only useful for overclocking, so if you don't its pretty much the exact same cpu.",base clock may seem lower but all-core turbo exists now anyway.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah think itâ€™s if you have 32gb iâ€™m unsure what to get,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what's counted as their mid range?,steel legend?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12700k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah no idea what to go for itd only be asus prime z690 msi pro or gigabyte aorus elite and gaming x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™ve got 360mm aio and idk what motherboard to go for think iâ€™m going for msi pro,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah with what board is the question,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah still though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
b660 with a k cpu is not a good idea.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so what would you go for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah no idea everyoneâ€™s got a different say, i just thought msi or gigabyte would be best but unsure since everyoneâ€™s saying mixed",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i went 12700k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what did you need the audio for iâ€™m just gaming and streaming so wonâ€™t it still be alright,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whatâ€™s that mean and what cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is it really good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah am staying far away from gigabyte the amount of people whoâ€™s said itâ€™s bad and what not compared to whoâ€™s said itâ€™s fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks iâ€™m more towards asus and msi pro as iâ€™ve heard that the gigabyte is really bad and has the most bad news,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the pro4 and phantom gaming 4 are the ones people are talking about.,i've personally built and used some machines with pro4 and phantom gaming 4 mobos and they've been rock solid and are never anywhere near dangerous temps but all of those machines had superb airflow so take all this with a grain of salt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the same thing, msi or gigabyte is the way to go, and i just had a better experience in the past when it came to ocing and vrm cooling.",just make sure it comes with a beefy vrm cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah iâ€™d be getting z690 but iâ€™m stuck on whether to go for 12600k or 12700k and whether to get asus prime or msi pro board (z690),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the 11400 is supposed to boost to 4 ghz.,"it seems like your cpu is power limit throttling, just check the bios and see if you can remove any power limits.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
likely power limited due to a cheap vrm configuration with no heatsink and cpu cooler.,you can check the bios but its likely locked to prevent users from increasing it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have the same cpu though its dell (office edition.. hehe).,for reference to play ori will of wisp you need to go down to 90% from 720p just to make it run 60fps.,at that point gpu usage is already 99%.,i think minecraft is lighter than ori so maybe you can get better result.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the 1235u should solidly beat the 1165g7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"alright, but a 19% ipc uplift still means itâ€™ll beat the 1165g7 if they really have the same core count.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thing is that they donâ€™t have the same core count.,"itâ€™s a 9w i5-1230u, 2 p 8 e vs 28w i7-1165g7, 4 â€œpâ€.",if you see cinebench r23 results for multi-core and single core they legit score almost the exact same results.,"you do get more energy efficiency with the i5-1230u i think, so better battery life.",but how exactly can you calculate ipc in cpus?,kind of new to that info.,but i donâ€™t know how that affects into these performance benchmarks that are identical.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"in addition to the other comments, the e cores are used in the atom, celeron silver and pentium silver branded processors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"e core is what they used to call ""atom core"".","p core is the regular core that you found in the i3/i5/i7 chips until 11th gen.

they never put atom cores with regular cores in any of their chips prior to alderlake, that's the only thing that's new about alderlake, the p and e cores are just branding.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is none.,p-cores are simply far bigger and more powerfull (higher clocks and higher ipc) than the little cores.,"intel choose this route, because the e-cores, in theory, use the precious die-space of the cpu more effectively, than p-core only.","1 p-core equals about 4 e-cores, so the 12900k could have been a 10 core 20 thread p-core only chip, instead of the 16 core 24 thread implementation, we see now.","and yes, the 12900k is a true 16 core cpu, even if half the cores are ""little"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">with cut down instruction sets 

i thought the isa was the same but the performance was lower.",this is news to me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the e cores were supposed to be skylake cores, not atom cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes there are differences.,p dies take more space and are optimised for performance.,e cores take less space and they are optimised for power consumption.,"example [here](https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2021/08/intel-alder-lake-desktop-mobile-configurations-100899792-orig.jpg?auto=webp) also e cores dont have hyperthreading, p cores do.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">1 p-core equals about 4 e-cores, so the 12900k could be a 10 core 20 thread p-core only chip, instead of the 16 core 24 thread implementation, we see now.","as a former intel employee, i don't agree with the that equation, the performance doesn't scale that way.",">intel choose this route, because the e-cores, in theory, use the precious die-space of the cpu more effectively, than p-core only.","uhhh nope, they're trying this architecture out to reduce power consumption and get back at apple.","arrowlake which is supposed to come out in 2023 is aimed at beating apple's best in-house chip that would be used in the mac pro, it not only uses the hybrid architecture from alderlake but also the chiplet stacking that you're gonna see in meteorlake that's gonna come out later this year.","although i'd like to think intel can pull it off with arrowlake, the rejigging of product skus that have been happening point to failure of sticking to the tdp and hence you'll see reduced number of cores/threads in the final product.",the original highest config arrowlake chip was supposed to have 8 dual-threaded p cores with hyperthreading enabled and 32 e cores.,but now the highest end config is down by a massive number of cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so an fx 6300 is also a 6 core?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that's why you are former employee.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"technicially yes, because you have 6 independent integer cores with own schedulers.","the fact, that the ressources are shared, and that it leads to a bad performance is irrelevant.","an fx 6300 is a 6 core, as well as the 12900k is a true 16 core chip.","and before someone comes up with the amd lawsuit: it was a settlement, not a sentencing.",amd simply did want to get over it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so what you're saying is they have the same instruction set since the p cores have avx-512 disabled and caching is internal to the hardware and not in any form controllable from software.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i read somewhere that they were recycled skylark cores, but upon looking it up, the e-cores really are atom cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is controllable through the bios on earlier alder lake systems.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"what do you mean ""earlier alder lake systems""?",alder lake is brand spanking new.,all alder lake systems are as early as they're going to get.,unless you mean older uefi firmware revisions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel started fusing avx-512 off recently, so earlier weeks of production... as well as a bios that doesn't prevent it from being enabled.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it works perfectly well, but the e-cores don't support avx-512 and it's really hard to manage routing instructions between cores since the instruction mix can change in an instant, so it's just easier to disable avx-512 completely.",intel fusing it off is just intel being intel... no freebies!,the solution will be for the e-cores to share an avx-512 fpu in a cluster akin to how amd implemented their old flexfpu (which is the basis of zen's fpu).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

fps depends on so many things that nobody can give you an answer to that.,but with 8600k you can relatively easily get ~10% more cpu performance by overclocking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it depends on your cpu cooler on how much you can overclock.,i've seen people run the 8600k @ 5 ghz.,"csgo is a very cpu bound game so you will probably notice a nice little bump in fps, nothing crazy though.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea i tought that too but i think that the cpu is the weak point in my pc so i think i should try to boost the performance a bit.,just seems very complicated at first tho :d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have corsair h150 or whatever that watercooler is so i think i should try to overclock it a bit.,thanks for the answer!,:),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there are a lot of guides for overclocking.,any guide that is written for intel skylake derivatives (6000-10000 series) should work for you.,you donâ€™t really need to adjust anything but core multipliers and core voltage.,you need an overclocking capable motherboard of course (intel z series chipset).,with 8600k you should be able to get something like 4.8ghz at 1.25v or 5ghz at 1.35v.,i would start at 4.4ghz at 1.25v and see how high i can get the multiplier without increasing the voltage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
okay im gonna try that!,thanks a lot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you have any luck installing the h10?,i got curious and bought one and put it in my msi prestige 15 2019 model that has a 10710u comet lake processor.,"it seems to me that unless the laptop was made specifically with optane in mind, it will lack something necessary.",tried installing the intel rapid storage technology driver but it kept failing.,also my bios has noting related to optane or rst.,"first windows only saw 2gb from the drive, so i used the diskpart tool to erase it.",hopefully it can be made to work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

just curious what kind of framerates do you get at what resolution?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
those are surprising good temperatures!,do you think the gpu has anything to do with them?,"i'm building a 12400 build and i won't get a gpu and cooler until may, but i was thinking about playing some valorant with the igpu on low and i'm worried temps might get too hot",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

nice !,i guess nobody wants an air cooler:(,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you want to stick with air cooling like i do check out the noctua nh-u12a.,that's a good heatsink.,"yeah i have a 200 mm fan in the front of my case and a 200 mm fan on top, and a 120 in the back.",that has good airflow.,"i could also use 2x120mm fan in front or on top, but back then at least most 200mm fans moved about 2.5- 3 times as much air as a 120mm fan in the same series, so i used 200s where i could.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

excited for the hx chips and arc graphics :d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's impressive how fasts laptops are nowadays but i really wonder how many watts that chip is sucking down under an all-core load.,"somewhat related, i hope with alder-like and zen4 (but likely in a few generations) that intel and amd will be able to close a lot of the efficiency gap compared to the m1.",my macbook air is faster and more efficient than the dev laptop (i7 1185g7) i was given at work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm waiting for dell to announce xps 15 refresh with alder lake.,need to upgrade mine.,"won't go for the top top sku however since the xps can't really handle the thermals for many generations now, imo it's better to get one of the slightly downclocked top-end versions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all core load is really rare anyways.,most of the time you use only a few cores.,early reviews of intel alder lake laptops and amd zen3+ (rembrandt) have shown that under single core tests intel and amd can easily consume 20-28w.,apples m1 firestorm core is 5-7w for a single core while achieving  similar performance.,the efficiency gap is almost hard to believe.,youâ€™re totally right that itâ€™s going to take a few generations at least for intel or even amd before they are competitive.,apple is going to be on top for a few years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>i really wonder how many watts that chip is sucking down under an all-core load.,this will depend heavily on the laptop and the temp and noise levels.,laptops that these hx will go into can handle 60w like its nothing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also hoping for a zen 4 impl with tb4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that would be great.,dell hasn't offered amd yet in the xps line and my guess that will continue for now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's very important to have two sticks of ram, so it runs in dual channel mode.",other than that the pc is perfectly fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there shouldn't be any issue with the combo.,"you won't get max fps because of your cpu, but unless you're getting a 12900k, you'll never get 100% of the fps cause its always relative.","you'll be fine and won't even notice it, and your gpu will still reach 100% usage, if that's your concern",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"it supports dual channel.. its just a single dimm per module, aka it's limited to 2 ram slots instead of 4. which isn't a big deal, since it's recommended to run 2 module kits anyways instead of 4.

not having memory overclocking/xmp isn't as bad as it sounds either as h610 will support up to 3200mhz which is still the sweet spot for ddr4 price to performance, and in gaming the difference between 3200 and 4000 is like 2% on 12th gen.

well i commend him for trying but this test was just wrong.,he even admitted that comparing those coolers by using different cpu architectures is meaningless.,all he did was to compare stock 5600g vs 12400 processors not those coolers.,"and then he went with amd vs intel ""drivers"", which is not really a thing and then his stuttering and crashing complaint with 5800x which again judging by his previous statements and testing methodology raises some questions on those claims.","i really think that currently alderlake is go-to choice for most people ranging from budget 12100/12400 range all the way to high end 12900k but this video im afraid aint it, author needs to learn and research a bit more into this kind of content.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pretty fair comparison as it's what is included out of the box.,"arguing he should have tested the cooler on both architectures is pointless as it's not how you would receive the cooler, nor how anyone would ever use it.","the comparison was to see which one kept the their respective product cooler, not which one is a better cooler, at least that is the only point that matters.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the difference is just 10% in single core, but in multicore the new alder lake is a beast and has a 50% lead due to the extra efficiency cores it has.",there are not that many work tasks that scale well beyond 8 cores.,i doubt that you would notice that difference much unless you were doing those specific (often professional) tasks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah and even in this case only if he had rtx 3090 or 6900 xt and he was pro enough to notice difference between 300 and 400 fps.,basically to op: no you will not notice any difference in gaming.,"you would notice difference in some workloads that actually scale well for more than 8 cores, but those workloads are pretty rare as most computations are pretty thread dependent (mostly some encoding stuff etc truly scale so each core can work truly on its own stuff).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah you're probably leaning more on the gpu for your game performance than the cpu.,"so a cpu upgrade would provide a small boost to your numbers, but if you switched the numbers off and just experienced the game?",i doubt you'd be able to tell.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what's you cpu cooler?,assuming it's an adequate model it's probably not mounted properly.,check the heatsink and thermal paste.,12600k should not be reaching those temps if run at stock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what the hell are you doing to get those temps?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
always give undervolting a go.,it's pretty safe and easy if you watch a guide.,"if you do it correctly, you'll get no performance loss and a decent temp drop usually.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the temperatures are under full load while playing a cpu intensive game, it seems to stay around 70c, but occasionally the reading spikes very high, up to high 90s or low 100s for 1 reading.",is this something i should be concerned with?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"also, if you run a stress test, it can get super hot before the cooler responds to the increased load / temps, as thatâ€™s the max temp youâ€™re worried about.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have th same issue with same cooler and cpu.,it seems they a lot of people have th is exact issue.,some people say it is what it is.,others say to remount the cooler and spread the paste.,some people say to add washers like igor.,i'm pretty sure at this point you literally have to try everything possible and it still may not work.,consensus is to undervolt the cpu or limit the power.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ouch, wtf are those temps mate?",there is something dramatically wrong with your cooling if you're getting this with an 360 aio.,"on my oc'd 12700k (less cores, but tdp is not that far off), i barely cross the 80c mark in intensive benchmarks, and gaming very rarely goes above 65c degrees.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah, they are high, the case is a p500a and it has a ekwb 360mm aio with the lga 1700 adapter but i think the aio isn't having perfect contact with the cpu.",i tried repasting etc but it stays with the same temps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i have the exact same cpu, mobo and aio.","never goes above 60 in games, and i idle at 29. ambient is usually ~19/20.",the only times i see 80+ temps are in cinebench with a power draw of about 300 watts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"...if you think aio mounting is a pain, you're yet to try one of the massive hsfs!",at least in terms of mounting on the socket.,"aios are a blessing for cpu swaps, once you have the radiator mounted where you want it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i get that, maybe it's just that the ihs has some weird angle to it and there's not much you can do if you don't want to lap it.",maybe you could look into undervolting though?,"depending on your setup and a bit of luck, it can yield great results with only a fraction of performance lost, usually it's not even noticeable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
now iâ€™m curious how alder lake compares to ryzen at similar pier consumption.,say you drop the clocks some more to get similar power usage how would they compare?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it has to do with die size.,a gpu has a much bigger die so the heat is transfered faster over into the water.,also a gpu is direct die cooled while a cpu has an ihs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how much does gpu heat output affect water cooled cpus?,"i do notice the difference on my (badly) air cooled prebuilt, where the cpu goes to 80c at about 85-90 watts, but if there's an extra 110 coming from a underclocked 3060ti, it can only deal with 72 watts before tripping over 80 (then the prebuilt fan ramps up to helicopter noise levels...)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"are you using high performance as your power plan and or a combination of disabling the cpus ability to dial the clocks down in bios (don't have an intel system atm, i forgot what the feature or features are called, like speed shift, speed step, tvb etc).",i see plenty of users do it because they read somewhere that they should but reality is you're not letting your cpu dial its clocks down to conserve energy and produce less heat when it's not in a demanding use scenario.,"it will automatically boost them up in milliseconds when needed so you're not even letting performance on the table, only hurting your thermals.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"idling at 60 c is beyond the scope of living in a warmer climate, unless op has no air conditioning",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, jayz2cents proved it did zero.",the claim that it reduces temps dramatically is blatantly false and actually has a high chance of causing even more issues due to lack of contact with the pins in the socket.,horrible idea imo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the manufacturer sent me a separate set of things for lga 1700 but the high temperatures are probably because i didn't install it right or the mounting pressure is not right for some reason... i've reinstalled it many times,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"what i noticed is that in most games, my 8700k pulls between 60-100w with a hyper 212 black.",it then reaches ~65-75c.,"this is with an r9 fury happily consuming 300w, and getting to about 78c.","but, when i do a stress test on my cpu only it reaches about 87c after 10 minutes of cbr23, with about 135-145 watts of power draw.","if i then also stress my gpu with furmark, the temp for my cpu goes up to roughly 90c.","but my gpu does remain cooler then in game, at roughly 65c for 10 minutes.","now for my gpu, my hypothesis is that, the vram is used less and making it get less hot in this case.","as it uses hbm memory, that is close to the gpu die.","so, for me on air cooling, +/- 3-5 degrees of cpu difference between gpu+cpu and cpu only.","two 120mm intake, two 120mm exhaust.",1 120mm fan for the cpu 8700k @4.7ghz all core.,"now i think, that for a cpu that is liquid cooled, a top mount rad in exhaust position would get the cpu hotter, whereas an aio in the front with a push config, so intake, would get the gou hotter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depending on his cooling set up for the 12900k if it's an aio in exhaust it may affect it quite alot depending on the case air flow 400+ watts is alot to remove i know this first hand with my 3080ti ftw 3 lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i see the fix.,it is a relatively easy fix.,just reverse all fan directions except for the rear fan.,the top 3 fans on the cpu?,switch them to intake cold air.,the 3 fans on the right?,just flip them to exhaust the hot air.,try and see if that does not keep a better balance in the case?,i suspect the cpu is being heated by the gpu because it's radiator is set to exhaust.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

jay has no idea what he's talking about and his mythologies are usually flawed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"indeed, with normal coolers.",buildzoid did a video on the subject covering the scenario where it can make a difference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"jay made the mistake of lapping the cpu which exacerbated the problem of poor contact further

it's understandable as it used to be a good idea for lga115x but the ilm on lga1700 bends the ihs in a new way

using the cpu stock (ihs unmodified) the washer mod works as it reduces the bending force on the ihs which allows a flatter surface and better contact with the cooler.",the higher your overclocks the higher the temp savings too.,i saved 15c!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just noticed it's 190w in bf5.,did you tune your cpu voltage or it's auto settings?,"i don't play shooters but it sounds a bit high for 'only' 5.1, when i think 11700ks only use 180w or something in bf2042?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when you grab the tubes can you feel the liquid moving?,also what voltages are you running?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

nice clean build.,i am a bit worried that your tubes are right up there with the fan intakes.,or is your fan exhausting?,for your aio?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i picked the p500a because it cools the gpu very well with 4 140mm and 3 120mm fans... the cpu temp is probably mounting pressure problem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's why i said its not normal unless he doesn't have ac, we don't know where this dude lives",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not sure i agree with that.,he may not be as knowledgeable as some other tech tubers but he knows what he is talking about,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'm not surprised with it pushing 200w.,when my 12600k spikes to 240w it hits over 90 on a 360mm arctic lf ii.,these chips are insanely power hungry.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"personally i don't agree with software overclocking for cpu's but check your idle and load voltages, anything over 80 degrees is going to lessen the lifespan of your cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are your radiator fans setup as exhaust or intake?,"if theyâ€™re exhaust, i wouldnâ€™t be surprised if thatâ€™s part of the problem.",cooling a cpu with air ejected from a 480w gpu isnâ€™t going to be optimal.,"if not, does the air coming off the radiator actually feel hot?","if itâ€™s not, youâ€™ve got poor contact between the waterblock and the cpu.","if the airâ€™s really hot, your aio is the limiting factor.",maybe try more fans/a different (preferably thicker) aio if thatâ€™s the case.,or aiming for a lower voltage if possible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

lumi showed it made literally no difference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, they are designed to operate at that temp.",when you get to 100+ is when the lifespan starts to degrade,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it is exhaust :o thanks for the feedback, but my case is 3 140mm fans in the front(intake), 1 140mm(exhaust) in the back and the 3 120mm with the aio on the top.",so if i move the aio to the front i have 3 140mm fans i can't use ðÿ¤£ i picked this case because of the 140mm fan in the back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"that's really low for a 12900k but not the lowest which afaik, is a 72. a typical 12900k falls in the 78~86sp range.",it's generally a good indicator of how overclockable your chip is with ambient cooling.,but that doesn't mean you can't overclock.,you'll have to check the ai overclocking submenu which lists sp ratings for the p-core and e-core separately.,you may have dud e-cores dragging your overall sp downwards paired with slightly above average p-cores.,"of course, it's best to give it a spin through manual overclocking to really gauge it.",edit: downvoted for stating facts?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in your shoes i'd return it and buy the i7-12700k

unless you really need those extra 4 e cores it's in no way worth the cost",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
absolutely not.,the sp score is just a ballpark indicator of overclocking performance and in a way stock performance.,"it just means that for your chip to perform onpar with a better sp rated chip, you have to optimize your cooling more than someone with a higher sp chip.",and you may have to increase voltage a bit.,but uusually not by an absurd amount.,something reasonable.,i would research how best to cool your chip!,12900k is the best of the best.,it being an i9 indicates an extreme overclocking chip!,they are meant to be tweaked and fine tuned to the users liking and specs!,and they have good cooling headroom.,intel already has thin ihs and stim [advanced packaging](https://images.anandtech.com/doci/16959/12th%20gen%20intel%20core%20desktop%20processors%20blueprint%20presentation%20embargoed%20until%20oct%2027%2c%202021%20at%209_00am%20pt-page-039.jpg) built into these chips!,but of course you can always extract much more performance....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>should i return it?,"no, because this is how the silicon lottery works, and sp score is far from the end all be all indicator of overclocking performance.",if you wanted a higher bin these days you wait and buy a 12900ks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"~60s is average, from what i've seen.","unless you are worried about thermals for a large undervolt or looking to do extreme ocs, that's perfectly fine.","and even then, the sp rating isn't perfect - just an estimation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i swapped my 12900k once because i thought my first cpu was broken because i got random pc freezing and still getting it with my current one.,the first one has 80 sp and the one i currently have has 91. the thing i notice is i can undervolt the cpu with the higher sp more and be usable and still get 27k points on cinabench 23. since i can undervolt more my cpu temperature is also lower in full load.,"if you are not planning on oc and have a good cooler you can stick with the one you currently have, but in the end it is your cpu and you have to decide if you got your money worth.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don't worry about it.,the sp score is just a way to rate how well it is likely to overclock.,the difference between a 75 and a 95 won't really make a difference unless you are doing some serious overclocking.,it's not at all like you got a defective or substandard product.,only worry about it if you're trying to do professional overclocking or something.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"also, sometimes the asus bios bugs out the vid table.","if you look at the v/f points and it's showing all the p-cores with the exact same vid, it's not working correctly.",you'll need to reflash bios or perhaps even flash a different bios version.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"update: sorry, the nic is not defective, i used iperf3 to ""benchmark"" teh nic, setting the pc with the i255-v as a server and a laptop as the client, nothing rare was found.",the transfer speeds are normal (between 100 and 113 mbps).,here's a screenshot of the results.,[https://imgur.com/a/gsupnji](https://imgur.com/a/gsupnji),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"two computers on the same wired network, both with good gigabit network adapters.","do a file copy between them, and barring storage congestion (ie slow hard drives) you should see 105-120 megabytes per second transfers for a gigabit connection.","the problem with using the internet is the issue (beyond your pc or home network) could be your router, your isp, the specific connection between your isp and the testing site, and the actual testing site.","i have a 400mbit connection, and i can try tests with a dozen supposed speed checkers in my region and get massively different results from each.",almost none show my full speed.,"but when iâ€™m downloading from certain distribution networks, i get rock solid full speeds showing that my connection is just fine.",edit: and iâ€™m using the same intel network card as you on a z690 board.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

do you think it may be a hardware issue?","if not, what could be the problem?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"assuming the laptop has a ssd, thatâ€™s not conclusive but is very suspicious.","one of the reported issues with the i225-v is that it doesnâ€™t like communicating with all switches, and sometimes plugging the troublesome system into another switch (even if all itâ€™s doing is repeating things) can improve the situation.",do you have other gigabit wired devices on your network that you can use to verify full speed copies between them?,that would help eliminate your local network (or some device on it flooding the network) and narrow it definitely down to the nic/motherboard.,"i have the asus z690 hero with the same nic as yours, and while itâ€™s definitely been a problem, when it works itâ€™s been working fine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the laptop does have a ssd, i don't have other devices to test but there's just the pc and the laptop connected to each other with the cable, no other devices, no router or switch.",also when transfering from the pc to the laptop transfer speed is normal.,"anyway, i think i will try with a switch between the pc and the router.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you need to rule out disk read/write speeds.,"you should be utilizing a tool called iperf running as a server on one end, and a client on the other.",this eliminates bottlenecks and can be run using multiple streams to saturate the nic.,any other test is subject to various buffers and bottlenecks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
600w will be pushing it but should be fine as long as its a decent quality one.,"just be aware that future upgrades, either to a better tier cpu or next generation gpu might require a psu upgrade.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
let's say you run everything at max looking at 400 to 500 w to play with between your cpu and gpu i'd recommend upgrading just to be safe you can never have enough power ;-),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's a segotep gp-700g rated 80 plus gold.,"plus should mention that currently i'm just gaming at 1080 so when i decide to upgrade my screen at some point in the future i'll definitely need to get a bigger psu but 1080 on the 3060 surely wouldn't be pushing it too hard...

you're comparing 1440p 30fps to 4k 120fps.,"4k has more than twice as many pixels as 1440p, and you want 4 times the fps, so purely by napkin math, you need more than 8 times the gpu horsepower, and that's before you add in ray tracing, which your graphics card definitely isn't doing.",that seems about right to me.,they're being snarky because you're adding a data point that's so far from the scenario they're talking about that it's basically not at all relevant.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

of course it doesn't overheat when it's running on battery... the power limits aren't anywhere near the same and it's obvious in that you said it yourself the performance is awful.,you probably shouldn't have updated the bios as dell has been on a streak of locking undervolting due to plundervolt.,your only recourse probably is to repaste.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you will have to revert on bios that does not block undervolting settings.,what cpu are you runing?,you will need to move to throttlestop for fine tuning.,the best thermal pastes around are tg kryonaut and cm mastergel maker.,arctic silver 5 is electrically conductive and you should avoid it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if i was you , i would get just i5 12400 without getting 6500xt at this moment.",you would still be able to use pc since 12400 has igpu.,the reasons why i think you should hold off from buying gpu is because the prices just started getting lower and in month or two you might be able to get much better gpu for same price.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ya will definitely need the 12400 without f.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6500xt is a big no no.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"because of no hardware encoding on the 6500 xt, if you ever want to record on your pc (like if you wanted to record or stream your games) without having to resort to software encoding (uses cpu to encode, it can be pretty intensive depending on the quality you want) then you'd want the 12400 since the 12400f lacks an igpu, however if you don't care to record on your pc then it doesn't matter, although having an igpu is nice in case something happens to your dgpu or if you ever decide later on to record/stream without affecting performance.","edit: also, gpu prices have been dropping over the past few weeks, they'll likely keep dropping (although may be different where you live), so you could wait a bit longer for a better new gpu or a used gpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"please don't get 6500xt, try to get 6600 or a 3050, honestly a 5700xt is better.",you at least get 16x pcie lanes.,a 12400f and a 6600 is pretty decent.,"wait around a week, in australia 6700s and 6600s have dropped below launch price.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 6500xt is not a great card.,"faster than igpu, sure, but thereâ€™s a reason itâ€™s cheap and available.","with intelâ€™s new gpus coming out soon, prices really actually should be coming down, and hopefully youâ€™ll be able to get something better for the same or even less.","note that if you do want to use the igpu, see if you can afford the 12500 or 12600 as they come with a better igpu than the 12400 (770 versus 730).","the h610 will work, but itâ€™s extremely stripped and kind of intended for â€œweb & email office pcsâ€.",see if thereâ€™s any budget b660s in your price range.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think a better match for the rx 6500 xt would be one of the i3 processors like the 12100f.,you might want to consider the i3 anyway if it allows you to buy a better graphics card.,both parts would hold very little value later if you want to sell them though.,"or a different alternative altogether; go for an older platform, because it sounds like 12th gen is a stretch on your budget.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"12100f with 6600xt or 6600.

avoid 6500xt.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i5 12400f + rx 6500xt is good if you are running on a tight budget.,the i5 12400f is slightly better.,"you will be able to render using this combination in 1080p, but 4k i doubt.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm running the 12400f with 3080 absolutely awesome cpu for the money, came from 5900x and can't notice a difference other than costing half and consuming half the power.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i was considering that as well but i didn't want to rely on the hopes of prices dropping, people have been saying that for a long time and there haven't been too much of a drop.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh, i see.",thanks!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ah, so instead of the cpu itself doing the encoding, the igpu will be doing it, so no performance impact on the cpu?","and yeah, been thinking of just getting i5 12400 and wait for a few months for a gpu.",not sure how long it will take for the prices to come down here in india though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably would take months over here in india for the prices to drop somewhat reasonably.,"sad, can't afford the 3050 or the 6600.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the best i would be saving from going for an older generation is about 3k inr, which i think is not that worth it?",the frustrating thing is i have no other gpu than the rx 6500 xt to buy even if i compromise on the processor and get a i3 12100f.,"the next gpu of choice is rtx 3050.

rx 6500 xt is priced at 22k inr for msi brand, rtx 3050 is priced around 33-38k inr across various brands.",so i will be blowing my budget with the 3050 even with compromises.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"can't afford both of these, sadly.",i was thinking of buying the 12400 for now and wait for a few months for gpu prices to drop and then buy a gpu.,is that an okay ish plan?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1080p is good enough for me, not gonna get into 4k.",thanks!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at least this time around prices started dropping for real.,it is up to you if you want to wait a bit more and look for a better deal or bite the bullet and get arguably bad gpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea instead it's rising in india.,i feel that way in some sites.,u shud get the 12400 for now and wait a bit maybe the sellers are trying to scrap as much as possible before prices go down esp in india,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you do not have any specific plans in terms of memory settings there is no reason to get anything more than h610 as long as you are fine with the port setup.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i understand that you're finding yourself in a pickle.,the gpu prices are plain awful.,"12th gen might be good overall value, but in the end you'll have to consider what gives you the best return for your investment.","for gaming, the gpu should be your #1 priority, and at the moment the sweet spot for value seems to be the rx 6600, if you don't consider the used market.","some people still play games just fine on x58, and i was one of them only a few months ago.","so, i think there's a lot of room for most people, even on very small budgets, but you might have to settle for less on the parts that aren't as important and/or leave out the newest/fanciest games.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that might be true and idk about other country but if u live in  country like php the gpus prices does not drop so much.,"i heard about gpu prices dropping coz of mining is getting non/less profitable, and there's not that much miners here in php.",the prices stays the same.,"tho op have mentioned gtx 1050 and 1650 prices dropping i do not think those gpus are used for mining, and if they are observe the prices of gpus in ur country in atleast a week and see if prices are dropping down depending on how much it drops its a good idea to not buy immediately and wait for better offers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i am strongly beginning to consider that possibility now, i don't mind waiting a month or two more cause my requirements right now are okay ish.","just gta v, rocket league, valorant and maybe apex legends.",the 12400 would obviously do well with video editing so i won't worry about that.,where do you suggest i invest some money in if i don't get a gpu?,max i would use is half of the gpu cost (so maybe 10k inr),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, seems like a better option now.",where should i invest in if i am not buying a gpu?,i am fine with the h610 mobo though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"makes sense, thanks!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think i will get the 12400 for now, wait a few months for gpu prices to drop and then get a good gpu.","i waited years and years for a proper gaming experience, guess i can wait a few more months.",the igpu on the 12400 should be good enough for my use case.,"will just play games like gta v, valorant and what not, uhd 730 seems to do nice on those.",it's good enough to slowly learn video editing and blender as well.,a h610m motherboard should suffice right?,i will mostly likely keep this cpu for about 5-6 years so yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"honestly, there are not many things you can upgrade without having to spend much more money on some parts.","a logical step above 12400 would be 12600k but besides the higher price of cpu, you would also need to get a better motherboard as well as a better cooling solution.","all in all, i don't think it is worth it for the task you will be mainly doing and that is gaming.",12400 is already an excellent cpu and you won't be missing anything by getting 12400 over something like 12600k.,that money would be much better invested in stronger gpu once the prices come even more down.,the only thing you might want to consider is getting a better b660 board over b610 if you ever consider upgrading cpu down the line.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just save the money for the gpu.,"also, the major factor is that all three companies are releasing new gpus this year, this will inevitably drop prices for the older cards.",i am not sure about how prices in india work exactly of course.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i currently have an i5 10600kf overclocked to 5.1ghz all core.,i mainly play valorant on a 240hz monitor.,"i've been trying to get into streaming but the game lags when i stream, not a huge amount of lag but enough for me to be uncomfortable.",i am thinking of running stream and game off the same cpu so with the addition of ecores on the 12700k i assume it should perform better in terms of multithreaded workloads?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you!,i'll have a read about pcie,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not entirely true, my oc'd 9700k absolutely was bottlenecking my 3080 in some games and was extremely slow in multitasking compared to my new 12700k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
someone just told me my 9900k and 3090 was a substantial bottleneck he compared it to putting a renault engine in a porsche ðÿ¥º,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that isn't even remotely true lmao,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my 9700k would get 100% utilized when opening warzone.,"granted it's a terribly optimized game, but my brother's 3600 would open it with no stutters at all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have had some minor stuttering with that setup at stock, but after upgrading my memory to 3700 at 15-15-15 bdie in addition to an all-core oc, everything was smooth.",saw a big improvement in warzone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'd describe it more as input lag, a tonne of latency.",that being said i do feel the slightest increase in latency as i play the game at somewhat of a higher rank.,i've done extensive stress testing and monitoring thermals so i'm pretty sure it's not thermal throttling.,i also prefer the game to be constantly running over 240fps minimum.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i do plan on overclocking whichever one i end up getting.,i've got a decent bit of experience overclocking on the 14nm architecture but i'm not entirely sure if the 10nm will behave similarly or better even.,the pc will be used for video editing as well as gaming at high refresh rate while streaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the only thing concerning me is that the motherboard isn't selling for very much money...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the more cores will help substantially in this regard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the e-cores on alder lake should help with this.,lighter workloads like obs can be offloaded to the e-core while the p-cores handle the game.,at least that's the theory.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my 8700k was bottlenecking my 3090 and i upgraded to a 12700k.,solved all issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9900k 8 core 16 threads is still plenty.,it may not stream and game as well as higher cpus but chances are there are very few games you would notice a change if just gaming,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your network bandwidth could be a bottleneck too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is alot less oc headroom these days.,at stock my 10900k runs 4.9ghz and if i really push i can run 5.1ghz but temps are not worth it.,there might be a little more on the 12700k you might be able to bring the 4.7 all core to 5ghz or so.,memory can be quite worth it tho if you don't already have a nice ddr4 kit.,ddr5 is in a kinda odd spot atm very expensive for good kits and some of the xmp for those higher kits is not quite plug and pay and the lower speed kits that are under perform vs fast ddr4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"from what i've heard 12700k seems to be the better choice for me, hardest thing is getting someone to buy my moboðÿ˜‚",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
does that mean i5 10600k has more oc headroom than 10900k?,because i've managed to get my 10600k to run 5.1ghz all core with pretty decent thermals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all higher tier chips really do is kinda give you a better chance at the silicon lottery.,but it's alot easier to manage the heat of 6/12 cpu then it is a 10/20 cpu.,what kinda voltage did you 10600k need for a stable 5.1ghz?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no alder lake-p review that i know of exist yet.,for something without a dgpu i would be more tempted to go ryzen 6000 with lpddr5 for the igp.,but you donâ€™t actually have a choice because laptops like the x1 carbon are intel exclusive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"very helpful, and agreed, thank you.",it also nice that i can use my thunderbolt dock/monitor with intel.,my only slight concern is that ryzen 6000u is significantly more efficient per watt on single performance and plenty snappy and close enough to alder lake u for productivity.,"my guess is it's multi-core performance and of course the rdna2 graphics will be significantly better than alder lake u and that would be nice to have when docked (without thunderbolt :o(

does anyone know if ryzen 5000u thermal throttles  when running all 8 cores?",what is the max power draw in watts on the 5850u?,"a laptop like the x1 carbon will be limited to 20 watts due to the cooling system, so maybe that cannot be fully realized anway on most thin and lights, even when docked.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you could also move the radiator to the front or switch the top fans to intake instead of exhaust.,"i know it's easier to build and more aesthetically pleasing to have the aio rad as exhaust but in this config, it's using hot gpu/case air to push through the rad.",rad fans should always be set as intake unless (maybe) everything is being watercooled.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can set the power limits to like 170w or 190w to reduce temperature at the expense of multithreaded performance (25k instead of 28k in cinebench and low 80s instead of 99c),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"instant 100 on cinebench doesn't sound normal, 80s is fine.","would get hwinfo to see voltage, power usage, etc, and check bios for any ""smart"" features.","if there isn't anything obviously wrong along the lines of a really dumb auto oc and your cooler mounting is fine, it's just pulling way more power than your cooling can handle and you need to set a tdp limit below whatever it's drawing at peak (cinebench).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what cooler are you using?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can you try using a static voltage 1.19v?,voltages on auto are too high imo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"it's different for every manufacturer, but it's something like: overclocking -> advanced cpu then long and short duration power draw -> set both to 190w.",it shouldn't affect fps in games since they are single-threaded and won't use anything close to 241w (or 190w).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you don't have to upgrade every single time :) it is not necessary.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in daily use would you even see the difference?,or just bm boners?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nope.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think you're missing my point.,"i had 9900k before and honestly 12900k upgrade was a logical choice, together with my 3090 i can say i see a huge gaming or otherwise performance boost even with new 980 pro vs older 970 pro in everyday life or even gaming.",so even going from 9900k i can't really say i am thrilled.,"my point is... again weird for the first time i am ""dreaming"" of getting that 13900ks, when i always get cpu with igpu because of debugging and just general usage i like to be able to get by if gpu burns on me, no lost time.",something about it just reached me.,i don't know if it's the 13th thing or i know my maximum possible cpu will be 13900ks and knowing that i want it and just stick with it for the next 3-5 years or so.,"so yeah don't try to find a logical choice , i am just saying what i feel and not necessarily fps boost or microsecond faster completed tasks.",cheers !,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
he wants the upgrade for just gaming lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
?,??,the ks edition of intel cpus are designed for extreme overclocking.,i have no idea why you would buy it (the 12900ks is around 6-7% faster for an extra +200 dollars).,they've always been a sort of limited-edition ultra edition of an architecture.,they also come out months later.. just get a 13900k at most.,"also, 64gb of ram is way overkill unless you host a-ton of vm's or are a photoshop designer, and 32gbx2 is so much ram you likely won't see speeds over ~6000 max due to how much sheer data the cpu imc has to manage.",ddr5 latency is already in a good enough place at the high-end right now you likely won't see kits bother going below cl32ish because latency has diminishing returns when you sacrifice bandwidth.,(6400cl32 already on the market has similar latency to good ddr4 kits at ~58ns).,edit: latency will come down over time due to increase in base mhz but it isn't something to freakout over because the performance is already insane enough for your cpu to be the bottleneck in 99.9999% of workloads.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's not weird.,this happens with a lot of people who are bored and have money to spend.,"they *find* ways to spend money and justify any frivolous thing, even if it makes no impact in their daily life, and gives them virtually no additional utility they didn't have before.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have a rule, whatever your using your parts for, only upgrade when it's a 50% or higher uplift in perf.",served me we so far.,"obviously that only applies for personal use, if it's for business i can see why people upgrade more often but i still wouldn't upgrade every gen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on what he's doing.,the extra 8 cores of the 13900k would be a large uplift for multithreaded workloads but likely only minor st improvements for ging,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whatâ€™s a bm boner?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no problem with wanting an upgrade.,"when you jump even from z690 to z790 (13th gen intel) you will be getting newer, leading edge chips.","look at users who spend $5,000 dollars easy for apple products.",they know that they don't need the latest and greatest.,swapping for a new cpu honestly is a relatively easy thing to do.,"and quite frankly with new overclocking tweaks and techniques, its often just really fun to push for higher limits.",i sometimes play uncapped fps cs:go just because i can do it.,don't care about the temps/noise because its all under control.,"after years of learning how to build good and quiet pcs, you just get better.",that being said.,i would actually really just wait for intel 4. it is right around the corner.,"and then intel 3.... 

then the really fun stuff will start to roll out... =) and who knows... when that comes around in 2 or so years, i may start to run my current chip as a direct die and just push her to the maximum daily limit!",because why not?,if she dies... then i will now have a real justification to upgrade =d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
either that it have a person to off like ad last hen high end parts to.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
true... i guess if it's virtualized and they're running vmware workstation or something... then you'd definitely see a performance improvement and increase your capacity.,but most modern applications aren't optimized or coded to utilize multiple cores (exceptions like autocad/adobe) but even those limit multi-core utilization to an extent... now i'm wondering what this guy's typical workload looks like.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if you oc it past 5ghz and turn the e-cores off you have the single best bang/buck gaming cpu.,it's something like 30+% more ipc than skylake in some tests.,"if you do other things than game, leave e-cores on, and it's a cpu that goes toe-to-toe with 10900k's",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"for gaming, and even streaming, i personally think the 12600k/kf is better than the 12700f purely because of the overclocking potential.",not only can you do core/cache/ring oc but you can also get much higher ram oc because unlike the non-k skus the vccsa is unlocked for k sku.,"all this combined would produce much better performance if best gaming performance is the goal

now if the usecase reaches beyond just gaming, ie video editing/rendering, or code compiling etc, then i can see the case for the 12700f",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

10900k: $350 or 11900k: $330 (ok this is an odd case, debatable which is the high end)

overall, for the most part just buy the end of cycle processor thatâ€™s the highest end and youâ€™ll get your money back in 2-3 years.",the optimal strategy is to buy the processor when the next generation comes out on sale as retailers dump old last gen motherboards and processors.,youâ€™ll get a great deal then be able to flip it for a profit in 2-3 years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"12th gen intel blows previous gens out of the water imo, obviously in respect to there counterparts (i.e.","12th gen i3 is way better than 11th/10th gen i3, same for i5/i7/i9).",of you have the option to get 12400 then it would be a lot better than 10400 in terms of longevity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
each gen from the previous offers roughly 2-5% increased performance.,"some say this is negligible, some marginal, some even beneficial.",but itâ€™s safe to say 10 to 12 about 4-10% increase and even that is kinda iffy depending on the price~,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

good call on the cpu/graphics card imo.,you expect to upgrade graphics cards 3-4 times during the life span of a pc if you have a good processor.,since graphics cards are very overpriced currently it was a smart move to get something lower end and wait until prices return to sensible prices.,also when a new set of gpus comes out there will be a sell off of older models and better value for money new models.,you have most likely saved money in the long run.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what case is that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
use a gpu for h.265 instead.,nvenc is pretty formidable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"depends which cpu/gpu you're comparing against... anyway, it really also comes down to what they're going to be streaming right?","like low cpu utilization games then sure, you can encode and eat up 30% of those resources and it wouldn't make a noticeable difference in terms of quality and performance.","but, alternatively if you're streaming a mid-high cpu utilization game you're going to choke your system.","regardless, ime it's always been most practical/suggested to utilize dedicated gpu's that use the pcie bus for encoding/graphics for best overall system performance and quality.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have this case with a 12600k and tune my fans to actually spin down when around 30 c. only my exhaust runs.,it pulls in so much air with with one 120 mm exhaust fan that it continues to idle around 30 c with aio fans on low and some games still stay around 30 c most bring it up to around 40 c. i was very surprised.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ohh, that sucks.",still an amazing build!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this might be country/region specific but i saw 1650 super for less than that 12700k alone.,the gpu only being used for encoding will use less power than that cpu in idle and scales easily into high resolutions while handling multiple encodes like one using cbr for a stream and a high quality cqp encode for your local recording.,if you wanted to wait for gpu prices to drop you could've gone for something like an i3 and use the igpu (using quicksync) for the time being.,"my point is that you bought the wrong tool for the job, it will do what you want it to do but not as efficient as the nvenc on a little gtx 1650 super could.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what software is this?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because they aren't really idle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or its just a bad cpu.,manufacture error,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
on your judgement would it be better to rma than delid?,"it seems within my capabilities, but having not done it before it seems a lot of hassle.",the chip is pretty good otherwise but i suspect it's limited anyway from its full potential because of the heat issue.,rma risks a poor chip but at least it won't have the ihs issue...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if i remember correctly, intel does a garbage half assed job ""soldering"" the die to the heatspreader of any recent chips they make.","ever since they made the change to thermal paste with the 3rd gen i7, the way they solder the chip is garbage and can still show improvements delidding and applying your own stuff.",it looks like that's what happened here.,bad solder job from the factory.,this would never happen with the old style of soldering the die.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is your experience with delid?,"something i would consider, but not done before and i know the solder issue makes it more risky.",the chip seems pretty good otherwise so might be worth it... (edit: i just looked for a copper relid and it's only 35 quid... might be best approach.,even if i was to delid i'd probably need tools and one with a copper ihs would be easier to resell in future).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"not with this scenario, the problem is between the core and the ihs, you wouldn't have this huge difference on only two cores otherwise.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"hey i don't know if you saw my supporting comment, but just to add to yours i did just test this by setting everything on process lasso to avoid those cores, and now all the cores are the same, low temperature (around 37) in the same conditions.","so this helps explain it, but why are all the other cores low when handling these small tasks that cause core 1 and core 4 to run 20c higher?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes.,â€œcurrentâ€ was in the conditions i described.,"although when i set all process affinities to avoid those cores, they all showed the same temp (+-4c) under matching conditions, the other cores didnâ€™t increase like core 1 and 4 did even though they were now handing the same load",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yep hwinfo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hmm this is very interesting.,when i turned all process off those cores they did drop to match the others.,"however, itâ€™s always those same two, and when they are under equal load theyâ€™re always the highestâ€¦
also when i turn ht off then the temps donâ€™t drop at all (when under a not-quite-idle conditions like in the screenshot).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

depends on how much risk you are willing to take.,but i would rma it.,"delidding, especially soldered cpus is a huge risk.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you have to ask, then don't delid.",it's really that simple.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
delidding a soldered ihs is outright dangerous to the chip.,mistakes here destroy the cpu.,"while it sucks, an rma will get you something that will work as expected.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would definitely rma,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well considering rma is essentially free vs delidding which requires tools/could destroy cpu, i would go for rma.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my experience is good but it not something i would like to do with soldered cpus.,"35 is a good price, bear in mind intel ihs is already copper so what makes the difference is properly applying the liquid metal.",in your case might be sanding to do in order to flatten the ihs internally.,if i was in your shoes i'd resell the whole platform and get a 12600k on ddr4 but that's just me :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"possibly the way the boost algorithm works with favored cores, they will juice up the favored cores with much higher vcore voltage to ensure it can boost to 5ghz reliably within a single cpu cycle?",but it's just my guess.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it sounded like you're saying it's idling at those temperatures, i'm just pointing out that it's not the current temp",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think this is just a common occurrence with this model processor with all the cores and how it was designed.,"it was designed not to run 24/7 at max clock, but doing so opens you up to these types of things.","they aren't problems really, because under heavy load (prime95 would be a good test) they should all stay relatively the same if the load is equal.","that would be a good way to see if it is indeed a 2 core problem that needs addressed, or if you're fine and this is normal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would my rma be rejected if the previous person had delidded it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
turns out paid-for replacement with copper ihs is not a bad price.,"however if it turns out to be the same when it's replaced, i'm f'd.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"tbf i've seen derbauer's video previously just out of interest and was like ""f that effort why would you bother?"".",i'm not excited by the thought of doing it myself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

delidding requires more regular maintenance and know-how than a factory chip.,this is out of your league.,stop considering it.,return the defective cpu.,that's your only option,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for your opinion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
delidding does not require regular maintenance.,you don't know what you're talking about lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

delidding comes with a lot of risk.,you can knock out a cap somewhere and render the cpu useless during the process.,"and if your liquid metal application is sloppy, that's also the end of your cpu.",you can also rip the silicon if you don't heat it enough or take too long to open it.,"if after all that you still want to take the bet, then go for it.","also, maybe prepare a sacrificial oven?","pre heating your cpu requires an oven, and once you heat it, it'll make some real toxic smoke you don't want to mix with your food.","so yeah, more cost to consider.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

iâ€™ve whittled my options down to rma and getting it professionally relidded.,it makes more sense to rma it as essentially thatâ€™s a free relid but comes with the downside of silicon lottery issues.,however if the previous person delidded it then intel technically could destroy the cpu.,if i relid it before rma and it doesnâ€™t help iâ€™m screwed in terms of rma but at least the chip is still working.,the listing said they undervolted it set at 4.9 with an aio which makes me think they had heat issues as well and settled on undervolt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you read back through what i have previously said on this thread, iâ€™ve told you that i am both averse to delidding myself, and later said i was considering paying someone to relid the thing with new tim and ihs, why are you still youâ€™re talking about delidding?","i am honestly appreciative of your emphasis on the difficulty of delidding (and itâ€™s maintenance), but you could have just left it there.",however â€œyouâ€™re out of your leagueâ€ is an opinion and is not really constructive in the context of the wider discussion.,what exactly do you know of my capacity to do this?,apparently i shouldnâ€™t do it as i need experience doing it?,and thatâ€™s only gained by trial and error?,and only people like derbauer can afford to do that?,what if this cpu was one of 30 i was examining?,"what if, actually, i didnâ€™t give a shit and i learnt first try?","please donâ€™t answer these questions, or any other questions you may have interpreted i asked (but did not).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

your scores are low.,all 11700ks should perform more or less the same at the same clocks.,silicon lottery has no influence on a stock cpu.,ram can heavily influence results but cb & cpu-z aren't really ram sensitive.,it's either instability or software related.,given it's a stock cpu i'll guess it's the latter.,"when you run cb is anything else using the cpu, like your av for example?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"itâ€™s something thatâ€™d be designed into a motherboard, but essentially it can take a certain amount of pcie lanes and break them out as needed, it doesnâ€™t even always have to be 1:1 bandwidth.",for example some devices only support specific link widths - so if you were missing some lanes you could do something from an x2 to an x4 config using a packet switch.,the manufacturers iâ€™ve used are diodes and asmedia.,broadcom also makes some nice packet switches.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i wouldn't say leading exactly.,it took them a while to get caught up.,"alder lake is certainly impressive and i cant wait to see what they do next, but while they do beat out the top ryzen chips in most cases amd still got there first

don't know if you saw the previous comment but they were saying that the 11900k beat the 5900x in everything and that the 12900k was way faster than the 5950x.,i was saying how they are all pretty close to each other.,the 11900k and 5900x trade blows and the 5950x wins some and loses others against the 12900k.,"but amd was the first to market with a ""consumer"" processor that was this fasr",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"processes have an associated quality of service - *high* for foreground, *low* for background ([more here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/procthread/quality-of-service)).","each has a scheduling policy - prefer p-cores, restrict to e-cores only, etc.","on 12th gen, by default the background or ""low"" apps are restricted to e-cores only.","**easy:**
go to the control panel and move the power mode up to ""best performance"".",this removes the restriction of background apps to e-cores only.,"but they still prefer e-cores, so if your background workload fits on e-cores it will only use e-cores.","essentially unless your background workload has more than 8 threads of work, it still won't use p-cores.",also this messes with a bunch of other power settings.,"**medium:**
you can configure all background apps to prefer p-cores.",they will start on p-cores and use them and only spill over to e-cores when all the p-cores are busy.,this biases to even more performance for the background but will impact the foreground workloads more.,"run the following to force all background apps to prefer performance:

    powercfg /setacprofileindex scheme_current profile_background schedpolicy 2

have you tried process lasso?,handbrake still seems to be a bit wonky because of its development philosophies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can go into bios & turn off the e-cores on many mother boards.,this as likely one of the easiest if your are even mildly familiar with using bios settings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have experienced the same issue.,have found a better solution?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm pretty sure if you have a dual monitor setup, simply keeping handbrake in focus on the second monitor works just as well to keep the process firing on all cores.","this may or may not be useful for everyone, however.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

which would disable the power throttling for handbrake and more importantly it's worker task?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
re-installed it after my post and right now i have the set affinity set for the performance cores so it is only encoding on them.,if i set the affinity for all cores windows 11 once again relegates the tasks over the efficiency cores.,so i set it for performance cores and below normal priority so it'll use 100% of the performance but give them up to anything else.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"two issues with that firstly not all motherboards have this option in their bios, and secondly i'd be throwing away horsepower.","i process lasso currently sending it to the p cores so at least it is getting more resources but i'd love it to be able to use all 16 cores, or 24 cores when i get a 13900k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">powercfg /powerthrottling disable /path ""c:\\program files\\handbrake\\handbrake.worker.exe""  
>  
>powercfg /powerthrottling disable /path ""c:\\program files\\handbrake\\handbrake.exe""

yes as recommended by u/13_oclock i dug into powercfg and ended up disabling the power throttling.",i then set the priority to below average so i can use my computer for day to day things while it encodes in the background.,you have to do the worker for sure but i did the gui and worker and it works great.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">powercfg /powerthrottling disable /path ""c:\\program files\\handbrake\\handbrake.worker.exe""  
>  
>powercfg /powerthrottling disable /path ""c:\\program files\\handbrake\\handbrake.exe""

nope you have to turn off power throttling other wise it will go to e cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
haven't tested handbrake in particular myself but i believe that should work.,let me know how it goes.,"this should let handbrake use all the cores in the system (unlike processlasso), starting on p-cores and spilling over to e-cores.",note that this will cause more performance impact to the foreground application while handbrake runs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
worked like a charm!,thanks for sharing!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is so easy to do if there is the option that switching back & forth only takes about a minute so your can still have full performance of all cores when needed & just performance cores if performance suffer with all cores enabled.,this is simplest path if bios has this option.,i am not trying to detract from other options if there is no bios option.,at is just bios option of available is easier to use of available.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nope, it does not.","if i have handbrake open on my second monitor, it does not go to ecores.",it only goes to ecores if i minimize it.,"i use handbrake daily, so i should know.","i can keep handbrake open on the second monitor and continue working on my main monitor, and the encoding continues on all cores.",this happens because the windows scheduler in windows 11 smartly recognizes that second monitor tasks require a higher priority because of multitasking workflows.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks it is a mixed bag.,"it definitely helped but strangely the p cores aren't quite utilized as much as when i was using process lasso, but there is definitely action on the p and e cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"good, i'll try.","but if i want to go back then what should i do, type powercfg /enable?",which is the opposite.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ideally you just get 2x16gb 3200, it's cheap and gets you 95% of the performance with basically zero compatibility issues.",3600 is also an option but i still think 3200 is the sweet spot.,"it's worth upgrading from your current 2400 kit, that's for sure, but going to 4000 is throwing away money for basically no gains and can run into xmp issues on some boards.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

buy a new cooler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well you don't necessarily do anything wrong, the problem is that the stock cooler can only deal with a 65 watt tdp, which is this cpu's base clock, when turbo boosting it can go up to a 180 watt tdp (or even a little higher on some motherboards which boost it even further), waay too much for the stock cooler too handle, which is why it goes to 90c - 100c.",so it's doing exactly what it's designed for.,"i have the same cpu and the same issue, the solution is to buy a better cpu cooler.","temporarily you could turn off turbo boost until you can get a better cpu cooler, it's what i did so i can reliably use it without overheating, it's not ideal, i know, still beats it thermal throttling to heck, atleast until i've bought a better cpu cooler.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

they are just your typical plastic â€œtabsâ€ for adhesives.,i peeled half of it off and under it was just more adhesiveâ€¦ not sure what you would stick it to.,"so no, they would not aid in removing the backplate!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

just looked up all the cheapest equal parts that are in stock and it added up to ~1600$.,i think 600$ off is a good deal.,"so no, itâ€™s not a crap deal",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"depending on what cpu do you have you gain further advantages from swapping the board (overclocking, better vrm cooling etc)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but it could be that something is proprietary in these new lenovo pcs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have the i5 11400f so no overclocking.,but having other options than boot priority and â€œperformance modeâ€ would be great haha!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and ram overclocking should be possible with a better motherboard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you sure it's factually a 11600k.,not a 10100f someone swapped out and put into the box?,"if you bought it online, people will return a box of a cpu, and put their old cpu back in there and keep the new one.",common scam.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think this can happen during the fab process.,"maybe laser didn't have instructions for this batch, it can happen.","if cpu-z recognizes it correctly, it should be the real deal.","check temp, frequency and other reportings tho.",where did you buy this?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
was it lapped?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is probably just a manufacturing defect.,run some benchmarks to make sure the cpu is performing like an 11600k should be (to rule out that it is somehow a different chip like 10400 or 10600k somehow re-badged).,"if it reports as an 11600k, and performs like an 11600k, then it's probably just a manufacturing defect.",honestly really cool and lucky.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's strange.,i'd honestly demand a swap due to the possibility of counterfeit part.,it's unfortunate if you took it out and used it though.,"make sure everything is reported correctly, at least.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"shows up in task manager as 11600k, and cpuz.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yep.,works as expected.,"i was just surprised, but as long as it works i don't care.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nobody is counterfeiting modern cpus.,china and russia have been trying for decades to match intel and amd and are so far behind.,"sometimes people will try to swap the ihs onto an older or worse cpu but that's pretty obvious, and they wouldn't be using a blank ihs that draws even more suspicion.","if it fits, and reports as the correct cpu with the correct performance, it's genuine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
post some pictures of it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the benchmarks and cpuz/task manager all validate it as an 11600k so i don't care about the markings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if you get 12700k + b660, it is almost the same price.",youâ€™re also getting a much superior cpu performance and upgrade path to intel 13th gen raptor lake,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
quick search gives ~130-150â‚¬ for the basic atx and matx b660 boards.,i donâ€™t know where you find them at 250â‚¬.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"watch these 2 videos:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pea0vcj0lry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pea0vcj0lry)

hardware unboxed with vrm tests for b660 boards.",many of the cheaper ones are just atrocious for anything other than a 65 watt part.,"if gpus drop in price and intel motherboards stay the same i will buy a ryzen 5600 non x when it comes out, i already have a b450 motherboard so its all good.",except i wanted the intel igpu for troubleshooing and stuff.,"but alas, the motherboard prices are a joke with intel.","i dont want to pay 130 euro for a dsh3 board, get real.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it might improve a little but intel motherboards are consistently more expensive than amd.,"depending on your local prices and what cpu you want to get, amd might be the better option with their upcoming 5600 and 5700x cpus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"cpus are 330â‚¬s in my country for the kf model

all b660s under 200â‚¬ are very crappy while a decent b550 is 100â‚¬",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
b660 has issues compared to amd's b550s.,you're missing out on a lot of pci-e lanes and some other features when going down to b660 on intel where on amd you still get most of those lanes.,i wouldn't recommend b660 for k processors.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
exactly my point i can get a mid/high end b550 board with only 100â‚¬,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah watched these videos and also same i may get a b450 since they're only 60â‚¬s!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think you should seriously, honestly just get whatever is cheaper.",if the kf is so expensive for you then don't worry about brand just go with what seems better.,"as for upgradeability, it depends on how often you like upgrading in the first place.",if you only upgrade once every 5-6 years like me then by then both 12 and 13 gen cpu's are outdated anyways,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pay abit more for a superior cpu with an upgradable path isnâ€™t a bad thing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it should not be that bad.,a $120 amd board should be around the same quality as a $170 intel board.,intel does pull more power.,"so overall the vrms are probably comparable, but it'll run hotter on intel with the same design.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you get pcie4 on both of them.,it might actually be that intel has an advantage.,but i think they both offer pcie4 for one m.2 drive and top x16 slot.,and some b660 actually have pcie5.,intel isn't behind in this regard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe from late gen stock emptying sales.,at launch 100â‚¬ could buy maybe the cheapest  b550 board if you were lucky.,asus prime plus (lower mid range board) was 170â‚¬.,the main price increase from previous gen comes from increased requirements for signal integrity.,b550 only has pcie4 for the first pcie16x slot that is directly connected to the cpu and pcie3 for the rest.,b660 boards typically have full pcie4 support and wider bus for the chipset.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think that's a mistake.,i would not sacrifice pcie4 to save a couple bucks.,i'd personally get a bottom of the barrel b550 without a vrm heatsink than sacrifice pcie4 by going to b450.,even the most trash b550 still runs a 5800x at like 75c.,and vrms components are made to survive 110c temps for thousands of hours.,they aren't fragile.,hardware unboxed reviews and ranks vrms that stuff for views.,it makes pretty charts.,"but it's really not as important as most people think, unless your getting into the 90c+ range with a 16 core.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wait for amds am5 then you will be able to upgrade for many years not just one generation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but what would you choose besides them since cpus have the same price,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nah, 12900k is already 30% faster than 5950x.",amd has taken the backseat ðÿ¥º,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you can get a really good deal for a b550 then that absolutely makes sense.,intel cpus are better for the price but the difference isnâ€™t massive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the point of efficiency cores is to enhance performance in well scalable multi core workloads without spending a lot in silicon area.,basically they help in stuff like blender but donâ€™t matter much for performance in most applications.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
donâ€™t be such a blind fan boy.,you are comparing a 2 year old cpu to a brand new one.,wait for am5 then letâ€™s compare!,ðÿ¤¡,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would normally get a 5700x or 5800x but i saw the 12700 has better emulation performance.,also i'm troubled if it would be worth it spending more on a new platform when in 2/3 years time i'd need to upgrade to a ddr5 based system,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and then compare the new amd with the new intel to only compare it to the next amd and so on.,just live in the present and choose what ya think is worth it for your needs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ddr5 is currently still expensive.,i would not invest in it now.,it would probably be better deal overall to just update the platform in a couple of years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
agree.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"in my phd they funded 100% of students, and if you lost an ra/ta you were effectively out of the program even if you wanted to pay yourself.",my guess is that fund isn't meant to be used for engineering phds.,corporate phd support is usually through a fellowship.,"i've know a few people funded by samsung and various other korean/japanese companies, but it's uncommon in the us.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's very unlikely for companies to fund a phd for an employee.,it's usually at the master's level.,phd take way too long even as a full time student.,"but i'm sure there are exceptions, but that is something i wouldn't recommend on counting on, specially since you're asking the question here it means you don't have the type of contacts within intel to make this happen.","you should think of a phd as a full time job anyways, if you get into a decent program you should be funded by the research group you'll end up working with anyways.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there are a few small catches from what iâ€™ve read.,"you have to be an normal intel employee (canâ€™t be a contractor, intern, or student employee), you have to work at intel from the start to finish of your education, you must maintain high grades (depends on degree), and you canâ€™t start the program until youâ€™ve worked there for 6 months and you require manager approval.","the $50k is for business majors only, you can go higher for other stuff but the percentage coverage and maximum limit is discretionary for your manager as it comes out of their budget.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the absolute worst case is you might have to ta for a lot of your funding, but in engineering you are usually quite able to have a grant that fully funds you.",i'm in the final year of my materials phd and have not had to ta once as my (industry-sponsored) grant fully pays all the fees + stipend.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

probably pretty significant.,if i remember correctly arma is one of those old school games that really likes single thread performance.,the 6850k's broadwell-e architecture is quite old and slow as far as single thread performance goes.,even a 12600k would be a massive uplift in this instance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes.,it will also work in combination with an igpu where available.,check out intel deep link.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yes, though it depends on if the board allows booting â€˜headlessâ€™.",youâ€™ll at least want to set bios settings to ignore errors and boot.,"if you know what motherboard you want, look for â€˜<motherboard> headlessâ€™ and see if it works.",you might also be able to contact the manufacturer of the board for an answer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yes, a 240mm will cool the 11700k well enough in all but a few situations (like high overclocks and avx-512 loads).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
will they be a bigger change with arctic freezer 240m or the results will be similar?,"is it even worth it?if you ask me i get around 70c stress test, in intel xtu i haven't tired anything else and power draw while running the test is 145w to 160w   


will they be a bigger change with arctic freezer 240m or the results will be similar?",is it even worth upgrading?,i just want my have lower temps on my gpu and as well as cpu and i get a good cooler upto 240m or 340m that can only be mounted at the front and that could restrict airflow into the case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so do you suggest that i buy 360 mm aio and mount it in the front?,do you think that it can pull air into a stubborn case?,or there will be a lot less airflow?,because right now my gpu temps are around 80c and i am planning to repaste it and apply thermal pads.,i am not sure about the airflow through a radiator.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am thinking of getting the same cpu+motherboard combination.,can you go to bios and see which performance profile is chosen ?,there should be 3 available.,"one for ""boxed cooler"" which is intel stock cooler.",this option sets 65w long term power limit.,there should be 2 more options with 288w and 4096w for air cooler and aio cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

get a lepa neoillusion cooler that comes with lga1700 bracket.,i picked up one on ebey as a temporary cooler while test benching my 12700k and it kept that cool even overclocked at 4.9. very impressed with the cooler and it blew away my hyper 212 evo and artic freezer 34 by 10c.,(only 37 bucks btw),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you can also try the 1mm washer mod between the ilm and motherboard (it brought down my i7-12700kf & z690 temps from 100c+ 3 cores, 95c remaining cores to 88c hottest 2 cores, 70c remaining cores - overclocked.","it will probably help you in your case too, but as it's just a 65w cpu probably not as much as the i7 k sku which can draw 265w",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"no, the 65w is the ""intel spec"" pl1.",the pl2 for 12700f is 180w.,you can remove power limits and let it run at 180w indefinitely.,"but ""intel spec"" behaviour for 12700f would be to use 180w for 28/56sec and then ramp down to 65w.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that makes sense.,"when you chose aio the first time, the motherboard set unlimited (4096w) power.",which obviously the stock cooler cannot cool.,"btw, i have another question.",did you undervolt the 12700f ?,i think stock cooler is manageable with a 100w limit and a bit of undervolt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"you don't need a z690 board, but as mentioned already some of the cheaper boards such as the as the asrock $95 b660 board will absolutely limit your pl2 because of the cheap vrm situation on it.",the 12400-12600 and below will basically run on any board though.,but when you get to the 12600k and up you really want to buy $130+ b660 boards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i donâ€™t know anything about the specific cooler you have but those temps seem too high for stock clock cpu.,"iâ€™m using the tiny stock intel cooler and even for long periods of 100% cpu usage (mining for example) the temp doesnâ€™t go higher than 65c, usually stays around 60c.",idle temp is below 30c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is a relief to hear.,"i cherish my flying deeply, and i'd be quite distraught to have it slaughter my workstation.",thank you!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

for sure.,if heâ€™s going to upgrade the cpu there might be some problems there.,the cooling solution will have to be fairly small.,he might want to stick with the 10400 just for that fact alone.,otherwise tons of room for any gpu he wants to put in there and everything but the biggest power supplies should also be fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you should be gpu bottlenecked in virtually every game with this setup.,"12600k is a cpu that you can pair with an rtx 3090 and you wouldn't see a performance difference between that and 12900k, pairing it with an rtx 2060 (which in a normal market would cost less than 12600k) for gaming is just a wrong choice by any standards.",you're in for a gpu and perhaps a monitor upgrade first.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

\- possibly be the pioneer of a new wave of companies investing their money in eu, which is logistically better than se asia (this is up for debate tho);

\- push the schools to ""get better"" to have their precious alumni hired from a giant like intel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
currently working for a company which depends on tsmc for microcontrollers.,the situation is very very bad with european companies relying on taiwan for their industries.,even though intel might get subsidies if they will open to third party chip makers we would not need to rely on tsmc anymore in hard times.,i think the benefits of having fabs inside european borders outweight any cost we might have to set up production here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s more than just â€œa few high paid scientific jobsâ€.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we won't be as affected by foreign disturbances in chip manufacturing as we are today.,"also intel is opening it's fabs to other companies so it's not only ""american"" chips.",as you can see if eu subsidizes something they probably have a reason and know or consider something a random redditor doesn't.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"just a thought, you should look into handbrake's gpu acceleration.",it can be 10x-100x faster.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think itâ€™s simpler just to go into windows 11â€™s power settings and change power mode to â€œbest performanceâ€ instead of â€œbalancedâ€.,just a note to op and others: donâ€™t change the power plan setting from balanced; thatâ€™s different and wonâ€™t do anything for this issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
interesting!,"and by 'in focus', if i have multiple windows open, not minimised but not maximised either, is it only when the handbrake window itself is selected that performance cores are utilised?",or literally just open?,i like to have e.g.,2 open side by side or multiple across monitors,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"would be great if someone made a program like the eartrumpet equivalent of core management, where you could essentially drag and drop whether you wanted a process to use performance or efficiency",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'd put e.g.,hwinfo in full screen on the same monitor as handbrake trying to watch what was going on ðÿ¤£.,i was starting to think hwinfo itself was ruining my performance!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the input.,what put me off was the potential compromises on quality output.,i want as close to source as possible.,my gpu is also only a gtx 1060 6gb so a few generations behind so feel that would also encourage worse output.,happy to learn if i'm wrong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that solution, while nice and easy, only kinda works for some use cases.",that will allow background apps onto p-cores only if all the e-cores are busy.,"for highly parallel workloads like handbrake which spawn tons of threads it might be acceptable, but it doesn't truly prioritize using p-cores.",for less heavily multithreaded workloads (<= e-core count) it won't even make much difference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,in focus means it's the active window/last clicked window.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if handbrake was on screen but not the in focus application it would not be â€œbackgroundâ€ and my post would not apply.,frankly i would expect handbrake to use performance cores if itâ€™s on screen (albeit competing with whatever is in focus and could get pushed out).,odd if handbrake is visible to you and you arenâ€™t saturating the performance cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"windows 11 tends to aggressively put ""out of focus"" programs onto the e-cores for background/power efficiency.",i observed this behavior when testing my system with a single monitor.,"as far as i know, this behavior is supposed to stop if you have a multi-monitor setup, because microsoft expects that multiple applications might reasonably need to be priority at the same time.","changing the windows 11 power mode (\*not\* power plan) to best performance changes this behavior, and basically it treats all programs like they're active.","you can also pick a mode for ""best power efficiency"" that i assume prefers the e-cores even more, but i could not observe any meaningful difference between that and ""balanced"" when testing.","right now that i'm hooked up to 3 monitors, i can't really get windows to \*not\* keep using the performance cores for all programs, regardless of the power mode i set.",but i did observe the above behaviors earlier.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"this is because of how handbrake was designed, at least last time i checked the github project.","the reason for this was because the developers didnt want handbrake to be a resource hog and create unresponsive systems, they wanted the user to be able to do stuff while handbrake was running.","that type of logic was uncommon but worked for w10 (and older)+homogeneous cpu's, but with w11+12th gen and thread director, it now sees that logic as telling the scheduler that it should be prioritized lower, like a background task, and thus it is pushed onto the e-cores.","the handbrake team acknowledged this issue months ago, and they were supposed to be working on an update, but i can no longer find that thread on github.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

for what purpose?,gaming?,you'd probably see decent bumps in minimum framerates and mild improvements in your averages.,the 8700k is still a competent cpu and it's probably not a significant bottleneck for a 2070s.,if you have money to burn then it might be worth.,if you don't then i would wait until you actually *need* an upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have both.,it's a moderate upgrade.,if you're cpu bottlenecked it might be worth it but don't expect a gigantic improvement.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in pure gaming probably not so much - the 8700k and 2070 super are pretty evenly matched.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in general snappiness - yes absolutely.,"in gaming workloads, as others have said your 1% lows will be better, but your max fps will probably only slightly benefit (+1-3%)

i have a tuf gaming z690-plus wifi d4 with the 1304 firmware updated and running.",i have noticed one thing - the motherboard seems to be misreporting the link width of the rtx 3080 graphics card in the pcie 5.0 slot.,(check my latest reddit post on buildapc if you want more context linked [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/tcr381/rtx_3080_running_at_x4_speed/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).,"it shows the width as x4 running in pcie 4.0 mode on cpu-z and gpu-z, which is incorrect as the link speed shows as 16.0 gt/s.",either the motherboard is reporting the rtx 3080 as 4x link width in pcie 5.0 mode (which is 16.0 gt/s) or there's a bug in the bios which gets picked up by gpu-z and cpu-z.,performance wise there seems to be no issue either so i am certain its running a full speed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is most likely an operating state issue keep in mind that the pcie power management kicks in depending on load.,it will be lower when idle or checked under general desktop use.,you need to load the gpu to correctly check the link speed.,if you have confirmed performance via benchmark i would not be concerned.,you can also induce a load via gpuz via the load button it offers.,"in short, just ensure you are checking by actively loading the gpu to verify link speed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if you read the post you will see after updating the chipset firmware which can occur from agesa you may need to reload defaults and then reinstall your chipset drivers and core controllers ( note number 7 in the doc ).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the prior uefi should already be stable so it is hard to know what your issues are relative to crashing it could be many other factors but if you are running high frequency dram and have a xmp profile that is not stable it may provide a benefit.,ideally you can check this by loading f5 uefi defaults and seeing if you can duplicate your instability.,depending on the build you are running i would suggest you update if it is from last year.,"if you have more issues, consider joining our asus pcdiy group.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

wasn't that a given after the recent investor day presentation.,arrow lake is now a 20a product and will release an year after meteor lake.,so there is no way intel wont update desktop for an year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, but some people still spread the rumor that mtl is mobile only, which never made sense.",intel would be throwing away the performance lead they clawed back if they didn't release mtl on desktop.,"what we will probably see is two separate launches, desktop and mobile meteor lake in 2023, and mobile might just come first.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it likely depends on 7nm process yields and performance.,"if it performed like cannon or even ice lake 10nm, with ~4.1-4.5ghz max frequency, they'd probably cancel desktop skus.",maybe they even developed back ported compute tiles on 10nm or ported to n5 for desktop,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

idk about intel 4 being a really sting node.,"gelsinger says itâ€™s working well, and on track, but until they get past intel 3 i will have my doubts.",this node (and intel 10nm) were the original 2 nodes that got delayed over and over again because of the lack of euv right?,"while the ceo did claim they massively simplified intel 4 with more euv, the lack of euv machines from asml, this being their first euv node, and intels history of delays makes me cautious about the health and ramp",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

can you link the defect density graph?,"seems interesting, thanks.",intel lacks euvs by a factor of like 5 when compared to tsmc.,this is made an even bigger problem because intel has been increasing the amount of euv used in their intel 4 node.,"and despite switching over to euv they are not getting any massive improvement in efficiency between intel 7 and intel 4, its only a one or one and a half node improvement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"do the z690 ilm washer mod - guide in my posts

also you're probably putting too much thermal paste on the ihs and not getting good contact with the cold plate (as is obvious from your high idle temps).","i normally did the ""dot"" method or ""x"" method with bare dies, but found that spreading out with my finger, then drawing a flat credit card along the ihs to remove as much tim as possible gave me the absolute best temps",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is the part that makes the least bit of sense and is probably the most concerning to me.","on one hand, why is it pegging 100?",that's what you're looking to figure out with the washer mod and whatnot.,"but, on the other hand, if it's hitting that high a temp why isn't it thermal throttling?",have you messed with any of the thermal thresholds in the bios?,ocing at all?,"depending on what your settings are, it could be hard to apply a ""normal"" type label to it if you're doing something completely cray.",lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

gen 11 not a doubt since it has superior igpu and ipc.,"sure, you wonâ€™t have 8 cores but frankly who cares about having 8 cores in budget builds.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"9th gen i7 is good, but i think the gpu paired with it is going to be the bigger difference.","the newer igpu's are leaps and bounds ahead

i7 9750h vs i5 11400h,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"depends on which i5 10th gen and i7 9th gen. if i'm given an option between a 10300h and a 9750h, i would get the 9750h.","if it's between the 10500h and the 9750h, you can't really go wrong with either.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
eh it really depends on the user's needs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
due to supply demands even 3060 is out of my budget the maximum i can do is a 3050 as 3050ti is hard to buy as it is very rare in the third world country i live,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"11400 for sure, but make sure it's not a quad core aka the entire i5/i7-113\_\_ range",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11400h wins.,it seems like a lot of people commenting donâ€™t actually know how powerful the tiger lake cpus are compared to previous generations and are just looking at the cpu model and guessing.,"i can tell you for a fact that unless you get a gimped laptop, an i5-11400h will beat anything up to i7-10875h.","so, beating gen 9 will be a walk in the park, even an i9-9880h canâ€™t beat the i5-11400h.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"given itâ€™s a budget gaming laptop, userâ€™s needs arenâ€™t hugely relevant since your options are limited anyway.",having more cores from an older gen wonâ€™t necessarily mean itâ€™s better for you when the newer gen has the ipc to make having more cores redundant since you already have 6 cores which is nothing to scoff at.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can you give the exact specs of the most tentative laptops options you have?,"i7 and i5 mean nothing when talking about laptops, the difference there is wild.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well it's still honestly a tradeoff, all semi-modern 6-cores are definitely great, but if the user does anything cpu-intensive outside gaming it's likely going to benefit from more cores.",for example i can run em simulations in a vm on 4 of my 8 cores and still play elden ring at the same time just fine.,"if the user just wants the laptop for gaming and nothing you're definitely correct, all i'm saying is that there's still a tradeoff to consider outside of that assumption.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i7 9750h vs  i5 11400h,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think you might be missing the keyword â€œbudgetâ€ here, your argument would be valid and worth considering if it wasnâ€™t in the budget range.","in the budget range you would be looking at something like i5-11400h vs i7-9750h (iâ€™m matching parts within the same category), and the gen 11 part would win in both single and multi core performance by about 20-25%.","you might be underestimating how big of a performance leap gen 11s are, tiger lake cpus make all the previous generations look like a joke.",the gen 11 cpu would still win even if i upgrade the i7-9750h to a i7-10750h or i9-9880h.,"in fact, nothing in gen 10 i7 can match it.",thatâ€™s how powerful they are.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i5 11400h definitely, it's at the very least 25% more powerful.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
assuming the same gpu...ya....newer i5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes you are right about the u processors.,ice lake which was 10th gen had an impressive ipc uplift but clocked lower due to the 10nm process.,also had a much better gpu.,but it was labelled g.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel at that point were trying very hard to get rid of their 14nm+++++ architecture and shift to 10nm.,the differences in prices are probably the gouging that you they claim for stocking the items.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
meltdown and spectre vulnerabilities fixed in firmware is the big difference,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, you got it right.",intel got stuck and actually went backwards for awhile.,dell xps 13 laptops are a great example.,the 7390 from 2019 had up to a 6-core cpu and the next-gen 9300 in 2020 came with a 4-core that was no faster in single threaded.,it was actually a step backwards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which 10th generation ?,"but based on your thread its ""comet lake"" yes , i think comet lake is failed product... i tried 3 different laptop with comet lake , all end-up overheat (i7-10510u , i5-10210u and i5-10300h) , they just increase clock speed from 8th generation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
apart from minor fixes and some frequency differences the cpu is the same.,but there is no price difference between those cpus.,if you are looking for refurbished laptops the price difference is between older laptop and newer laptop.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i love ice lake :d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10210u vs 8350u.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they're pretty much the same chip.,"10th gen might have some power optimizations, but the only real difference is clocks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"any new power supply will work with existing gpus, otherwise it would be useless until gpus with the new connector actually ship.","i doubt a new psu will be required regardless, should be simple to make adapters for existing power supplies, at least assuming they have the necessary power capacity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i donâ€™t think thereâ€™s much selection in psus that come with the new connector - which, of course, you canâ€™t actually use on any available card either.",iâ€™m not sure if the new connector is mandatory for the pcie 5.0 specification or not.,"and if it is actually going to end up on new cards, youâ€™re not going to see such a massive sudden increase in power usage over current power needs, so iâ€™m sure the first few generations of gpus are going to be backwards compatible with multiple 8-pin, even if that means an adapter.",and that will probably be the case for a long time.,soâ€¦.,"if you need a new psu and find one that happens to have pcie 5.0 and itâ€™s also one you like for other reasons, and itâ€™s not obscenely expensive, then sure.","but otherwise itâ€™s probably going to be years before itâ€™s an actual requirement that you canâ€™t work around, so i would not base my purchase today solely on whether it comes with the connector or not.",for me it would fall under â€œnice to haveâ€ but â€œnot criticalâ€.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"corsair is saying that their rm850x (2021 model, not the older one) is compatible with the 10-pin cables (though they don't ship it with any).",i wound up choosing it for my build partly because of that.,"i figure that if they become standard, i may need to purchase an extra cable, but i won't need a whole new psu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for very older hardware like 3080ti...its too early to think about buying new psu with pcie 5 connector

its not worth it unless u r changing gpu every gen. get the best of whatever u can get from ur pc budget",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they'd have to just like pcie 2.0 and 1.0 x16 slots.,otherwise they're losing customers by cutting the market off not to mention the problems they're causing for users who maybe want just the 3080 or 4060 to come.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
either 12600k if you plan to buy a z690 and overclock or a 12400f if you buy a b660.,"12600 is not worth the price premium for a small boost in clocks and the ryzen products are decently priced, but they are slightly behind intel's counterparts.",for pure gaming i would save some money and buy a 12400f with a b660.,the 12600k needs a hefty overclock to see noticeable gains over a 12400. you will most likely be gpu limited with these cards at 1440p anyways.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you wonâ€™t overclock the cpu you could go for a i5 12600 instead of a 12600k.,just saving 60 euros,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would get a12700f which should be a similar price to 12600k but with more p cores.,edit: but you will get by far the best value going for a 12400f.,this would free up cash for the rest of your build.,i don't know if the 12600k is worth it vs 12400f for gaming as it has the same amount of p cores and the only difference would be clock speed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12400 will be much cheaper and wont be much different from 12600k in gaming,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just get a i7-12700k.,you will thank yourself later.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for 1440p with anything under a 3080ti you're almost always going to be gpu bottlenecked.,unless you really want those esports frames anything down to a 11400f or 3600 honestly will do you fine.,i don't know why so many people are recommending 8 cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just go with the cheapest cpu+mobo combo in ur options lol, and why 12600 instead of 12400?","u said 1440p gaming, if ur playing games at highest/ultra settings the gpu is the bottleneck that [even really old cpus can keep up to the top spec modern ones.","example the old zen1 1600x is much much much more inferior than the other options but the fps is still similar](https://static.techspot.com/articles-info/2201/bench/avg-ultra-1440p.png) with gpus up to rtx 3070 tier performance, and since ur considering rtx 3060ti or any other gpu with less performance it would be even less noticeable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

12400f and 12600k are the best values right now.,not to mention that the 12600k due to it's amazing single core performance and decent multicore is highest ranking in many gaming based benchmarks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

12400f for gaming or 12700f if you want those e cores no point in overclocking and you're saving a lot on mobo and cooling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 5600 will suffice for what you want to do.,you could even go cheaper.,if it's strictly gaming you are doing you could even go with a cheaper model and have the same performance.,the new i7 looks great but might have first gen bugs in some situations.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i think you're misinterpreting that chart...

it's saying that at 1080p ultra (which the 3090 can handle half asleep with one hand tied behind its back), the 3070 can push as 76% as many frames as the 3090

but the 3090 is a beast of a card, and whereas the 3070 can barely manage 42fps at 4k the 3090 67fps (i.e.","3090 = 160% of 3070, or 3070 = 63%)

but it's all gravy anyway, as the 3080 can handle the target 4k60 with ease, and those extra 7fps won't do much for you even with a 4k120 screen.","and ""in principle"" an i9-12900ks will see a practical difference over the i3-12100 in 4k titles where the gpu no longer is the bottleneck but the cpu is (even in gpu heavy games)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean not really.,"a lot of people are going to reccomend the 12th gen intel cpus over last years ryzen, they are really better, also i don't think getting a last year ryzen would be worth it if they change their socket.",we have yet to see what amd brings to the table but talking on what's currently on the market if you want the best performance intel is the way to go or waiting for amds new lineup,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

try 12700 or 12700f.,it shouldn't be that much different and similar priced to 5800x but with 2 more performance core.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they could help with background tasks.,"in a cpu bound game, it could prevent a lot of stuttering.",the extra cache is actually quite major when you get into titles that have massive executables and giant code paths.,"then again, drm has a tendency to interfere with proper cache line usage.","again, for cpu bound titles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why not overclock it anyway?,are you using like b660 board or something?,but yea i'd still get the 12600k over the 12600 if i had no intentions on overclocking it for the very reasons you mentioned.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the e-cores make no difference (and harm performance, more often than not, especially if you want to keep using windows 10)

the higher fps you want -> the more cpu and ram limited you want.,720p would require a better cpu than 4k because 720p processes so many more frames.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
correct so get the 10700f.,it will easily max out your 3060,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes but it won't be 20% extra performance for the 20% extra price so idk.,also i know people perpetually say this and it's always a moot point but the new gpus at the end of the year will theoretically be much much greater price to performance.,if you are urgently needing a pc though the 3070 and amd options are great.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's just weird because when i put it on power saver the clock goes down and the cpu runs 5-6â° cooler.,as soon as i try and put the balanced plan back on it just instantly goes back to 4.9/5.0ghz and runs hotter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you have the c1 state enabled in bios?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i had this happen to me a few days ago, check the minimum cpu power state in the balanced power plan, it was 100% instead of 5% and i had to manually adjust it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i found a setting called cpu c-states and itâ€™s on auto.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"on my z390 board, for some reason i had to enable the c1e state (even though it's for when the processor is hibernating).",maybe try that too?,"prob won't make a difference, but worth a try!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think you nailed it.,changed cpu c-states from auto to enabled and now my pc went back to a normal clock when idling.,thanks a lot!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i'm looking at also doing the same, did you get anywhere with this?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks!,i'll try a similar approach soon.,i ended up doing a 4.1 all core @ 1 on the vcore.,"i set power efficiency settings in bios, speedstep, and power saving in windows.",it idles between 15-25 watts now.,i tried doing an offset and adaptive power setting approaches but idk if it's a problem with my asus itx board or what but i can't get them to be stable.,i remember reading my asus z370-i had issues with voltage consistency from someone more knowledgeable about it than i am.,or maybe how it's interacting with my highspeed ddr4 4400mhz.,"when i set adaptive voltage mode and set the offset sign to -, i can't put in a voltage.",it won't let me change it from auto.,but it lets me set an offset if i change the offset sign back to +?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea so the setup i ended up going with is a 5ghz oc with all the power saving optional goodies my motherboard offers and best offset under-volt i could achieve in my bios.,then using windows power plan options i set minimum and maximum cpu restrictions.,i change the power plan profile when necessary for particular games or apps.,"for example, my power saver profile i have limited to something like 15% maximum cpu utilization.","i'll browse the web, watch videos, listen to music, etc.",on this profile.,i'll pull 4-12 watts in this profile.,i have a balanced profile which allows the cpu up to 65% or so for more cpu demanding apps or games.,and lastly a high performance profile which allows up to 100% cpu.,"i use this to play halo infinite for example and power draw from my cpu can reach 100 watts+

there also ultimate performance you can add via cmd or powershell code to peg the cpu at 100% at all times.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for your help i was able to get my wattage draw even lower.,i'm still tweaking a bit but got a good stable profile currently 12-18 watts idle.,i'm still able to hit 240fps 1080p in rocket league even with turbo off and a -.165 offset.,for some reason when i go beyond this or lower a few other voltages my gpu would crash in basically all games when ramping up.,haven't quite determind exactly what was causing it.,web browsing and light tasks see a 18-25 watt draw on the cpu now.,it seems my 240hz 1080p panel in combo with my xmp ddr4 keeps me from getting below 10 watts at idle.,"however, still super happy now my power draw is much much better.",the best savings came from using adaptive power for my gpu as a global and individually enabling prefer max performance on game profiles.,now between cpu/gpu idle is about 30-35 watts while still allowing 250+ total wattage draw under full high fps gaming load.,this is far better than the constant near 100 watt draw at idle.,my sffpc build is running much more efficiently temps and power wise but i don't want to go lower in performance since i can still get 60+ fps in aaa dx12 games but i'm on the border for more intensive games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""shared system memory"" is what it will allocate to the igpu should it need it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it doesn't matter, it's gonna use way more than that if needed.",you don't need to change anything,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the listed 128mb is what the integrated graphics allocates by default from your total system memory.,you can allocate more in the bios if you want.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's just a legacy thing for backwards compatibility with old software.,the system reports some minimal amount of video ram even though you don't actually have video ram in your system.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"don't bother increasing it (unless you're using something that specifically forces you to have more vram), it'll automatically allocate more if needed, performance isn't affected since it's all the same.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this is reserved vram, it can dynamically allocate more if needed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
vram and ram are different.,vram is how much ram your graphics card has.,you have a igpu which means your using your cpu as a graphics card as well.,igpu's do not have that much vram at all.,if you can id get a dedicated graphics card,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
windows already does that automatically.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> igpu's do not have that much vram at all.,"they don't have any dedicated vram in the sense that it's attached to it, that 128mb is what's set in the bios, it comes from the system's ram.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it would be a pretty decent upgrade but i can't imagine a 9700k holding back a 2080 super.,upgrading would also mean getting a new motherboard as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"its unnecessary to be honest, i doubt you can squeeze up that much more performance.",maybe a 13th gen (end of year) 13700f (non-k) would be a better alternative.,it will definitely be better and would last a bunch.,with that you should be good for nvidia 5000 even.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
idk man your cpu is pretty similar to mine and i feel like the cpu+gpu pairing is pretty appropriate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ur i7 9700k is still a good cpu but you will notice difference in cpu intensive game titles 

12600k is a beast and yes u will notice a big difference in cpu performance but wait till year end if u can for new gen launches from intel and amd",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
stick with what you have man,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it will be a big jump.,multicore performance is almost 2x better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if it's just for gaming not worth it imo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it really depends on the games you play and the settings you play at.,if you're cpu bottlenecked in the games you play you'll definitely notice an improvement,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> i haven't felt like i am getting the full performance out of my machine that i could be getting.,can you explain how you came to this conclusion?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you don't need a cpu upgrade for another couple years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is your ram specs?,"you should get better results with 16gb of fast memory rather than 32gb of a slow one, at least when it comes to gaming.",for cpu+mb upgrade i don't think the difference at 1440p will be worth it.,"btw, i hope it's a high refresh monitor, like 120hz or higher, otherwise the upgrade is even less justified (again, talking about gaming).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
however gaming don't care about multicores.... max he will get is 20% or less in fps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a 240 hz monitor at 1440p at the moment.,the ram i have is g.skill ripjaws v series 32gb 16gb x 2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i was thinking more about the ram frequency and latency, like 3600mhz cl16 or something similar.","g-skill website shows different ripjaws v 32gb (2x16gb) models, starting from 2133mhz cl15, which is way to slow for this cpu.",another thing is to make sure you have xmp enabled in bios as it is off by default and needs to be enabled manually.,"otherwise your ram will work at 2133mhz, instead of the actual rated speed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh my apologies,

it works at 3200mhz.",i did not know about enabling xmp so i will do that now.,is 3200mhz good enough or should i look to jump up to 3600mhz?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if it works at 3200mhz then xmp is already enabled.,"unless you meant it's rated at 3200mhz, then it's best to make sure xmp is enabled and it really works at 3200.

higher frequency would be better, but i would say 3200 is a reasonable minimum, so that shouldn't be a problem.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"unlike amd's and nvidia's paper launches at their release, intel's planning to ship a few million arc gpu's in 2022, with crypto definitely going to plummet, and more and more ""miners"" are selling off their rigs, meaning that eventually, at some point millions more gpu's are going to flood the second hand market, to an extent competing with retailers, maybe fiercely depending on the number of dgpu's to flood.","i don't believe people will scalp as much if at all, with nvidia during the first months of this apocalypse people knew for a fact they'd sell whatever they scalped, intel's untested and interest in gpu's dying in general, it's just risky business with little potential payout.","in the very least, if intel pushes high enough a supply at the launch, people should be able to have a chance catching one.","and with a 3rd player there'll always be more options, which is always good regardless, meaning too that the scalpers will be ""diluted"" across more products, meaning generally better stock .",.,.,"though, every 3000-series and 6000-series here in poland are in stock, everywhere, people stopped buying gpu's.","yeah, interest's crashing hard.","i honestly believe though that if they manage to hold their entry gpu's at 280 usd at the worst, but match or outperform rtx 3050's trash gpu, assuming availability, they'll win, people will throw a glance, blink, turn of the volume of the review and watch it again.","junky drivers would be forgiven, people would jump at arc, but it has to offer at least 6 gb of vram in my opinion, absolutely no less, even if it's gddr5 - which on an entry card shouldn't be a bottleneck really, and would offer tangible savings with 6 gb of vram as opposed to 8.

all they need is for their cards to work well enough, not to crash too often, price them with like gtx 16-series and hold the prices, and to be available, i believe people will take intel's arc, they, no better, no opportunity like this will ever again present itself for anyone, they must take the gamble and can't delay any longer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

iâ€™ll chip in with a good olâ€™ 8 core!,why not amd 8350!,heck fx 9590 had 5ghz!,thatâ€™s gotta be the way to go!!â€¦â€¦.,or notâ€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"obviously, the i5 is faster.","it has 50% more threads, ( i am assuming you are talking about a 4c/8t i7 cpu) has the skylake, coffe lake, comet lake generational improvements.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is ridiculous.,a 10th gen i5 (10600k) is faster than an 8th gen i7 (8700k).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"which i5-10xxx, which i7-5xxx?",in single or multi-threaded tasks?,"the 10400 is faster than every 5xxx available in single-threaded tasks, but if you're using a multi-threaded workload the 5960x is slightly faster (2.89%) compared to the 10400 thanks to the extra 4 threads.",stepping up to the 10500 and the 10th gen i5 is faster in every way.,10th gen was a huge improvement for the i5s since it's the first generation that added hyperthreading.,source: passmark,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's a joke, right?",:) i mean... why would anyone compare a 10th i5 with a very old 5th gen i7?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
221 people canâ€™t afford gen10.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
definitely the newer one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
268 people still have a 4790k and want that 5th gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have a 10700k oc to 5.2ghz on all cores, not going more than 1.32v as my avg.",55c avg.,"compared it to my friends 12700k, which has about 6% to 8% lead.",right now 10th gen is really one of the best when it comes to price to performance ratio.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for gaming it's clearly the i5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no idea which ""5th gen"" you're talking about.",a 5820k with a daily overclock is generally close to a stock 10400f.,"a 5960x with a daily oc would outperform even a daily oc 10600k, in multi-threaded workloads.","either way, 10th gen i5 would offer superior single core performance and thus more often offer a better user experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the i5 is better by a lot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what are the resaults?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the ipc on the 10th gen alone would be a better choice.,but then factor in that an 10400f has 6/12 cores compared to 5775c having 4/8.,the 10th gen i5 is better in every way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i7 4th gen thoâ€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i can spend a whole day telling stories about how much i suffered when i used to have an i7 5th gen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the i3 10100f beats the i7 7700k in every way,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

who cares?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rather a i5 10th gen because windows 11 doesn't support 5th gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"r.i.p 476 people who felt for i7 860 ""gaming pc""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
both 14nm...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
non there both sh*t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my 9 year old 3rd gen i7 stills plays modern games at 1440p high/ultra settings no problem after a 3070 gpu upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"don't forget broadwell-e (6800k, 6900k, etc).",these are 5th gen despite what the nomenclature suggests,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i had a nuc with the 5775c it was pretty cool.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there are pretty solid xeon equivalents to i7, 4c 8t no igpu... my brother got one, 2 years ago for his h81 mobo.","he swapped the pentium g3258 20th anniversary with it, since they locked oc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
f,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
now 32 people did but technically i didnâ€™t specify what kind of 5th gen i7 but the actually answer is the i5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
f,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yea sorry about that, this is my first poll, iâ€™m gonna do another poll right after this one.",the next one will be more specified and more difficult,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that extra cache on desktop broadwell is actually really slow by modern standards anyways,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
who doesnt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i prefer core 2 solo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"itâ€™s actually 4th gen, with numbering bumped to 5 to make it appealing to people since it was a refresh.",many products gets their number bumped up during product refresh but they are not considered to be a next gen product.,"as far as i know, only 3 desktop cpus from gen 5 can beat a gen 10 i5 (6950x, 6900k, 6950k), and thatâ€™s debatable whether or not you should count them since you are looking at hedt refresh chips instead of the standard desktop cpus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we still got i5 10600k to beat :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not according to 3dmark.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 5000 part you are counting is actually a gen 4 part in the refresh/hedt category, which in todayâ€™s standards would be an i9 or workstation part.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thatâ€™s what i want to see, who would choose a older cpu versus a better performing 10th gen i5",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12700k with 5.2ghz all core will at least 30% faster.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"those are technically not gen 5, but refreshed gen 4 parts that have their numbering bumped up for marketing purposes.",and itâ€™s also debatable whether or not refresh chips from older generations should be counted if itâ€™s a category vs category (i.e.,"desktop vs desktop, hedt vs hedt) comparison since by modern standards, some of not most/all of those chips would be elevated to i9 status.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thereâ€™s 2 more days left, still waiting",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thatâ€™s not the point, which one is better than the other",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"broadwell-e, haswell-e, ivybridge-e, sandybridge-e, westmere, nehalem.",i'm pretty sure that makes broadwell-e 6th gen hedt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
does it have the 128mb cache?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there are significant differences between an i7 5775c and an i7 6950x.,but most people would assume it's for the mainstream lga 1150 socket and not the high end lga 2011.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this is very true, the extreme edition chips weren't even on the same socket as the regular ""high end"" i7's from the same lineup.","it was only 4c/8t on the standard desktop platform until 8th gen essentially, where we finally saw 6 cores, even on the i5's.",and 10th gen offered incremental improvements to ipc and added ht for i3/i5 cpus.,"the 10th gen i3's are more comparable to any *consumer-level* i7 prior to 8th gen. and now with alder lake, those i3's are considered the most powerful quad-cores ever made to date.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well yes, but on the other hand the 5960x *is* a 5th gen i5 (or if you prefer, the 6950x is a 5th gen i5) what it would be if released today is kind of irrelevant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
annnnddd where are you getting your facts?,"there is your opinion, then there is facts.","[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=babn5fuylgy&t=824s&ab\_channel=jarrod%27stech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=babn5fuylgy&t=824s&ab_channel=jarrod%27stech)

at 1440p 12700k vs 10700k you're looking at least 10% faster, and at 1080p about 15% faster.","then, you add in the price, well, 10700k is a better price to performance cpu, especially if you game at 1440p +.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>so i7-6700k would be 6th gen core.,"that works on the consumer side for the core i3/i5/i6 (don't look at pentium or celeron parts), but then we also have things like the i7-6950x for broadwell-e, which is technically still a 5th gen part.","basically, the enthusiast parts are a generation behind on architecture, which does make sense as it allows intel to launch smaller and less complex parts first and then follow up with more cores later.",https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/the-broadwell-e-review/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no... i didn't check, but i'm certain it doesn't, probably the normal 4,6,8 mb.","maybe you are thinking of some other platform like x99, regarding the broadwell haswell architecture.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm using an i7-6950x.,i don't feel a need to upgrade yet.,weird?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that is debatable as when comparing modern and old practices, from an academic perspective itâ€™s normal to investigate whether concessions, alterations or reclassifications need to be considered since standards would have changed and cross generation comparison could be made grossly inaccurate through the introduction or renaming of categories (i7 extreme into i9).",those refresh parts belong to i7 extreme/hedt which in modern standards translates to i9.,the terminology/classification system has changed over the years but they are the same thing in practice.,"if you reorganise the stack using an organisation system that reflects the changes in the way intel classifies cpu tiers, you may find that i7-5775c is the most powerful gen 5 i7.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you might want to watch the video again.,the combination benchmark is 50% faster.,i wonder those who simply quote a youtube link ever watch the video themselves?,it's funny that the result is often totally contradict with their statement.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what's really wacky is that even mainstream intel had 2 cpu arches before sandybridge.,lynnfield and clarkdale.,sandybridge shoud've probably started at 3xxx like sb-e did.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i asked since you said there were xeon equivalents to the i7-5775c, since afaik, there arenâ€™t any.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's my point, it's gonna be a long time until the 6950x is going to need an upgrade to avoid it causing 10 fps dips.","the same can't be said for the 5775c and 10105. people who bought the 5775c got ripped off to buy something that costs more than it's physically worth, and i purposefully bought the 10105 with planned obsolescence in mind because it was an incredibly good value cpu when i got it last year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol... not sure what you're talking about?,take a screenshot where it shows for gaming that 12700k is 50% faster?,"(bet you won't do that) 

""i wonder those who simply quote a youtube link ever watch the video themselves?""",are you talking about yourself?,"because, i watched that link at least 3 times, and many others like it with similar specs, at best for 1080p gaming 12700k is 15% faster, and thats probably at best 1 or two games.","here, let me dumb it down for ya

"lol... you have enough time to hit the dislike button on my recent comment, but can't show me a screenshot where 12700k is ""50%"" faster vs 10700k?",nice....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i7 5775c has 6mb of cashe memory...
and there are various variants with different turbo frequency.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i bought a 5775c off aliexpress in 2020 to mess with lol interesting cpu to say the least.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it has 128mb of l4 cacheâ€¦ afaik there is no broadwell xeon on lga1150.,thereâ€™s just the haswell stuff,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
anything interesting that you noticed?,"i almost chose it over my 6700k, but i wasnâ€™t happy with the motherboards available.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well my brother has a 14nm xeon without igpu on 1150... afaik level 4 cache is not refered when you mention just cache memory.,"btw what process do you need that 12mb of cache, and may i suggest a different platform.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
performs still surprisingly well in the new games with it overclocked to 4.2ghz and 3.6ghz cache.,"it is very difficult to clock it high is one, so in terms of raw compute performance the 6700k will definitely be better.",but apparently the 128mb cache helps it a lot in games but i haven't directly compared them.,i still use it in my htpc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[removed],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no ""dude""... i didn't mention i7 5775c, just a xeon equivalent to a broadwell i7.","that's unusual/rare, there are haswell and refresh xeons on the same socket/platform.","i still don't understand why u r impressed with lvl4 cache, when for most applications it's not that relevant.","btw my brother overclocked the forementioned xeon on a 40 euro h81 msi motherboard, from 3.something to 4.2 fully stable.",read the tread from the beginning.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
has never been announced,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i highly doubt it will ever.,intel's released their 12th gen desktop parts so it doesn't make sense to launch a last gen product.,not to mention 13th gen is on its way.,"if you wanna get a high core count chip, the 5950x and maybe the new threadripper pro chips are a good option considering there aren't any options from intel",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean the next intel hedt isnâ€™t going to be lga 2066 anyway.,it will definitely be a different socket.,rumors suggest it will be announced q3 this year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"awww man i think ima just swap out my mobo for a newer one i need me a 11 or 12 gen for davinci resolve and video editing in h.265 10 bit 4k, the one i have right know is ok but i need butttery smooth play back.",tbh.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
theoretically is going to be based on sapphire rapids,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"youâ€™re right it doesnâ€™t make sense to release a last gen tbh, iâ€™ll just wait for 13th gen, wow deja vu almost feels like app l e how the release new models each year lol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m new to this what does it mean?,is it lga 2066?,or other chip set?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol.,you should look at amd if you want it immediately,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sapphire rapids is the next xeon architecture.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yea most likely a ry9 5950x is a good one iâ€™m looking into, you know what sucks though?","a little bit of topic but, my old mother board is intel and it has 8 slots for ram i believe the manual says it can take up too 256gb ddr4 ram, while all this new mobo weather it be intel or am d they only have 4 ram slots and can only hold about 128gb ram, why is this?","i would like to have more ram since i am a 3d artist and edit video on davinci and use fusion witch uses a crap ton of ram as projects grow, itâ€™s sucks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean consumer platforms do have only upto 4 slots to my knowledge in what almost seems forever (i think there were a few 6 slot boards about 10 yrs ago but i'm not aware) .,u currently have intel extreme platform(is that what it's called?).,"if u want more ram slots, look at threadrippers",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
clock\_watchdog\_timeout means your cpu is not getting enough voltage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
turn off any automatic overclocking such as multicore enhancement or game mode or ai overclocking.,"once that is done turn on adaptive boost technology , and reduce score till it runs stable without blue screen and ridiculous temps.",you can use cinebench r23 for stabily testing this.,aibs for some reason decided to over volt the shit out of 11th gen processors for some reason.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you didn't even mention what your vcore is.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if that sp rating is legit that's the most garbage 11900k ever lol.,if it's taking 1.4v to make cine bench stable at 4.8ghz you need to return that thing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hey there,

what bios version do you have?",it used to bsod at stock  (with this message) unless you disabled hyperthreading **(i have the same board and cpu since release day and it's my main machine**).,"once the bios was updated around the middle of last year, those bsods only occured with abt enabled and very rarely, under extremely light loads.","i patched the bios again the other day and i'm running abt again (with 90c and 250w limits manually set, personal preference because of noise in my setup), 2 weeks without any issues so far.","assuming you are not looking to overclock (if that sp is real then better not lol) and just want stock performance, i think we can work it out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

time to upgrade to a 12900k?,:d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

had the same problem with lenovo.,i think it's just a limitation of usb c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just dont oc it, problem solved",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1. bclk oc is locked at 103 since decades maybe.,"12th gen can do bclk oc is because some of the motherboard come with external clock generator which will bypass any bclk limit that intel put in their chipm
2. it should allow you to do that, but it's gonna depend on your ram kit also.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think u got your answer from another comment.,"you needed pcie 4.0, but to my knowledge only z590s support it.",why did u not get a z590 then?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"most if not all msi and gigabyte z490 boards support pcie 4.0 via cpu lanes, asus cheaped out though.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yep, my bad should have said i was using a z490 aorus elite ac which does support pcie4.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh okay my bad.,i did not know that lol.,then what is even the difference between z490 and z590 then?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bout the same differences between z170 and z270 or z370 and z390.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"really hard to tell , you can try installing various updates manually from a third party webiste such as softpedia (trustable) to see which one works best for you.","there are lots of updates and versions of most drivers , if its a issue that came with updating drivers then you might be better of staying at the version that works the best for you in games.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

are you gaming or no?,if you are def go with the better gpu.,the 12th gen i3 is the best i3 yet imo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would suggest a i3 12100f + rx 6600. amd gpus cause less cpu overhead.,[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jleijhunaw8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jleijhunaw8),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that cpu us really expensive.,not it itself but mainboard costs way more.,get a normal 5 5600x with a cheap b450 and get a 3060,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12100f or 12400f + rx 6600 is the current price to performance king right now.,although if you don't need the pc now maybe another month or two could see gpu prices down even more.,or it could be world war 3 i dunno.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"12100f + h610 + 16gb ddr4 3200 cl16 + (or best value gpu available to you)


is definitely the way to go for a super budget build right now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12100f + 3050 imo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i do play csgo on low settings but i wanna try other games if i have enough money from streaming (not yet),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"guess i have to save up 1,202 dollars (1,000 dollars for the entire pc and 202 dollars for the tools)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
buying a cheap b450 for 5600x is not a good idea imo.,12400f + a decent b660 cost less than 5600x and a b550.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ryzens are always out of stock lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
im saving up for it lol im a broke guy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12400 would be better for cs and esports games like r6:siege.,but the 12100+3050 would be better for all the other non-esports games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what tools are you using?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i will keep the i3 when my build is finished and i will save up to get the i5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thermal paste, toolkit for the build, and an nvme to usb for cloning the boot drive.","others include the monitor, the case, cooling fans cuz the case dosent come with fans, and the gk61.",i already have a mouse but imma save up for the g pro superlight when my new pc is done,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
more tool then i thought was needed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i will keep the i3 when my build is finished then imma save up and get an i5 12400 if possible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

at last.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think ht should be kept off the pentium and celeron line.,"celeron should be 2p2e4t

pentium should be 2p4e6t

additionally, make an atom platinum line with *only* e cores, these don't actually need to be cheap, they're 'platinum' - but they should have full i/o and very low tdp.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"small cores make sense either for power efficiency, or mt.",they're not really going to affect overall system responsiveness so i'm not sure if it makes much sense for office tier chips which aren't going to do any more than light web browsing and spreadsheet work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hardware unboxed did a b660 roundup and it looked like it did pretty well.,[12900k it was a bit warm](https://youtu.be/pea0vcj0lry?t=762) without direct airflow at it while the [12700 was relatively cool](https://youtu.be/pea0vcj0lry?t=875) even without airflow directed at it.,"iirc most vrms can get to something like 125c while being within spec, 67c while maxed out will be perfectly fine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it has 4 possible fan connectors - 2 sys, 1 pump, 1 cpu.","the different names don't really mean anything, they are interchangeable (you just need to configure them in bios to suit your use), so if you use 1 on your cpu, you are left with 3, which should be enough for most setups (depending on the case obviously).","if you want more, you will need a splitter, yeah.","no, you don't need usb to install bios.","bios is already preinstalled, although probably not the latest version.","if you want to install the latest bios, you will need a usb.",it is a great board and you definitely won't be making a mistake if you buy it for your 12700.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

he simply slaps a 120mm fan directly on the vrm area for additional (direct) airflow.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh ya, i just had a look and they seem to have a 4 pin socket as well.","you can absolutely chain them together without any issues, it will work just fine.",the only slight issue/incovenience would be that then you cannot control them individually.,"if you want to increase the rpm of one fan, then the one that is chained to it and connected to the same moterboard socket will increase it's speed as well.",sometimes to reduce noise and keep the fan speeds as low as possible it is advantegous to have them increase their speeds individually as needed - each has it's own thermal curve profile in the bios.,"but that's hardly worth spending the extra money on a hub, personally i wouldn't worry about it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what's your problem?,also why would you buy a b660 board with a 12700k?,not trying to be a dick but makes no sense to me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its current temperature is a chilly 22 c. there is 78 degrees to go before hitting tj max.,"no worries, you are doing fine.",more tan fine really because you are the lucky owner of a wonderful machine.,enjoy!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it shows maximum *distance* from tjmax is 100c.,never did it get above 45c.,everything is fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there are no problem, i totaly misunderstand it.",i was going with non k+b660 but i got a great deal for 12700k for the same price or less than non k. thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

intel does not actually release laptops.,we manufacture processors.,laptops are up to the oems to release,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"because intel, like amd doesnt release laptops the same day as desktops.. laptops were just announced earlier this year and they are shipping performance (h series) first.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they're too busy handicapping the damn thing via software and fuses.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"lower power mobile alder lake chips are scheduled to be introduced in march, according to slides on thg.",it's not late yet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"stop acting smart, you know what i mean.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel generally releases laptop cpus first, considering that they make more money from consumer laptops rather than gaming pcs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your question makes no sense the way you asked it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">intel generally releases laptop cpus first

i wish that were true, but alas, it is false.",but can anyone here explain why desktop cpus are always released first?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
everybody else gave an answer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"on the contrary, laptops have been released first for the last while actually.","the reason primarily being that when switching to a new node, the smaller dies (i.e.",low core count laptops) have higher yields.,"thus when moving to 14nm, broadwell was laptop first... and in fact there was barely any desktops at all.","with the move to 10nm, icelake and then tigerlake were also laptop only.",no desktops at all.,"alderlake desktops were first, likely because intel was pushing for desktop amd compete.",they had fallen so far behind without any major update since the 6th gen skylake on desktops.,hence power-be-damned 12900k to get the best possible benchmark scores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that doesn't change the fact that it didn't make sense,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think historically would 45w h series laptop cpus fill this role?,and now 11th h35 and 12th p series are exactly 35w right?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is the alder lake p series processors that have a 28w base power and 64w turbo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
t series are mostly low end oem systems like terminals where performance is unimportant.,"mobile processors make more sense than taking a desktop processor and throttling it to hell, especially for enthusiasts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
true.,but these would run cooler and can be upgraded/replaced.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a 35w chip won't throttle, given that higher end laptop chips start at 45w.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"higher end t series can draw almost 200w, so to get them down to 35w limits they're massively throttled after a couple seconds.","h series use less power, so throttling is much less of a problem.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i thought they were all locked at 35w.,guess not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they're just regular desktop cpus except with the power limits such that they throttle really hard.,"before they throttle the power consumption is similar to any other desktop, e.g.",100-200w under heavy load.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you try intel xtu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"~~intel disabled undervolting for tiger lake because of [plundervolt](https://plundervolt.com/).~~ 

maybe not 100% accurate?","i was looking through a few conflicting posts/articles, a few saying 10th and 11th gen undervolting was disabled, but there were some posts saying they could undervolt, and also some saying they couldn't, i think one or two that couldn't, their issue apparently had something to do with vm being enabled in bios, so you may want to check if it's enabled in your bios.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if your machine runs hot and loud, but the bios is locked down, and don't mind losing some performance, then set processor power management, maximum state to 99%.","this will disable turbo boost, but it will also keep it cool(er).","the other trick is to disable the discrete gpu in device manager, if you have one, xe is almost as good as an nvidia mx.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no i thought it was incompatible with this processor?,iâ€™ll try now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
only for non-h series cpus.,11800h for example can be undervolted.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just use throttlestop's speedshift multiplier limit in the 'tpl' tab.,i don't have a tiger lake cpu but it worked on my 11700f even when voltages are locked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
xps13 laptop - should i turn off intel speed step for better battery life?,intel turbo boost?,"my laptop is amazing, but i used to use throttlestop and get 14 hours of life.",this gets 3-4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i've seen a few different posts on multiple websites that don't specify u/h/etc., although i'm also seeing conflicting posts on a few websites, some saying they can undervolt on 11th gen h series while others can't, reading further there were some mentions that it may have something to do with vm being enabled, so maybe that's op's issue?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"some oems have circumvented it such as asus, hp, msi and any tongfang or clevo odm.",acer can also have it re-enabled very easily as well.,i do know that the 11xxg7 can't be undervolted though as they have locked voltage registers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is there any way to check if undervolting is enabled on my laptop?,i have an asus with 11400h.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
download throttlestop and see if you can offset the voltages.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your temps are fine.,"but if you are asking to help optimize your cooling, you can try less mounting pressure when you secure in the cooler plate.",you should also consider locating the aio radiator to cold air intake.,if it is currently fixed as hot air exhaust.,small choices like that will have a large impact on the delta temps.,but overall in the grand scheme of things those temps are absolutely normal.,"so unless you are min maxing, your current setup is fine.","edit:

okay after re-examining your specs, you are setup for high end.",so you might as well optimize your cooling setup and maximize your overclock.,that is why you pay for a very capable overclocking motherboard.,that platform should be overclocked and not run at stock settings.,even the ai overclocking system is good!,just be sure to update the bios to keep the ai updated.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

nice!,it does look like your chip suffers from the combination.,"* not completely flat ihs 
* too strong retention clip so that it warps the ihs a bit

but from looking at your photographs, it does not look too bad at all.",the cold plate looks like it has paste where the cpu ihs does not.,and your reapplication of the paste looks excellent.,how are the temperatures after that?,i have not looked too deeply at the retention clip washer mod.,but i have heard that it will affect performance when using ln2 overclocking at really low temperatures.,"in that cold temperature zone, they really do need that high retention mount pressures.",see here for an explanation.,"https://youtu.be/t2_xmo6efw0?t=536
i know you are not using ln2, but i wanted to include this clip as part of a discussion since you mentioned the article in igor's lab.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looks very nice!,i can only suggest relocating the cpu cooler to the intake position.,but that might mean reconfiguring your entire system.,ultimately it is up to you if you want to pursue this route.,"but overall if re-pasting has helped lower your temperatures, your cpu is operating perfectly fine.",usually gaining higher frames mean cooling your gpu more.,"unless you are gunning for much higher cpu overclock, i would leave everything alone.","you can also test the potential of how a ""cold"" air intake would perform for your case/system by simply removing the side panel.","this will sort of simulate a ""cold"" air intake for your cpu cooler and allow the gpu to vent to atmosphere rather than vent through your aio radiator.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, after give some more paste temperature still 40c-46c
mostly stay at 44c when idle.","when gaming it will reach 64 max
i know 40c is still fine temp, but just curious about people review at youtube.","they use 12900k but tempt can idle at around 20c

a good article;  thanks for posting!,i gathered that intelâ€™s new foundry division will be based on tower and their offerings.,it also sounds like pat really wants to aggressively expand intel through acquisitions (based on his learning at vmware).,his goal of 50% of chip manufacturing in eu and us by 2030 is quite aggressive but admirable - thatâ€™s going to require a lot of investment.,lastly it sounds like he also plans to do a lot more long term investing in israel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

funny you bring that up.,"i, regrettably, hired an engineering manager from intel and first thing he suggested was getting a software called wellnomics.","he said while the software is supposed to monitor ergo safety, it apparently notifies managers if someone has been using a computer for >40 hours.",it was his way of identifying who is working hard and who is not.,he didnâ€™t last long in my company and left for another santa clara based company thatâ€™s working on some epic stuff.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i would try adjusting your ram speed to at least 3200mhz and then report back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you bought 3200mhz ram and are running it wildly below spec of 3200mhz and wonder why it's slow?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there's not much information to go by here other than the curiously weird choice to run the memory at that absurd speed without any explanation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you enabled xmp?,try turning your ram clock up to its spec speed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why 2133mhz?,and why a 12600k on a h670 instead of a 12700/f?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you reinstall windows?,have heard a rumor that os config can go nuts if doing a cpu swap.,i have never swapped one without a fresh install.,"and yes, system should not run slower, assuming you used same gpu as before.","ram would not cause stutters as many are saying, is not like you are using integrated graphics (please double check).",also run cpu-z benchmark and compare with baseline.,if you get score lower than normal there you have the problem.,if score is fine then check with msi afterburner in-game qnd detect the limitting resource.,"who knows, maybe is not the cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"on a lark, disable e-cores in bios, set xmp, and test again.",e-cores are extremely slow (slower than 4790k core) and when a game thread randomly hops to them (still happens on windows 11 with thread director since td isn't mature yet) performance stutters like crazy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that's very likely the issue, format your drive and install the os so it's a clean install, installing over an existing os, especially when you change mobo+cpu is going to cause issues like this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

seems to me the only difference is that the level of vrm that previously struggled with the 11400 now struggles with the 12600k because they consume roughly the same amount of power at peak load.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

iâ€™m pretty sure the commenter was being sarcastic :).,that said - there was a conversation with an intel engineer sometime after ceo craig barrett halted clock speed advancements on p4 (at 3.8 ghz).,"the engineer indicated that prescott could have hit 5 ghz but would have required 200 watts to do so, and the oems didnâ€™t want that.",(the btx standard was created to deal with these new hotter cpus).,"funny as fast forward to today, and weâ€™ve seen plenty of cpus hit and exceed 200w in the last decade (amd fx 9370/9590, 9th-12th gen under certain circumstances, not to mention amd and intel workstation and server cpus).","the market today is a lot more tolerant of high power consumption (oddly) than in 2004.  

iâ€™d still love to hear about the paper studies on prescott and tejas done before they were fully engineered (or as far as tejas got) and see what the engineers at the time thought they were going to get out of those cpus from a power and performance perspective.","was it all â€œdennard scalingâ€ breaking down at 65/90nm, or was it other missed assumptions?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

go with a 12600k and some b660 board if for gaming honestly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it will work but youâ€™ll be unable to oc.,check max wattage and supported cpus on you board manufacturer website for sure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why not the 12700kf on a h610?,its the same price do i really need a b660?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've tested a bunch of b660 boards and lower end ones don't run an i5 non k or an i7 properly.,the vrms suck and throttle the cpu.,h610 are universally worse in spec.,"awful vrms, basic i/o, just real bargain basement stuff.",it's a misallocation of funds.,get an i5-12600k (or even i5 12400) and a b660 board instead.,then your cpu will actually be able to perform to potential.,if it's 'just gaming' then move money from the cpu to the gpu budget.,you'll get a better gaming pc that way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it will work, but a high end cpu with a low-end board us always a bit weird.","you might lack access to some features, upgrading in the future might be a pain, etc.","if you want to go for this though, do it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah this is the right approach.,think of it as a car - you dont want to have a ferrari engine ( 12700kf + 3070ti ) that runs on a hyundai i20 accent ( h610 ) cuz it will not handle it right and wont unleash its true potential.,"its common to think on the mobo as a not-so-important part of the chain, but it really isnt.","once the mobo cant handle that power, he starts to overheat and in order to lower his temps, he takes power away from the cpu and other... not good.","you need a decent b660 one, no need to go over that.","and a 12600k will be great, as said above already - take the 12700kf only if you plan on extra tasks other than gaming.",just dont take that b660-hdv from asrock because it got the worst vrms of all that chipset series and will not handle very well the i5.,"that msi [b660m-a pro](https://www.newegg.com/p/n82e16813144523?description=b660&cm_re=b660-_-13-144-523-_-product) is a good one.all the necessary features, good vrms, etc...

with the money left off from the 12700kf to the 12600k, it should fit your budget.",goodluck !,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
will how about a 12600k with a h610?,is that more sensible?,i just want the best performance for the cheapest price also do u think theirs any real drawbacks from using a h610?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
best performance for cheap?,"then go with the i3 12100, top performence per price for lga1700",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"but im pairing it with a 3070 ti wont the i3 bottleneck it, i play msflight sim 2020 and halo infinite and csgo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh, then go with your original combination i suppose.",get a 12600k if you want to save some more money and the 12700kf if you think that you might do more than just gaming,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks for your help i appreciate it, will the h610 break faster or anything im worried about that?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thank you.,i am on baby duty right now but will post when i get a moment.,i also find my cooler has the sliiiightest bit of wobble to it too so i wonder if this is a factor.,mounting screws are all on tight as poss by slight i mean basically the next step up from no movement at all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i did it!!!!!,max temp 74 degrees!,difference of 26 degrees c!!!!!!,i am so happy i could cry.,"few things:
- when i stripped it all down, i realised it was one corner of the mount that was wobbling.",i took it off entirely and saw the spacer thing (which i had 'hand tightened') was loose and that was that issue.,"sorted that

- did the washer mod.","no longer feels like i'm crushing my cpu to oblivion when i lock it in its socket

- cleaned off all thermal paste from cooler and cpu.","the fact it came pre applied on the cooler and the shape of the cooler contact was square meant so much thermal paste was going on the socket mechanism before, so it was good to be able to apply just to the cpu.","- i moved the be quiet fan to 'pull' air out the heatsink towards the back, and added the noctua a12 to the push position at the front of the heatsink pushing air through it.","here was the results 5 mins in (and didnt get any hotter after then either) - https://1drv.ms/u/s!aks37mdaffdq09svzcxzhzbcn6zmqa

my be quiet cooler coldplate is a flat even surface so i think that'll apply.,the pattern i saw online as an indicator of poor contact with thermal paste looked like mine too.,i'll report back for others who make come across this in the future,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
seems your comment with screenshots isn't showing up in this thread but i found it on your profile.,"the screenshots show your p-cores running at 4.5ghz which is correct stock speeds for all-core loads, before thermal throttling kicks in and they downclock.","the reason you see turbo written as 4.9 is because that's the maximum speed that will be reached if no more than 2 cores are under load; at 5-6 core usage, the maximum boost is 4.5ghz.","at around 135 watts, you probably shouldn't be seeing such high temperatures with that cooler, i'd expect something more like 85-95c, but your results arent so far off that i would consider this to be a sign of anything deeply wrong with your components.","first, you should try a mild undervolt of 50-100mv, which is usually stable for the 12600k.",you can look up some videos on how to do this through bios or the xtu software.,make sure you test stability after applying the undervolt.,"in addition, it is possible that your cooler is getting poor contact, so i would definitely recommend remounting and repasting to check for better results.","the cooler coldplate being made before lga 1700 should not matter, as they are typically convex to make contact at the center of the ihs where the die is located.","that being said, the bracket adapters can be dodgy and some people have had issues with them.",as for your question about the noctua fan -  putting 2 fans on a 1 fan 1 tower cooler will typically give a few degrees benefit.,"your best bet would probably be to replace the current fan with the noctua, and then put that fan either on the other side of the cooler or somewhere else in your case for more intake",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
few hours on still hasn't gone past 74 degrees under heavy load with handbrake.,seems to be doing the trick.,"only odd performance issue i experienced was during encoding an iso to mkv in handbrake, it switched to only using the efficiency cores.","i paused the encode, resumed and it wentb ack to using all again, and then after about 20 minutes the same happened again.",i'm going to take the plunge to windows 11 anyway + mess with some settings in handbrake too as i know setting it to 'below normal' priority causes it to only use efficiency cores 100% of the time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you cant see the flatness with the naked eye.,we are talking microns.,the dude that created the washer mod says not to do it unless you have a lapped waterblock for a custom loop.,i would try other things before this.,i just built a new pc with 12700k and did a lot of research about this issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you so much.,"my hunch is this is to do with the mounting rather than any fault with the cpu itself, the more i think about it.",it's difficult to know it's sitting right as the (heatspreader is it called?),"is square whereas these cpus are slightly rectangular, and it overlaps with the metal clasp either side of the cpu itself.",it concerned me as it came with thermal paste already applied and i wondered if some of it being on the metal casing keeping the cpu down and in place could be a problem or not.,"i think i'm going to clean all thermal paste off, reapply, put the noctua so it's pushing air through heatsink and the be quiet fan so pulling it out.",take all mount screws etc out and put them back in and try and see if i can get better contact.,"if i can't/things don't improve, i will see about getting a different (/type) of cooler for the cpu.",i'm going to avoid message with voltages for now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good luck and hopefully that will give you some improvements.,"i would still encourage you to check out a video on undervolting with xtu software as it is really quite easy and can't damage your cpu (you can however bluescreen, but it will automatically reset settings to defaults), and is the most consistent way to reduce temperatures since motherboards will intentionally give your cpu more voltage than it needs to ensure widespread stability.",but as always don't do it if you aren't comfortable with it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
