* gaming 60c
* stress test 90 but i undervolted a bit.",without undervolting i am reaching 98-99 c in cinebench r23 test.,your cooler seems works fine as shown by stress test temp.,on your place i would try to force 100%  fan-speed/power on cooler and see the temps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
messing with the fan curvature helped lower the temps.,i think it is just bad contact if i am being honest because most of the thermal paste is pushed to the sides.,"while the temps aren't high enough to be super concerning, i bought a contact frame just in case.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

edit: update i got my card in, and it works... *well sort of.","*

* i can't get it to show the av1 encoder in obs at the moment, it does however work with intel quicksync (which is fine for what i need but i was excited for av1)
* one of the biggest problems i am finding is configuration, i'll explain.","my main gaming gpu is in slot 1 running at pcie 4x16 which is great, until i install the a380.",when the a380 is installed it will only let me run the card in 4x8 for my 3080 and the a380.,"* i thus went into my bios and swapped them 3080 at pcie 4 and a380 at pcie 3. well it seems to not have taken as when i boot up gpuz shows me running them both still at pcie 4x8 (splits the 4x16 lane into two 4x8 lanes)
* onto my next step try my third slot.",this is what seems to work the best so far.,still no av1 as i can't get it to work in obs however my gpu is running in all pcie 4x16 and the a380 runs in pcie 3x18.,* this worked it allowed me to stream and i didn't see any issues with frames drops or overloaded encoder at a resolution of 1440x810 at 60 fps.,"i have not reviewed the stream vod yet to see if it looks ok but i assume it does (intel quicksync is a very good encoder even if its not the av1 encoder)
* i will keep testing when i have time but i wanted to give y'all and update

**tldr**: the a380 works as a streaming encoder fine, it wont run av1 for me in obs at the moment so i have to default to intel quicksync.",i had to use the 3rd pcie slot on my motherboard for the a380 so that my main gaming gpu could still use all 16 of my pcie 4 lanes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what are the chances they'll be released before nvidia and amd release their next lot which presumably will have similar av1 hardware encoding?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
anthony from a linus tech tips video mentioned someone might do this.,i think the video is from this weekend.,i would imagine this encoder would show up in intel's igpu at some point.,what if this also worked in reverse though.,get an old cheap nvidia gpu that has been optimized for games and then play those games on intel's gpu hardware.,i have no idea what i'm writing about.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think you may run into conflicts with drivers trying to use an intel and nvidia gpu in the same system.,"i could not even get an older nvidia gpu (760gt or something) to work with my 3070 because the driver versions are different, but i could be wrong.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you wonâ€™t be able to run it while running another gpu in your system.,you canâ€™t do it with nvidia or amd cards.,but if you have a second system just for encoding it would work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[removed],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it might impact your pcie bus width on your main gpu if you put it in the wrong slot.,"i think it can take it down to x8 speeds if you're using lanes that  go towards your cpu, instead of your chipset.",but a lot of motherboards don't have that 3rd x16 slot.,someone correct me if i'm wrong.,at worst you'll loose 1% performance on your main gpu if you're using a pcie4 motherboard/cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"it *is* that good, and even beats the slowest cpu x264 encoding at low bitrates.",whether it's worth it just for that use case is of course very questionable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's better than the best h264 presets apparently.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"like based on what i read, it could greatly increase the quality and/or reduce the file size, if you do lots of video editing and recording, smaller file size = less time to render.",that time savings could be significant and worth the price of the card.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i've been experimenting with that already, but it's not as really good enough, a hardware one would be so much better.",software av1 encoders feel like they have a long way to go before i would consider them practical over hardware encoding.,which is why i'm interested in intel arc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

are power limits off?,check hwinfo and see pl1 and pl2.,if pl2 is over 190w then its running with no power limits and a 240aio will not cool that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a 360 aio and iâ€™ve never seen beyond 50c while gaming.,"this is at stock, i havenâ€™t ocâ€™d it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
will setting power limits reduce its performance ?,how would you set up ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well it depends on your cooling.,because you only have a 240aio you will be thermally limited.,thus not being able to take advantage of the extra power since your cpu will throttle.,"just saying, if you are jumping to 80-90c in gaming then you definitely have a cooling issue",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if it was the 13600 i would choose that but also just.,"between these definitely the 12700. its 8 p cores vs 6. for gaming p cores is what matters, not e-cores.","also re-sale value, when you sell perhaps few years down the line, an i7 will always be better value than a i5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"lots of threads regarding thermal concerns with 13600's lately, i'd personally go with the 12700k in this scenario.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"let's compare them:

* 12700: 12 cores 20 threads (8 p-cores, 4 e-cores)
* 13500 : 14 cores 20 threads (6 p-cores, 8 e-cores)

they should be very similar in performance but if u use for gaming only i'd pick the 13500 because of better ipc that help games a lot altough 12700 have sligthly higher frequencies.","the 13500 also have two more physical cores that should make last longer your cpu

13500 \~264",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13500 is [alder lake die based](https://videocardz.com/newz/intel-confirms-core-i5-13600-cpu-and-below-are-based-on-alder-lake-die) and it doesn't have any ipc improvements over 12700.,12700 will definitely be faster in gaming.,i'd say get it or find the money for 13600k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah thats my biggest problem too, no benchmarks to compare them",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
between these two i would choose the i5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you don't need them.,they are the same architecture.,"12700k has higher base&boost clocks, higher pl1&pl2 (meaning higher sustained clocks in stock) so it will be faster.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

how can intel ensure that the undervolting is not blocked if it's not their decision anymore?,intel has introduced a feature allowing a particular motherboard vendor to decide whether to block the undervolting.,"also, which is more frustrating, according to the ""recommended bios settings"" the undervolt protection should be enabled by default.",a vendor needs to make an extra step to disable it or add a setting allowing changing it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this doesn't really clear anything up.,"perhaps if anyone updates to latest bios and tries to undervolt, they could confirm here by listing their motherboard details (exact model, version and revision), and also whether or not the uvp option is there, whether it can be enabled/disabled, and whether they have successfully disabled it and undervolted?",this would be a big help to anyone wanting to uodate their bios.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"memory controller voltage modification blocked on non-k cpus since gen 12, now undervolting blocked on 12th and 13th gen depending on mobo manufacturer's will.",sooner or later to be available only in z skus.,intel salary cuts are well-deserved.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this post confirms the following:

1. intel introduced a new feature called undervolt protection.",it effectively blocks the undervolting and is deployed using bios updates.,2. each vendor decides whether to enable this feature by default and include a setting in the bios.,so now intel can say that they do not block the undervolting.,that's something evil vendors did.,"3. now there's no guarantee that if you buy a z-series motherboard and unlocked cpu, you will be able to undervolt.",it depends on the motherboard vendor and its policy.,i have made an additional research regarding undervolt protection and published it here: [intel undervolt protection](https://www.reddit.com/r/overclocking/comments/10ojbbq/intel_undervolt_protection/).,"also, i found, that the undervolt protection setting is completely missing on 12900hk and, probably, 13900hk systems.",i'm talking about hidden settings here.,on other systems it may be ignored by firmware or not work properly.,"probably, that's because some vendors are using the ""undervolt protection"" setting to control another feature called ia cep.",as for the undervolting through the bios it does not work properly with the undervolting protection enabled.,"there are settings to specify the negative voltage offsets, but if you specify even a tiny offset (30-40mv, for example) and have the undervolting protection enabled, the system will be very slow.","xmg [described a similar issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/xmg_gg/comments/10qveay/launch_xmg_neo_e23_with_rtx_40_and_intel_core/), but in their case the system wasn't able to boot even with the minimal 30mv undervolt.",the cpu locks the clocks to 400mhz.,"it's not an issue with a cpu, because i reached -150mv before on the same system and had zero issues on the previous bios version.","also, tools like throttlestop and hwinfo show that there are no voltage offsets applied.",i've seen a similar behavior on other systems.,the intel cep was enabled in all cases (on the old and new bios).,i've checked that as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
should undervolting be possible on b660 boards?,lots of mixed information about that i find too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it depends on a vendor.,i've found [a confirmation](https://www.reddit.com/r/overclocking/comments/10ojbbq/comment/j6hj4gj/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that the undervolt protection was enabled by default on msi pro z690-a with the 7d25va9 bios update.,so no undervolt there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mind sharing some performance comparisons?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"in a recent blog post about the dx9 perf uplift intel said: ""we use a hybrid approach, i.e., a combination of api techniques, to take advantage of translation layers when a better experience can be delivered using one of our more modern api implementations.",these improvements will be delivered transparently to the end user through our normal driver distribution process.,"thedetails of this implementation may change over time as our dx9 driver evolves. ""","this sounds to me like they use a native driver,and then use an emulation layer  in situations when it can outperform their native driver,and according to op,they switched to dxvk for an emulation layer from d3d9on12(which comes bundled into windows)

intel already heavily invests into the linux drivers.,"in fact, much of the core of mesa (the opengl/vulkan drivers on linux) was created by people working for intel.","[nir, the internal format used by all mesa drivers, was created by intel employees.",](https://www.jlekstrand.net/jason/blog/2022/01/in-defense-of-nir/)  radv (the amd vulkan driver) was based off of anv (the intel vulkan driver).,"given mesa's architecture that emphasizes code sharing between all the drivers, intel's development efforts have substantially impacted every single driver, from intel/amd/nvidia vulkan/opengl drivers, all the way down to opengl(es) drivers for various arm socs.",the linux graphics world owes a lot to intel's development.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"in fact, sometimes dxvk is even faster/better than fully native dx9/10/11 drivers (gta iv is a good example of this).",dxvk is definitely way better than the microsoft-provided d3d9on12 translation layer that intel was using exclusively before.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how would they decide which one to use though?,"is it a per game basis, or decided at runtime.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why is d3d9on12 so slow?,how can it be slower than vulkan?,also kind of weird that intel is still going to make a dx9 driver anyways.,nowadays there are translation layers to vulkan everything.,"you have dxvk for dx9,10 and 11, vkd3d for dx12 and zink for opengl.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the deets!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and they have to optimise for every single game that has ever existed.,it's not a feasible task.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
per game basis.,"popular games get the work first, makes sense",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my guess is this is a matter of priorities.,"microsoft in theory should have the advantage, considering they made directx, while the dxvk project basically had to reverse-engineer it.",d3d9on12 is developed by microsoft as basically life-support for older games on windows.,"i believe they do not have much incentive for improving legacy support, as they are pushing for buying/playing new dx12 games.",dxvk is in contrast an important project for running games on alternative platforms that support vulkan only.,"dxvk is open-source and made by independent community developers and business backed ones (notably valves)

perhaps intel might benefit from adopting dxvk for most dx10 and dx11 games too.",as for dx12 intels driver seems to be okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah per game basis definitely seems to be the case considering what the team has talked about in prior videos and putting such an emphasis on csgo in this one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yep.,"every game uses the apis different when you're talking about older ones like dx9, apparently.",so they can't just go and do a base line optimization.,"and it's not like they only did one or two at a time, either.","they showed what looked like over a dozen, including league of legends.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"technically true, but it's only really developed by ms.  dxvk is funded by valve but also sees significant community contributions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also since it's part of the driver you don't have to worry about games detecting dxvk as a potential cheat and banning you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"given that the evo can cool up to 150w, i'd say you're fine with it as is, providing you aren't gonna run intensive benchmarks for long periods of time or overclock, but more cooling never hurts.","so yeah, no need to undervolt or anything like it.",keep the workload light and you'll be fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you need to limit the power draw its not possible for aio to cool 300w,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
any aio is going to struggle with cooling a chip that is drawing 300+ watts like that.,"i can get my 10900k to draw 330w with a custom loop and it still hits 88-92c in a cinebench run, and i am using a really good water block (heatkiller) and with a flow rate cranked up.",aios don't usually have higher flow rates.,"flow rate does make a difference on component temps if you are going from a low flow rate (0.5 gpm or lower) to a medium/high flow rate (0.75 gpm or higher), so i'm not sure what the typical lf 420 flow rate is, but there's definitely a lower ceiling to its cooling power when compared with a custom loop.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cpu bend is unlikely the cause but did you install with a contact frame?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did your aio come with the lga1700 mount included?,friend of mine purchased one and it wasn't included.,retailer here in aus also lists the lga 1700 kit not being included.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you absolutely should not be anywhere near 100c.,"also, the aio you have is the same one i plan on buying.","i would carefully remove the video card, and gently remove the pump.","i would clean the thermal past, use alcohol and clean both the surface of the cpu and the surface of the cold plate on the pump.",apply a new thin line of past and then reapply the pump.,make sure you stagger the corners when tightening down the pump.,"of course, i am sure you already know to do this.","but, 100c is not right.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

achieve what?,set power limit to intel's suggested 253w and done,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whats the option called for that specific motherboard in the bios to adhere to pl2 out of curiosity?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
does this disable anything else?,or does this just get rid of the voltage increase?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hi, thanks so much again!",could you possibly give the same instrutions but for a gigabyte arous z790 master?,i'm very hesitant to change bios unless i have total clarity on what i'm tweaking.,thanks again!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
asus boards have both lga1200 and 1700 holes but if i remember correctly the lga1700 kit has shorter standoffs allowing for higher mounting pressure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"hey, 
thanks, mate.",it's weird - i undervolted mine from the bios but it looks different.,i had a menu where i selected adaptive mode and then chose minus as an offset.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
on some boards (asus) you can do a global offset somewhere.,"itâ€™s considered less good since you donâ€™t want too much offset at the lowest frequencies but can drop it more for the top ones (or give it a boost if you are using a different undervolt method (ac/dc loadline, for instance) and need more power at the top).",the global offset can be also be done in the windows tool intel xtu which allows testing of oc settings without having to reboot each time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i ended up running stock with some ram oc.,6000->6600... i mean the difference is so small and i can offset most with stock.,just remove all limits and it performs like an f1 car.,this is at least until i sort out the water block issue.,i have unfortunately a water block contact issue.,i started with tg contact frame but it was uneven contact and some p cores up to 10c hotter.,"i then today reverted to stock ilm, and that has made it worse.",even at -.0095v offset  some p cores (half cpu) gets to 100c.,in cb r23.,the water block is one of the most expensive out there: ek quantum magnitude rgb so its incredible disappointing!,also to take apart the pc all the time!,i'm just done for it!,this is a great example of buying the most expensive don't give best results!,the water block is convex designed for intel concave ihs.,but top half cpu just does not give contact and worse with ilm.,i reseated all 3 times.,so this is bs.. i am gonna write to ek and hear what they say.,"there is the possibility to lap the ihs, use contact frame again with correct screws but then i will have to buy a new cold plate for the water block that's perfectly flat and all these toy exchange parts for this block are very expensive!",its just a principle for me that out of the box it performs bad considered it should be among the best and most expensive!,i am mad now!,:)   i am going into a think box atm haha!,:)  but otherwise its an awesome cpu no doubt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you reach that limit with custom loop?,i have never seen such limit with a cpu waterblock but it's good to know.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

looks like limiting power draw to 253w rather than auto helped me keep my cpu at around 80 with about the same results   https://youtu.be/bwq7k7ledse,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you make sure to run cinebench on default settings with mce turned off for 30 minutes to allow your system to calibrate itself to be overclocked by the ai feature?,i also found in asus boards that under monitor and then q-configuration having the ai cooling feature on helps as well.,you can always set a custom curve through whatever software you use.,i use i-cue which fucking blows but it is what it is.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah.,7980xe skylake-x meme cpu owner.,delided.,"if i go 4.8+ ghz allcore, then the cpu can get pretty toasty, 1x 420mm and 2x 360mm rads.","when i had only the 420mm with one 120mm then you could feel the heat coming out of them so the rad space was not enough but since i swapped the 120mm one with 2x 360mm rads then the temps got slightly better and i was getting cool air from them yet the cpu was still almost thermal throttling, cpu block heat transfer limit.","tried different thermal compounds, offsets, pressure yet the cpu block surface can trasfer only as much heat.",must be said that this is only for a 300+w situations to where i can see only the 13900k getting with unlimited power limit or maybe even 7950x.,"pretty easy to spot, if you are getting hot air out of rads then you need more surface, if you are getting cool air and you still have really high temps then you hit the cpu block thermal transfer limit.",7980xe oced could pull a 400-500 wats no prob.,i am ditching it now for 13900k/7950x still deciding.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the dissipation of the cpu is actually 250w, so i don't think it's a mounting issue.",i just did configure the fans to speed up after 30c water (with an aquacomputer quadro controller) and it immediately makes a huge difference if the fans start to spin up  (i have 6 fans in push/pull on the radiator).,think the mounting is ok. the paste and pressure seems very evenly.,i even mounted it with proper torque-wrenches etc (and a bit more or less mounting pressure doesn't even matter).,"&#x200b;

i think, it's the block combined with too little flow of the pump.",that's why i was asking if and why you thought a custom loop could be better compared to the aio.,is a custom block and separate pump/resevoir really that much better than a aio pump-block?,and by how much?,i'd like to know before making the investment :p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

interesting thread!,just received my tr frame and will spend some time tinkering.,"i have a lot of experience with custom loops, oc, etc., but at some point, i decided the 12th gen are fast enough not to bother and got lackadaisical thinking that with aio and stock turbo settings my 12900k will run cool enough.",(iâ€™m sure it did not) then without doing any research i bought the 13900ks popped it in and the whole shebang crashed hard on the first benchmark lol.,"so, the journey begins since i purchased 13900ks from newegg which does not offer refunds.",otherwise i might have reconsidered.,1. turning off asus multicore enhancement stabilized my system but throttles heavily after about 20 seconds of cr23 with mid 36k score after 10 minutes.,2. try the thermalright frame and some voltage tunning.,tight setup at the moment and really do not wish to disassemble the case to install it.,iâ€™ll first see if some hot glue will hold ilm backplate in place.,any other creative suggestions?,3. upgrade my corsair 4000d / h115i to phanteks evolv x / 420 aio or maybe a custom loop.,(itâ€™s a hobby after all),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you think a board thatâ€™s still considered consumer class need to be self tuned by the end user to not break spec?,by default should be normal restrictions.,any ocâ€™ing and power target adjustments should be a feature only enabled and adjusted by the user.,i donâ€™t know why this isnâ€™t considered the same realm as overclocking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was under the impression disabling mce also disabled turbo boost?,if you disable mce  can the cpu all core boost to 5.5ghz(13900k as an example),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

agreed.,it seems like the lf ii can't exchange the amount of heat that cpu puts out when suddenly ramped up to full load almost like the cold plate is overwhelmed or something.,probably not enough mass in the cooler to draw the head from the cpu.,too much wattage for the aio to handle i guess.,i think i am going to go with a direct die setup at some point soon.,the ek / der8auer setup looks promising.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"this is very interesting, thanks for reply.",while i do have better contact with the contact frame than these pictures (no 1 does not look good haha !),i think itâ€™s interesting that you use another frame and has kind of same results because people say this or that works better.,but i will conclude that itâ€™s not the frames it self but something else!,i suspect the screws being to short for my frame as it only just i can reach threading making it possible it not tight even.,but when stock ilm also do it and even worse it must be the cpu and or water block.,"i think the water block at least mine should cover the length of the ihs, and i so far learned that there will be a diff between coldest and hottest core for up to say 7c like yours?",but mine 10-11c is to much i think.,there is also possibility for bad solder under ihs like you say.,i remember my 10900k also had this problem to some degree.,what of your cores are hottest?,my no 5 is top hot and 4 after i think.,1 and 2 coldest.,some say that itâ€™s always core 5 etc.,but i donâ€™t know ?,are your water block also convex?,i actually had great results with the contact frame and the block even when top did not contact.,i just missed the edge on the hot cores for max oc.,5.7/4.5 was under 95c.,but now with ilm it is not acceptableâ€¦so i am thinking of either try to turn water block 180 degrees then the not covered part would be the integrated graphics.,"but i think iâ€™ll go all in and lap and get the flat cold plate, i just want it perfect and know this block can do it if contact is perfect.",i just think it will end up in quite some customization and fiddling and break warranty haha but i want this to be top notchâ€¦.,.,"i have a thick 360 rad with 6 fans push pull but the case is open , distrocase 350p and itâ€™s plenty it stays pretty cool when setup correctly

afaik it's best to go for a custom loop when you want to go with direct die cooling.,i only know of the ek velocity water block which is compatible - but i am not sure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is what you would need for a 10900k: [https://rockitcool.myshopify.com/products/10th-gen-direct-to-die-frame](https://rockitcool.myshopify.com/products/10th-gen-direct-to-die-frame)you probably would need a compatible waterblock and would have to do a custom loop.,i wouldn't bother personally since the 10900k is so old.,you'd be basically just as well off applying some protectant to the outer caps and then using liquid metal and re-adding the heat spreader.,then just install the cpu like normal and use your old cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there was [one](https://youtube.com/watch?v=n4o_dq3xrja&si=ensikaiecmiomare) reviewed on a linus tech tips episode a few years ago.,i don't mind lapping heat spreaders but that's a bit beyond my comfort zone.,if your kraken x61 is an aio (i don't know what that is) i would suggest you'll get much more effective cooling by swapping to a custom loop with a large radiator and a d5 pump.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
direct die is standard.,it is a standard thing in most laptops.,"when they do a direct die, the laptop screws are (1) tiny, (2) they use 3 instead of 4 mostly, and (3) they reduce the torque by having the screws spaced far apart and connected via a thin metal.",this way it transfers very little downward force.,they used to use springs under the screws too.,never had issue with that.,but they've replaced springs with much simpler thin metal spaced apart.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because silicon is very fragile and even with full proof mounting designs people will manage to break the die and blame everyone but themselves.,just not worth it for 99% of diy consumers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

well i guess what i'm saying is that there's no point in spending so much time and effort on doing something like this when you aren't going to get performance close to modern stuff.,unless you are just doing it for fun.,i mean a delid tool and direct die frame combined are going to be north of $100 and you are going to get very little in return.,if you are doing it to the latest and greatest maybe it makes more sense but not for something that's 3 generations old.,so it's old for this application.,it's not that old in general i guess.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm torn on it.,"on the one hand, selling the cpu and getting a new 13th gen one costs probably the same as a new cooling solution and will bring the same if not more performance for the money.","at the same time, delidding a 3year old cpu is a lot more safe than a brand new one.","if you do it because you're interested, i would even advise you to not use the latest and greatest that you bought with your own money.",i'm just surprised that op delidded his cpu without doing proper research about what to do next.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

lol i have a 12900k and it is normal under 50-70% load on all cores.,often 90-100% on all cores.,what are you talking about?,actually many programms using more cores.,not only r20/r23 uses it.,mining is dead.. my theory is people like you only use 1% off that what is possible with technic...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
usually 4 to 6 cores seems like enough.,donâ€™t see the point in these cpuâ€™s with insane core counts like the xeon and threadripper.,"but still would love to  build a xeon/threadripper/epyc machine someday, if i can get the money for such a build.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you tried it with the direct die water pumps?,"and then there is also die lapping, which seems extreme.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would prefer an aio but cannot find ones compatible with direct die compatibility.,so it looks like iâ€™ll just have to build one.,i want to overclock my cpu to 5ghz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes it does have 2 extra cores and costs around the same amount.,but doesnâ€™t that run at 3.7ghz?,iâ€™d probably end up in a similar situation like this trying to overclock it whilst keeping the temps cool.,or just spending the extra on the 12900k.,"but to be honest for my next build i want a xeon, epyc or a threadripper.","a cpu with insane core count, would be nice to own someday as a be done with it kind of build.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™m going to overclock my cpu to 5ghz perhaps even 5.3ghz, so will have to delid it with a proper cooler.","i found the ncorev1 water pump, so iâ€™ll be using that.",thanks for the reply will check out that post.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hang around vr subreddits for a week or so and you'll see it.,"""oh no guys i smashed my controllers into my desk and it's broken!","what can i do???""",followed by a zillion replies recommending to contact the manufacturer and ask for a warranty defect replacement.,it's disgusting.,i used that as an example of how people through their own actions destroy something and then shirk responsibility of the consequences off to the manufacturer to waste resources fixing it.,in the case of cpus i agree with u/prince_melon that if we had bare die products tons of people would break them from reckless installations and then scam the system to get replacements for free.,"same concept, just a different application.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,but a delid and direct die kit are not worth the money.,like at all.,unless you are doing it because you like to tinker.,that's all i'm really saying.,you might drop like 10c at most or gain 100-200mhz.,"again, only makes sense if you like to tinker.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is good you use your cpu.,i am talking about generality.,i mean today the cpus we have available (these past 2 years pretty much) now all have the power of supercomputers and 52 core cpus of the past.,all within these past 2 years.,i don't think the pace of consumer level software (what i was getting at) has reached the point of everyone needing all this compute.,"if you fully utilize your cpu in your workload, that is awesome.",i don't.,"i just model, work on e-mail, pdfs, excel, and web browse.",ocassional phone use.,but nothing that needs 25 to 52 core level of past xeon/threadripper levels of performance.,amd doesn't even have a new threadripper line of cpus coming because the current consumer line has basically overlapped with that workstation class chip.,now all cpus are workstation class.,which is a good thing.,but doesn't mean everyone needs a workstation class cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i fully agree.,it is the sex sells marketing or car salesmen tactic.,"everybody would love a v8 400hp engine, but not many people can fully utilize it.",but you'll always get that one guy that can say that his diesel truck with a v8 and 500 lb-ft of torque is able to haul his 15 foot fishing boat every weekend and he makes full use of it.,while you'll have another guy drive his pristine with a fully covered truck bed never hauled a thing in its' life ford raptor.,truth be told i'll probably get a meteor lake i5 when it launches =d can't wait for something faster than 14nm.,but i know i'll still cap my fps at 60 to keep the gpu from being too loud.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was using a 280mm kraken x62.,with a custom loop the gains would probably be even less since cooling with ambient air becomes less and less effective the lower the temps.,would absolutely not recommend die lapping because if you go too far your chip is toast.,that's only really going to help you with ln2 cooling anyway.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i understand the goal.,i am of the mindset that aio is on par with a solid air cooler.,"if you're trying to overclock hard with direct die cooling, in my mind, you shouldn't even consider an aio",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you might as well buy a 13700k if you are going to go with a 12900k since they are the same price, and you can use a 13700k in a z690 motherboard with a bios update (get a mobo with usb flashback and you can update it from usb without a cpu.)","same cpu, slightly better with more l2 cache.",not much real world difference.,11gen had about a 20% ipc uplift and 12th gen had another 20% which means that at the same clock speeds a 12th gen or 13th gen is about 45% better performance than a 10th gen part.,a 10900 has 10 cores compared to a 12700 that has 8 pcores which are like the previous gen but 4 e cores which are slower and more energy efficient.,the net result however is still a dramatically faster cpu in both gaming and raw benchmarks.,a 10900 in cinebench will pull around 16k compared to the 22k+ even at stock that a 12700 will pull.,"by default the k cpus in 12th and 13th gen always run at their max boost clock with pl1 and pl2 set to max boost power as defined in the intel arc spec, and tau (boost duration) as infinite.","a 12700k will run at 4.7ghz boost as long as it stays within the power and temperatures limits (and you can raise the power limits on the motherboard if it is throttling down to like 4.5, which will of course raise the temps.)",definitely doable on air without an overclock with a contact frame.,a 12700 is actually easier to keep cool than a 10900 as the 10900 can easily pull 250+ watts especially overclocked; a 12700 can be kept cool with the best air towers like a nh-d15s.,12900k / 13700k / 13900k or overclocking should be done on 360mm / 420mm aio or better with a contact frame (contact frame lowers temps by 10c or so on 12th gen as the ilm bends the cpu creating uneven mounting pressure.,"costs like $25) 

if you do decide to go with a custom liquid loop at least a lot of the parts can be reused for when you upgrade.","the reservoir, tubes, fittings, radiator, and pump should all be able to be used again within their shelf life.",it's just the cost of the block you are going to be out.,"it's maybe worth pursuing even staying on your current platform if you want to stay with custom water cooling going forward, but it's a big commitment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i see.,"i don't think they are shirking responsibility as much as, they don't want to pay to fix it even though it is their fault.","i mean, you even see adults steal shit, and even tell and teach their kids that.","this only gets worse as more and more poor uneducated people is produced, because that's what our society has been steered for decades.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah i understand

but you can say the same about modding an old car.","some people just like to do it for fun and then there is the other segment who say cars should remain stock because they will then become a classic... etc...

i get it.","i just wanted to focus on the 3 year old cpu = old comment =p

i also wanted to get everybody's butt out of the sand about cinebench scores and all those super inflated scores.",it is like just more marketing to make you seem like you are using an out of date product.,similar to what we see in the car market.,the salesmen/marketers just keep adding additional extra unnecessary options to inflate the cost of the vehicles.,just as an example (not to start a flame war) but tesla's model series vehicles.,some of them come equipped with twitch.tv or youtube or netflix in those vehicles!,and it's like i don't even like driving that much to begin with !,but it adds to the costs and complexity.,"my 2016/2017 hybrid works just fine to get me from point a to point b.

same thing with suvs and oversized tires and now you have to get awd because you need to go off road etc.... it just becomes some unnecessary thing that forces the consumer to have to buy the next thing.",so in my area you have tons of women and men who drive around in these large lifted suvs/trucks with large offroad tires but the truck is like squeaky clean.,anywho!,i like direct die myself =p it is like a butthole itch that you sometimes just gotta scratch?,you know?,haha like redoing the gpu heatsink paste/pads to get a lower hotspot temp.,just gotta do it =p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes i looked onto it.,itâ€™s mostly done on the 9900k since it has a thick die.,where as the 10900k has a thinner die.,"since i found a direct die water block, i should be good with the rest of the build.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i canâ€™t really be bothered at the moment, iâ€™m not an editor or a renderer, just a gamer.","iâ€™d rather wait to see whatâ€™s in line in the future meteor lake, lunar lake.",a cpu that can truly utilise the power of the newest graphics cards like the rtx 4090. which seems to be bottlenecking even the newest of cpuâ€™s.,i will stick to this build with a 3090. plus iâ€™m more inclined to spend more when going over to an expandable motherboard since they support ddr5 ram aswell as support for 13th gen cpuâ€™s like the 13900k.,"i have a habit of maxing out motherboards, water cooling can also cost more due to multiple kits to purchase when delidding/watercooling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's exactly what they're doing, they're avoiding their responsibility to resolve the problem themselves and offloading that cost to the manufacturer.",i just despise seeing it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for sure.,i delidded a 7960x and cooled it direct die style with an aio for a while.,it was pretty fun but yet it made no difference really lol.,i kind of want to direct die cool one of the new 7000 series processors cause i have an am5 board now but i don't think there are any frames yet :(,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"xmg here, thanks for linking to our announcement thread in op.",a few points for clarification and a timeline.,"**ancient past**

* voltage offset used to be unlocked on h-series cpus for ages
* after plundervolt (2019), intel [sent out guidance](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00289.html) to oems that they hide voltage offset from bios because safety first.",some oems followed suite.,"**2020**

* on clarification, intel confirmed to us in 2020 that we are still free to offer voltage offset if we understand and carry the risks, which we did.",* we published [this article](https://www.igorslab.de/en/undervolting-on-intel-laptops-in-2020-this-is-what-you-need-to-know-xmg-support/) on igor's lab with our official guidance based on intel core 10th gen h-eries (comet lake).,"**2021**

* with intel core 11th gen h-series (tiger lake), we introduced a fallback mechanism where the ec firmware can automatically reset all bios tuning options if the system fails to boot (post) multiple times due to inappropriate voltage offset or memory tuning values.",this fallback mechanism could also be triggered via hotkey (ctrl+b during cold boot).,this made undervolting via bios setup 100% safe and convenient for our users.,"please note, runtime undervolting (via xtu or throttlestop) is cumbersom on laptops because the laptop oem performance profiles (required for fan control and battery life) often overwrite such runtime tunings.","undervolting in bios setup is a more convenient, permanent ""fire & forget"" solution once you found your voltage offset sweet spot.","**2022**

* with 12th gen, intel moved all ""h-series"" (marketing name) to the ""alder lake p"" platform (technology platform), where voltage offset msr inbox was fused off, just like it was in previous u- and p-series cpus (e.g.","i7-1165g7, i7-11370h).","exception: i9-12900hk still allowed the msr inbox, despite being otherwise the same silicon as i7-12700h or i9-12900h.","* we have started to roll-out bios update to some of our 12th gen h-series to unlock ""ac loadline"" as a less powerful alternative to undervolting.","* in the same year (2022), intel introduced 12th gen hx-series, based on desktop chips.","codename: alder lake sbga (""s"" stands for desktop).",voltage offset was unlocked.,"**2023**

* when we learned of [hp's announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/hpomen/comments/yejp66/qa_for_vbs_and_impact_to/) about blocking runtime voltage offset, we contacted intel as a precaution.","this was still relatively low-key for us, because we felt safe in having voltage offset in bios setup (i.e.",not at runtime).,"* in 2023, 13th gen (raptor lake) continues the hx line-up, and voltage offset was still unlocked.","however, suddenly our odm partner advised us as follows:
   * the uncoming bios version will remove the â€œvoltage offsetâ€ option, because ""voltage offset"" values will affect bios update procedures when using ami's bios update tool (afuefi64, afuwin64).","it will cause a sudden ""power off"" crash.","* we tried -30mv, we tried -50mv, use afuefi64, afuefi64cap, afuwin64cap, all will have problems.","this is very dangerous, if ""power off"" crash occurs during a bios update process.",* we have announced that we will not be able to offer voltage offset in our raptor lake hx flagship models and that we are still pushing our odm partner and ami for a solution.,"* after now reading this write-up by op, we have contacted our intel contacts about this issue with additional urgency.","* we also read [this statement](https://boringtextreviews.com/2023/02/02/intels-lex-hoyos-clarifies-the-situation-with-undervolting/) from intel's lex hoyos, but it does not address the sudden stability issues that our odm partner encountered with the voltage offset options in bios setup on ami, so the issue is still unresolved for us.","**our position towards industry partners:**

* we want to allow undervolting for end-users as long as it provides performance-per-watt benefits.",* we are able to mitigate any risks and educate our customers about how to apply voltage offset without risking system stability (i.e.,"small steps, some testing, fallback mechanisms for system recovery).",* under our corporate nda we seek guidance from intel to educate us about how to offer reasonable tuning options via bios setup in a safe and orderly fashion on both ami and insyde bios.,we are currently uncertain as to how this is going to develop.,"so we are not able to promise to our customers that voltage offset will come back in our intel core 13th gen hx-series flagship  laptops, despite having committed all of our volume to the unlocked intel core i9-13900hx in this generation due to its superior thread count, cache size and ddr5-5600 memory support.",you can find us on [our discord server](https://discord.gg/xzykwqf) for further discussion or for sharing further insights on this issue.,a community member on discord pointed out this thread to us.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

how exactly can this have negative consequences?,when undervolting you are actively decreasing the stability through your actions.,how is it possible for the prevention of something that inherently decreases stability also decrease stability?,"that would suggest that undervolting can be a necessary for system stability...

undervolting is not good actually based on my limited experience.,i have desktop 9900k and 2x 10980xe which i tinker alot.,"when you undervolt, like when you overclock, it requires thorough stress test.","however we all know that most people will go with whatever they are comfortable with like few runs of cinebench, never test avx-2, let alone avx-512 because they are running too hot, etc.",so in a sense we are reducing the stability.,"with all of my cpus, it looks stable with -0.1v for gaming and daily task but with thorough stress test even with small -0.02v offset it will have eventual error running linpack xtreme let alone when you also overclock the cache.",donâ€™t forget that negative offset is affecting stability more on lower speed ratios than the higher ratio let alone max cpu boost.,for example with 1.4v at 5.0 ghz you would have room to offset by -0.1v to 1.3v total.,however with 0.8v at 1.2ghz that -0.1v offset is too much and will leads to instability during idle or transient.,"so i would say if you really need to lower power consumption, do it by lowering the max boost clock or better yet using power limit.",there is reason the vid is programmed at that value.,"sure there is small safety margin for error included but you can find that it is not much, like 0.015v in my experience with all my intel cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the whole undervolting fad is foolish and pointless,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in my opinion, this is an important feature to have enabled for most\* end users (95% to 99%) with the power users not majorly affected.",because the option is still there to enable it again.,the vast majority of users do not understand how to maintain laptop battery health.,and will routinely charge to 100% and hold it for a prolonged time or they discharge the battery down to 0% regularly.,this will over long term degrade the battery performance and lead to a drop in voltage.,"same thing with a car's battery, over time the lead acid battery will no longer beable to provide you 12v.",typically a good one will provide 13v and a bad one will dip to 11.5v.,cold weather will cause the battery to under perform as well.,back to the point.,when you undervolt and you have a degraded laptop battery (most users do not regularly measure their laptop battery voltage output) you can have a laptop that may not boot overtime.,"and most users don't service their own machines, they often take it to a specialist tech.","the tech many not know that a particular user has ""undervolted"" their cpu and will spend hours trying to diagnosis this issue.",anyway i think this is overblown and the rant is too long and spans multiple posts for some reason.,it isn't a blocked feature via your reference links to the official intel response.,"you can enable it if you'd like, but know that battery degradation is real and if the cpu has a degraded battery and is undervolted, the issue will crop up in the future.",most users will not be able to diagnosis this issue.,since most users don't regularly adjust their under volt.,it is a set and forget feature.,on desktop pc this is a non-issue since it has a steady supply of constant power.,no power fluctuations.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thank you, tom!",i have a similar experience with the bios provided by dell on xps 17 with core i9 12900hk.,"i think, the same is true for alienware systems using the same cpu.","the undervolting options (offsets) are still present in bios, but require enabling the **overclocking feature** in order to work properly.","if i specify the 40mv negative voltage offset, the cpu switches to a very weird safe-mode.",it drops the clocks to 400 mhz and sets nearly 0.7v voltage.,the new undervolting protection feature is enabled and there's no hidden setting or efi variable to disable it.,on the previous bios version with 0x41b intel's microcode the same system was fully stable with 150mv negative voltage offset.,"as for other devices like dell precision 7670 and 7770 with core i9 hx, the undervolting works and the undervolting protection setting is in the bios, but hidden.","if you try to enable it using efi variable modification, the performance also decreases significantly.",it looks like the current bios version is shipped with the old intel's microcode.,"on top of that, i saw similar messages from some desktop users.",the symptoms are nearly the same: bios update -> disable undervolting protection -> significant performance drop.,"i'm not aware of cases, when the device was bricked, but it's not excluded, because the voltage offsets are applied in the beginning of the device initialization before efi (pre-efi or pei stage).","i hope, this information will help you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"you can still undervolt from the bios, but op doesn't like that they will have to go to the bios.",>intel states that the undervolting will still be available from the bios and is not affected by the new undervolt protection feature.,"they claim that ""adjusting voltages from bios is ... more dangerous"", dangerous how?",who knows,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there's no h-series desktop cpus.,undervolting is available on hk and hx laptop cpus.,"on h-series laptop cpus it is disabled since 12th gen.

"yes, if you undervolt your cpu too much, you may experience some stability issues, obviously.",that's why it's important to do appropriate testing during this process.,"on the flip side, i can't consider system constantly running 90+ degrees celsius as stable, just because the manufacturer decided to put more voltage to the cpu.",here's a real example with top precision 7670 and 7770 devices: [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68rcek3l0os).,they throttle almost instantly when you open a start menu.,this problem was quietly fixed only in december.,undervolting helps resolving this issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you use intel xtu or apply offsets through bios?,do you have the undervolt protection enabled?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"undervolting through bios is for noobs ðÿ¤£

from my experience two 12900hk samples were able to achieve -0.15v and -0.14v undervolt while passing prime95 and occt testing.,"let's do some very rough math and assume, that the chip is running on 2.8ghz, 1.0v voltage, and consumes 45w of power (typical laptop pl1).","if we lower the voltage by 0.15v, there will be two edge-case options:

1. we can lower the power consumption to (0.85 \* 0.85) / (1 \* 1) \* 45 = 32.5w while running on the same frequency.",2. we can run it on the higher frequency with the same amount of power (the same frequency as we had when we apply 62.3w of power).,"by default, the laptop will use the second option and we may have \~15% performance boost.","if we decrease the pl1 to 32.5w, we will get the same performance as we get without undervolting and 45w power limit.",the difference between 45w and 32.5w is nearly 10 degrees c and clearly audible.,"the laptop will generate much less noise (\~5 dba, usually).","your concerns about working on lower frequencies are correct, but you can adjust the v/f curve and specify some voltage boost for low frequencies.","in this case, you will be able to achieve even bigger undervolting on high frequencies.",classic voltage offsets actually shift the whole v/f curve.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh yeah, deep-throat that boot!","there you go, just like that.",good consumer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
undervolting is already disabled by default using features like memory integrity.,"we don't need another feature blocking it :)

as for the battery health, the undervolting has a positive impact on that: lower device temperatures, lower power consumption during light loads, etc.","actually, undervolting is the only good way to make a laptop work better, generate less noise and throttle less.","as for the intel's statement that the undervolting through bios will be still working, it completely depends on the motherboard manufacturers now.",some of them can't make it work with the new microcode update from intel.,"also, in the case of undervolting through bios, it is way more dangerous and can brick the device.","it's not a big issue on the desktop motherboards, where you can relatively easy clear the settings.","but on the laptops, it's the problem.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"on the new microcode and inside sdk, if you specify a tiny 30mv offset, the cpu will be locked to 400 or 3600 mhz.","the performance, obviously, will be lower.",on the ami sdk the system won't boot at all.,that's why xmg decided to remove the undervolting functionality from their 13th gen devices till this issue is fixed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hp and xmg were talking about laptop undervolting.,desktop undervolting is a different beast.,maybe you could say more about your exact system to narrow down the issue.,youâ€™ve cast your net too wide and confusing vastly different chips by mixing desktop and laptop.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i wrote wrong, i meant k , maybe on basic boards, on msi and gigabyte it's still possible.","while the  overvolt , potentially dangerous, is allowed?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i use both bios and xtu.,undervolt protection is disabled to do undervolt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, asus might simply disable this option by default.",there's no valid reasons to have it enabled.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the thing is that is not the case with reality.,the lowest voltage we can activate a silicon diode is at 0.6-0.7v.,now cpu is usually running at ~0.7v at lowest ratio (my 10980xe now in front of me is running 0.732v at x8).,if you give it negative offset of -0.15v then it will never be stable at idle.,well i donâ€™t have cpu with adjustable v/f curve and that may work if you can let it stay at above 0.7v when idle but as i say try linpack xtreme instead of prime95 because it switched between sse and avx.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the reply and link.,have a good weekend!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hp is talking about the mobile and desktop devices.,"as for xmg, the mobile hx cpus are exactly the same as regular desktop skus.","internally, they use excactly the same s efi toolkit.","in a broader perspective, the laptop and desktop efi are using the same sdk from intel, insyde, ami, etc.. there are some platform-specific code, but it's tiny.",all other parts the same.,there's no reason to create and support separate sdks for different platforms.,you can even find a recent uefi leak from lenovo (intel + insyde sdk) and check it by yourself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it depends on the particular board and the intel microcode (bios version).,there's no restrictions for positive voltage offsets.,"at least, i did not find that in the latest intel docs.","at the same time, the cpu has restrictions on the minimal and maximal voltage and features like ia cep, but they mostly protect the cpu.","in a broader perspective, there are a few way to implement that type of restrictions:

\- **soft**

in this case the motherboard vendor simply hides some overclocking or undervolting settings from the bios.","the settings are still there and working, but a regular customer can't change them in the bios.",a good example here is the laptop undervolting.,it can be enabled by modifying some settings directly in the nvram.,i saw the overclocking settings on a lot of different laptop bios.,they are usually disabled or hidden.,"but if you try to enable them, they might work :)

\- **mixed**

in this case there's no hardware lock, but there's no setting either.",it sometimes happens with some new settings like undervolting protection.,"\- **hard**

in this case the intel's microcode will ignore them in bios even if you found a way to change them.",a good example here is the undervolting support on h-series cpus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, and that's why there are a few types of voltage protections.","the cpu won't request vid, that smaller or higher than some predefined values.","also, there's a feature called ia cep.","if you go from 0.9-1.4 (typical voltages for 12900hk with 45w pl1 and 115w pl2), to 0.75-1.25v, the cpu will work within the acceptable voltage range and you can get all the undervolting benefits.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sorry.,hadn't had a chance to reboot yet.,"in my z690 aorus master f23a bios it's under tweaker, advanced voltage settings, cpu/vrm settings, and then cpu vcore current protection.",mine is on the default of auto.,on previous bios (f20) it didn't matter what i set that to in bios.,windows wouldn't let me under volt in intel xtu.,now i can.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hp \_is\_ talking about mobile and desktop.,they're literally the worst oem when it comes to uefi bios settings.,literally everything is stripped.,want to run system in legacy mode for an older os?,"fu, not even listed.",i take the chance to let people know everytime.,i wouldn't buy one of their desktops.,the laptops i guess they have some justification (although msi allows unlocking advanced bios/xmp/undervolting where able) but hp does it to all of their systems.,"check out ""universalamdformbrowser"" if you're really curious about the underpinnings, though.",be advised some uefi bios do not save all their settings in cmos.,"some are on the chip..so, if you for example turned xmp on a lenovo legion laptop and set frequency ridiculously high so it bootloops...well, cmos clearing won't fix this.",bios reflash only.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
link documentation showing hp was talking about uv desktop chips causing crashing.,laptop and desktop are not remotely the same platforms.,it would clarify a lot once you realize this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"on gigabyte desktop 12th and msi laptop 11th i have the latest bios and everything works perfectly, on asus tuf laptop instead you can no longer undervolt with the latest bios.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well you can under volt that much i guess itâ€™s because of the lower cpu temp while intel and i think their way is the correct way is to set the voltage while the cpu at itâ€™s max temp (slightly below throttling).,hence when temp is much lower you can enjoy those extra voltage reduction however this will introduce instability when temp rises for some reason.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks man for the follow up!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
laptops and prebuilt pcs often have a very limited bios.,"xmg, lenovo legion, msi, sometimes asus, and some other vendors do a good job here offering more settings out of the box.","in some cases, there's an advanced bios mode with even more settings.","at the same time there's an option to disassemble the bios firmware and get access to all the settings, including voltage offsets, v/f curves and other stuff.","all those settings are pretty similar across different devices, because they are based on the same sdk from intel.",vendors usually avoid making a lot of customizations there.,"yes, sometimes there are some issues with changing efi variables on lenovo thinkpads, but it's rather an exception than a rule.","and yes, it's also available on hp.","but even enthusiasts rarely go that deep in their tuning and simply accept the fact, that undervolting is locked on their devices.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are not correct.,"from the developer's standpoint, desktops and laptops are mostly the same.",this approach is easier for intel and easier for vendors and their partners.,there's no need to spend double or triple the amount of resources to support and develop separate sdk and tooling.,"there are the same settings, the same variable names, the same pei code, the same dxe, and other modules.",the fact that you see more settings on the desktop bios compared to the laptop one does mean nothing.,ui is the tip of the iceberg.,"and if you don't see some settings, it does not mean that they are missing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"fortunately, 11th gen systems are not affected.","as for the asus laptop, we need to check in the undervolting was blocked by the new intel undervolting protection feature.",you can do that using hwinfo64.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are not correct.,"from a silicon design standpoint, they are absurdly not the same, and the challenges you are seeing with bios corruption while undervolted are precisely the result when you try to make them the same.",it only looks the same to you because you have no clue what youâ€™re talking about lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the undervolting protection feature was enabled both for desktop and mobile platforms and controlled by 195h msr (or mailbox 0x195, like developers call it).","check the new intel's sdm, vol.",4 from december 2022).,you may find a link in the post.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've been able to apply the -0.15v voltage offset on the old bios and get 15% performance boost in cb r23 mt.,after the update and the new intel microcode if i apply a tiny -0.04v offset through bios my device is working in the fail-safe mode with 400 mhz locked clock.,did i get the new silicon with the bios update?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok and how does that affect what i said?,"you developers tried to make them the same when theyâ€™re different beasts, and now you get to try and fix issues like bios corruption due to undervolting lol.","just because you guys want to make them 1 register, doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s actually the same thing lmao.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that was not the question lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yup.,normal.,try upping your fancurve a bit.,i used to get 90c package temp with peaks of 95-97c but after upping the curve i get 85 package temp.,but max peaks still will hit 90-93c on the hotter cores.,the cpu will not throttle until 100c unless your motherboard specifies 90c limit.,this is with stock 253 limit by the way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
check out the sensors in hwinfo to see what's throttling your cpu.,you should get 5.3 ghz and 4.1 ghz on your p and e cores respectively.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"5.1ghz is likely the all-core boost, that's not throttling.","if you think it's too hot, maybe consider contact frame?","thermalright has a pretty cheap one for $13 while thermal grizzly has a more accurate one for $45, but iirc gamers nexus didn't find much of a difference between the two.","but if it's only during cinebench and you aren't always maxing out the cores, then you're probably fine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it may also throttle because of your vrm.,pay attention to mosfet temps in hwinfo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you could have a poor mount.,or try putting the z73 fan header into the aio_pump header on the board instead of the cpu fan header.,iâ€™ve seen certain boards not supply the same voltage between the headers.,your pump speeds should be over 2000rpm under load-check that in cam.,with all aioâ€™s i would recommend wiping off the stock thermal paste and using your own on the cpu.,my x63 with a 13700k doesnâ€™t ever go beyond 90c package temp and my cpu will boost to 5300mhz.,what is your cb r23 score?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"edit, if you are getting p cores that are throttling, then that's not good.","you didn't give us a very good screenshot with your stats, so it's hard to tell what's going on.","90â° is fine, but if it's throttling p3, p5 and p7 to stay there then you either need to try to repaste the aio pump or set power limits.",your all core turbo boost multiplier is lower than even stock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it depends, how long it takes to throttle.",if its like instant then yes itâ€™s a problem.,i had exact similar issue and had to put contact frame to resolve it.,"it was throttling as soon as i was clicking start, now it throttles on 3 or 4th run.",i was getting score of 28k on 13900k but everyone else was hitting 40k so i kinda knew it is a problem.,"as soon as i installed contact frame and extreme grease from thermal grizzly, all issues were gone.",i got the score that everyone else were getting while temps were great.,definitely compare your score with others to understand how well it is performing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"90-91 is fine, i usually get 90 on cpu, 110 for package while pressuring it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
get thermalright contact frame!,makes a huge differenceâ€”probably only half of your heatsink is making contact,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have the same configuration.,the cpu temp in the second i start cinebench jump to 100 and trigger the thermal throttle.,maybe the aio is bedly mounted?,as additional info in gaming the temperature never exceed the 85 c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
may want to check your power limits in your bios.,running a z690 mpg edge and it was running unlimited wattage giving me some similar temps with a tg contact frame and mx6 paste on a 360 aio.,dropped it down the limit to 253w and i stay under 80c in game.,cinebench peaks briefly at 87 on startup but as soon as my fans catch-up temps stay under 80 on a multicore load.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
awesome thank you!,appreciate it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
does the high temperatures of 95 plus degrees reduce the life of the cpu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would there be a specific alert?,iâ€™m new to hwinfo64,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no 13700kf is 5.3ghz all-core boost on p-cores.,he's thermal throttling if it's dropping down to 5.1ghz.,very common you might have mce on or some other motherboard feature that is aggressively overvolting the cpu causing much higher power draw.,i turned that off on my asus board and my 13700k no longer hits \~260w under cinebench.,it's more like 190w now and no longer throttles.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, raptor lake's turbo boost is different from previous generations.","single core and all core boost now share the same frequency, minus the ""best cores"", tvb so the all core turbo should be 5.3 ghz for p cores and 4.2 ghz for e cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for the insight!,iâ€™m using one currently from thermal grizzly!,only during cinebench,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,degradation doesnâ€™t start until 115c.,the cpu throttles at 100c to make sure that doesnâ€™t happen.,if this was 3-5 years ago then it would be a different story but these cpus are able to handle high voltage and high temps without reducing life.,and laptop cpus have been running high temps 90-100c for at least 10 or so years.,amd and intel made it so the cpu will boost until 95c for amd and 100c for intel.,anyone that says high temps are dangerous are living in the past and is wrong.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

itâ€™s a damn shame they canâ€™t compete with nvidia and amd in a key feature of any hardware product: stability.,"of course, there are some edge cases and some everyone-cases.","they are showing as a productive and hardworking division, which is what they need, so there is hope.",but thatâ€™s all that: hope.,"unless youâ€™re playing the mainstream products, or you donâ€™t have gpu stock, these are not _bad_.",i would still recommend and console for those wanting to play something until the market goes to normal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i want oculus vr and airlink support,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
an overlay only really makes sense to me when you're in game and want to bring up the recording/streaming/hw info elements via a shortcut like nvidia does - outside of such it should just be a normal piece of software.,also i'm not fully voiced in this but having two separate programmes for one card sounds a little awkward - maybe they should be combined.,will be upgrading to arc a770 soon from my 6 or so year old 1070 so hoping these get resolved.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i can't wait to buy an intel gpu in 2 generations once they've closed the stability/support gap.,"i expected alchemist to be rough but i was still disappointed by how common the issues were even in the ""good"" titles, but with his quickly they've been improving i have no doubt they'll be substantially better in 3 years or so.",hopefully intel can give nvidia a reason to price their products competitively like amd hasn't been able to.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i am generally interested in your thought process when you purchased an arc while owning a valve index.,"i mean, they seem to be conflicting pieces of hardware in my mind.",the headsets a high end pcvr headset requiring a fast capably machine with exceptionally well tuned drivers and the arc is medicore performance with anything but finally tuned drivers.,did you genuinely expected it to work well together?,im not having a go or anything im just curious how you ended up willingly with such a pairing?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah, from your comment it looks like a thermal issue.",you can check the temperature limits in the bios but tjmax should be 100c.,there could be some kind of soft limit for temperature which slows it down a bit when going over 95c.,cpus also lose quite a lot of efficiency when running very hot.,however at 224w the 29k result is normal and that is a good amount of power for an air cooler.,so you can also just ignore all this.,i would set the max package power to 220w to avoid thermal throttling at all and if you want to increase performance you can look at setting a small negative voltage offset.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"faced similar issue, idle temps were too high, while gaming it was hitting 90. i had to install contact frame and repaste the cpu with thermal grizzly extreme.",now idle temps are 30-40 and while gaming 55-65.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for the quick response and yeah it seems normal from what i have looked at but the idle temps seem a bit high for this cooler.,i had a previous pc that was prebuilt and the pump went out and caused thermal throttling and i think permanent damage.,i built this new system from scratch so i am overthinking a bit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think you need to somehow manually adjust your cooler - it seems it does not kick in under low load / temps.,"i got same cpu and air cooler ( noctua nh-d15) my results are

* idle : 32-40c
* gaming 60c
* stress test 90 but i undervolted a bit.",without undervolting i am reaching 98-99 c in cinebench r23 test.,your cooler seems works fine as shown by stress test temp.,on your place i would try to force 100%  fan-speed/power on cooler and see the temps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
messing with the fan curvature helped lower the temps.,i think it is just bad contact if i am being honest because most of the thermal paste is pushed to the sides.,"while the temps aren't high enough to be super concerning, i bought a contact frame just in case.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also thank you for the tip and quick response.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nah, you're lying",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
im sure he is speaking truth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"lol, i don't need to prove you anything but you can check my post history",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you want more points buy ks version.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a 13900k should hit 40500 points in cinebench r23 at stock clock speeds, so you're either hitting power or cooling limits.","disable asus ai oc, as that will dynamically adjust the temperature and power limits depending on your cooling, and simply enable asus multicore enhancement",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"so, update.",it occured to me that my os was a restored image from a dell laptop i owned that had a 10700k cpu.,"so today i did a fresh install of windows 11

stock numbers in geekbench 5 are 2111 single thread and 17xxx multithread

asus ai overclock - 2254 single thread (which appears to be typical) but only 19311 for multithread.",still far lower than 24xxx for other's stock scores.,not sure why single is now the typical score but multithread is still lower than other's scores.,the fresh install plus asus ai overclock is higher in this fresh install.,digging a bit more...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38500 is the average score for 13900 non-ks version.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok - will try that and report back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
will give it a shot.,thanks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's because reviewers are either hitting power or thermal limits.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's true.,"but to hit 40500~ you'd need to do quite a hefty undervolt on most if not all 13900k's on an aio since they're pushed so far ootb, arguably even moreso than the 12900ks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"tbh, you chose to buy a laptop with a 45 watt cpu (and good thing you didnâ€™t get a 55w hx!).","but, there are plenty of 12th gen laptop cpus available with tdps of 28w, 15w and 9w.",you just have to pick those models.,"still, manufacturers are unquestionably putting too much cpu into todayâ€™s laptops, but thatâ€™s more the oemâ€™s issue than intelâ€™s.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you have the ability to modify the power limits and boost clock values with either intel xtu or throttlestop?,"i didn't necessarily have to do so for the laptop i own to keep temps under control, but i used throttlestop to create a low power / battery only profile that runs reduced clock and boost speeds as well as lower total power limit values.",i am also running a global core undervolt on the laptop which helped a lot by itself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel 12th gen have pretty inefficient power usage but what you described doesn't sound like a good cooling system.,cooling 12w in a large-ish gaming laptop should be quiet.,i'd advise replacing the stock thermal paste and check if all fans are connected properly first.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just curious.,does 12-13w of power draw include integrated gpu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's why people buy m1/m2, if you want a better power efficiency laptop wait for lunar lake.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why the hell did you buy an h processor of you wanted something that draws less power?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i used to have a 2nd gen i3 with 35w tdp and it was very silent because it was a thick boy with a large fan.,the problem with modern notebooks is apple.,"macs don't need as much cooling and these dumb x86 notebooks also want to be as slim as those, but there is no space for cooling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm not sure either, it's on silent, cpu utilization literally sits on 1-3%, so there's absolute no point for it to use that much power.",did you undervolt yours?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"xtu won't run because of ""system incompatibility"" and throttlestop won't let to undervolt, the option ""unlock adjustable voltage"" is greyed out.","i manage to turn off turbo boost, but that won't help since it's too high idle wattage is what warming cpu up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i really don't think fiddling with cooling system will let 12+watts run less than 50c to not trigger the cooling system.,there is a reason laptop cpus try to stay under 5w on low cpu activities to stay.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gpu is in sleep mode.,12-13w is cpu package usage from hwinfo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hate apple.,"i'll just go amd, their 6000 series lineup has much more sane tdp than intel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is an h processor i7-12650h,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my laptop is not thin, it's not chunky either it's 0.78 inches, with good cooling system with enough intakes and exhausts.",it should have been more than enough for mid-upper-tier cpu.,"the thing is that your laptop cpu tdp was max 35watt and in mine it's a minimum 45watts, which is my point, it's way too much for a laptop.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it uses this much wattage when you move cursor around with a touch pad, if you don't touch it, it uses <5watts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the option to do so unfortunately has to be allowed by the laptop manufacturer, the cpu also needs to have the ability to have these values adjusted in the first place.",i figured it would be worth checking to see if you could at least as it would have made a world of difference if so.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well depends what you want to do with it, i'm just gona wait till lunar lake comes out to upgrade all my hardware.","btw, i would recommend wait for amd 7000 laptop cpu for batter battery performance though",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah.,my question was why did you buy an h processor?,those a high-wattage cpus.,alder lake u or p class chips use much less power in laptops.,15-28w,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wiggling the cursor around doesnâ€™t count as idle, it would be a light load but still heavier than idle.",when people talk about idle they mean when the computer is literally doing nothing (apart from the necessary background processes).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i know.,"my first instincts was to turn off the boost, undervolt it and tweak fan curves, but it can't be done in bios and after hours of googling, none of the options worked.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i really did think they thought this through, with e-cores use for low-cpu activities and short-term 115watt boosts, but it just sits at 115watts in cinebench.","to my unfortunate surprise, they did not think this through at all(

i7-1260p for example is still 24-60watt cpu, which is still too much for laptop cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no he won't.,"my gf has zenbook s13 with ryzen 6800u, the thing literally sits at 3-4w when watching watching youtube and doing something along with it, and under 3w when scrolling the interweb.","that's why i made this thread, the amount of power this intel cpu uses is just ridiculous.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"itâ€™s not that the processor or itâ€™s xe graphics are bad, itâ€™s that microsoft has put a very powerful high power chip into a laptop with almost no cooling capability.","it is like running a v12 lambo engine with the radiator from a pt cruiser, it will overheat very fast and throttle back performance to avoid overheating.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it is overheating probably, get a laptop cooling pad for like $10-$20",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
surface devices have never been very good cooling-wise.,make sure the laptop has good ventilation towards the back.,"for some reason, microsoft designs the surface laptops to only have 1 vent on the back for cooling and covers everything else, which severely limits thermal headroom.","also go into power settings on windows and make sure each game you have is set to ""high performance"" power mode, otherwise microsoft will throttle the device",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s really interesting.,i have been consumed by thinking itâ€™s the graphics card.,itâ€™s my first pc from having a mac and gaming was one of the things that helped me choose that.,i will try a cooling mat to see if it helps a bit.,thanks for your help,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"likely import duties, and remember the pricing you see in north america is always without sales tax, and in europe, from my experience, it always includes it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"prices in the eu always have vat included, which for hardware is 16-27% depending on the country.",an msrp of $350 translates to 370-410â‚¬ + import tariffs.,"in spain, pc componentes is selling them quite expensive.",they should be roughly 390â‚¬.,either the store or some national/local distributor are getting very high margins.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

still 370-410â‚¬ is still too expensive in my opinion.,"for example, in pc componentes the intel arc a770 is 462â‚¬ when you have rtx 3060 that is going around for 376-450â‚¬, that being said going for a a770 is a no go for most people when you have a more ""stable"" gpu for cheaper price.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i don't know of any official confirmation of raptor lake refresh, but one thing to consider is that the last time intel was developing a new node, frequency regressions and low yields meant that laptop dies were the only ones that would make sense to make.","intel 10 nm's first major release was ice lake mobile, limited to 4 cores and 3.9 ghz.","then, they released tiger lake-u with 4 cores and up to 4.8 ghz, then tiger lake-h which got up to 8 cores and slowly increased the frequency.",only 2 years after their first real 10 nm lineup did we get alder lake with 10 nm for desktop.,will a similar process play out with intel 4?,"i have no idea, but the precedent is there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
go with raptor lake.,raptor lake turned out better than expected and there is not really something coming in this year.,"a raptor lake refresh could be coming, but itâ€™s unknown what this refresh is about.",because raptor lake is basically a â€žrefreshâ€œ.,probably one of the best refreshes ever made by intel.,"a well known leaker said the naming scheme will be like i9 13950k if a raptor lake refresh is happening, so i would expect its a very small performance uplift.",meteor lake is a high efficiency focused product (like lunar lake).,i expect only laptops will equipped with them this year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

meteor lake will be released for laptops first in september.,it will have up to 6+8 configuration.,"intel may release a desktop version in november or december, but i'm not sure.","there's no sense in raptor lake refresh, because now intel has pushed the 10nm+++++ process to its limits.","yes, we may see another 100-200 mhz bump, but it won't change anything.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"meteor lake is in 2h 23, all we know",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no it makes total sense because meteorlake won't be competitive with amd considering the redwood cove core is not 15-20% improvement as mlid suggests but more like haswell in the range of 10%.,"also they need to bring up next gen nodes fast, so by skipping meteorlake they get to do that.",arrowlake-s is coming only about 1.5 years after raptorlake so the greatly improved cpu will more than make up for needing a refresh in between.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not just last time, happened at 14nm too.","we got haswell refresh and then when we finally got a 14nm desktop part, it was just a handful of broadwell parts.",at this point a desktop launch of a new intel node on time would be the exception.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10nm was an efficiency disaster with icelake.,if 7nm follows the same pattern that means intel failed in their attempt to catch up in node development,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

mobile raptor lake is a refresh of mobile alder lake.,in only bumps up frequencies a litlle at the cost of power.,they don't even include more cache.,so meteor lake mobile is desperately needed for intel in order to compete with rembrandt and phoenix.,yes it is strange to have nothing in between raptor lake and arrow lake.,so intel came up with raptor lake refresh that bumps clock speed by 100mhz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"actually, check out the broadwell core i7 5775c.","it had intel iris graphics on board, but when a dedicated gpu the cache from the more powerful igpu can be used as an l4 cache which gave it 1% and 0.1% lows that often beat the 6700k and 7700k.",different technology but similar idea to the 5800x 3d.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"curious which settings you're using that you're seeing it ""demolishes"" a 13900k.",what are the fps differences you see?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel probably doesn't see the need for 3d cache since the single threaded performance of raptor lake and presumably meteor and arrow lake is very good.,intel might only consider if a future variant of zen4 or zen5 has better performance than expected.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for raising this question.,i have googled for a bit but cant find any material on this.,"seems like the slightly similar thing intel has is the ""hbm"" memory cache coming up in sapphire rapids.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

tarkov is a very shitty game as far as optimization.,"it's funny how that game has been in active development since 2016 is still absolutely horrendous on high-end hardware, a la 13900k with rtx 3080+ cards.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well 5800x3d is losing to raptor lake in performance both in gaming and in other programs.,there is a lot of expectation from certain parties that the 7000-series 3d-cache cpus would be great for gaming.,"we do not really know how that will be, we do know that the regular 7000-series is really nothing special as it is ddr5 only and maxes out at pretty poor ddr5 speeds and latency.",the ram controller seems to pretty poor on those cpus.,on top of that 3d-cache is just more cache.,"it seems that cache is increasing each cpu-gen, but 5800x3d was the first cpu that purely went for that direction, while forgetting a lot of other characteristics.",that approach seems to have paid off for it.,it has 96mb l3 cache.,5950x also had 64mb of that same cache even without the stacking tech.,13900k has 68mb of l2+l3 cache.,"lets see how this game plays on, but for now it seems that all cpus are getting larger caches gen by gen. it does not seem to matter where the cache is located and instead of focusing on marketing like ""3d-cache"" we should focus more on the amount of cache and checking how much benefit it gives.","too much certain types of cache can lead to increased latency in some use cases, so just automatically always adding it is not the correct path to take.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i get well over 100fps with my 13900k, i think the examples you are seeing are not great examples lol.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i am not sure if ""3d"" cache is a good idea.","more cache is always welcomed, but why place it on top of the processor, hindering cpu cooling?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no it wont.,raptor lake is already being pushed about as hard as intel can push their cpu technology at the moment.,"some slight improvements on intel 7 are potentially still possible, but we're talking smallish clock bumps here.","and meteor lake is likely not gonna see a huge level of improvement in terms of such single thread performance, not to mention it's probably only going to be 6(p) cores rather than the 8 of raptor lake and potentially mobile-only.","there's just no way to compete with adding 64mb of cache on an existing, affordable chiplet like amd can do with zen 3/4.",adding another 40-60mb of l3 on raptor lake would mean needing an entirely new chip to be designed and it would be much bigger than current raptor lake chip(which is already very big for a consumer cpu).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's the 3d heatsink era.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would be cool!,no idea if i'd actually bother upgrading though.,"i mainly play games and well, the cpu doesn't matter nearly as much as the gpu anyway.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intels lack of answer to amds 3d vcache was the reason i went with a 7950x for this upgrade cycle instead of a 13900k to get on the platform and wait for the vcache chip.,this is my first amd chip since an x2 4400+ and seeing how long amd supported the last socket seemed like a nice change of pace from what i had grown accustomed to.,"i will admit though, buying this chip and 6000mhz ram is kinda boring.",iâ€™m used to being able to get faster memory down the line etc.,it is refreshing that intel is no longer producing carbon copy cpus any longer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes but the 5800x3d just combines it into the l3 cache efficiently just becoming a massive l3 instead of an extra l4.,would be nice if intel can do the same.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"one of the issues amd ran into with the 5800x3d was that the 3d cache acted as a thermal insulator for the cores below, that was a big reason why the 5800x3d was clocked a few hundred mhz lower than its not 3d counterpart.","if you stacked extra cores, not only would those cores serve as an insulator themselves, theyd serve as a physical heat source for the cores on bottom.",i can't see stacking cores as a practical design.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50%+ in tarkov with a 5800x3d vs 12900k.,"in warzone where cache isn't as important the 12900k/13900k are much better, just depends on if the game is cache sensitive or not.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i googled it first as i don't normally make posts and couldn't see much if anything relating to it.,"intel have gone with some interesting design choices with the p+e cores so would be interesting to see what they do about adding more cache, seems it's a struggle to fit it on the die.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the way i see mtl potentially including extra cache would be a layer of cache in the base die.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't even want to see how absolutely horrendous will intel's 1st gen of chiplet cpu be.,expecting the performance being all over the place in some workloads falling back to comet lake performance.,intel seems very incapable in terms of implementing cutting-edge technologies.,first chiplet-like thing from intel was supposed to be sapphire rapids but those cpus already got delayed by two years because they have huge issues with making them work properly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes i agree it has bad optimization but it's the game i play most so having the 5800x3d is completely worth it for me, it's insane how the cache helps so much.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in tarkov?,i've watched streamers with 13900k struggle to get 80+ fps on streets whereas i've been hitting 120+ no problem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"amd's implementation of 3d cache doesn't place it over the cores, but over the cache already there.","as for ""why place it on top instead of off to the side"", presumably it's for latency purposes - there's a very small latency penalty for tripling the size of the cache.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for latency reasons?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"have it as an option for gamers, 5800x3d does run much hotter than a 5800x while having lower clocks but the 3d cache makes up for it, worth the extra money if primarily gaming.",imagine a slower 13700k/13900k with extra cache it'd be amazing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">more cache is always welcomed, but why place it on top of the processor, hindering cpu cooling?","as somebody else already mentioned, amd cleverly places their cache chiplet over existing cache only, so it doesn't cover the cores.",but you are right that placing the cache on top is ultimately a less ideal way of doing this.,"it makes sense when you want to offer the ability to have a chiplet that can be used standalone or have a stacked cache chiplet, but if you really wanted to optimize the design, you'd put the cache chiplet under the core chiplet, and you'd put all the l3 cache on it, where you could not only use more cache if you wanted, but you'd also get to shrink the core chip by quite a lot(current zen 4 chiplet is like 50% l3).",the downside is that these become inseparable and you can *only* sell it as a stacked product.,"this seems to be what cdna3 will be doing going by amd's own illustrations, though it's a very obvious solution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7950x doesn't have 3d cache,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would be curious about the performance implications of using a much larger l4 cache or adding less cache but stacking it for extra l3.,"one way might not necessarily be better than the other, i'm guessing it depends on how *much* more extra l4 cache they can add compared to how much extra l3 cache they can stack.","it also would depend on how much extra cache games could utilize effectively for the l4 to be large enough to yield performance benefits, for example if the l4 only added a marginal amount of capacity but the game requires a large amount of information that couldn't fit into the l4 regardless, then all the addition of l4 would be doing is adding latency.","but then that would also depend on how they use their l4 as well, ik intel at one point used their l4 as a victim cache for their l3?","it's a shame there aren't more tests for the impacts of l4 on the 5775c, other than the (imo flawed) anandtech testing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the only way i can see stacking cores as a practical design would be:

a large server processor made up of entirely atom cores where the clock speeds are going to be extremely low anyway 

p cores and e cores on the top maybe?","but tbh unless drastic new ways of cooling chips becomes available, i don't really see much benefits from stacking cores on top of each other.","the perhaps best benefit of stacking cores would be to increase performance by decreasing latency, but you would also see a huge decrease in clock speeds because of thermals.","imo it doesn't really make much sense when you could also just expand horizontally with chiplets, even if the power/latency cost is larger.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> because they have huge issues with making them work properly.,"sapphire rapids is a pretty ambitious overall design, and i've not seen any indication that chiplet packaging has been responsible for the issues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
?,they already had chiplet cpus 10+ years ago.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">as for ""why place it on top instead of off to the side"", presumably it's for latency purposes - there's a very small latency penalty for tripling the size of the cache.",the reason is because it's necessary if they want to make it an optional part.,"ideally you'd put it on the bottom, but now you've got to completely rework the connections.","this is what i expect will be done in time(and what amd's cdna3 seems to be doing), but only once cache stacking becomes standard rather than a higher priced option.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would assume the reason is because its cheaper.,"amd outsources cpu construction to external companies, so number of cpus per waffer may be important.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but like practically?,it seems like outside of gaming there are few applications that benefited from this design and the gaming market isn't *that* huge to justify designing and manufacturing entire line of chips.,we'll see i suppose.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">have it as an option for gamers, 5800x3d does run much hotter than a 5800x

i dont believe it does from what i've seen, though they could be using higher binned chips to achieve this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you put the cache next to the cpu, there is no need to slow down the cpu.",i would expect (if intel decides to add more cache) that the extra cache will not be stacked ontop of the cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

donâ€™t bother waiting for a t cpu.,there is no difference between a t and a not-t besides the stock power limits.,theyâ€™re no cheaper.,theyâ€™re no more efficient.,and power limits are entirely user configurable.,so just buy a 13500 and set the power limits to mimic a t cpu at 35 watts.,"voila, a diy 13500t.",seriously.,"or, do what you like - thereâ€™s no reason you canâ€™t allow 36 watts or 50 watts.",or 125 watts.,itâ€™s in your control.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
t series chips aren't usually on sale until 2-3 months after k and non-k. so you'll have to wait until march/april.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
t processors are oem parts with the default power limits lowered.,"they're not usually sold to individual builders since you buy a non-t and lower the power limits in your bios, so no point in buying one unless you get a good deal on it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"thanks i had no clue, figured it was different hardware.",it sounds like i'll just buy now and enjoy/not worry about an extra low tdp,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think apart from the tdp which can be lowered on any cpu modell as long the mobo supports the options these t modells have a different execution pipeline.,does mean t modells work more effective when the command prio allows it.,so realtime processes like game fps production won't gain from that but non realtime tasks can be faster due to optimized command orders.,(it was that way in the past.,maybe newer gen don't do that anymore but i guess they still do).,"so i second what you say, just buy s normal cpu and a better mobo to set tdp by your own.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you were downvoted but that's exactly right.,the posters on [silentpcreview have been explaining this for years](https://silentpcreview.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=70036) and people still get the wrong idea.,t suffix cpus are not binned from special power efficient dies.,there's no point in paying a premium for a t cpu when you can accomplish the same thing with a regular non-t cpu using a power profile that limits frequency scaling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
unraid shows the different cores as threaded and unthreaded.,"i donâ€™t have a new chip to verify, but thatâ€™s what iâ€™ve been told",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"t should still be more efficient if the power limits aren't reached, because of lower clocks (especially all core turbo, but intel doesn't list that in their website.)","since software like throttlestop cannot adjust turbo boost frequencies now, i am not sure if you can underclock in bios either.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"fwiw, idle power on the 12/13 gen cpus is stupid low due to the e cores, so if you're planning on having a server that idles a lot i'd recommend ignoring the t cpus and just buying a normal desktop part.",without a gpu they'll idle at just a few watts.,i have a 12700k server and its probably the lowest power pc i've ever owned since 95% of the time only 1 or 2 e cores are active.,if you're going to have a server that sits around rendering or doing scientific computing 24/7 then that changes things and you really want to look at efficiency under load.,p cores on 12/13 gen aren't always the most efficient.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks for your feedback, thatâ€™s the boat iâ€™ll be in.","90% doing not a lot, 10% workâ€¦ wish i could get a 6 efficiency core cpu or something to sip @35w",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

at idle you will be less than 35w (probably less than 10) with any intel cpu.,haven't tested amd this generation.,"if you want to limit load power (and therefore performance), set the power limits to 35w like on a t series.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is the new msrp.,"the a750 was already competitive with the (terrible) rtx 3060 at its launch performance and price, but now with the driver updates, it genuinely rivals the discounted rx 6600 series in value.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that's the new msrp for the a750 as two others have already said.,"the lowered msrp along with the updated drivers and better hardware encoding than amd's 6600/xt/6650 xt start making it pretty appealing, if they continue to improve drivers (which seems very likely), i could see it being very good in the long run.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's not a very good choice for 1080p because you're not taking advantage of the high fill rate and get cockblocked by drivers.,1440p/4k has better returns on arc than 1080p.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s great for 1440p gaming also!,for the majority of the games i play i have little to no issues using the latest drivers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

another option would be a used 3060 ti.,it's not that much slower than a 3070. i recently got one for 275. in the us it should be even cheaper.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just be careful with used.,the 3070 was a popular mining card.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that 60 euros would be better saved for a complete system upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

wouldnâ€™t make a difference.,my cousin had a 4690k and i gave him my 4790k laying around and it was pretty much similar performance.,although he has a 1070 and hasnâ€™t bottlenecked yet which makes ur issue kind of weird now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have 4930k and a 4080 and i get 125 fps on cyberpunk at 2k with psycho rt/ hdr/ ultra,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it may help a bit, but it isn't going to magically make your 10/15 fps games playable.",i have a feeling the gains would be marginal at best.,i agree with others...save up for a full upgrade.,putting in a 4790k is not going to solve your problem and it is only going to get worse over time since even the consoles have much better cpus than the 4790k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, it has higher clocks and uses ht to virtualize its 4 cores into 8 threads.",not much of a benefit actually.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is just a blatant lie.,"there's noooo shot ur getting that frame rate with a 4790k and rt on, even with dlss 3.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wow, people really do know how to waste their money.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lmaooo anything but weeping.,i specifically said actual gameplay.,the built in benchmark is extremely light on the cpu.,"show me a city scene with a bunch of npcs and i might walk back the ""with the dlss 3"" part.",i can guarantee its no where near 125fps and relies on a technology the vast majority of people can't use (including op).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"with frame gen, 4080 can do that.",100+ for sure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
um ok would you like me to take a screen shot?,"hell, i'll do even better i'll post a youtube clip.",why do you feel the need to accuse me of lying?,i bought my computer in 2013. i don't think anyone has put in a new cpu behind my back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how is that wasting money?,can you get that many fps on a 2080?,"when i bought it a 3080 cost more than the 4080.

not to mention i'm upgrading to a 13900k and this was just a stop gap.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, that is not what i was talking about.",the fact is this is damn impressive for a 10-year-old cpu.,"prior to dlss3, i was getting 60-65 in this ""benchmark""

in-game, i was getting 30-60 with an average of around 40. i'll have to check it out now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then post it.,"i accuse you of lying because i've had a 6700, 10700k and a 13600k plus over 100 hours in cyberpunk and your results are way off base.",in actual gameplay you'd be lucky to get 60fps and definitely drop below in the more demanding areas with ray tracing on.,your comments are incredibly misleading.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you're getting a better modern cpu then it's a different story.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok standby i get home in about an hour,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well this just shows the power of the cpu i have.,even when i get the 13900k i'm only looking at a 20% increase in fps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"maybe if you play mainly heavy gpu bound games like cyberpunk, but you should see a much more substantial increase overall.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, you show only your silliness and also lie about those results.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
first you say frame gen can do 100+ and then you say i'm lying which is it?,watch the two videos for yourself if you don't believe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
changing to 13900k will boost your fps to 50% at least.,in some cpu-demanding games boost might be twice or more.,"125 fps can be achieved only with balance or lower dlss and in some spikes, 125 is not an average.",this is what you lied about.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i didn't lie about anything.,the in game benchmark average is 126 and that was what i was talking about.,it's clear in the video.,you can't put conditions on what i was talking about.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and in-game fps is almost twice lower.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
now do these tests with rdr2 for example.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
an important metric missed is fps 1% lows.,those have a large impact on how fps feels.,min fps is a poor replacement as it's only a single point of data at the *very* end of a bell curve.,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxepiwi4sgm

but honestly though.",this is a great write-up!,i didn't expect those results.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i personally use 8p+2e on my 12900kf for gaming.,itâ€™s perfect for me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
definitely try rdr2 or something like that and the outcome most likely will be diff.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so this confirms that i made the correct choice going for the 13600k paired with a 4090 for 4k gaming @ 144 hz, even if most people were telling me to get the 13700k, or even the 13900k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"interesting test, i think cyberpunk 2077 with high crowd density would have been a better test as that is a cpu hog.","also, 4k is a heavier load on the cpu than 1440 or 1080, so this should really be done at 4k to get the best results.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wow what a interesting set of data.,thanks for running this and really interesting that in overwatch a 4 core cpu is more than enough.,really makes you think why we are buying 13600k and itâ€™s 20 threads for â€œgamingâ€ builds.,really a gaming build should be a 13100 and 13400 and the extra money should be spent on getting the next tier up gpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on what kind of gaming you want to do.,i run an i3 10105f and a 1660 super maxed out settings at cyberpunk on 720p gave me around 80 to 90 fps,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just play the damn game.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i really don't get why you want to bother with e-cores if the major bottleneck of pc nowadays is gpu.,most modern games can't saturate a true 6 core and do you think that e-cores is going to help with games?,just disable it or buy a p-core only config or any amd cpus (which is within your budget) and invest on gpu since most of the time players wants to play their games beautifully at 1440p.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
interesting data.,"to me it seems like 6p+some e cores would be the best case scenario, as generally when you game you'd have some other programs open too, which the e cores can handle.","obviously depends on how many programs/how demanding they are, but going through the hassle of turning off e cores for a very slight performance uplift when only the game is running seems  to not be worth it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great tests wish we see this with other games,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
happy to see high fps benchmarks tested with the gpu bottleneck properly removed.,i wish you had a 12700k/13700k or higher with sufficient p-cores to test e-cores enabled but with hyperthreading disabled.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the best thing anyone here could ever possibly do to give themselves an amazing affordable gaming experience is go with a 12600k or 13600k .... more than enough for gaming and does excellent in productivity as well.,"with the 12600k you get 18 logical cores, with the 13600k you get 20 logical threads.",overclocking is extremely easy and results in gaming performance on par with any .. any high-end cpu buy either intel or amd.,the 14600k will probably have 22 logical threads.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thanks for the helpful suggestion.,actually i have different opinion on 1% low for the above particular tests.,the 1%-low fps is more important for comparing the stability of different cpus/gpus under heavy gaming tasks.,"it is especially helpful when comparing hardware of different gens and architectures, such as the 5800x3d vs 13700k or 3090ti vs 7900xtx.",some youtubers said that the 5800x3d did have a poor 1%-low and accordingly brought some noticable fps stutterings even though it showed a higher avg fps than the competition.,"in the above tests herein, there's no brand or architecture difference for cpu/gpu.","hence, to the best of my understanding, the 1%-low and/or 0.1%-low data were all merged into and reflected by the avg fps results.",please correct me if i am wrong.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

how do you have 2e cores?,doesn't that cpu have 8?,can't you only disable a whole 4e core complex at once?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i hear disabling all the e cores will give a better overclock making the cpu perform better ðÿ¤”,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you lose the l3 cache advantage of the higher end chips which does limit performance some.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i mean, for now.","when you start to see most games optimized for 8 cores, it will be a different story.","that's why you'd go 13700k for gaming, future proofing.","there are already games that use more than 6 cores (4x strategy games ect), and in those few games the performance gain is substantial.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
e cores arenâ€™t really designed for gaming loads.,theyâ€™re designed for highly multi threaded loads where single core speed doesnâ€™t matter.,theyâ€™re great if you can get the scheduler to have it run various background tasks (like 500 chrome tabs) and can get the game to run mostly on the p cores.,but for running just a game for benchmarks youâ€™ll never see any improvements.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, also notice this - the higher the p/e ratio, the better the fps of the game.","i wonder how many people really need the 16 e cores of the 13900k/kf/ks... since the e cores aint help gaming much, then one should really just get a 30% cheaper 13700k/kf instead.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that sounds good.,i haven't really considered that.,wouldn't 1% lows show a larger range of time while min fps is from only the last second or a few?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no.,grab a 4 core against 6 core and try writing that text again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i doubt the e cores will help much with 1% lows given their lower peak performance and higher memory latency.,"for real time tasks generally you want to make sure nothing gets scheduled to a slower, less responsive core.","exception of course is when you have too few fast cores, then slower is better than nothing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you can disable them all or select anywhere in between 1-8â€¦ or atleast i can anyways in my bios.,i currently use 2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think that's a myth created by the anti-e-cores crowd,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they definitely help speed load times by crunching through decompression and shader compilation preloads much faster.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the e-cores are more for background tasks, so more os related than games.","multithreading is still a difficult problem, so having too many threads (i.e.",e cores) especially less performant one is going to hit a ceiling really quick.,i think game development is still on the 8-core maximum optimization too.,e-cores are great for laptops though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
p and more specifically e cores is a way to save die space and inflate core count.,"it makes a lot of sense for low power devices like phones and laptops, but less so for desktop pcs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

a 4090 with a 7700k is a complete waste of money.,that cpu holds back even a 3060.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

isn't the l3 tied to the cores?,so disabling (in bios)  a cluster of cores (2p or 4e) won't make that l3 cache available to the other cores?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i guess that's one tiny benefit then.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
x3d has a different cache architecture physically.,not just size,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, l3 is shared, l1 and 2 are core bound.","intel calls l3 as smartcache, as they're shared, they made it shared with core2 release.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's not really a tiny benefit.,"by the time you get to any sort of workload where you can max out 8 cores, you can usually max out an arbitrary number of them.","outside of vms, there's going to be very few scenarios where it'll ever be worth having more p-cores than we already have.",all other things being equal i'd put my money on 6p+8e beating 8p in just about every scenario.,maybe even 4p+16e too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"good point, amd sits the additional 64mb l3 cache on top of each chiplet's ccd, bonded with through-silicon vias (tsvs) to reduce data transfer latency, leading to higher fps in many popular games.","although i have been buying intel cpus all my life and many people think the amd 7000's lose out to the intel 13th gen, i still think amd 7000's like the 7600x are very good gaming cpus.",the only problem is that the am5 platform cost is too high compared with intel's and consumers are not ready or in a hurry to pay for am5 and ddr5.,the fact that the 13600k offers higher performance than the 7600x due to the extra 8 e-cores is not the main reason most consumers don't buy the amd 7000.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes

people tend take those boards and use them as budget ram overclockers since there's no lower pcie and only 2 dimms they're more stable at higher frequencies",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the only caveat with the bx60 boards is the lack of v-core control as well as locked multiplier.,afaik.,"i'm doing a very similar itx 13th gen, and ended up buying a z790 board for more just to get the voltage control to undervolt",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
x60 boards tend to leave features of a k sku'd chip not used...there's a non k 13900.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good to hear.,thanks for the reply!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"13600k is cheaper and will work on the same boards as the 12700k, and mostly better in games.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you would.,but why the 12700k when the 13600k exists?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why not just wait 14th gen and jump to ddr5 at once?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh so you would recommend that instead?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sorry i didnâ€™t know that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because i just bought this gpu for 500$ plus i have to upgrade to mother board 150$ and then the cpu is 300$,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
those come out in a year iâ€™m having performance issues now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no worries, to be honest you could save a bit more with a 12600k honest which is still a big step up on the 10400f and a good chunk of your instability may have to do with your gpu bouncing off the ceiling of your settings.",totally normal for the frames to vary 10-20 or so as long as it doesn't look like you've suddenly hit slo-mo instant replay during it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://pcpartpicker.com/list/4bqjrv this works for the budget you have for cpu and board.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is the 7690 better then the b560?,those are the 2 main motherboards for 12th and 13th gens right?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"z690 has an lga1700 socket for 12th and 13th gen, it can overclock k cpus

b560 has an lga1200 socket for 10th and 11th gen, it can't overclock cpus but can overclock memory.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sorry i meant b660 i have the b560 now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
z chipset is better than the b chipset within any generation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just so you know, the b560/z590 boards are only compatible with 10th and 11th gen. b660 and z690 is required for 12th and 13th gen.

you very likely will need a motherboard swap if you decide to upgrade.","but before that, use task manager to make absolutely sure that the fps dips are caused by high cpu utilization.","and if you can find a really good deal on a 10900k ($200-$300), it might be worth it for 12600k like performance without needing a motherboard swap.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the i9 runs hot, i still recommend him to buy 13600k even if you have to buy new mobo (also you can sell your old one)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
get msi z690-a or asrock z690 extreme.,both go around $200.,go for i7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
\~3% differnce between i7 and i9.,i opted for i7 when i upgraded and the thing is a beast.,not enough performance differnce to justify the price jump imo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

k versions have pl1=pl2.,so yours should both be 181w,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what bios version are you running on the motherboard?,there was an update in november.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what's pl2 set to?,"either you can't set pl1 above pl2, or your motherboard might not have enough vrm cooling to support more than 125w.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the asrock z690m phantom gaming 4 has just puny 6x 50a mosfets and therefore the bios limits the power draw to 125w to prevent overheating.,there's nothing you can do except to invest in a mobo with better vrms.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, yes, but the stock 13600k pulls around 200w in cinbench, so 125w pl1 is gonna make it perform terribly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i know, but i can't set pl1 above 125w.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the latest, 11.05",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's sad that such a thing is even needed - really holds me from buying an intel 12/13 gen chip,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
need more data before coming to a conclusion on whether there's a benefit.,i've decided to take a wait and see approach before ordering a frame.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i put one of these on my 13700k build that is current under construction.,i paired it on my asus rog strix z790-e mobo.....tight fit but feels sturdy and my cm pl360 flux aio installed easily on top of it.,i hope it knocks a few extra degrees off.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you need the 13th gen version of the contact frame not the 12th!,just kidding!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"tldr:

yes.",this thermally benefits 12th and 13th generation parts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that was my guess when i ordered the bracket a couple months ago, figured i would buy before the rush.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i installed mine yesterday, no change for me 

13700k / fc140 cooler with nt-h1 paste",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so the same reasons as everyone else?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
those would be the only reasons... yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think derbauer said the next two gens will take the same ilm frames.,derbauer frame might not contact the mainboard at all vs other frames?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thats a typical marketing answer.,it is not preventing it from hitting boosting frequencies under what cooler?,"most of the processors dont even come with a coolerâ€¦ 

also, independent testing shows that major improvements can be made by installing a contact frame.",does it work without?,yes.,does that make a contact frame bullshit?,absolutely not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
otherwise they would be admitting to putting out a product that lacks fit and finish.,sure it's good enough to hit the target frequency but if overclock bench tests are better with the bracket then they shouldn't be discouraging anyone who buys a k chip from maximizing it's potential.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"'needed', no reviewers are using frames for their reviews.","and it only benefits people with flat cold plates, which is a minority of the cooler market.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's needed only if you want to overclock.. the ~5â°c drop gives you oc headroom.,more extreme solution for this is direct die cooling.,otherwise if you run it at intel recommened stock settings (power limit) and on capable cooler (dual tower for i7/9) it works just fine without the bracket.,it'll be at 90-95â°c but that's fine because 12/13 gen temperature temperature target is 100â°c (if you're under that it means your cpu will not throttle and runs within design spec).,"come on, cpu isn't made from butter or soft plastic.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are your temperatures under 100â°c when cpu is fully loaded?,if yes then you don't need the frame since you won't get any performance improvement.,"and if you are thinking about cpu health then even if you're super lucky and the frame decreases your temperature by 10â°c (for most ppl it's <5â°c), those 10â°c don't make any significant difference on the cpus lifespan.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™ve got 4 of these adapters, i kept ordering from ali express and they werenâ€™t showing up over the course of a few months, then suddenly all 4 showed up within a week",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"its really up to you, its not a particularly hard install.",but you should definitely be slow and cautious to do it correctly.,"you may see big temp improvements or may not, so if you feel like your temps are high and need some improvement you can go for it, done properly it won't make anything worse at least.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

they did suggest tweaking the llc and getting a more capable cooler if heat is a problem.,they did not admit the contract frame is a necessary solution,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hi!,so yes it did.,i actually ended up buying both the thermal grizzly and thermalright versions.,my experience was that the thermal grizzly was hard to mount on my particular mobo and i was worried it was going to cause pressure issues.,so i ended up buying the thermaright and it was super easy install no issues at all.,both saved me between around 7-8c in temps which i think is great.,with a more moderate fan profile an cinebench r23 i am seeing max temps after 15 min loop around 86c max and gaming temps range from 45-65c depending on the title.,my settings are stock with unlimited pwr settings in bios.,if i up my aio fan settings i can see my  temps drop in the same benchmarks another 5c roughly but i like to opt for a more silent experience.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

which ones?,these cpus don't care about running above 90â°c as long as it's below 100â°c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is fine... many laptops are running their cpu under load between 90-100â°c for years already  and zero problems.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

our problem isn't solved at all if the trend continues upward.,your line of thinking is exactly how we deal with servers and other data center equipment.,it's okay if raw energy use is going up a bit if performance is increasing 2-3x every couple years because doing more with fewer servers in a data center is an overall energy win.,it helps that the servers are more utilized than most desktops on average.,desktop sales alone in the us in a given year are anywhere from 7-10x the volume of server shipments.,the smaller increases in power with larger performance gains in the server space are flopped in the desktop market right now where smaller performance gains (compared to servers) are coming at much larger chunks of additional energy as configured by the oems.,"yes die shrinks cut energy, moore's law isn't dead yet *clap clap* but the % of energy increase on the consumer side is alarming, and it's actually arguably worse on the discrete gpu side.","the base architecture is always improving, which is why the mobile versions of these chips have gotten so solid in general we barely have anything left to do there.","but the desktop side where the are no battery life considerations we still see all kinds of wild shit, even from plenty of oem systems where power draw is ramping up beyond the needs of average users to win marketing wars.","no most people aren't going to go buy the latest 600w gpu, but it drags up the power of even the low end stuff to 200-300w, far higher than just a couple gens before.",yes it brings far more performance too!,but if desktops en masse start drawing nearly 500-1kw of power to support that performance then we a real power problem at a national scale.,"we're not after enthusiasts, the number of us are relatively small and many of us build our own rigs anyway.","but if the average mid-high end oem desktop configs start really creeping *up* in power rather than staying pretty steady or even declining like they have nearly every gen to gen the past 20 years, you have a regulatory nightmare that can't be explained away like we do on the server side (the principle that 2 powerful servers can do more overall work and use less overall energy than 6 weaker ones doesn't fly with individual desktops).",everything we do is data driven by both power and performance data with the manufacturers hand in hand and it's not a guessing game.,but the power trend going up at the rate it is in this volume regardless or the performance benefits raises a lot of red flags in the environmental policy world whether you all like it or not frankly.,that's the reality.,"it's not always about the tech, but how it's marketed, configured when shipped, and used by the average user at a national level.","we don't just look at the market now, but also 2-4 years out, and we have access to oem info to help us navigate that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i've been very disappointed with the qvl listings at higher capacities of ddr5.,many motherboards seem not to have even tested at 128gb.,i'm currently waiting for the 7950x3d since the extra cache has been said to help negate the benefits of higher clocked memory.,would love to be able to see a comparison between these two chips when fully loaded with ram that is clocked to as fast as is still stable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ãƒ»the stability and compatibility of xmp memory kits that operate beyond the jedec standard is not guaranteed because it can be affected by the capabilities of the cpuâ€™s integrated memory controller, installed devices, and the operating frequency of associated bus domains.",ãƒ»always install dimms with the same cas latency.,"for optimal compatibility, we recommend that you install memory modules of the same version or date code (d/c) from the same vendor.",check with the retailer to get the correct memory modules.,"ãƒ»the default dimm frequency depends on its serial presence detect (spd), which is the standard way of accessing information from a memory module.","under the default state, some memory modules for overclocking may operate at a lower frequency than the vendor-marked value.","to set the rated speed of the kit, please select xmp(intel)/d.o.c.p(amd) or apply manual settings.","&#x200b;

ãƒ»when installing total memory of 4gb capacity or more, windows 32-bit operation system may only recognize less than 3gb.","hence, a total installed memory of less than 3gb is recommended.",*ãƒ»ddr5 speed may vary depending on the number of memory modules used.,"in general, ddr5 speed with 2 dimms will be faster than that with 4 dimms, and its actual speed will also vary depending on platform.",refer to your memory modules' specifications for more details.,*,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

probably not even that.,"current raptor lake is already hitting ddr5-7600, a speed far beyond anything representing reasonable value.","meteor lake vs zen 5 is looking really ugly for intel right about now, thoughâ€¦",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what i came here to ask.,would love to extend my z690 aorus master even longer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i donâ€™t see why not.,if raptor lake refresh has the same socket.,and z690 boards already support raptor lake.,then probably a bios update will be needed for the refresh.,i canâ€™t see why it wouldnâ€™t be supported,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
different socket.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 9900k is still a beast, and should hold you over until the next generation at least!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"14th gen being on the same socket as 12th gen seems highly unlikely from my point of view, partly due to the fact that itâ€™s completely different packaging, where meteor lake is using tiles instead of a monolithic die, but we shall see.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the entry level sapphire rapids parts have quad channel memory 64 pcie 5.0 lanes, so they're not really comparable to alder lake.",if you wanted to build a semi-affordable workstation with 256gb of ram and a couple of gpus/accelerators and some pcie 5.0 ssds you'd be looking at sapphire rapids.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's the most optimistic interpretation, and yet it leads to the question of ""why is meteor lake not good enough for desktop?""",we saw this with ice lake - the first* generation on a new process node was laptop only because clock speeds and yields meant it couldn't scale up to desktop performance.,is something similar happening with intel 4?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this makes sense but intel has been reconfirming meteor lake for 2023 for quite some time now.,feels like this refresh which hasn't been mentioned anywhere before untill now is a response to ml missing 2023 and intel needing something to go against amd's 3d-cache cpu's.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
still a notable break from convention.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all i care about is ecc and av1 hardware support so i can build a new server and drastically reduce my power consumption.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but thatâ€™s under no pressure from flop of bulldozer.,"now table changes, either am4 or am5 have a long life support which pressures intel do something â€œunconventionalâ€.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
chipset is irrelevant to his point,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9th gen was called coffee lake refresh and was more than a clock bump.,do we have any details from intel yet?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, gen 12th, 13th and 13th-refresh",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably arl on some n3 variant.,meteor lake wasn't going to impress in gaming nor productivity anyway due to core count&peak clocks regression.,but i think mtl will fare much better than raptor lake p against zen 4 mobile apus.,even though this new process probably won't be reaching 6ghz it should at least improve performance and efficiency at lower power range.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my point wasâ€¦ w680 and z690 are the same socket and cpu support.,folks might expect a similar situation from w790 and z790.,"of course the sockets are now different, but chipset naming here between the two generations is not particularly intuitive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel hedt used to be xx9 chipsets with a different socket.,way less confusing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

exactly!,"by the same token, what is up with the nonsensical naming conventions?","look at alder lake:

- h610
- b660
- h670
- w680

isn't yields and perf not being good excellent right from the start completely normal for a full node at the beginning?,yields improve as they ramp and enter hvm.,and meteor lake overall seems like an unexciting product for enthusiast market with desktop version rumored to have core count and clock speed regression from raptor lake.,"so maybe they don't want a repeat of rocket lake situation, with all the negative reception.",the cores themselves in mtl also aren't that much more powerful according to leaks.,so it makes sense to skip meteor lake on desktop or have it as a low to midrange option next to arrow lake which will feature a better cpu tile.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

intel has prioritized laptops for a long time since they make so much more money than desktops.,laptops got ice lake first but laptops also got 5ghz tiger lake chips a year before desktops got a decent upgrade.,i think it's mostly about production volume since laptop chips aren't really that much smaller or slower anymore.,intel has to produce ungodly amount of the laptop chips so they will likely want to prioritize that.,intel hasn't as far as i know ever even mentioned meteor lake desktop.,all the chip examples we have seen have been laptop chips.,desktop might not get upgrade until arrow lake.,edit: apparently intel just said that intel4 is manufacture ready as of now.,which would roughly line up with late q2 release of first products.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

q6600 had a vid of 1.25v average fifteen years ago.,and that was a 65nm cpu.,no overclock at higher voltage on 10nm or smaller architectures will impress me.,at least this guy is using a very low voltage in comparison to what all these other clowns are pushing and will have fried chips if they keep it up.,there's already been reports of degradation on overclockers forums with 12th gen. but sure dude push insane voltage for that extra meaningless clock speed totally worth it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what the hell does voltage have to do with with anything.,its just a minimum required voltage for stable operation.,no regards whatsoever to if its better or worse and cannot be directly compared to different architectures.,damn this sub is full of morons who worry too much about voltage.,iâ€™ll fry my chips if i want to.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

voltages go down with new generations of cpus not up!,"the lower the node size in nm, the less voltage required for the same / higher clocks, this has always been the case in the entire history of silicon computing.","look at ddr5, less voltage, up to double the speeds of ddr4, each new ddr generation clocks way higher on less voltage than the previous gen, the same is the case with cpus.","my 13600k runs at 1.25v 5.4 all core, no previous gen chip could run that high at 1.25v.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that's true.,"but to hit 40500~ you'd need to do quite a hefty undervolt on most if not all 13900k's on an aio since they're pushed so far ootb, arguably even moreso than the 12900ks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

gonna go against the grain and say that offering a complete line of hedt products is good.,some people need memory or io-heavy configurations or just want a starter chip and to upgrade down the road to split the cost up.,"there historically have been lots of products like i7 3820, 4820k, threadripper 1900x, etc that crossed over into ""regular desktop core count"" territory and that's fine, it doesn't hurt you to have the option available.","i specifically disliked when that option went away with threadripper 3000, and generally feel that was part of the overall big-picture of pushing asps upwards and forcing people to spend more for things they didn't necessarily want.","entry level hedt being accessible is a good thing - remember historically this went as low as $375 for a cpu and $200 for a mobo, it never has been high end, just higher than consumer.","cutting hyperthreading is dumb though, and i really don't see many people taking the 6c and 8c most likely (although there will be a few takers for storage servers or licensing reasons - and again licensing reasons are a place where capacity-on-demand helps too).",even the customers who might be interested will probably want ecc.,"weâ€™ll also have to see how well the mcm solution performs, of course.","first-gen epyc was pretty bad and even with 2 dies here the scaling may not be all that amazing (and thatâ€™s a broader criticism of sapphire rapids in general, not just the ws series).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm glad intel is bringing high core count + high i/o solutions to the desktop, it has been too long and prices have suffered with no competition in the market.",i'm also glad that these cpus are now been referred to as workstation cpus rather than hedt because i doubt we're going to see hedt prices unless you're only looking at only the <16 core range.,"with names like 'w7-3465x' these are meant to compete with threadripper pro, will be interesting to see how these xeon cores compete considering the lower cpu clocks compared to threadripper but that's where the ipc will do the talking.",hopefully these cpus provide good alternatives to threadripper pro and result in more sane pricing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
misleading title.,it will have a wide range from 6 to 56 cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the cheaper 2000 series looks like the old hedt brought back (4 channel memory, more pcie, reasonable core counts for a somewhat reasonable price).","if so, count me in.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

glad that theyâ€™re getting back into the ws lineup-including ocable â€œxâ€ skus-as well as how intels new mcm architecture performs!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 13700k and 13900k will probably perform better than these ""budget"" 6 and 8 core xeons in benchmarks that don't stress memory bandwidth.",edit: these low-end xeons will likely only end up in oem pre-built workstations since diy builders will be looking for xeons with more than 8 cores or simply go for the 13900k or ryzen 7950x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so the 56 core xeon will be overclockable too?,excited to see the power draw lmao,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">oh good, skus that will let my employer think he bought a high end workstation but he actually just bought an expensive i5.",an expensive i5 that can use expensive ecc ram memory.,the pack comes together.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[expensive i5](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/121500/intel-core-i57640x-xseries-processor-6m-cache-up-to-4-20-ghz/specifications.html) - which into the bargain meant that you'd have to work out which dimm and pcie slots wouldn't work if you used one.,if this rumour is broadly correct then the 3000 series and 2000 series will either repeat the mistake or require different motherboards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they will provide *alternatives.,* but not good ones.,"the efficiency gap between amd and intel is huge right now, on desktop chips 170 vs 250 watts for similar performance isnt huge, but on high core count chips intel is showing number that use 200% the power of equivalent amd chips.","so on server/hedt with intel it's pick your poision, either 50% the performance or 200% the power draw :(",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
these are hedt.,"well more specifically:

w-3400 is ""expert workstation"" aka workstation and w-2400 is ""mainstream workstation"" aka hedt.","in this case even the ""expert workstation"" is actually more hedt-ish than traditional workstation in that most of the parts will be sold boxed.",it's clear that overall this is essentially a hedt revival.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how is it misleading?,it never said only and stating the lower end skus isnâ€™t misleading,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yup, my i7-5820k system has done sterling service over the last 8 years, and i don't regret building it over a similarly-priced i7-4790k system (the ddr4 bumped up the cost of choosing the 5820k, but i got a rebate on the cpu and x99 motherboard, making them about the same prices as a 4790+z97 board), even if the 4790k was faster ""in a straight line"".","i've been waiting for a decent hedt upgrade for a few years, though!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the 20 core sounds like it doesn't have a big price premium over the xx900k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is just a rumor though.,but it might also be a special design for data bandwidth per thread.,all kinds of weird designs are made for specialized needs.,amd for example has an epyc sku with just single core active per chiplet to maximize cache and data bandwidth per core.,that's a $3000 8 core.,or it could be basically a cheap design for the bulk workstations that don't actually need much computational power but the oem benefits from having them on the same platform with the bigger ones.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
does the i5 have ecc?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
double the memory support due to quad channel.,it's for when you want to load something enormous into ram and only need one or two cpus to do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i donâ€™t think anything they announce is delayed.,they havenâ€™t afaik announced any sapphire rapids products yet.,but intel has a habit of talking about their future products pretty early on so any delays in the roadmap are very visible.,that being said sapphire rapids is very badly delayed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's true, but in previous years, the skus with fewer cores also get fewer pcie lanes.","in the rumor/leak the article is about, all the 6-10 core skus have half as many pcie lanes and memory channels as the rest of the lineup.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

and even if them dual rank a die sticks do turn out to be the magic bullet my pc needs for 64gb in dual rank
what should i do fire up my time machine and go forward a year to when i can actually buy them
then go back to november 2021 when i actually got mine and give them to myself?","i built pc 1 for a family member had murder getting it stable at 4800 with 2 x 32gb of ddr5  on release
i did what any person with a brain would do and decided to send my ddr5 board back and keep my ddr4 for another generation and run it as fast as i could 

and it was a wise decision my pc gets much better fps than the family members
if you guys dont like that i dont really care

maybe i would come close to my ddr4 fps with that a die or maybe i would only get it stable at much slower speeds due to imc problems thats â£600 im not willing to spend  for -20% to +5% until i upgrade again on 15th gen

lets face it to get the same gaming performance on the 90% of games that prefer latency over bandwidth as my tight sub timings 4100 gear 1 cr1 i would need something like 8200 cl30 cr1 yes yes i should roll the dice again 
pick up a â£600 ddr5 board then spend â£600 on ram then just hope it hits stupid speeds that nobody has been able to get yet on dual rank and that my board adds cr1 support for ddr5

wrong.,intel pl1 and pl2 are 253w.,motherboards out of box without pressing anything in settings are releasing unrestricted power limits that are not what intel has in spec for 13th gen. and the tau thing yes you are correct on that.,they will boost however long they can.,but anything over 253w is not stock and is an overclock.,even intel themselves have said that.,donâ€™t confuse the 2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sorry but thatâ€™s literally impossible with intel guidelines.,the upper limit would be 39k.,anything above that is overclocked territory.,keep in mind motherboard come out of box overclocked.,so even if you didnâ€™t touch anything itâ€™s still technically an overclock,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

wrong.,intel cpus have not followed pl1/2 since 95w days.,nor is it an enforced spec but merely guidance on how to design your power delivery and cooling solutions.,intel allows for motherboard vendors to design their boards to deliver whatever it can and run unlimited to the max cooling potential.,"out of box with my asus board and my dark board, both will pull whatever it needs to deliver the clocks provided the cooling is there.","that is stock behavior, and saying i need to go into the bios to limit this would no longer be stock as i am changing defaults.",the mce argument died with 12th gen when they fully removed any time limit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"youâ€™re right, but the conception of stock is kinda a moot point with 13th gen. stock more means running it without manually doing anything.",stock requires manual configuration on every motherboard.,"also, iâ€™ve heard the 13th gen is meant to thermal boost until it throttles, part of the design, which is why the motherboard manufacturers set it the way they do",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i did notice in the hwinfo cpu area it did say yes in the thermal throttling section but yeah for sure didnâ€™t go over 92 max it was usually in the 80s during r23.,"itâ€™s harder for me to determine thermal issues with these chips because they run so hot, are you running windows 11 or 10?",iâ€™m on win 11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i dont care what you believe and i didnt say its limited to that but odds are against you due to imc and ram availability at that density and such

firstly he is only using single rank 16gb sticks
secondly dual rank is much harder to drive at higher speeds
and i can pretty much guarantee he isnt 100% stable at that speed

show me him running 30000% karhu and his voltages to achieve that

i am going on my experience stabalizing a 4800 set at 4800 with a 12900k and it wasnt simple or easy nevermind 8400",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no im saying its a lottery and in my case it was 4800max karhu stable, 5600 if you dont care about stable which most people here dont seem to care about

i can run this pc that im on now at 4400 ddr4 gear1 but its not stable so zero use to me 4100 is the max its 100% karhu stable",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wrong again.,alder lake 12th gen followed the pl1 of 125w and pl2 250w if you turn off the unrestricted power.,itâ€™s up to the motherboard vendors what they allow out of the box.,again.,just because intel allows the motherboard to unrestrict power does not mean it is stock.,it is still an overclock!,mce is on out if box not because intel has it stock.,because motherboard vendors have it on to give more performance.,stop confusing the two.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah its a fair point.,intel kinda just said fuck it and went full blast,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
im on windows 11. i have mce enabled so it does go instant 100c but i can get 360w peak.,i feel like 285w is a little low for r23 if you have unlimited power.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
his latest vid was 1 hour 20 mins stable (atleast).,do you really believe you need to reduce frequency by idk 2000-4000 to get it rock stable?,"i know he got 32 gigs here, but you are just so wrong if you think you can only have potato frequency with dual rank sticks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wrong.,changing values in the default bios is no longer stock.,"most users never enter the bios, too complicated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i agree.,itâ€™s a weird time to get back into building a pc.,"last time i did it was 2600k build and that would overclock awesome but never got to 90 and high temps back then would scare the shit out of me, or make me think my cpu was gonna die.",now people seem to accept it and not worry about degradation so much.,time will tell i guess,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i was thinking the same thing, i did see 4095w in hwinfo so i assume it was unlimited but i donâ€™t know for certain if mce is enabled as i only enabled xmp in bios, would it be on by default?",another thought i had was pinning the cpu at 100 min state in the high perf plan in windows,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dude 1 hour 20mins?,"really that is not stable thats stable ish at best
i do a 30000% karhu run thats over a day for 64gb

"ok dude, whatever.",believe whatever you want to then.,if you ask intel they will tell you itâ€™s an overclock themselves.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i found the reason.,"it's the cpu current limit, defaulting to 307a on my asrock board.",increasing it made the clock speeds match up with what i was seeing elsewhere.,i will keep it at the default of 307a however.,i was getting significantly lower power consumption in games with that limit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for posting this.,i have been fighting with my msi z790i board ever since i dropped a 13900k in it.,i was limited to \~220 watts which forced the 13900k down to 5ghz allcore.,upped the current limit and everything is working as expected now with a mild underclock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
glad i was able to help someone else out :) but be careful with your chip.,"i'm keeping the default 307a for now, it's not just an asrock thing but intel's default spec as i later found out.","with this limit, the temps and power are no worse than my 12900k while clocking ever so slightly higher, and the extra eight e-cores appear to be free in terms of power consumption, which impressed me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

how can intel ensure that the undervolting is not blocked if it's not their decision anymore?,intel has introduced a feature allowing a particular motherboard vendor to decide whether to block the undervolting.,"also, which is more frustrating, according to the ""recommended bios settings"" the undervolt protection should be enabled by default.",a vendor needs to make an extra step to disable it or add a setting allowing changing it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this doesn't really clear anything up.,"perhaps if anyone updates to latest bios and tries to undervolt, they could confirm here by listing their motherboard details (exact model, version and revision), and also whether or not the uvp option is there, whether it can be enabled/disabled, and whether they have successfully disabled it and undervolted?",this would be a big help to anyone wanting to uodate their bios.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"this post confirms the following:

1. intel introduced a new feature called undervolt protection.",it effectively blocks the undervolting and is deployed using bios updates.,2. each vendor decides whether to enable this feature by default and include a setting in the bios.,so now intel can say that they do not block the undervolting.,that's something evil vendors did.,"3. now there's no guarantee that if you buy a z-series motherboard and unlocked cpu, you will be able to undervolt.",it depends on the motherboard vendor and its policy.,i have made an additional research regarding undervolt protection and published it here: [intel undervolt protection](https://www.reddit.com/r/overclocking/comments/10ojbbq/intel_undervolt_protection/).,"also, i found, that the undervolt protection setting is completely missing on 12900hk and, probably, 13900hk systems.",i'm talking about hidden settings here.,on other systems it may be ignored by firmware or not work properly.,"probably, that's because some vendors are using the ""undervolt protection"" setting to control another feature called ia cep.",as for the undervolting through the bios it does not work properly with the undervolting protection enabled.,"there are settings to specify the negative voltage offsets, but if you specify even a tiny offset (30-40mv, for example) and have the undervolting protection enabled, the system will be very slow.","xmg [described a similar issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/xmg_gg/comments/10qveay/launch_xmg_neo_e23_with_rtx_40_and_intel_core/), but in their case the system wasn't able to boot even with the minimal 30mv undervolt.",the cpu locks the clocks to 400mhz.,"it's not an issue with a cpu, because i reached -150mv before on the same system and had zero issues on the previous bios version.","also, tools like throttlestop and hwinfo show that there are no voltage offsets applied.",i've seen a similar behavior on other systems.,the intel cep was enabled in all cases (on the old and new bios).,i've checked that as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the tl;dr is basically close to identical to 12400f in games and probably need to be using something close to 3080/6800xt for the cpu to start becoming the weaker link, as most of his results are hitting gpu bottlenecks with a 3060ti.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i bought the 13400 due to setting a budget and it being more than i need and being the only intel chip in my budget of 13th gen. amd rigs had a few chips but nothing with ddr5 support that wasnâ€™t more than the intel build,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

they are all shit and intel quietly released them with no review samples.,they suck and you shouldn't buy any of them really.,the best of the 13th gen non k chips are just 12th gen chips with a few mhz higher clocks.,the worst have cache sizes so small they will suck for gaming.,plus a lot of them are just alder lake anyways.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i view the arc a770 as somewhat of an investment because theyâ€™re more than likely going to be collectorâ€™s pieces in 5-10 years.,especially the 16gb model.,"other than that, i think itâ€™s a safe purchase if youâ€™re patient.","intel supports their products for a long time, unlike amd that has dropped support for gpus after only ~5 years (rip fury x, rip r9 390).",performance and vram amount is pretty good at the $350 the 16gb model is currently priced at.,"this is coming from someone than ran amd gpus from 2011-2017 though, so iâ€™m more used to dealing with dog shit drivers and other bugs lol.",remember to take care of yourself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a770 preforms pretty well imo, obviously far off from high-end nvidia/amd but yea; i play in 4k and most games are 60+ fps at mid-high settings, including mw2

a770 is a good gpu that is slowly getting better over time.,however either get a 6650xt/6700/xt for better performance and drivers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i replaced my 1080ti that i had bought new as a nvidia fe preorder that was dying slowly with an a770 16gb.,itâ€™s more than enough for 1440 gaming (a bit quicker than a 1080ti) for me and the only game i have had real issues with is darktide where it basically just doesnâ€™t work.,drivers have come a long way since launch so the real question is if you are ok with itâ€™s level of performance with maybe some bugs here and there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you could do worse for the price.,"it's terrible with older titles (dx10 or under), but does okay with dx11 and dx12.","drivers are still quite unfinished, so the card is very much still a work in progress.","some stuff will run fine, other things will run like ass, or have lot of graphical glitches or issues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

or

&#x200b;

leave it there and don't worry about it.","it's fine, really",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it doesn't matter, no pins contact that part of the cpu but it also looks incredibly easy to take off with your finger nail or tweezers, so idk why you can't remove it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the sticker won't affect anything.,"if anything, it'll just fall off on its own after you use the cpu due to the heat.",there's just empty air there anyway on the socket too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they also writ on the sticker when placed after on cpu or before?,i definitely remove the sticker and check underneath.,"i never seen this, so it pisses me off.",i would be pissed off if i bought this.,hammer time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
im running a pc with that sticker inside for 8 years not a single problem.,that's completely fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's just covering resistors, but i'd still try to remove it because it might burn.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"like most people say, this is fine and doesnâ€™t influence anything.",itâ€™s usually used by certain sellers to mark for warranty purposes.,i personally would advise you to remove it if it doesnâ€™t affect your warranty from the seller.,there have been some shady sellers use it to cover up missing capacitors located there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it should be fine to use the processor as is, but if you're worried, use some alcohol to loosen the adhesive without damaging the processor.",might be a good idea since the processor will likely get hot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the sticker will come off with a little isopropyl alcohol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don't worry these aren't pins,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ah shit, chinese seller",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
use isopropyl alcohol no problem...and remove each and every single piece of paper....isoprophyl wont harm the chipset... don't use any other heating substance or any other tinner liquid...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not pins and you can just install it and never think of it againâ€¦.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol!,[gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i saw this problem on intel cpus as well.,you just have to remove that sticker for the cpu to work properly.,but make sure you remove it really carefully,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"those are not pins, sir",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your bigger issue is that that marking only appears on es and qs samples -- this is almost certainly not a retail model.,this is a grey-market chip.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it should be fine but iâ€™d definitely remove it if it was me for heat reasons.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mainly no-contact components in the center  (caps).,"iâ€™d still remove it as paper blocks heat, so will impede heat distribution for the center of the chip.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"great, thank you!",so leaving that sticker on (not that i can easily remove it) should be okay?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nope, those are pads.",pins are in the socket.,edit: by â€žthoseâ€œ i mean â€žthe things on the outsideâ€œ.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
those are pads.,the pins are in the socket.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"those power delivery components can hit upto 100â°c, and that sticker might hamper thermal dissipation.","most cpus have temp sensors only in the cores so you might not be aware itâ€™s cooking & lowering lifespan :/ 

remove the stickers with isopropyl alcohol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
soaking it in isopropyl would get it off easily though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
exactly.,"and who knows, it might even help with thermal dissipation.",i donâ€™t understand these people getting bent out of shape.,"have you seen kapton tape, conformal coatings, and flux?",icâ€™s donâ€™t care about looks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you got it from a refurb store, typical chinese factory will do inhouse qc on all the chips and those that pass the check will have a tamper proof sticker like this one with the check dates and some initial.","it act as a warranty sticker for the store also, do not remove it unless you are sure the chip is working fine.","if you break something when removing it not only you got a dead cpu with missing smd, you also have a invalidated warranty sticker.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don't listen to anyone who tells you it's going to be fine.,its absolutely not fine.,do a simple google search on an intel 12th gen cpu and see if you can find one that has a sticker on the same spot as yours.,you won't find any.,remove it before installing!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably refurbished and it's a qc verification sticker,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do not use goo gone on electrical components.,"it is oil based, and can be electrically conductive.",you are asking for something to fail using it on a complex substrate like a pcb/cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
capacitors actually.,"100â°c doesn't pose any fire hazard, the worst that would happen is the glue dries out and the sticker falls off.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which marking?,the sticker?,"if people are wondering why there is chinese language there, i live in china.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it will not change anything related to heat lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
remove with ipa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it might not last long being exposed to the heat, but it wouldn't gurt your system as far as i can see",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that sticker should not be there and should be removed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nope, those are components.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the question is why bother if it doesn't come off easily?,"i'd probably warm it up slightly with a hairdryer to soften the glue and clean it up with isopropyl alcohol personally, but if op doesn't want to tinker with it, there really is no reason to do anything.",it won't have any impact on the functionality of the cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just because intel didn't put it there doesn't mean it's hurting anything.,if it's easy to remove then remove it.,if it's a pain in the ass then just leave it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is absolutely fine.,what do you think the problem is?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah i get that, but don't put it in the damn pins though",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"been using it for years on pcbs, dram sticks, gpus.",itâ€™s fine as long as you clean it well.,but you do you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no iâ€™m saying cpu heats up and melts that adhesive and paper, who knows really tho i wouldnâ€™t like it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"mmmm....beeeeer.... little ipa for the chip, a little ipa for me.","a little ipa for the chip, a little ipa for me",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
warranty void if removed?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
prob too late now but in this situation i would just send it back.,"it is gonna take a lot of scrubbing with ipa to get the glue off, and there will still possibly be traces.",he shouldn't risk breaking the warrantee to fix somebody else's mistake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
run it for a while.,power off the system.,remove the cpu.,remove the sticker thanks to the softened adhesive.,(/s btw),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the chinese put those stickers everywhere on used parts for warranty purposes / to prevent tampering.,never removed one and never had an issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i was refering to what the commenter above said, they called the things on the outside â€žpinsâ€œ.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the part in the middle are various components, the part surrounding it are the pads.",lga cpus donâ€™t have any pins.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm uncomfortable with the idea of something remotely combustible being trapped in a small pocket under a component that can sit at up to 100 degrees c for long periods.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its not suppose to be there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
couldn't that sticker cause problems with the mounting pressure of the cooler?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i mean sure, if you have an ultrasonic cleaner handy, by all means go ahead and clean your board with an oil based solvent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ipa = isopropyl alcohol lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the retailers didn't want op to remove it, so yeah warranty void probably",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would just use a hair dry on it for a bit should come right off,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ummm, so we still call them ""pins"" even given that they're actually configured as flat landing pads.",source - am a chip designer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the flashpoint of normal paper is 233 degrees, you'll be fine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ipa 99 is so pure, it evaporates.",will never be stuck in some pocket that isnâ€™t also exposed to air.,"if ipa99 is used, and you let it sit out for even just 15 minutes it will have all evaporated.","source:  i use ipa 99 all the time and it evaporates nearly instantly, to the point that i need to limit how much i have exposed to air in my container.","if i pour a small dish to use with qtips and walk away, when i come back a short time later itâ€™s literally all gone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"correct, it's not supposed to be there.",but it being there doesn't hurt anything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, if you look at the cpu socket for this cpu there is a hole in the center, that's where this sticker goes.",i'd say there is a 1% or less chance this sticker causes any issues by just leaving it.,"however, the capacitors under there are used for power delivery and having any of them damaged could break the cpu.","so, i would just leave the sticker.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i do, but i donâ€™t use it for spot removal of cleaner.",iso and a qtip is fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's a gif tho,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

warranty stickers are unenforceable in the us  afaik,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol no.,iâ€™m actually in the semi industry (which is what itâ€™s called) and you sound like some kid.,https://i.imgur.com/bus4jmb.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it already looks like a chunk has melted out the left.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the sticker not the isopropyl.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it will almost certainly be crispy and fall off the first time itâ€™s removed from the socket, yep.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's a bit harsh of a response.,even people that build their own computers can have limited knowledge.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ikr, people should stop using ipa when referring to isopropyl alcohol.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not everyone lives in the us.,i've seen some retailers put their warranty date stickers in the same spot(in case that the purchaser loses his receipt) here in asia.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
unexpected and funny.,i like ur style.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you funny.,hehehe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nah the borders are too clean it is a cut,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the entire idea of having a discussion about iso burning or the sticker with someone with the username mrfahrenheit\_451 absolutely makes me laugh.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ah, i thought you were saying the combustible part was droplets of ipa left behind from removal.",my bad.,i hadnâ€™t eaten yet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you know what, it was pretty harsh, iâ€™m gonna remove it.",but people who have no clue how little a sticker matters need to not be making comments giving their â€œadviceâ€.,manufacturers put stickers on a lot of components under the hood.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm animated.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this was the first place i've ever seen anyone say ipa for iso.,"in the circles i travel it's just called ""iso""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and paper doesn't melt..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"but look at it, why is there a portion burnt be or melted lol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's probably where the op tried to peel it off initially and failed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"from my understanding, this was expected.","the market is saturated, unlike the last 3 years.","also, it wasn't the highest yearly loss, but it was the highest quarterly loss if what i read was correct.","this is why they're pushing meteor lake, despite the timeliness being screwed up.",going to a 4nm process will be huge cost savings on the server side of the business and give businesses an incentive to upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"it will get better, but very slowly.",the problems are very easy to see on the mobile end of things.,not just intel.,intel: xe-lpg with raytracing for meteor lake.,"but no xe2 or new microarchitecture until lunar lake in 2025.

buy the dip!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just because it was expected does not mean it is okay.,also the expectations were better for future quarters before er.,how it is much worse than expected can be understood with a small look at ah stock price change.,at the moment it looks more and more like a failing business that is betting all their hope to new fabs.,i hope it works.,"more companies in any sector, better for the customers.","on server side, amd is not the real threat but rather biggest ones such as amazon and microsoft is getting more and more independent with their server hardware.","of course  intel has so many patents and licence for lots of things so even with decrease in sales, it will be still a slow bleed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not too big concern imho, once intel 3, 4 is in mass production (h2 this year and next year) it's right around the time the covid-era pcs need to be upgraded.","also keep in mind that intel is like 1-2 nodes behind their competitors, yet no one is able to take the performance crown from them yet.","next year will be interesting, i don't think amd will have a clear answer for intel's next gen cpus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
everything is going according to plan /s.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hopefully this happens on all financial reports this year.,intel needs to be forced to pull their head out of sand and finally change their structure so they can develop technology more efficiently.,they just can't keep the same tactic from 2000s in 2023.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel: we're going to raise prices, you better buy at higher prices.",consumers: nah.,"intel: e-cores, get your e-cores.",why would we give you cache and higher frequency on mid-range gaming builds?,better buy them.,consumers: nah.,intel: *shocked pikachu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"now that amd reported good results by eating intel's lunch, you can see it's not a industry wide problem.",it's an intel problem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the losses are within guidance, so as expected.",also the full year was still net positive in terms of money flow so itâ€™s not like they are in trouble in the short term.,but in long term they will have to adjust for not being a monopoly anymore.,"the market isnâ€™t growing indefinitely, there are only so many data centers the world needs and only so many laptops people buy per year.",i would say that within 2-3 years time frame the key is 20a succeeding.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it was somewhat expected, but they still missed revenue by quite a bit.","if the ceo is believable, then they missed revenue targets by even their own internal projections, not just external wall street projections.","there's a bad sign, and is a clear indicator that there are other things going on that intel hasn't come to terms with.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they actually have *real* competition now from amd, after having pulled their anticompetitive shenanigans for the last 20 years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you know why people shouldn't take securities buying advice from folks around here?,we had people like you saying the same thing last year when they dropped to $50.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"amd is a huge threat, wth are you talking about.","their data center business is growing 45% year over year and continues to gain momentum, eating away at intel's marketshare.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"also 100% betting all on idm 2.0, they are switching to a foundry model like tsmc (of course they will still make their own chips)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's not just amd they're losing to in the server space.,"it's also nvidia, as more users move towards multiple accelerator cards like gpus for their compute needs, instead of just adding more cpus.","so as a proportion of a complete system's price tag, someone like nvidia is potentially getting 8 times the amount of money per sale as intel.","arm as well, such as amazon expanding their offerings with graviton-based instances (ie.","cash not spent on buying x86 parts), google heading in that direction, qualcomm as well putting an arm-based option on the market.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why would covid era's pcs need to be upgraded?,"i am still on a 4790k, and yeah it is very old now, it can still run plenty of games, i cant imagine a covid era pc (which is only like 3 years ago) would need to be upgraded at all?",?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
amd very solidly took the performance crown from them if you can use avx512.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the performance, price, and wafer footprint of the e-cores help give intel healthy margins against the higher performing amd chips with more cache and all large chips.",today still most consumer software will not fully saturate 16 threads of full size cores let alone fully saturate the smaller e cores.,so most high performing gaming applications still benefit greatly from single core boosted performance.,that is to say that most of our cores in our cpus today is wasted just idling away.,better to idle smaller e cores than larger full cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the mid range is pretty impressive though for application performance with the e-cores..  

and for corporate laptops theyâ€™re great for running the 35 security agents in the background.",but yeah not the right time to raise prices.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
youâ€™re being dramatic.,my 6700k way back in 2015 set me back $360.,i picked up a 13700k last year for only $390 shortly after launch.,$30 in 7 years is nothing.,the i9 6900k was $1100 at launch and now i9s can be had for under $600.,mid range cpus have stayed mostly the same price while high end cpus have dropped significantly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i thought the actual eps were below estimated eps.,looks like i'll have to go check those numbers again.,still those gross margins are a big yikes compared to years past.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[removed],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, this is categorically wrong.",these numbers are actually quite a bit worse than the guidance intel put out previously.,that is a clear indicator that until hasn't come to terms with how uncompetitive their products actually are.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"revenue [guidance](https://www.intc.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1586/intel-reports-third-quarter-2022-financial-results): 14-15b$

this guy probably bought the dip on enron.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the pc space is definitely saturated â€” a lot of unusual (above expected) pc and related purchases during 2020-2021 to support changes to the workforce related to covid.,"last year, (q3-q4) we finally caught up on gpu demand and thereâ€™s a lot of downward pressure on gpus.",server (/cloud) is still quite strong and this is where intel is falling down hardest.,"but youâ€™re right - intel saying the market is saturated, while true â€” hides the fact that intel is not as competitive as they need to be.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
apple was a major customer loss.,they accounted for a lot of revenue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's probably more all the laptops purchased for covid, which generally don't last as long as a desktop.","i'd say once they start hitting 4-5 years old, many of them will be needing replacement for one reason or another.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so in an extremely specific use case which 99% of people wouldnâ€™t even know about, or much less, consider in a new chip.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
those e-cores have the same ipc as your 6700k but they share their cache and suffer from latency.,"if you want ecc to go with those skylake performing e-cores, you can look forward to shelling out another $500+ for a w680 mobo..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which ones are not?,intel guided $63-64b revenue and got $63.1b.,as they say itâ€™s in the lower end of the guidance but still within guidance.,earnings per share are also approximately what they predicted it would be.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
eps is the number that matters for a publicly traded company.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's not exactly sound reasoning because you could say the same thing about any company that's not on the verge of bankruptcy and that's a pretty low bar.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
havenâ€™t had a 6700k since 2016 but the e-cores in the newer cpus are fine for their intended use.,the average person has no need for ecc and would be better off getting a higher-end z790 board than sacrificing performance and money on something irrelevant.,iâ€™m usually running my 13700k with e-cores disabled and p-cores at 6ghz so e-core are just a nice to have.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

they guided loss per share.,nobody claimed it was a good quarter.,they didnâ€™t predict a good quarter.,the question was was this as expected.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""consensus was .20, and they did .10"" is not hitting guidance lmao.",they also had to lower guidance even more next quarter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the big one is competition, but there is a wrinkle to it.",nvidia has so much control of the market and spends so much that they're reliably at the top.,"what this means is that not only do they outperform, but they also outproduce.","the issue is that if amd or intel do not have the *supply* to compete with the sheer amount of cards nvidia pumps out, they're not really incentivized to lower prices.","and if they do, they'll sell out and scalpers will get them, and they'll fall further behind since they have less r&d.","so in a weird way, it's better to charge the market rate for the supply you have and pump the maximum into r&d so you can compete more in the future.","basically, you can't take marketshare unless you also have the supply to take marketshare *and* nvidia doesn't drop prices to match you to bleed you dry.",that's why rdna2 msrp's were what they were.,although amd is fine going under those msrp's when it needs to.,"in the past i've been down on arc's pricing because they're priced right in line with amd cards it competes with on performance, despite having a ton of issues in older titles and as a result not selling well.",intel also has more r&d than nvidia and amd put together so it's not like they needed the money.,"but now that they're dropping the a750 msrp to 250 and there's new drivers, i'm a lot more optimistic.","with other markets like phones, this isn't as much of an issue because improvements are slower, they're not all priced in line with performance, and you can offer other things to entice people.",oneplus for example was able to get in with the oneplus 3 because it was a little over half the price of the s7 but had a metal back and the same processor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
software features are just as important as hardware specs.,a770 was a promising product.,first gen gpu with good driver upgrades.,if they keep fixing it.,they have my money for next gen gpu.,meanwhile nvidia and amd are leaving budget segment wide open for intel for now.,nvidia is obviously superior when it comes to software features.,"amd is just there, selling every card they are making.",business is good for both brands.,"as someone else said already, microsoft should do something in hardware space.",they are the ultimate boss when it comes to software support.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nvidia has market dominance in gpus.,amd is bleeding money and posting big losses in this area.,having 3 gpu manufacturers is great for competition.,but amd doesn't seem seriously interested in the gpu sector and their 2022 financials explain why.,intel could attack the low-mid end gpu market but i doubt there is enough $ there to motivate them to do so.,and their bleeding financially too.,it only seems to be worthwhile at the very top where nvidia can charge obscene prices.,"i foresee a decade of stagnant gpu technology where nvidia controls the market, charges thousands per card, and intel/amd simply price fix to avoid significant losses.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i agree.,i feel that a big part for me is the cost of the card.,"i totally understand that i just stepped up from 3930k and 770 era, that i can not have those pricing as it was a decade ago, but as gamers nexus and linus and other larger authorities have pointed out that the gpu manufacture cost has not risen that much to warrant double the price hike.",thank you for your time and input.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is not a new thing.",the market has always been like this.,most game developers target mid range cards because that is where the most people are.,then they try to add a little extra icing on the cake to push the boundaries a little.,"the people who buy the flagship cards do it so they can a: brag about it, b: make the money back in some way, or c: have some longevity before needing to replace it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"agreed, no one is competing at the low end like intel right now.",to be clear they are also in stock everywhere lately and intel has come under pressure from regulators because its hurting the market where amd can't make as many units and take the risk.,there's also new chinese and russian chip makers coming to the market and intel has to succeed both financially and politically.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think you can easily get a gpu from amd/nvidia for the same price range you're talking about that can also run most games if not better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's really not how anything works.,"you make an efficient architecture and generally because of the basic design of a gpu, you can scale it up or down.","if hte high end is way more efficient, so is the low end.","arc isn't magic because it's mid range, it's a large core for not much performance being sold likely under manufacturing costs because performance/mm^2 or performance/watt aren't great.","a more efficient architecture is better in a high end, midrange or low end card.",arc isn't a shift in anything at all.,"it's just a mid range card being sold at a lower end price because it's inefficient, nothing more or less.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> while nvidia and amd compete for the high end, most people won't even need high end graphics anymore - they just want something affordable that can play most games well.",i doubt the statement of high-end becuase we have yet to see what intel will do with battlemage enthusiast category on pricing.,maybe intel can sell a topline enthusiast battlemage gpu with a theoretical 5090ti or 6090ti performance in mind for $500.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they would need money dearly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

maybe theyâ€™ll do a 500 series with the â€˜alchemist refreshâ€™ later this year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a770 supports freesync though.,what monitor is that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is some inflation going on in the gpu perception.,one might think that a card comparable to 3060ti in performance is way behind.,but if you look e.g.,"at steam hardware stats, the most popular gpu is not 3080 or anything close, but gtx 1650, followed by gtx 1060, then rtx 2060. and a770 is faster than all of those (i think a750 too).","so they don't have to catch up that much, they are already quite powerful, they're just not at the top of the performance hill.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as new build with a 4080 i agree on one of these.,potential longevity for the next 5 years want to max out 1440 uw at ultra settings and get butter smooth fps.,why?,i've spent over a decade on laptops and always compromising image quality to get something just playable.,no more!,from here on in i can move at dizzying frame rates without stutter!!!,i also see a trend towards better graphics in most aaa titles and higher requirements to push it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it makes building a pc fun when its affordable.,you can spend more money on an aesthetic rather performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"theyâ€™re trying to make money, not lose it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"plus, if developers want to capture the mass audience demographic is to conform with the most popular gpu's.",intel can shift the goalpost if they provide low end budget gpus that most people can be priced in.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
those are laptop gpus.,that's why they're so popular in steam survey,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes they do.,the reason the 1650 has bigger numbers is because of time on market.,low end sells more than the midrange which sells more than the high end.,"that's always been true, but for intel to make profit and continue gpu sales they need a competitive architecture.","selling 400mm^2 chips at the same price that are a similar size on a much older and much cheaper node on a 2 year old architecture and being beaten, is bad.",anyone can take a bigger core and sell it under price to be competitive but you can't maintain sales and make a profit doing that.,intel needs to catch up to being able to make similar sized cores to amd/intel that perform in the same ballpark or it will always be under pricing larger chips to compete which is fundamentally unsustainable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>i also see a trend towards better graphics in most aaa titles and higher requirements to push it.,yep.,i don't see that trend stopping anytime soon.,"if we didn't have a trend toward better graphics we'd all still be playing games that looked like quake, and duke nukem 3d.","until it becomes indistinguishable from real life, we'll probably continue to see attempts to make better graphics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

tsmc & samsung's ""7nm"" = 91-95 mtr/ mm^(2)

intel's ""10nm"" = 101 mtr/ mm^(2)

this is why intel decided to rename their nodes to match them, specifically 10nm esf, the third optimization of their ""10nm"" node, became intel 7. this move is actually industry standard since tsmc & samsung have been slashing the number on optimizations for years, that's where 12, 11, 8, 6 and 4 ""nm"" nodes come from.","the issue of the person you are responding to is that journalists often don't specify the version of ""10nm"" that got renamed, mine is that insisting on mentioning the rename is a double standard since intel didn't do anything its competitors weren't doing already but it's the only one constantly getting called out as if they cheated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

for xmp maybe y-cruncher (10runs) and linpack (50 runs) + 1000% mem test pro / 3-6 runs of tm5 absolut.,for overclocking to find 100% stable ram perhaps double it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yes, it doesn't affect ram compatibility (as in enabling e cores back doesn't change stability of overclock), it's just when tm5 runs on just e cores (which is by default) it error detection reporting is kinda broken and tends to report very late, as in errors detected in first cycle can get reported in 3rd one.",there's also enormous time waste between cycles too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thats not true.,changed ram timings and used mem test pro for maybe 10 minutes and got errors in the logs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you do catastrophic ram timings then ye, it *may* work.",else tm5/karhu obliterates this redundancy in terms of time wasted and error detecting accuracy.,and you don't need to waste more time booting into the pendrive and don't need the pendrive itself too.,"also, mt86 does false positives in hammer row test, which is also an unusable test.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
was no catastrophic timing.,was no timing at all sry.,put from 3200 to 3333 i think.,could game with this for quite some time.,didnt start from stick.,was too lazy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i just installed the previous version of the intel driver no more screen flickering.,and i also have nvidia but doesn't have the need to downgrade that one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
search the driver number (it's in the title of this post) and in the intel website you have the option to choose the previous version before downloading.,and just install it.,it worked for me.,english is not my first language hope my instructions are clear.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the big one is competition, but there is a wrinkle to it.",nvidia has so much control of the market and spends so much that they're reliably at the top.,"what this means is that not only do they outperform, but they also outproduce.","the issue is that if amd or intel do not have the *supply* to compete with the sheer amount of cards nvidia pumps out, they're not really incentivized to lower prices.","and if they do, they'll sell out and scalpers will get them, and they'll fall further behind since they have less r&d.","so in a weird way, it's better to charge the market rate for the supply you have and pump the maximum into r&d so you can compete more in the future.","basically, you can't take marketshare unless you also have the supply to take marketshare *and* nvidia doesn't drop prices to match you to bleed you dry.",that's why rdna2 msrp's were what they were.,although amd is fine going under those msrp's when it needs to.,"in the past i've been down on arc's pricing because they're priced right in line with amd cards it competes with on performance, despite having a ton of issues in older titles and as a result not selling well.",intel also has more r&d than nvidia and amd put together so it's not like they needed the money.,"but now that they're dropping the a750 msrp to 250 and there's new drivers, i'm a lot more optimistic.","with other markets like phones, this isn't as much of an issue because improvements are slower, they're not all priced in line with performance, and you can offer other things to entice people.",oneplus for example was able to get in with the oneplus 3 because it was a little over half the price of the s7 but had a metal back and the same processor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
software features are just as important as hardware specs.,a770 was a promising product.,first gen gpu with good driver upgrades.,if they keep fixing it.,they have my money for next gen gpu.,meanwhile nvidia and amd are leaving budget segment wide open for intel for now.,nvidia is obviously superior when it comes to software features.,"amd is just there, selling every card they are making.",business is good for both brands.,"as someone else said already, microsoft should do something in hardware space.",they are the ultimate boss when it comes to software support.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nvidia has market dominance in gpus.,amd is bleeding money and posting big losses in this area.,having 3 gpu manufacturers is great for competition.,but amd doesn't seem seriously interested in the gpu sector and their 2022 financials explain why.,intel could attack the low-mid end gpu market but i doubt there is enough $ there to motivate them to do so.,and their bleeding financially too.,it only seems to be worthwhile at the very top where nvidia can charge obscene prices.,"i foresee a decade of stagnant gpu technology where nvidia controls the market, charges thousands per card, and intel/amd simply price fix to avoid significant losses.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i agree.,i feel that a big part for me is the cost of the card.,"i totally understand that i just stepped up from 3930k and 770 era, that i can not have those pricing as it was a decade ago, but as gamers nexus and linus and other larger authorities have pointed out that the gpu manufacture cost has not risen that much to warrant double the price hike.",thank you for your time and input.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

amd data center bu is still hiring...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i believe this is the least disruptive discission in a bad climate for intel.,i know it might seem cold but i think the alternative would have been to shed 5-10% of the workforce and make the remaining work overtime.,i mean what do you expect nearly all arms of intel are experiencing serious delays.,"data center, graphics, asics, client, fabrication , etcetc.",why would there not be any consequences?,this move immediately reduces the capital outlay burden on the books by about quarter of a billion.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

can intel bring back brian krzanich?,or at least move pat geslinger along?,"intel needs some swagger to bounce back, not penny-pinching by a far from inspirational leader.","the board really needs to make a change, and it isn't a financial one.",one just needs to compare pat geslinger to dr. su.,"dr. su is brilliant, captivating, and an inspiring leader.","and according to my amd connections, created a great place to work.",bob mansfield is available right?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

pat's not hitting his targets this year lol.,if he did he would be one of the highest paid ceos and at a company that isn't anywhere near the largest or most valuable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
before i left they spent the entire year talking about how they were below market for pay and how they were going to increase the pay.,to cut it so much so soon after that is pretty cringe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i worked for intel for a very long time.,this has been coming for years.,14nm was the last successful start up.,that was 2013.... 10 years ago!!,10nm was a disaster.,if the ireland bluejay project fails they are dead as a company.,in ireland the bonuses and reward system loss will hurt every one.,l7 is not particularly senior.,lower management and senior engineers would be at that level.,5% wipes out the last 2 - 3 pay reviews and this one is gone.,i'd be fuming,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well good for shareholders, they're doubling down on the dividend... at the cost of us employees.","lower pay, no bonuses, no merit increases.",it's gonna be a rough ride for us.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in 2021, gelsinger's total compensation package was $178.59m.","of that, $1.1m was base pay.",cutting base pay is just a rounding error for him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you think he's only paid 1 million a year?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my thoughts right now is that they are going the employee layoff/benefit cut off due to the job market cooling down and also having massive layoffs all over tech.,they are taking advantage of the timing where human capital/talent isnâ€™t in high demand elsewhere.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

didn't intel get funding from the us government for a new plant?,plus tax breaks?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a dividend isn't a cost.,it's a return on capital distributed to the owners of the company.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is a pretty terrible take.,"public exchange listing has trade-offs, as everything in life.","strategically i think it would make more sense to cut the dividend more, yes, but they can just leverage the fact that the job market is cooling down.",i feel it myself.,"a while ago i would get a dozen ppl reaching out on linkedin per month, like pretty much any tech guy.",has decreased by a lot!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
stock based compensation seems like it would be smart and really incentivize people to stick it out through the tough times without touching the dividend.,"but they're not being strategic here, the board and shareholders just want their payout in the short term and they can't see the reality of how a business can't see their revenue get cut in half and keep paying out dividend like nothing happened.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">i wish they would have lead with this when they started the layoffs so i could have requested to get paid to leave and started the job hunt before there were 100k+ people in tech competing for the same handful of open jobs, they intentionally waited until all the chairs were gone and then stopped the music.","unfortunately they can only do iou even if they promised future shares that would be recorded on the balance sheet, then the pay cut would be pointless.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it'll destroy the motivation of high performers.,for useless people they're probably still in golden handcuffs anyway so it won't matter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"from what i've heard from engineers and others here at intel, the compensation is already behind the competition.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

most senior engineers (sr.,staff/principal/etc.),"at intel could triple their salary by leaving for netflix, amazon, or google.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"they're really trying to do it with pricing, not brand.",the margins make this very clear.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wonder if itâ€™s also because of the arc and fab investment.,"not only are they trying to take on amd, theyâ€™re simultaneously trying to take on nvidia and tsmc from scratch.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh it sucks big time.,i'm an hourly employee at ra and nobody is happy in our section.,the recognition system was a pretty decent hit to us along with no raises this year.,the funny thing is that our group is desperately understaffed and they were telling us that decent sized crop of new employees would be added in march before this news hit.,it also hits when our section is making a push for hazard pay due to our constant exposure to the chemical byproducts of chip manufacturing.,doesn't help that portland's cost of living is starting to get california crazy either.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"it does suck, and i'm sorry for you.",can't believe how they are running this timing-wise.,"they had terrible shock in q2 earnings last year and have shifted into constant cost cutting mode; ireland fab pause, job cuts, projects canceled, and now this.",ridiculous lack of foresight from upper-levels imo.,intel already had talent retention issues and weren't known for paying better than their competitors.,"it's not like you don't make a decent pay check at those grades but cutting bonuses, base pay, & falling stock is a lot to take.","take the bonuses fine, i never enjoyed getting them even when i worked there and the whole 10nm clunking was happening.",i would have never planned around my base pay going lower though x.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

iâ€™m approaching my 2 year anniversary as a tech at intel and feel like iâ€™ve just lost all incentive to do anything but the bare minimum to not get fired.,"no opportunity for raises, and significant cut backs to benefits and bonuses.",really feels like they just wanted to do mass layoffs and instead chose to give all their employees their employees the finger instead and hope they get the same results from attrition.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

good bot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the retirement cut is what gets me.,i got in at intel when they had a pension.,then 2 years in they do away with for 401k cause it has the benefit of more money.,now you just cut that out.,sure it's only hopefully one year but that's 2.5% that would compound for the next 20ys,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you considered the many employees hired during the good times in the last two years that werenâ€™t eligible for good bonuses last year?,those that are now having their pay and benefits reduced?,"some of us joined too late for the boom, but in time for the bust.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would much rather get rid of 10% of my team and do more work than take a paycut.,they now need to increase headcount because no one is going to be working.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you see intel as some big vision and dream.,intel sees you as just another wwid.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if intel is gonna get out of this theyâ€™ll need to retain a good chunk of their people, not fire them, then in a year and a half from now try to hire them all back when they need to ramp gnr/sierra forest/lunar lake.","i can understand the move, but to do all of this just so they can not touch the dividendâ€¦.",i donâ€™t get it.,hurt operations just so the stock is a bit more appealing to some boomers looking for cashflow??,lmao.,"you want yield buy treasuries, buy a reit, or best yet buy a rental property.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's way more than a 5% minimum.,the bonuses are easily 10% of t.comp plus 5+% in pay for salaried folks plus 2.5% match on the 401k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ceo made 178 million last year.,the c suits makes most of their money outside of salary anyway so a 25% salary cut isnâ€™t as bad as it sounds.,in comparison lisa siu made 29.5 million.,standard employees lose qpb worth an additional 5% of their pay and 2.5% on 401k matching.,to me it seems like rather than cutting the fat or dropping the dividend they took the cash from employees.,hurt the everyday man but save the stock and avoid bad press of layoffs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think this has the biggest impact in reducing cost.,"intel has very large manpower resource 131,900 employees.","in terms of revenue per capita (employee), amd is usd1.5 million/employee while intel is only usd 0.5 million per employee.","also, intel is too burdened with interest payments on big debts/loans and depreciation costs on too much assets that impact profitability.","when the market has low demand on products and hence low revenues, profit is impacted as you cannot just magically reduce fixed costs of the company.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"mi guessing management is trying to keep stock price up, via the dividend and just waiting it out for a 2024 resurgence when granite, and sierra forest launch, maybe they think cutting the dividend or massive layoffs will tank the stock.",they may feel that the damage to the stock might be irreversible.,"shitty situation all around as employes are the scape goat, i think pat might be genuine in trying to make things right, but i don't know if the board and shareholders will allow him to.",situation is just fucked all around.,id rather just pause and resume the dividend after some time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

but i don't want to work on glued together chips...lol...jk.,that whole back and forth on that is hilarious inter-corporate politics :p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sounds like layoffs are happening in addition to the pay cuts.,i donâ€™t know of anyone in my former team  (salaried) who didnâ€™t work insane hours.,meetings with employees in one country at 7 am.,meetings with employees in another country at 7 pm was a norm for many.,one of my former coworkers was laid off and said my former team was decimated.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"that includes the one time $110m hiring package, which will pay out in 3-5 years if the company hits its targets.","currently $80m of that is trending to zero, and is practically impossible for him to get unless some absolute miracle happens to the share price.","also $10m of it was a match for a $10m intel share purchase that he made with his own money, which has now lost 50% of its value.","his actual yearly compensation for 2023 is about $26m, 90% of it shares.","obviously not bad, but he is also not making hundreds of millions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the vast majority of that compensation is incentive pay he did not obtain.,"media trying to make it out like he received 9 figures in 2022, when he only received 7. that's a big difference.","in 2023, i imagine that will fall to 6 figures unless the market cap doubles or triples.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in salary, yes.","it's 1.1m/year, the rest is in stock, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well thatâ€™s why all these tech companies are timing their layoffs and sharing notes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that would require a level of both cunning and competency which i doubt exists.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i believe that someone asked that question and the rsu are still available for the performance review,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
chips act money hasn't come in yet.,i believe the application process is still ongoing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes and yes lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and the eu too (billions) :d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah but it comes from cash flow which is also an indicator of how healthy a company is.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i donâ€™t disagree with the reality of it and that itâ€™s part of current life.,"in fact, thatâ€™s the actual point.",you are just looking at it from the perspective of the group trying to take advantage of the workers.,iâ€™m looking at it from the worker perspective and wall street forcing corporations to take advantage of the workers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
better they have a good way of locating high performers and provide better deals for them otherwise those high performers will leave for the competition and they will be left with useless people.,i think it is normal for companies to have good and bad years but it can just makes things go south very quickly.,i would definitely prefer layoffs or shutting down branches that doesn't make them money but this.. i am not so sure of... at least the bags i am holding probably not as heavy as many other people.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you're right, it has destroyed motivation.",senior high performers are already looking around.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
welp.,i don't think compensation is great at amd but at least they're not doing layoffs and pay cuts yet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for entry to mid level engineers it is significantly lower than the competition.,when i started at intel as an entry level engineer 4 years ago my salary was the same as the starting salary in 2008. other semiconductor companies in phoenix are offering at least 30% more than what iâ€™m making now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"itâ€™s not bad for engineers (but is much behind for software, compared to big tech at least).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they are spending 20 billion on ramping up the new manufacturing with euv lithography.,amd already paid those costs so itâ€™s not going to be a fair comparison between the two for at least a few years.,but unfortunately that nuance is lost on wall street.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
recognition at least for my team is huge.,i probably got 4k+ from recognitions last year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what are benefits of rule of 75 other than rsu vesting?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don't forget they paid $1.5 billion in dividends *just last quarter*.,nearly $6 billion throughout the whole year.,paying that amount in a single quarter while heavily reducing pay of basically everyone is a slap in the face to all employees.,edit: they announced a $1.5 billion dividend payout 6 days ago.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> ridiculous lack of foresight from upper-levels imo.,upper management is probably afraid of pissing off investors.,it's gonna take a while to get the company running on all cylinders again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"believe me, the pay is nowhere close to enough given how many hours you might end up working as a process engineer.","after spending 50% of your day in meetings and the other 50% preparing to report out in meetings, plus constant firefighting of issues and getting stuck with 24/7 on call every few weeks and being unlucky enough to be in a level 2 or even level 1 task force (weekend meetings), you definitely rack up 50+ hours a week and it can become 60+ in some weeks.",and i know people doing this all on a grade 5 or 6 salary while being gaslit by their managers that they should be grateful that they're getting all these useful learning opportunities.,like the only thing you learn is that this is a toxic industry that wouldn't survive without companies using the h1b to chain people to their jobs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you think cutting pay is better than layoffs?,"i think pay cuts might be better than mass layoffs (with the biggest cuts coming to the ceo/evp's) but have to be justified,and with intel still paying the dividend i don't think its justified.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
any existing employee that falls in those categories are going to get a pay cut starting march 1st.,"the new hires... i doubt they'll see the same treatment,  but who knows.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"theyâ€™re doing paycuts to virtue signal to investors that they are serious about their stock price and cutting back in the face of economic headwinds, without laying off 10% of their workforce.","on the face of this, this looks like a much worse story then google and microsoft and meta cutting headcount, but if you really think about it, intel is actually being more pragmatic and trying to save more peopleâ€™s overall livelihoods then any of these other companies doing layoffs.","ultimately this is still about intel making the most money it possibly can for shareholders, but its just doing it differently then a blanket 7-10% employee layoff across the company.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"lol what do people have to gain by lying about this , such weird behavior by people that think there is some grand conspiracy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe they meant from other subreddits?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they are an intel engineer and gaslighting the crowd... sounds like a normal day at the office.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the apb formula and basis aren't changing.,grants will still happen with the delayed rewards cycle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>you won't get rsus either.,"they didn't explicitly say it, but they said there's no annual rewards; rewards is when you get your performance rating and rsu grants.",i think that's kinda what they want you leave on your own no severance....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i concur.,nothing showing in [the archives](https://www.reveddit.com/v/intel/).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"5% is just the base pay, but quarterly bonuses are gone as well, along with the recognition award cash (that many employees have been abusing for a long time).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yep, and no promotions.",i don't know about other senior people but i'm out.,fuck this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol there are news articles about it.,itâ€™s public.,all my coworkers are upset.,this is company wide 60k+ people affected.,the only other forum iâ€™ve found is thelayoff.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
three months ago we were getting all we could eat free food,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"definitely regret at least not entertaining the severance package during ""volunteer layoffs"".",could have taken that and went to work somewhere else and that would have been better than a year of no raise and no bonuses.,as an hourly employee this is probably a  close to 7k loss.,although... if the company was going to continue to be in the shitter our bonuses would have been shit anyways,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think this makes a lot of sense on the intel side.,in past downturns intel offered people voluntary separation or early retirement.,this helped intel reduce headcount and money for pay.,but it was always bad publicity.,now intel just cuts off bonus and other spending programs and cuts higher up pay.,now if people want to leave they will in theory quit.,now intel saves that money from them quiting.,they don't have to pay out that sum of money that people got with early retirement or separation.,plus if the quit and not get terminated.,intel doesn't have to pay out the unemployment money either,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
broadcom is hiring.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they did not anticipate the slump during the time of massive investments (double whammy for them - increased interest payments on loans and depreciation) and recruitment years ago.,it was a gamble.,"if the market continued upwards, their profits will be enormous.",unfortunately it went south and now they are burdened with increased fixed cost while the revenue continues downhill.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think there will still be series of lay-offs in companies specially those that deal with technology specially in the micro-chip related businesses.,the ones that could possibly remain steady are those that deal with food and agricultural products - basic consumption requirement for people.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it really depends on specialization.,senior graphics/gamdev people are not having a hard time right now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
unbelievable they cut 401k match but no cuts to the dividend.,401k should be the last thing that gets cut.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good for them if they still have a job.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"fair, but imagine 10% of the company being laid off, there's no way my org could support the debug work across all the existing products in flight and coming if that happened.","and those layoffs would likely be worse than act, which was far more demoralizing than a pay cut for many reasons...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"agree with the first part, not necessarily with the second!","but again, i've been fortunate in my career as i've had more ups than downs and only worked under shitty management briefly and gtfo to another team.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i get the r/ antiwork sentiment, lots of people are not as fortunate or have the opportunities that i've had.",but i busted my ass for them and very much take pride in my work.,"so please don't speak for me by saying ""no one"".","some people work for that paycheck, and deal with working on a shitty team, project and/or manager.","that's fine, to each their own.",but it's not how i choose to spend my limited life's energy and time.,as i've had a shitty manager and team members that drain you every freaking day... it's not anything i'd ever want again.,"imo, companies are made of people, the people i choose to work with and the work i do is more rewarding than working for another company and maybe making more money.","but also i'm lucky, i have a job i love, work that is having a direct impact on our products, i have received recognition for my work and have a great organization+team.",i'm proud to be an intel engineer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that 5% number is pretty misleading since the qpb/apb aren't ""bonuses"" they are planned for and factored into your total compensation.",so by cutting those programs most >grade 7s are looking at a 15-20% pay cut.,it'll be more like 30-40% if they also cut the annual stock grant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gotta keep the investors happy that's why the dividend was untouched,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you seen the share price???,that 178 would have been if he hit every target which never happened lmao.,"the point remains that the hit to pat is minimal, but he wasnâ€™t making nearly $200m lol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"he didnâ€™t pocket that money, like 80% of that figure is all stocks contingent on performance.","the qpb and 401k matching getting cut hurts, of course.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it is a common practice at large companies, and once someone gets to the low tier of executive level, they can fail their way up no regardless of how the company is doing.","it is a world of promotions, bonuses and ideally an early retirement with an fu money no matter how stupid they are.","i bet someone got a fat bonus for this ""solution"" to a problem they created in the first place.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"lol, news flash.",you work for the shareholders and it's not an attractive stock right now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wasn't aware of that.,i was under the impression that only less than 300 people were given pink slips.,i am sorry to hear that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't think things are that simple though as doing dividend freezes will immediately tank the stock.,and since most employees especially the big named critical ones are always paid at least partially in stock.,i wonder how possible it would be to retain that talent.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they don't even need to pause dividends, just decreasing them by 10c would make up for the pay cuts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"arguably, but still better than pat geslinger.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cutting dividends is a great way to tank your stock price.,that's probably worse for the employees.,many intel employees are heavily invested (and have been partially compensated) in stock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
he definitely gonna have to settle for the base model bugatti like a peasant.,i couldnâ€™t imagine pulling up to the country club in bugatti chiron knowing that the top g drives a bugatti chiron pur sport,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ah true,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so encouraged to keep dividends high,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is no performance review this year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
application opens this month,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hopefully one of the questions on the applications is â€œhave you laid off any employees in the last 180s daysâ€,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you are right, but the fixed employment already hedges a lot of risks that one would incur working e.g.",as a permanent freelancer.,as freelancer i would earn better than at my current corpo job.,but i would also be among the first ones to get cut.,"i agree those things can always tip over to exploitation - i cannot assess it well enough in the intel case, not sure if their pay is good or shit by respective standards.",but to speak of exploitation would really mean bringing them down into a poverty standard of living - is that really the case?,last comment: actually remarkable to see a case of breaking the downward wage rigidity.,rarely ever happens.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that is why we are keeping stock compensation(rsus) this year as that has been, in general, more stock \~= intel believes in your future.","also heard there might still be a limited budget for grade level promotions, but without pay.",we'll learn more next week!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so why are you at a job for four years when you could have a 30% pay raise?,there must be other factors here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't think the nuance is lost at all.,capex spending is not great but hardly the biggest problem.,there are many other much bigger problems.,"being behind and still on 10nm process is one, keep slipping and not delivering products on time to compete with what's being offered by the competition is another.","79 billions revenue in 2021 down to 63 billions in 2022, then q1 2023 guide down to 11 billions vs 13+ from q1 2022, i think those numbers have sunk in for a lot of investors and for sure 2023 is going to be much tougher than 2022. 

amd is fabless, so they do not have to pay for euv, at least not directly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same here.,"the recognition system was a huge plus in our module and a great motivation tool, especially for us night shift trolls lol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i did not make the $4k you did but it was always nice to see a kudos come along.,even the $25 ones meant someone thought you did a good job and wanted to say thanks.,a nice gesture.,i just cannot believe that we save much from cutting this.,i guess we are down to the old adage of the beatings will continue until morale improves.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"at least you still got recognition, at intel site where i work, recognition system was prohibited to use save for management, 5 years ago.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
now you get an e-rec card..i feel shitty asking my team to do so much and i can't even recognize them appropriately!,it's an insult.,so was that 0.04 bs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good god.,i've never made more than $400 in goodie drawer in a year because our mtl threatens to write us up for giving them out too often.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for us â€œold-timersâ€ we get the proceeds of a medical account which that they used to fund.,"for every year worked, they added x-amount to the fund.",itâ€™s not an hsa.,the purpose is to fund insurance premiums for as long as your particular maximum is reached.,"the program was discontinued several years ago, so newer people might not have heard of it.","there are also accelerated stock options, or is this what you meant?",i think those are the biggies.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think you count as a retiree for things like epp and stuff.,maybe medical plan?,"dunno, i'm not in us...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i can imagine a lot of people checking out at work until they land a new job.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm kinda worried that this might go down as pat's worst decision while intel ceo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hopefully they don't start financing everything with debt just so they can refuse to cut the dividend otherwise they are gonna just turn into at&t.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> don't forget they paid $1.5 billion in dividends just last quarter.,nearly $6 billion throughout the whole year.,paying that amount in a single quarter while heavily reducing pay of basically everyone is a slap in the face to all employees.,"tbf reducing the dividend would be slap to every shareholder (i'm not one of them), and so given the two i think they'd rather reduce employee wages or lay of staff.",ultimately i think wage reduction for everyone makes more sense than lay off.,i would scrap that dividend too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the oncall is such unbelievable horseshit.,the ltd/ltd-m split cut my team from 14 to 5. as a result we go on call *every three weeks*.,"i've never been so tired in my whole life, and the pay is just utter dogshit for the hours.","i'm the only citizen on my team, and the only one with more than a year here is the gl.",now i understand why.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"biggest percentage cut to ceo/evps yes, but in reality, gelsinger salary goes from $1.25 mill to $0.94 mill, saving ~$300k.",purely symbolic for executives; more impact to employees with loss of bonus and recognition awards on top of pay cuts.,"also they have been doing layoffs, they announced that last oct and the business units have been rolling them out recently/currently.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that's exactly my point.,at intel's last conference the presenter told a story about his daughter wanting 2 laptops to justify the 300m numbers instead of data.,assuming other consumers will approach this way which sounds unreasonable.,"intel's official number is 270-295m units, and optimistic of 300m from pat's own words on the call in q&a.",amd's official number currently is 10% below last year.,"last year was 250-270m units, so roughly 225-250m units (depending on if you use idc or other).","december's sell-through was equivalent to a 200m unit year, which could be gigantic miss if purchases don't pick up.","and i agree, that people and businesses who upgraded earlier during covid because of work-from-home and other factors of lockdowns won't be purchasing again anytime soon, so being optimistic of a return to 300m units is naive if you ask me.","there aren't even many/any programs that need extra horsepower these days unless your doing rendering or other heavy workloads, and those aren't the majority of notebook purchases.","so i think intel is going to over-estimate again with their 270-295, and 300 is just outrageous.","q1 may suggest otherwise but consensus is roughly 250m units this year currently, 270 best case.","at this point, q1 is trending roughly equal to q4, and q2 not much better.",but there is hope of a big resurgence in 2h which i don't see happening.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"eh, the problem is they don't give technicians enough responsibility or ownership.",my module is split between development and ramp and the development side of things has the most work and unfortunately the overwhelming majority of tasks are engineer owned because they are creating the experiments for us to run.,now let's think about the hours engineers work.,8-5 with on call after 5. typically most of the work orders are wrapped up before 10pm because they stop putting them in when they go home and the night shift is only there to make sure the place doesn't burn down.,the other problem is at least in the 4 years ive worked there ive noticed that intel hasn't really fostered an environment that encourages going above and beyond to learn and excel in your technician role.,when one of your most knowledgeable technicians who's also on the safety committee and covering for the shift group leader when they are off is still making less than people that get hired on now... it's demoralizing.,why would or should that technician care about the efficiency of an organization that doesn't care about their efforts?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm in operations so there's always something for us to look at, but a tech on the pm side just flat out might not be assigned to something for the day.","if there's no tools that need work, then they likely are just going to sit in cafe or in your case... sit at home and wait for them to trigger a pm.",again... night shift is interesting because if engineers aren't actively triggering things on night shift then all they have to do is continue working on a pm day shift didn't finish or just stay on standby.,i haven't worked nights long enough to fully understand how it all looks yet though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

dont run prime95 small fft on 13900k or u will lose the chip.,you can use karhu ram test or hci mem test or tm5 to test for ram stability.,what i do is i download benchmate and use ycruncher 2.5. if i can pass that run which is only 2 minutes or so then i use those ram test app to verify it.,u can use 1.5v on those ramz.,"if u want it safe, put a fan in those ram stick ro cool it better.i watercool my ram so i use up to 1.7v on those ram and has none issue for 3 4 years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there are many things you can try like upping the voltages (vccsa, ram vdd/vddq, etc.)","or messing with ram timings by upping the timings by one and test again to see if stable, rinse and repeat.",i donâ€™t use msi so i canâ€™t give a more specific advice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it appears i cracked it.,upped the sa/imc by offset of +0.020 and it runs stable in p95 small ffts now.,"msi carbon doesn't have xmp2 option, mind you.",ps i do have one further question that maybe you can advise on?,"occasionally i'll run p95 small ffts and the whole system will absolutely immediately cut out, complete instant restart just after i hit run.","if it does get to run it's stable and fine, but occasionally that instant reboot.",what is that down to... llc?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hmmm iâ€™m not a overclocking expert so i canâ€™t tell you.,but congrats on getting it to work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is your psu?,p95 is power intensiveâ€¦ itâ€™s basically its purpose is high power and heat.,"instability there usually means clocks are pushed too high but you say you are at stock, so iâ€™m thinking something on the power delivery side.","some things to try is disable mce, and ensure your board has the correct power limits set.",iccmax iâ€™m particular some boards will disable by default.,should be set to 360 amps.,sometimes called â€œedp currentâ€ or something along those lines.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah on my board i needed to do 1.15v vccsa and 1.27v cpu vddq.,"usually more cpu vddq makes it easier to post, but too much causes instability.",this is with a 6800 cl34 kit oced to 7800 cl36.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what's the p value on that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you think that buying a build based on lga1700 in 2023 it's a good decision?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"even though i don't have any issues with my 13900k, i really wanna know what my sp value is lol.",i only have a gigabyte z690 auros master mobo though.,:(,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tell that to my 1390kf that won't even boost to 5.8ghz stock unless it wants to pull 1.5v,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i thought this was fairly common knowledge among enthusiasts / overclockers?,it's a known fact among the overclocking community at least that the kf series cpus often have the best silicon bins and hence why they're so coveted in that community over standard k series cpus for record breaking.,it's not something terribly relevant to people who aren't extreme overclockers who are trying to break world records though.,i think the largest benefit to regular users who have this knowledge is knowing that you can achieve stock clocks or higher with a better sp score while applying a rather heavy undervolt to reduce temperatures at the same time.,"this information also isn't universal though, you could go out and buy a kf cpu and wind up with lower scores than a k series cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm guessing that ***if*** the result is true at all though, that the 13900ks would only take away the best bins of the 13900k because it has an igpu, this means that the average silicon quality would be lowered for the 13900k but not the 13900kf.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"here in canada, ks version is about $180cad more vs non ks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they say the difference is 2%.,literally the minimum margin for error in almost any data.,run for run variance will be higher than that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, most likely.","amd does it with their chiplets, so some unicorn ryzen 5800x have two ccds - likely just failed 5900/5950x.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a few months ago i would say no, but meteor lake is rumored to be only mobile chips and likely the reason why there's a rumored raptor lake refresh in q3 2023. lga1700 is on it's way out, but might still have another release in 2023. intel sockets tend to last for two cycles before moving to a new one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends if you have the patience to wait.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"same, but whatever intel xtu 2.0 is telling me my 13900kf is ok to boost to 6.0 on two cores at 1.375v - but also i think all these â€œvaluesâ€ are just as reliant on your cooling setup",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how many watts is that at 1.5v?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 13900ks is already posting ambient cooling results that's above what any 13900k has managed.,"unless you have an excessively well-binned 13900k(f) capable of benching cinebench r23 at 6 ghz p-cores, a new 13900ks will beat it all the time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you care about price/performance, get an i5",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">yes, most likely.","amd does it with their chiplets, so some unicorn ryzen 5800x have two ccds - likely just failed 5900/5950x.",my point is slightly different.. core performance between 13900k and 13900kf should be the same (f=failed integrated graphics).,the best 13900k dies are skimmed off to sell as 13900ks.,the best 13900kf dies will still be 13900kf dies as there is no 13900kfs.,so while paying 13900kf price you may get a die that is capable of 13900ks speed.. but never made it to that bin due to failed internal graphics.. so (at least for me) it's clear that when paying for 13900k grade silicon there may be some out-performing dies in the 13900kf bin that won't be there in 13900k (moved to 13900ks bin) - so maybe this explains the difference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you can use throttlestop to reduce the cpu speed or the power limits or you can do both.,whatever works best for you is ok with me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"run throttlestop, open the tpl window, go to the miscellaneous section, check the speed shift box and change the speed shift max value to a lower number to slow down your cpu.","if your cpu is reaching 100â°c, what you really need is a better cooler or a properly installed one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

most b660 have the ability to enforce strict power limits or don't.,just can't really tweak clock speeds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you cant undervolt any 13th gen cpu with b660 board.,cep cant be disabled.,need z board.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sorry!,typo!,i meant the 13th gen!,changing it now in the op.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you!,"i am confused, why would intel prevent users from undervolting?",isn't the idea of k sku cpu's and z series boards that you are free to overclock your cpu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel cep does not lock the undervolting.,it is some kind of throttling when voltage is too low.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on the board and cpu.,"i'm undervolting a 13600k on an msi b660 board just fine - not sure if it would work with a non-k cpu, though.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sorry i mixed the numbers up!,i meant the msi mag **b760** tomahawk.,but i assume your point still stands.,"if i want to undervolt, i need a k sku cpu **and** a z series board.","&#x200b;

is there a way using a non k sku cpu and a non z series board (in this case a b) to lower the power draw of the cpu?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think, we need to wait for statements from motherboard vendors clarifying their policy in this regard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did i say it locks undervolting?,no i did not.,it doesnt allow undervolt as it tanks the performance.,"thats what i said, and you didnt say anything that would make that statement incorrect.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how exactly are you undervolting and what results are you getting?,because ive seen more than 1 person already unable to undervolt with msi b660 boards.,you cant be different.,"btw, ac/dc adjustment is not the same as undervolting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes it stands.,"i think you need z board, but not necessarily k cpu.","you can still lower ac/dc loadline values on b boards and as a result decrease power usage under load, but its not as efficient as undervolt.",you do too much and you start loosing performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel cep protects the cpu if the voltages are too low.,"from my experience, i've reached a huge -0.17v undervolting and this feature did not throttle or limit performance.",thant's on 12900hk.,"cep creates slightly more problems on desktops under full load, but you need to go really low.","also, this feature can be enabled or disabled right in the bios.","if this setting is missing for some reason, you can disable it through efi variables.",it takes 15 minutes or so.,the internal variable name is **ia cep enable** and its usually located in the **cpusetup** store (0x3).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably some older bios and/or intel me driver that allows it.,might be related to the same way how you can bclk oc 13th gen chips with the bclk oc capable b660 boards [if you don't update the intel me to the newest one apparently](https://www.overclock.net/threads/best-motherboard-for-overclocking-non-%e2%80%9ck%e2%80%9d-intel-processors-12100-12400-12500-12600-13600.1796291/page-6).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it throttles anything above -0.01 offset.,and it cannot be disabled on b660 boards.,"you are talking about laptops, it has little to do with desktop boards and cpus.","on b660 boards cep setting is available in bios, but disabling it does nothing, as its locked.","you disable it, go to hwinfo64, and it says right there that ia cep is still enabled.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel has introduced a new feature called ""[undervolting protection](https://www.reddit.com/r/overclocking/comments/10ojbbq/intel_undervolt_protection/)"" as a part of new bios updates.","it is enabled by default, but some vendors can make it configurable through bios.",today intel officially confirmed it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in his case, he cant be using older bios, because 13600k wouldnt work on b660 board with older bios.",i think he is just mistaking loadline calibration with undervolt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bclk isn't always an exact 100mhz because of spread spectrum which is meant to reduce electromagnetic interference.,so bclk is more like 99.8mhz and that's what the multiplier bases off.,"it's not an issue, you shouldn't stress about it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bclock at 99.8 instead of 100mhz easy change!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
should i leave spread spectrum on in this instance?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if it's not posing any problems besides the slightly lower clock speed, i would leave it enabled

but if you have the time to do all the necessary stress testing, you can turn it off and see how it affects performance and stability",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
being that you are going amd to intel i would absolutely recommend you reinstall windows with that migration.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
im thinking of backing up files and doing that but im so confused.,i got one friend saying i'll absolutely need to going from amd to intel.,i got another saying he went from intel to amd and he didn't have to do anything (other than reinstall drivers.),but i don't understand how.,my only real concern is everything getting wiped and losing my game data.,"i don't have any important photos or anything to lose, and reinstalling every single game client and game is a pain but i don't want to lose any progress.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"also, i keep seeing stuff about backing up game files (and really just all your data) using a flash drive of at least 8 gb - how does that make sense if for example one game file i have (an example is apex legends) is 68+ gb?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have a 420mm aio,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well those temps along with a high cinebench score means you're golden, the 13900k is extra spicy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do i just let it finish for the full 10 mins to get a score?,"also, i have windows power settings set to full performance and my p cores are all 5.8ghz, but during the cinebench, they drop to 4 something?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, it'll jump up to the max boost speed of 5.8 for a little bit and then drop down to normal max speed which is 4.something something and yeah there should be a score when the run is done.",and unless there's something really wrong the score should be near the top of the comparisons at the bottom.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the info!,"i just installed a â€¦ whatâ€™s it called, thermalright socket thing?",i read itâ€™s suppose to reduce temps.,"also because i installed that, reapplied and reseated my cooler",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sounds like you did all the recommended things and it's working, enjoy your new computer, it's the most power cpu on the market, because the 13900ks is silly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you set the cpu to all-core over lock mode in bios?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is your spec system?,"mb, ram etc...?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have the same issue as of late on my 13900k / z690 dark.,core 3 is stuck at 3ghz while the rest are at 5.6 all core.,i have e-cores disabled.,"i tried reflashing to the latest bios, cmos reset, and flashing to the previous bios.",i'm not sure what's going on,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it was at 5.6ghz lock for a month  only today its doing this, reset to default still happening",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's the new speed on 13th geni9 i believe thought it went to 5.8 turbo tho,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"uninstall the overclocking softwares in windows, just let the monk control your cpu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it should be 5.5 all core.,5.8 happens briefly on 2 cores at a time and itâ€™s so brief you wonâ€™t really notice it.,5.6 on all cores is an overclock.,the fact that 3 e cores are stuck at 3ghz maybe a sign that you are overclocking and may not be aware.,13900 should be 5.5ghz all p core and 4.3 all e cores.,perhaps your bios has been set to keep 3 e cores running lower speeds to allow for the 5.6 all p core oc?,5.6 all p core oc is easy enough to do but it does seem like youâ€™re running oc and thatâ€™s the reason for these oddities,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that 60 euros would be better saved for a complete system upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"couldn't hurt, but that system is rather outdated, there's stuff from 4 years ago more powerful like a ryzen 3000 series processor and the gtx 1660 that'd peform far better than those.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wouldnâ€™t make a difference.,my cousin had a 4690k and i gave him my 4790k laying around and it was pretty much similar performance.,although he has a 1070 and hasnâ€™t bottlenecked yet which makes ur issue kind of weird now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have 4930k and a 4080 and i get 125 fps on cyberpunk at 2k with psycho rt/ hdr/ ultra,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it may help a bit, but it isn't going to magically make your 10/15 fps games playable.",i have a feeling the gains would be marginal at best.,i agree with others...save up for a full upgrade.,putting in a 4790k is not going to solve your problem and it is only going to get worse over time since even the consoles have much better cpus than the 4790k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, it has higher clocks and uses ht to virtualize its 4 cores into 8 threads.",not much of a benefit actually.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is just a blatant lie.,"there's noooo shot ur getting that frame rate with a 4790k and rt on, even with dlss 3.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wow, people really do know how to waste their money.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lmaooo anything but weeping.,i specifically said actual gameplay.,the built in benchmark is extremely light on the cpu.,"show me a city scene with a bunch of npcs and i might walk back the ""with the dlss 3"" part.",i can guarantee its no where near 125fps and relies on a technology the vast majority of people can't use (including op).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"with frame gen, 4080 can do that.",100+ for sure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
um ok would you like me to take a screen shot?,"hell, i'll do even better i'll post a youtube clip.",why do you feel the need to accuse me of lying?,i bought my computer in 2013. i don't think anyone has put in a new cpu behind my back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how is that wasting money?,can you get that many fps on a 2080?,"when i bought it a 3080 cost more than the 4080.

not to mention i'm upgrading to a 13900k and this was just a stop gap.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, that is not what i was talking about.",the fact is this is damn impressive for a 10-year-old cpu.,"prior to dlss3, i was getting 60-65 in this ""benchmark""

in-game, i was getting 30-60 with an average of around 40. i'll have to check it out now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then post it.,"i accuse you of lying because i've had a 6700, 10700k and a 13600k plus over 100 hours in cyberpunk and your results are way off base.",in actual gameplay you'd be lucky to get 60fps and definitely drop below in the more demanding areas with ray tracing on.,your comments are incredibly misleading.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you're getting a better modern cpu then it's a different story.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok standby i get home in about an hour,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well this just shows the power of the cpu i have.,even when i get the 13900k i'm only looking at a 20% increase in fps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"maybe if you play mainly heavy gpu bound games like cyberpunk, but you should see a much more substantial increase overall.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, you show only your silliness and also lie about those results.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
first you say frame gen can do 100+ and then you say i'm lying which is it?,watch the two videos for yourself if you don't believe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
changing to 13900k will boost your fps to 50% at least.,in some cpu-demanding games boost might be twice or more.,"125 fps can be achieved only with balance or lower dlss and in some spikes, 125 is not an average.",this is what you lied about.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i didn't lie about anything.,the in game benchmark average is 126 and that was what i was talking about.,it's clear in the video.,you can't put conditions on what i was talking about.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and in-game fps is almost twice lower.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"itâ€™ll be quite a lot faster in most games, yes.",whether or not youâ€™ll notice the difference depends on the games and settings.,"if you have the budget for a 12700k, 13th gen (13600k or better) is preferable over the 12700k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thanks!,will an i5 be enough?,or should i go for the i7?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's a 14 core cpu.,6 p cores that boost to 5.1ghz and 8 e cores.,it's plenty for gaming and is close enough to the 13700k performance.,you can overclock to close the gap,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"well considering this was done on an i9-13900kf which has 8 p and 16 e cores, or 24 total, clearly you didnâ€™t need 32 cores or you would have bought a different cpu i presume ðÿ˜‚

you can do that on a decent 8 core lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so hereâ€™s my question will p cores no longer use additional threads ?,so just 8 cores for gaming and thatâ€™s that ?,are the e cores used for the games too ?,like hyperthreading,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how do you know the tasks are split up like that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i personally use only 8-p cores(hyperthreading on) have e disabled on the 12900kf for gaming, love it.",everyone does it differently ðÿ¤·ðÿ»â€â™‚ï¸,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
recently i watched someone stream cnc red alert remastered and it becames choppy.,later on the streamer show on his screen it was steam unlocking preloaded games that causes it.,he has ryzen 5900x.,"i wonder if steam will only use ecore in this case, i'll have to try that later if they allows preloading hogwarts legacy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i tell people more cores is better and they tell me you donâ€™t need that many and same with ram.,i have 32 gigs of ram and a 10900f.,my work programs and school stuff sit around 16/17gb ram and then iâ€™ll take a break and okay a round or two of cod 0 stutters because i have that many cores and ram.,best decision i ever made to go for an overkill cpu.,while playing it will be around 27 gigs of ram.,i cannot close my stuff as thatâ€™s how i work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this...isn't demanding at all?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

maybe not at 74 mb/s but that sound like a stupid usecase for 16 dumb cores,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 8 p-cores have hypertherading, meaning itâ€™s actually 16+16=32 threads.",op likely just mistook cores for threads.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"some games that i played did use ecores, iirc the priority is

p core > e core > hyperthread.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, some games will use all cores, even all threads.",thats why i dont understand why some people turn off e cores in the bios.,it just doesnt make sense to me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
on 12th gen turning off e waste cores is beneficial because you can then improve ring latency ontop of overclocking the ring much higher.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, every time i download while gaming, steam uses the e core only, its kinda amazing.","if you have a program maximized, p core and e core will be split",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they probably shouldâ€™ve used nvenc then.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i agree...people look at those benchmarks from all of these reviewers running them on a nice clean rig with nothing on it.,the thing is nobody is running those tests with a ton of programs running in the background because it creates inconsistently in their results.,at the same time they are not really testing a realistic scenario.,i have a feeling a lot of the more budget cpus they recommend would tell a different story with a bunch of background programs chugging them down while you game.,(especially the 6 core cpus),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"actually steam uses quite a lot of cpu to uncompress downloaded games, more so on unlocking preloaded games.","i used to have a 6 core system that is getting hammered on when downloading games on steam, its more noticeable when your internet speed is not the bottleneck.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"it doesnt on my test, butter smooth",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes you can do things while gaming.,i let my p-cores take care of all of my gaming apps and certain workloads that i don't want going to the e- cores.,"_x000d_  
_x000d_  
i let the e-cores take care of background tasks such as web-browsers, video streaming, obs, streaming software, downloads\\uploads & other side tasks depending on the workload.","it also makes it easy to render workloads when you need to use your pc for other things, like playing\\streaming new games.",i love the multi-tasking options.,"_x000d_  
_x000d_  
i haven't noticed any stutter.",i'm using a 12900k undervolted with a slight overclock on the e-cores.,the e-cores are more powerful than they appear.,they are pretty decent.,i'm sure they are straight beast on the higher end raptor lake cpus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i saw a reviewer on youtube cap the fps and compare gaming and they actually were not that much different.,"sure intel keeps showing more power draw in gaming, but it is also producing more fps.","on top of that intel cpus have significantly lower idle power draw, so i would imagine the overall power usage between the 2 is not as drastically different as you think.",after all of the issues i had with the x570 platform and their numerous bios bugs throughout the years...i would gladly take a bit higher power draw to get away from that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s funny af ðÿ˜­ i went from an 11600k to a 13600k and the 8 extra â€œstupid coresâ€ let me process 30 minutes long openshot files while i game at 2k 140+ fps with no stutter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lmao,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea well threads != cores haha.,most games are only lightly multithreaded as many aspects of games require serialized rendering.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they say it's for latency and consistent/higher low % fps and that it ""steals"" cpu cache from p cores... thats just what i randomly read... but i also like to keep them, cause i paid for them, too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because especially on 12th gen like yours turning off e cores lets you overclock the ring clock significantly and improve ringe latency so much you probably are faster in gaming than using the e waste cores.,on 13th gen this does not apply anymore.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is this more waiting on software developers to implement or is it something the user can control like a priority hierarchy kind of things?,or both even?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"its a dual pc setup, nvenc doesnt help in this case.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i realize i'm replying to you twice, but i've come into some new information that lead to me fixing my situation entirely in the bios.","turns out msi motherboards (and i'd assume other manufacturers) by *default* will oversupply power and voltage to a cpu, in theory to let the chip push further and improve performance.","which i guess makes for good performance benchmarks, but is absolutely asinine if you care about thermals and power draw.","instead of leaving everything in the bios on auto, i manually enforced intel's stock tdp (188 watts - msi had given it 288), and adjusted a setting called ""cpu lite load"" (this, by default, oversupplies voltage to account for variations in chip lottery / ""bad chips"")

* i now top out at 88.5 in full load cinebench.","* it maintained boost speeds the entire 10 minute bench, at no point thermal throttling.","* it's pulling max 1.3v instead of 1.4v
* my cinebench score **went up** to 24263 from 23130

it's cooler, quieter, using less power, and literally performs better.",there's no downside.,i have no idea why the default bios settings oversupply it so much.,seems idiotic.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it appears to be a voltage issue i found a forum post where they lowered the default ""cpu lite load"" setting in bios from mode 12 to mode 5 and it made cpu run a lot cooler under load.","i wasn't comfortable shooting for mode 5 right away since going to low will cause instability, one 13600k might handle lower voltages than another 13600k it's a luck of the draw thing, so i slowly dropped the setting, tested for stability & temps w/ cinebench, dropped it lower & repeat.","currently have it at mode 8 and maxing out 89-90c after a 10 minute cinebench r23 run, no stability issues after going on day 3 now.",cpu lite load is found in the oc section of bios under advanced cpu config (assuming you have an msi motherboard).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"also found this video where they test cpu lite load on a 13600k with good results, at default mode 12 it was hitting 100c even being water cooled so think its safe to say voltage is the issue, at the end of the video he shows a chart and it says mode 9 is the intel guidelines for voltage so not sure why msi has it as 12 by default https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mkavitzoly",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the above results were with lite load 10.,"(it defaulted to 12 for me)

my (rough) understanding is that lowering lite load is just countering the relatively minor overvolting the board is doing by default.,"undervolting is, i think, a step further, lowering the voltage curve below intel stock specs.",how far you can push both of these depends on the individual quality of your chip.,"if you're lucky you can hit lite load 1.

i do not know if this can or should be combined with actual undervolting - you'll have to do some research there.","and room temp is fairly low at the moment, as it's a basement and it's like -10c outside right now.",rooms maybe 20ish.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ok, sure, but are you going to invest in that much customization?",because the out of the box experience is just not going to be that nice otherwise.,"also, most of the nicer looking options have a trade off, like the nzxt boards being only available with older chipsets right now or those maskings for the radiator likely affecting performance (which, i assume, you'll need every bit of for 13th gen).",i'm not saying these are bad options but you need to consider if that's what aligns with your priorities for the build.,"personally i feel like if you're going with 13700k/kf right now you are one of these 2 people:
1. someone who wants to be on the bleeding edge, regardless of anything else.",2. someone who needs a new pc asap for some reason and wants to future proof their build.,if you're in the 1st category you can go for the looks because you will most likely be upgrading your platform again in the next 1-2 years anyway.,however if you're in the 2nd you might need to consider function over form.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my $.02 - you would be fine with an air cooler on a 13700k in real world scenarios.,my 13600k is at 5.4 on an h150i and it's overkill for day to day usage.,i average about 60 after an hour stress testing with occt extreme large data set.,that's a realistic workload of \~130w.,in normal usage and gaming i am usually in the 40-50s.,220w on a 13600k is only going to happen if you're throwing something like prime95 small fft at it.,great tool if you want to find overclock instability in a short time but (in my opinion) i don't think you need to buy a cooling solution just to pass a stress test that puts double the power draw you would ever see in your actual usage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
absolutely what vrdubin6 said - prime95 is not a real world test scenario.,> great tool if you want to find overclock instability in a short time but (in my opinion) i don't think you need to buy a cooling solution just to pass a stress test that puts double the power draw you would ever see in your actual usage.,"this is great advice - even as i'm doing my oc as we speak i'm failing speeds that would probably be stable in games, so if you're not ""in to"" overclocking i guess, a 240mm would be ok.

for reference my 240mm afii is good enough for cooling 200w without hitting much of a sweat.",highly recommended aio - i've been using them since the i7 2600k days and have nothing but good words about them.,would highly recommend an aio if you've got a gpu that dumps air into the case (rather than a blower one),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the non-led versions of corsair vengance and kingston's basic ones have a low enough profile that they should fit at least in the second slot.,i believe nh-15 also has the option to attach the front fan at different heights (to a degree) so you might be able to clear the memory regardless though it may slightly affect the cooling efficiency of the tower.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"your $.02 was amazing :) its what i figured really, im not going to be doing anything crazy then just gaming and working on chrome etc so i think its perfectly fine - i guess i just need to see what i like better , the look of an aio or an air cooler ;) the only problem with the  nh-15 is how i cant show my ram off unless i go for something like nh-d15s or deepcool ak620 but i also would love to see some reviews on how loud they get when you game/ just work on chrome etc",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's not about the chipset itself.,the motherboards are newer so they are coming out with better compatibility for the new tech.,they support wider range of ram which is important if you will ever (and you probably will) need to replace your dice.,it can be surprisingly difficult to get ram compatible with a 4+ year old mobo if it wasn't chosen with that in mind.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so iâ€™ve only tested my 13700k/u12a in bf 2042 as rhat hits the cpu pretty hard.,iâ€™ve found that with the fans on full blast that the cpu got up to 78c and then tapered off in the mid 60s.,this is with mce on in the bios too so definitely not too shabby.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"google â€œthermalright cpu contact frame for lga 1700 â€œ

that sounds like a good plan.,"one thing to note is that the length of time a rig can last largely depends on longevity of components and maintained support from manufacturers, mainly for the motherboard via bios updates.",my longest running build got over 8 years and it was thanks to a combination of advance cpu tech (future proofing from intel at the time) and great support for the mobo (asrock).,"the things that aged the fastest were the gfx (duh) and the ram, i've even had hw failures on both of these components.","now, gfx is easy to replace but ram can be tricky due to compatibility.",i don't know how nzxt approaches it but make sure your choice has a large variety of compatible dice to ensure it will remain available for as long as you plan to use this pc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

mobile cpus are a bit difficult to compare because intel allows the oems to determine how much power the cpu can use themselves.,so part of the comparison is the settings that a particular oem uses and the other part is the thermal solution.,some oems will limit a cpu on purpose because of thermal constraints but other might let it go full tilt but their thermals will trip them up.,if you need to have the cpu boost for as long as it can be sure to pay attention in reviews for a particular make or model of laptop how it holds up under load.,if you want performance as close as possible or equal to desktop counterparts be sure to look at the h-suffix mobile cpu's.,"any i7 from the 11th gen onwards could be considered for the job, although i would prefer 12th gen or better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"not a stupid question at all, don't worry.",i'm referring to the capabilities of the cooling system of the laptop.,the default spec of an i7-12700h (and other cpus with the h suffix of both brands) is to have a long term power limit of 45w but it is up to the laptop manufacturer if they stick to those limits.,"for example, there are laptops like the huawei matebook d 16 that have a [single fan](https://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/_processed_/a/0/csm_img_5179_504a781562.jpg) so their i7-12700h is limited to 35w while at the other end of the spectrum we have the 2022 lenovo legion 5i [with much better cooling](https://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/notebooks/lenovo/legion_5_15iah7h_82rb_/csm_img_1528_b5daed068c.jpg) that handle it at a constant 100w, with the tradeoff of being over 1.5 pounds heavier.","this is sadly not something they put on their spec sheets, so you'll have to look at reviews to be sure of the exact capabilities of the laptop.",i find [notebookcheck](https://www.notebookcheck.net/) to be a great resource for that kind of reviews and it is from where i got those photos and power limits i mentioned above.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"there's a limit to desktop zen's power scaling, since the i/o die uses somewhere around 15-20w.","maybe with better binning it could push it towards the bottom of that range, but once you start looking at 20-30w package power, the cores will definitely be a bit starved in nt workloads.","that said, those low power limits probably doesn't matter too much for these desktop replacement devices.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i hated amds new naming scheme at first.,"but after learning how it works, it makes more sense.",you can see everything you need to know about the cpu in those 4 figures.,"at least you can see from the name which generation the cpu is from, 7020 is zen 2, 7030 is zen 3...guess what 7040 is?","intel hides their older tech behind the new names, every 13th gen cpu from the 13600 and below isn't raptor lake, it's alder lake that was rebranded.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

can you post more of a complete hwinfo64 sensor screen?,"showing temperatures, cpu power consumption / limits, any and all throttling sensors, vcore, fan speeds, etc?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i found the reason.,"it's the cpu current limit, defaulting to 307a on my asrock board.",increasing it made the clock speeds match up with what i was seeing elsewhere.,i will keep it at the default of 307a however.,i was getting significantly lower power consumption in games with that limit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for posting this.,i have been fighting with my msi z790i board ever since i dropped a 13900k in it.,i was limited to \~220 watts which forced the 13900k down to 5ghz allcore.,upped the current limit and everything is working as expected now with a mild underclock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
glad i was able to help someone else out :) but be careful with your chip.,"i'm keeping the default 307a for now, it's not just an asrock thing but intel's default spec as i later found out.","with this limit, the temps and power are no worse than my 12900k while clocking ever so slightly higher, and the extra eight e-cores appear to be free in terms of power consumption, which impressed me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

when the automatic repair menu comes up after 3 reboots go to troubleshoot-advanced options-command prompt

find your windows drive by typing

c: (enter)

keep trying different drive letters until you find your drive e.g

dir (enter)

once you've found your windows drive letter (in my case it was c) type the following

dism /image:(your windows drive letter):\\ /get-drivers /format:table (enter)

in the list you will find a driver with

published name: oem(a number).inf

original file name: raptorlakesystem.inf

take note of the published name.","in my case it was oem40.inf

then scroll back to the bottom and type, substituting your drive letter and driver name

dism /image:c:\\ /remove-driver /driver:oem40.inf (enter) exit (enter)

then hit ""exit and continue to windows 10/11"" button

once back in windows, proceed to uninstall the chipset driver and reinstall the last working version (v10.1.19222.8341) until they apply a fix",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is there any way to restore the first nvme slot?,it really sucks only have two dimms slots and one of them is bricked at the moment.,i just got a new z790 apex board and naturally installed the newest drivers for everything and then fell victim to this.... currently i have my samsung nvme in the second lane.,it would be nice to put it back under the better cooled nvme slot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so i tested in bf2042.,and before i used to get anywhere from 170-200w on the cpu package during gameplay.,"&#x200b;

after chipset drivers i was getting anywhere from 175-201w.",with 201w being the highest it reached.,so it looks like its the same to me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what does that mean?,â€œwindows repairâ€ led to quite a few different google results.,is it a built in windows 11 functionality?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes sir, however please see the important update i made.",as i guess intel messed something up and this is an only valid update for 12th gen. if you update it on 13th gen it apparently might make windows not recognize your boot drive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

my advice is to get a quality psu.,you can carry it forward in builds for years to come.,"you don't have to break the bank, but do your research and make sure it's well made.",my current psu is 12yrs old.,"i will be retiring it soon, but it's lived well passed its 7yr warranty and performed flawlessly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"good for the price, but drivers will take time to mature.","this is intel's first line of dedicated gpus in years, so you will see some driver related bugs/issues that should slowly get better over time.",for instance they did a recent driver update that had something like a 100% performance increase in dx9 games.,"might be off by a bit on that, but the idea is it was a major improvement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's about on par with the 3060ti for gaming.,there are some settings to tweak in the bios to get the idle power usage under control... but it's not a bad card.,the 750 has a better bang for the buck.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

definitely.,who told you to change the start value of intelppm and why?,you shouldn't do that.,"setting the start value to 4 means that the service is disabled, so intelppm never starts.",intelppm stands for intel processor power management.,it is the driver that allows windows to control the power states of the cpu.,"if the driver isn't started, then it will stay in a low power state and windows won't be able to change it.","i really doubt that intelppm is the cause of your bsod, even if disabling the service *seems* to fix it.",tons of people would be having this issue if that were the case since everyone has this driver enabled.,"if you are getting a consistent bsod on a fresh windows install then you must have some other issue, such as defective hardware or bad overclock.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

14th gen core according to leaks) will not bring major architectural changes to big cores (little cores will be new) like 12th gen. however, because of intel 4 process it will be much more efficient - *intel 4 (i4) promises a 21.5% improvement in frequency at the same power as the previous-gen i7 process, or 40% less power.",* i hope intel goes after 7ghz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whatâ€™s wrong with e-cores?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
efficiency gains will be used for performance rather than to reduce power limits.,"this was the approach with 12th gen which is actually very efficient even compared to zen 3, you will find the idle to medium load power draw is quite low compared to other cpus.","but, rather than reduce peak power usage you increase the performance/boost speeds.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"new node doesnâ€™t reduce power use, power limits do.",you will very likely be able to have a 300w 14900k one day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think zen 5 launches like 'only' half a year to 3q ahead of arrow lake, so it's probably arrow vs zen 5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is exactly what i'm doing.,"meteor lake will be a new node, new compute architecture, and disaggregated 'chiplets'.","raptor lake will be last and best of the monolithic dies and on a mature platform, with new pcie 5 and ddr5.",i expect it will be a very good platform for a very long time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
truth be told intel was right to rename their nodes.,it is not helpful if the node numbers aren't remotely comparable in performance.,intel 7nm is now marketed as intel 4. compared to tsmc that makes much more sense as what used to be named intel 7nm significantly outperforms tsmc 7nm and is in fact much closer to where tsmc 4nm would be (though it might lag that node slightly).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7nm and 10nm are marketing terms though that are rather meaningless and don't relate to anything objective in the process.,"the reason intel has started using the terms 'intel 7' and 'intel 4' is these make a more apple to apples comparisons to nodes from tsmc, samsung etc in terms of density and power consumption.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
talking about 10nm or 7nm just creates extra confusion.,the nodes are called intel 7 and intel 4. they compete against tsmcâ€™s n7 and n5 node families.,none of it has anything to do with nanometers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that's what i used for my first full build when i got my first big boy job after college graduation end of 2012. it was a great cpu.,"i ended up replacing it with a 9900k six years later that i still use and still don't feel the itch to upgrade outside of maybe better rpcs3 performance...

12 is both a tick and a tock in the same generation.,"13th gen will count as neither, as it is same arch and process node.",hence the tick and tock is no longer being followed.,"yet 13th gen still has significant optimisations that will see a big performance boost, even though it's neither a tick or a tock.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,the performance increase from 10th-11th gen was basically nonexistent but 12th gen alder lake brought a huge upgrade.,13th gen raptor lake will just be a refined alder lake and would therefore be considered a â€œtokâ€,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"imo, tick-tock as a concept for intel process-architecture ended when 14 and 10nm generations had issues continuing that cycle.","there was briefly a third optimization cycle giving a [process-architecture-optimization](https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/intel/process-architecture-optimization) concept, which played out as broadwell as the first 14nm process, skylake as the architecture improvement, and kaby-coffee-whiskey-comet lakes all optimizations of 14nm while 10nm had issues.","cannon lake was supposed to be first process step of adaption skylake microarch to 10nm, still had problems, and icelake was architecture step where process started catching up as well.",tiger lake is optimization of icelake.,"now, i consider this end of p-a-o mindset in response to all difficulty and endless 14nm.","rocketlake fits here with tiger lake as gears shift and hybrid core enters alder lake(12th) and raptor lake (13th), which is kinda like an optimization or formerly a tock step, improving alder.",meteorlake (14th) is summarized best as disaggregated architecture.,"it's 4 different designs/silicon nodes together, it's both an arch and process step in that sense.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
correct.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's a completely different approach to chiplets.,amd is all about reusing and maximizing yield.,intel's approach instead focuses on making specialized products by mixing & matching different chiplets like lego building blocks.,also intel believes that product development cycles will be shorter with this tiled approach.,i guess this also makes dealing with process yield issues easier.,like if their 20a is terrible they can port it to tsmc or back port it to older node and still get the product out with a less severe delay.,"they don't have to go through the whole process again, only that exact component needs to be ported, and they don't have to touch the rest of the chip",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hard to say.,"brand new processes usually take time to get them ready for high clocks, and this looks like mobile first for 14th gen.

exactly.,let them experiment on the guinea pigs while the rest of us stick with the stable architecture.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, thatâ€™s something i forgot to mention.",intelâ€™s 10nm process has been refined so many times that theyâ€™ve basically been able to match the performance and efficiency of smaller nm processes from other chip fab companies.,"personally, i donâ€™t like the fact that intel renamed their node processes because it can be a little misleading, but i understand that they need to do everything they can to try and establish dominance in the cpu space.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"eh, i deserve it anyways.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in an interview intel's idc chief architect said that raptor and redwood cove are incremental updates, which are done between big upgrades like golden cove or skylake.",so i guess the ipc uplift will be quite small.,didn't leakers also say the core won't get any wider and it'll mostly focus on efficiency?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"you ignore 20% higher single and light thread performance, along with double the bandwidth on the dmi lanes to the chipset, and pcie 4.0.   all of those things are going to give rocket lake more life than gen 10 has left, since intel saw fit to essentially keep the same connectivity on gen 10 as you had on a z170.",i'm saying that as someone with a 10850k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you are emotional, you're being completely irrational.","there was a double digit (single+duo+quad core) performance gain between 11th and 12th gen, without e-cores even active.",your complaint is just nonsensical.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes.,but that is not reduced power use.,300w is still 300w.,and people will be crying about intel furnace in the future too.,"so, to be clear, the reason amd cpus are usually not ""space heaters"" is power limits, not process differences.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's not just a matter of refinement - that's i think more applicable to 14mm which they refined to the moon.,"what i'm talking about here really is the reported transistor density, which is arguably kind of in line with how the original nm nomenclature was used by all foundries - as a measure of physical dimensions.",the problem is that there was no consensus on what physical feature should be measured and it's kind of hard to reach a consensus because different designs may be equally small overall but differ in their subdimensions due to architectural differences.,that's why transistor density per square mm2 is now considered among the best easily understood objective markers that determine how advanced a node really is.,"with tsmc currently leading the market and with their 7nm and 5nm factual transistor densities given, it was a sensible move by intel to rename.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel 10 was always about the same density as tsmc n7.,tsmc itself has said the numbers no longer mean anything other than general improvement.,"this all started long ago, but became a runaway train wreck when tsmc/samsung named their 20nm nodes ""14/16nm"" when they added finfet to them.","when intel went from 22nm to 14nm that was both a node shrink and adding finfet, so intel 14nm was actually a half node (35%) more dense than tsmc/samsung 14/16nm nodes.","tsmc didn't actually have a node more dense than intel 14nm until they hit 10nm, which was essentially a half-node shrink vs intel's 14nm.",intel 4 is expected to be significantly more dense than tsmc n4 and land in between tsmc n3 and n4.,"see article below :

""to that end, we estimate intel 4 at 123.4 mtr/mmâ², 2.04x from 60.5 mtr/mmâ² in intel 7. our data for tsmc n5 is very much incomplete but our rough estimates based on known pitches put their hp library at 94.85 mtr/mmâ².","based on most of the recent publically available foundry data, intel 4 hp cells appear denser than tsmc n5 hp and are likely closer to or better than tsmc n3 hp cells and denser than samsungâ€™s 3gae.

if you want to see how zen4 does at 65w you set a power limit.,you canâ€™t talk about that question without talking about power limits.,amd â€œtdpâ€ designations also indirectly define power limits.,also your comment about zen3 is completely wrong.,in general alderlake tends to be slightly more efficient in most workloads at higher power levels.,zen3 wins at low power levels.,certainly nowhere near 2-3 times at either direction.,you can compare 12400 with 5600x for example.,it is practically impossible to make 12400 consume more than 75w and it generally matches the performance of 5600x.,where is the 2-3 times?,you get those large differences when you take smaller cpu and try to make it match the performance of bigger cpu.,you do that by making the smaller cpu run very fast which is always inefficient.,thatâ€™s why a 5950x will always be more efficient than anything intel does that is not at least a 16big core cpu.,you get very inefficient by not setting limits and instead seeking the maximum performance.,intel gets maybe 5-10% more performance for the last 50% of power.,"amd by default doesnâ€™t do that, they set a lot stricter limits to performance to limit power use.",which is one reason why an alder lake core fairly significantly outperforms a zen3 core.,try to match alderlake core by overclocking a zen3 core and see the efficiency disappear.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there is a reason why e-cores are 4 times smaller than p-cores.,it's quite obvious that some (serious) tradeoffs has to be done to make it possible.,the beauty of not having e-cores was that you just don't care which process runs on which core.,they are all same.,now they are not same.,there is a serious problem for os to define what process should run on which core.,if you think a bout it a bit you will understand that this task is much harder than it looks.,"when i first heard something like ""p for foreground, e for background"" - that's when i got extremely alerted and started to think about this.","and quickly realized that salesman are operating with some ""generic usecase example"" where important processes are those that are running in foreground.",this is true for narrow spectre of use cases.,"the number of people in such usecases may be huge, but it's still the small portion of all possible scenarious for something that is called ""universal computing machine"".","now, the problem that i personally have is that i use computer for work / computation / stuff.","i will end up letting os to assign my custom soft and vms running in background to e-cores, while my browser or some light game will sit on p-core because it is on foreground and i'm just messing around waiting for computation results.","at the end of the day, my main work will take longer to complete, because e-cores are far from p-cores single thread performance.",it's like jumping on few families old cpu.,"magic will not happen, and 100500 e-cores will not make my 4-thread process to finish as fast as on p-cores.","avoiding even more specific things, that's pretty much it... as an example: i have 8 core cpu.",i can run 2 4-threaded computations in parallel.,if i buy 16p cpu - i can run 4 computations in parallel.,"if i buy 8p 666e cpu - i can run 2 computations fast and 2 computations slow, because i have only 4 computations to do, and extra e does not make any difference.",so for me 16p will be much better than 8p 999e.,what i am trying to say is that if you make a step away from marketing examples into other usecases that were totally ok on all-p cpus to the extent that nobody even realized it's beauty - you get many headaches with these e's.,and again - i just can not take it why they did not make all-p model?,"pack 16 p's on the die, put the price, and sell it.","why, oh why they take away this option in such crucial thing as cpus, where you only have 2 manufacturers and will end up in big trouble if both of them decide for a bad move!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

typically you'll want llc around 3 or 4 for overclocking.,the further you push it up the more voltage it'll overcompensate with and thus increase overall temperatures on the cpu.,"there is a good skatterbench guide to overclocking newer intel cpus you can look into, but just remember that every cpus overclocking ability is different and some people who have better binned chips will be able to pull off overclocks that won't be possible to others without increasing the voltage even more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

quite the other way around.,cpus may get further disaggregated and have even more sets of specialized cores.,this is happening soon as intel is adding ai units into meteor lake.,amd is also jumping in making a core denoted zen 4c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"damn, i had never looked at the power gap between the 12700 and 13700 until now.",itâ€™s pretty substantial.,your system would probably run on a 500w psu even.,"either way, the point i wanted to get at is thereâ€™s no gpu that requires more than an 850w, despite the reddit sentiment that 1000w+ is a new standard for high-end builds.",so you can still look forward to your current system getting a big gpu upgrade down the line without the psu being a major limiting factor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you cannot overtighten the thermalright bracket unless you apply brute force.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

> doesn't it stop warping as well ?,that's how the temperature reduction is achieved ;),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you want cooler temps on 13700k go to bios and either set the cpu max wattage under load to 253w cap or undervolt with offset of -0.05 or -0.1. literally almost no impact at all on performance and runs 25â°c cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its due to the lga1700 clamping flaw so not sure if there is such flaw on lga1200 that would benefit from it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean pcb and the metal heat sync are flexible to a degree.,and this applies constant pressure so it keeps it flatter.,does it permanently undo warping that already happened - i donâ€™t know?,"i doubt it, but as long as you keep the bracket there does it matter?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

newer i7 and i9 are designed to run really hot (90-100c under load).,even with the best 420mm aio it gets there around seven minutes in stress tests.,setting wattage cap under load or undervolting a bit affects almost nothing on the performance side and lowers the temps 25c.,crazy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

look at the photo of this post - thatâ€™s a contact frame.,"instead of default bracket that locks your cpu in place people often are using the contact frame, because the stock one might bend your cpu ihs in the middle and result you in not having enough contact between ihs and the heatsink - hence high temps.","it doesnâ€™t apply to all cpus, but itâ€™s a pretty common issue on 12/13th gen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"awesome, i saw the same thing in my google searches.",is this okay to do with aioâ€™s or do i need a custom loop for it?,"if i need a custom loop, this will probably push me to pull the trigger on it.",edit: just watched the video they have on the site.,wow.,that makes the process insanely easy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's not inherent but we need to change the default fixation bracket by a frame ?,"really ...

we donn't have 36 000 ways to put a cpu into a socket ... you put it in, you close the retention bracket and thats all ... so tell me why all my cpu are bending at corners all the time ?",why the memory's controller pins are not working anymore all the time ?,and always these particular pins ?,because they are located at the top of the cpu ... the same side that bends all the time ... !,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you should be able to use any cooler because you normally remove the original paste or solder and replace it with better paste or liquid metal and then put the original ihs back on.,before reinstalling the ihs you can lap it to make sure it has the best contact as possible with the cooler's cold plate.,this requires determining if the cold plate is concave/convex/flat and then lapping the ihs to mate to it.,or instead of re-using the ihs you could get a direct die frame (this is supposed to be the best.),cpu die->paste/liquid metal->cooler's cold plate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pricing over here is like 180â‚¬.,"my ak620 cost some 40â‚¬ and is good enough, though just borderline.",6p-core prime95 max-temp test goes into 90s @ ~185w power target.,using a mx-4 tube from 2016. the nhd15 for example costs 100â‚¬.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ok, thanks for the advice.",have you dropped the voltage as well?,"i think i'm gonna try that first because a lot of people have said that really helps with temps, and doesn't seem to affect stability or performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why?,because you're installing it wrong.,"seriously, watch a youtube video on how to install a cpu or something.","this is not a normal issue, it's definitely user error.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was thinking of getting a direct die frame.,"my aio puts out very well, but the room temp is high around this time of year and the cpu feels most of it.",would i use typical thermal paste with the direct die frame or something else?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think you should fix the issue instead of looking for workarounds.,you should not throttle like that with good cooling.,iâ€™d be really upset if i couldnâ€™t use my cpu at its full potential.,"my cpu is overclocked to 5.5ghz on all p cores, 4.2ghz on e cores (cause i donâ€™t care about them) and cache oced to 5ghz - all of this is @1.365v llc6.","i pretty much havenâ€™t used my cpu on stock settings, so iâ€™m not sure what are default voltages.","btw, when you are throttling - how much power your cpu is using?",also have you tested it with and without enhanced multi-coreperformance?,(bios),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
liquid metal would see the best results.,i have seen some comments that have said liquid metal reacted with cold plates.,i think most were things like cosmetic stains.,something else for you to look into,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mobile cpus are a bit difficult to compare because intel allows the oems to determine how much power the cpu can use themselves.,so part of the comparison is the settings that a particular oem uses and the other part is the thermal solution.,some oems will limit a cpu on purpose because of thermal constraints but other might let it go full tilt but their thermals will trip them up.,if you need to have the cpu boost for as long as it can be sure to pay attention in reviews for a particular make or model of laptop how it holds up under load.,if you want performance as close as possible or equal to desktop counterparts be sure to look at the h-suffix mobile cpu's.,"any i7 from the 11th gen onwards could be considered for the job, although i would prefer 12th gen or better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i quick google search tells me that a [stock i7-10700k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noa2uozakq0) does 1260 st and 12350 mt in cinebench r23.,"for comparison the i7-12700h does [1800 st](https://www.techspot.com/review/2410-intel-core-i7-12700h/) and [13k mt](https://static.techspot.com/articles-info/2487/bench/19-p.webp) when locked to 45w but if the laptop can handle 95w it can score as high as 18k, roughly on par with a desktop i5-12600k.",other options that can match your desktop but at higher power limits (\~55w-60w) than the i7 are the i5-12500h and the ryzen 7 6800h and 5800h but with these you'll have to look more carefully at reviews to be sure the laptop can handle them over long periods of time.,"i'll stay clear from intel 11th gen laptops since the i7-11800h needs 85w to match the i7-10700k, that would be a beefy laptop.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in a few weeks the 13700h should be available.,pretty sure that will give you a similar level of performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i apologize in advance if this is a stupid question but i only have a basic consumer understanding of pc's... when you say ""can handle 95w"" am i referencing what the power supply delivers to the laptop?",or are you referring to some specific spec on the processor i should be looking for that relates to what the laptop maintains for power to the cpu?,"if it's the latter, where do i usually find that spec?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not a stupid question at all, don't worry.",i'm referring to the capabilities of the cooling system of the laptop.,the default spec of an i7-12700h (and other cpus with the h suffix of both brands) is to have a long term power limit of 45w but it is up to the laptop manufacturer if they stick to those limits.,"for example, there are laptops like the huawei matebook d 16 that have a [single fan](https://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/_processed_/a/0/csm_img_5179_504a781562.jpg) so their i7-12700h is limited to 35w while at the other end of the spectrum we have the 2022 lenovo legion 5i [with much better cooling](https://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/notebooks/lenovo/legion_5_15iah7h_82rb_/csm_img_1528_b5daed068c.jpg) that handle it at a constant 100w, with the tradeoff of being over 1.5 pounds heavier.","this is sadly not something they put on their spec sheets, so you'll have to look at reviews to be sure of the exact capabilities of the laptop.",i find [notebookcheck](https://www.notebookcheck.net/) to be a great resource for that kind of reviews and it is from where i got those photos and power limits i mentioned above.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

for xmp maybe y-cruncher (10runs) and linpack (50 runs) + 1000% mem test pro / 3-6 runs of tm5 absolut.,for overclocking to find 100% stable ram perhaps double it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yes, it doesn't affect ram compatibility (as in enabling e cores back doesn't change stability of overclock), it's just when tm5 runs on just e cores (which is by default) it error detection reporting is kinda broken and tends to report very late, as in errors detected in first cycle can get reported in 3rd one.",there's also enormous time waste between cycles too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thats not true.,changed ram timings and used mem test pro for maybe 10 minutes and got errors in the logs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you do catastrophic ram timings then ye, it *may* work.",else tm5/karhu obliterates this redundancy in terms of time wasted and error detecting accuracy.,and you don't need to waste more time booting into the pendrive and don't need the pendrive itself too.,"also, mt86 does false positives in hammer row test, which is also an unusable test.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you're asking way too much from this cpu.",my guess is that it's a relatively pedestrian sp rating that you're trying to get golden sample overclock out of.,for an everyday gaming system you could push all core voltage to 1.4-1.45v and probably be ok long term.,there's also no issue with 1.5+ when it's an unloaded single thread boost.,high voltage overtime and heat is what kills the cpu.,"with what you have going on here, i'd say you need to cut that oc back to 5.1/5.0 and manually test for stable voltage.",even then i'm not sure if you'll be able to stick it.,i'd also suggest bios overclocking.,"the xtu is easier to get a ball park and maybe iron out a few kinks, but once you get it close manually set things in the bios.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hard to read the pic, whats your idle temp wattage and cpu usage?",wondering if you have software bloat issues and/or cooling related.,even at 4.6ghz all core you should be getting ~15k r23 so you have something going on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

turn off t-aa and switch to fxaa in rainbow six: siege.,either way i9 or ryzen 9 processors along with rtx 3090 or rx 6900 are bleeding edge technologies.,which means they all are for enthusiasts on the border between high end and professional cases which need a lot of computing power for small businesses or bigger private projects.,"rule of thumb is that the performance increase is too low and there are too many downsides like unexpected behavior, crashes or simply heat which are simply trash for pure gaming and not worth the hassle.",also overclocking is absolutely no fun on them and so many generations of i7 processors were having so much better results that the higher tiers as you can see from your friends performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what is your cpu utilization  while rendering?,what is the temperature at idle for your cpu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
only way that can get well over 100 degrees is if it is set to ferenheit scale.,cpu will throttle heavily if it reaches 100c.,it may go to 105c momentarily but just for a fraction of a second before throttling but this is extremely unlikely with your cpu.,120f would be safe & normal operation though.,100c=212f.,i can guarantee that your cpu will never get to 100c even on air cooling except with stock cooler & maybe not even then.,those cpus are very low powered & not overclockable.,we have a 10400 6 core cpu that just barely draws 65 watts even on turbo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

youâ€™re replying to a bot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
default is celsius but there is an option to show fahrenheit under tools.,some people may switch it to fahrenheit because that is what they are familiar with.,i leave mine on celsius in order to be consistent with rest of the different programs that i have that do temperature monitoring even though i am more familiar with fahrenheit.,see if pump is running at full speed which should be well over 2000 rpm.,if it is not running full speed go into bios setup & find where you can adjust fan speeds & such & make sure that pump is set to run full speed at all times.,if it is properly set but pump still not running over 2000 rpm them pump ma be defective.,mine runs just over 2500 rpm.,if pump is running correctly but you are still running hot pull heatsink waterblock & check for plastic film.,none should be there.,be sure to have high quality thermal paste available if you remove waterblock from cpu.,also listen for any noise from pump.,this could be a symptom of air in the line or restriction due to corrosion of copper heatplate or coagulation coolent plugging fins in copper heatplate.,this is doubtful on a new system but not impossible especially the part of having air in the line.,water pump should be nearly silent.,for air in the line you could try repositioning radiator to top of case.,if no mounting point on top & if radiator tank is at the top (hosed coming out near top) try inverting radiator so hoses are now coming out near bottom.,this will prevent air from getting trapped in pump as it will be trapped at top of radiator but water can still be circulated by pump.,in my case i ended up having to replace coolant & cleaning the tiny fins in waterblock as they were clogged with corrosion & coagulation coolest.,i replaced all coolant with 50/50 premix of long life automotive coolant & have not had any further problems.,this was done about 2.5 years ago.,original only lasted a little over 2 years before clogging up.,if you need to open the aio to clean out the tiny fins in the copper heat plate before opening completely remove aio from computer.,if they are clogged after only 6 months usage replace coolent with 50/50 mix water/high quality long life automotive coolant.,you will likely have to replace it anyway though as you will lose  some when opening it up.,you may also have some difficulty getting air out of system once you refill with new coolant so be patient.,move the radiator around a lot at different stages & listen for air in system do not put back in computer until you have worked out all the air.,this is easier did than done.,when replacing coolant replace it all as some coolant formulations are incompatable with others.,just to let you know i have a beast of a cpu to cool that easily draws 180 watts in current state & my 240mm radiator & 2-120mm corsair maglev fans keep it below 90c even at full load which in my case can last hours.,i have core i7 11700k with mild all core overclock.,i had used the same aio on my core i9 9900k.,i use my computer for video transcoding a lot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

meteorlake and arrowlake desktop is more like q2.,raptorlake refresh needs more time to be in the market.,i don't see most of meteorlake mobile until ces 2024. i can see 5w and 9w in q3/q4 2023. think broadwell launch.,"core m first late year, and rest coming early the year after that.",zen 5 is probably near arrowlake for timeframe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 so 13900k will get a refresh?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tsmc n3e is still set to enter hvm in 2h 2023. launch by early 2024 isn't unrealistic.,"but more importantly, zen 5 is also expected to use tsmc 4nm.",i suspect there are two zen 5 variants- 4nm and 3nm for premium mobile or server variants with higher core counts but lower fmax but better efficiency.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yea then i can't see how any meteorlake will launch this year.,that means they'll have to cut the lifespan of raptorlake mobile.,"and unlike desktop where you can easily upgrade, with mobile ones you can't.",think of a laptop company that just launched 13th gen laptop.,and what like 9 months later they need to get 14th gen?,when you can't even buy 13th gen laptops until sometime like end of february?,you think any company will do that when some are still launching 12th gen devices?,either that or they are launching an entirely new line like the m part.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there's been rumors that lnl might use n3 node for it's compute tile.,which is weird because lunar lake would be a perfect lead product for a new node based on how intel describes it as this small chip designed for <15w tdp.,what's interesting is that in recent presentations intel didn't mention lunar lake and 18a in the same context,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"18a is too early for 2024. i am also leaning into the n3 rumor as well, since leakers with good reliability such as raichu said it.",20a makes sense but i don't see that either.,apparently 20a is only for arrowlake mobile.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
some people talked about lunar lake as a pipecleaner product kinda like the first 14nm broadwell parts.,it probably has a 2+8 or 4+8 compute tile which should be tiny on both n3 or 18a.,"and it doesn't have to reach super high frequencies, so it's a perfect candidate for 18a lead product.","would be kinda awkward for intel foundries to be touting 18a as this ""industry leading node"" while simultaneously using tsmc n3 for their newest mobile chip.","this n3 rumor might also be outdated, a lot of products got redefined and ported to different nodes.","arrow lake was entirely n3 as well at some point, so maybe this rumor also originated back then.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's possible but if you look at the original roadmap that references lunar lake, it's ambiguous in that it refers to external before 18a, while in the meteor/arrow reference we see intel 4, then 20a, then external n3.",suggesting lunar lake is 3rd party and either an updated version or a different chip is 18a.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

nah the 12700k is a really good cpu.,like there can be cases trying to push insane fps that the cpu will be the limit but that's with any cpu.,the 13600k has slightly better single thread but overall performance is quite similar as the 12700k has 8 p cores and 4e and the 13600k has 6p and 8 e cores.,but the 12700k will not disappoint as a gaming cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"did you type ""generous amount of thermal paste""??",you should only add a pea drop.,"or a somewhat thick line since this is 12th gen.

maybe try again, but just not too much paste this time around?",see what happens.,it should fix your temps.,"in bios, the max you should be is 40 to 45c.",i am about 32c for my 13600k on a z690 mobo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thermal paste renew it !,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think the fan isn't making good contact with the cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"he's in the bios, where the cpu usage is close to zero.",lack of water flow does not cause 96â°c tj.,this is an issue of insufficient mounting pressure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™ll reread the manual but i think they tend to plug into usb 2.0 and thatâ€™s where i have it plugged in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well considering the pump came with pre-applied thermal paste i donâ€™t think there couldâ€™ve been plastic anywhere but i might take it apart to check anyway, ya never know",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i have a liquid cooler, it should be sufficient to at least keep the cpu cool when itâ€™s at idle.",iâ€™m now convinced iâ€™m using the wrong bracket and iâ€™ll be driving to micro center in a couple days to get the right one.,"i believe iâ€™m using an lga 1200 bracket on an lga 1700 processor, which is only a couple millimeters different but apparently enough of a difference to cause this issue",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"many manufacturers set max power usage of the cpu to infinite and an added boost in the bios as base settings, to get the max out of the cpu, which yes increases the temperature of the cpu, normally max tdp is only used for a short while to then return to minimum tdp, many manufacturers simply turn all knobs to extreme, which is fine, but needs to be considered for the cooling solution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because after i first noticed the temperatures i removed the cooler and after you remove it once you have to reapply before you reattach (from what iâ€™ve read),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it came with pre-applied thermal paste so i donâ€™t think it had plastic ðÿ˜…,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
even crazy amount of paste wouldn't do 90+ â°c.,the rest of what you wrote is true tho.,turns out he used lga 1200 bracket on a lga 1700 cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
too much paste doesn't affect temps.,this was debunked years ago by linus and gamers nexus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i made an x and a dot in between each > shape,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"while this is an obvious cooler contact issue or pump malfunction, it's worth noting that bios does run at high cpu clocks on all cores unless configured otherwise.","until os boots, there will be no dynamic frequency adjustment based on load, hence staying in bios for extended periods of time can result in higher than average temperature.",also applies to at least some gpus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">i think they tend to plug into usb 2.0

that connector is for the screen, not the aio pump.",you need to plug the pump header into a the motherboard aio\_pump or fan header.,the reason your cpu is hot is because your pump is not running.,"[https://www.datocms-assets.com/34299/1666145998-kraken-z-digital-manual-en-2206.pdf](https://www.datocms-assets.com/34299/1666145998-kraken-z-digital-manual-en-2206.pdf)

yah i re-read the post but that part is out of order so it lead me to believe you added more paste on top of the pre-applied lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m pretty sure i overdid it with my 3600k lol.,i did the dot and then the x on top of it.,"and then even more dots between the lines, and itâ€™s not once gotten over 45c even under load.",just paste everywhere!,iâ€™m kidding.,"not too crazy, but probably the most iâ€™ve ever used in a build.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for gpus it is okay... but for cpus, not soo much.",try it yourself and see?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hmm... an x and a dot maybe be a bit too much.,"cause i am not sure how ""thick"" your x or dot was.","what i did was put a decent pea drop on the middle, and very small dots around my pea dot.","gaming so far, i don't go above 58c to 62c max.",and the 13600k is just about neck and neck with 12900k.,"edit\* also, change your pump settings in bios.","change it to pwm, if it isn't already...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thanks man i honestly wouldâ€™ve just put it back on haha,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lmao no i've put my cooler on so many times without repasting.,i just grab someghing to spread it out with.,60 psi of clamping pressure from the cooler squishes the shit out of the thermal paste.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"general waste of time and paste, check by yourself.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nope, after looking into it further, my serial number implies i got a cooler from old stock which doesnâ€™t include the new bracket.",i emailed nzxt and hopefully iâ€™ll get the new bracket soon :/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you can watch the [video](https://youtu.be/euwvvty63hc) and verify it yourself.,it's not that deep.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
either way it doesn't actually matter other than making a mess.,it's been proven multiple times now that having excess paste will not make a measurable difference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i did a thick x with extra dots with my 13600k and peak at 45c.,i have some corsair cooler on it with the 3 little fans.,iâ€™ve never passed 50c and canâ€™t imagine hitting 60. i watch my temps frequently.,i bought some thermal grizzly paste for like 20 bucks off amazon.,i was mostly just winging my build.,googled what to buy and just slapped it together.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can you hear the pump running?,does that motherboard have a specific aio_pump header?,"if the pump is running, then itâ€™s likely a problem with the install of the aio block.",edit: from other comments seems like op used 1200 mounting kit for 1700 socket.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it probably would have been fine if it is pretty fresh.,people get worked up and there is a lot of myth surrounding it.,the key is just to make sure the chip has enough to cover the chip.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>the reason your cpu is hot is because your pump is not running.,i just use my index finger and even out the past on the cpu and cooler and slap them back on together (if taking the cooler off for some reason).,no problems what so ever.,if the paste is too hard to spread then it's time to replace.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i am not sure how accurate nzxt cam is for system monitoring but i would recommend compare the temp values with hwinfo64.,the important bits are the temps and the cpu power draw so we can see if this is 253watts or unlimited.,once we see your hwinfo sensor results we can then take the steps to improve your 36k.,typically the 13900k out of box with 253watts power limit should score 38k+ depending on silicon quality.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

so what you are saying is that it wont do a thing to its lifetime expectancy and cpu perfomance(in a bad way)?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you are making zero sense.,"the standard is frozen, 3200mt/s is here to stay.","you want to overclock and the vendor is willing to offer warranty, that's between you and your choice of vendor.","neither intel nor amd can guarantee it'll work, that is the expectation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how did you get it to run?,i canâ€™t on mine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sure.,so it wont damage my cpu?,because that is what i was asking about.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ltt frequently make mistakes even with their new ""labs"" and don't really have the foresight to investigate results even when they seem off (like claiming rembrandt has twice the battery life of cezanne which turned out to be purely because of hardware av1 decode).",don't assume anything besides that they're wrong when they show results different from everyone else.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

something to do when their channel have a far bigger focus on entertainment and general audience than just pc hardware.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

linus has always been a clown.,what are you expecting?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they will fix it.,not that serious issue.,"on serious note : they need to at least cross verify their scores with multiple sources, to remove any outliers in testing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
linus hates intel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i stopped watching ltt a little over 2 years ago i think.,blocked the channel from my youtube.,"more that these mistakes, i really couldn't stand their aggressive advertising.","when watching one of their videos, 70% to 80% of all ""watch next"" in my youtube feed were ltt's.","i was wasting so much of my time everyday, even when the content was good.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"likely the cheese fingered blob made yet another mistake, remember the recent cyberpunk fiasco ?",ltt is not to be taken seriously.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

so much butthurt here...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for everyone shitting on ltt, they've always said that their results may not be the most accurate and that their vids are for an overview.",they've literally endorsed gn and hwub as the guys to go to for detailed reviews.,"also, the ltt labs are relatively new, so of course there are going to be issues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, i have in my miniitx build i5-13600kf that gets multicore of 19700 points.",the cpu is power limited to 85w so no idea how linus got such score on unlocked 13600k.,it should get \~25000+ points when there is no power limit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"lol my i5-12600k can hit 19k, 24\~25k makes a lot more sense",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that look like the performance when intel boost bug in the motherboard bios.,my msi pro-a z690 board stock setting was with intel boost/turbo disable.i only discover that a few weeks later when i checked my frequency for fun.,since these never any regulation and even a clear \*stock intel setting \* in any motherboard maker.,that kind of stuff will definitely always happen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's not the only mistake in that video.,[this whole segment](https://youtu.be/ctirnnsg0ja?t=257) is wrong too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's just variations.,"not all reviewers have to agree with exact numbers, just more or less have the consensus of how many x is a product from another.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"insane how many mistakes they are making, just what i saw personally from recent reviews, can't take them seriously on any review going forward.",4090 review they made mistakes with the cyberpunk benchmark.,on the 7900 xtx review messed up the numbers on f1 22.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"odd to me with their reach that they don't have any contact to check in with another reviewer and ask ""hey is x ballpark for you?""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the hope is the lab once its up and producing results will behave more like a technical review than entertainment around hardware but given what linus has said so far i fear the entertainment will probably compromise the lab.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
he even said during the video: hmm that's weird and then carried on without explaining or investigating.,that's why i love nexus gamers and hardware unboxed.,they explain to the last bit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
where those other reviews with pbo on?,i know this linus video had most of its graphs with pbo disabled and later sections of the video doing explicit comparisons between oc and non oc with pbo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i got 24k with a 125w power limit, but it draws 132w (78-80c temp).","i can get 19k by limiting the power to 65w (63-65c), and a 21k score on a 90w (67-69c).",they're really clowns.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they are a clown show, period.","they only look ok because bottom tier like jayz, mlid and ufd exist.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i always do, iâ€™m just curious if this can actually happen in some motherboards.",my 13600k with minor tweaks hits 25k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"would that be out of the box behavior, or them changing settings and causing it?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mines 22968 on lite load 7 with 181w pl.,should probably let it off the leash a little since it only hit 79c in cinebench.,but then again it's probably an unnoticeable difference in games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
who do you mean by â€œheâ€ out of curiosity?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that is the point they want to get you, they meme around with the results and catch you to believe their benchmarks to be scientific lab results.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i have seen their graphs with the wrong names on them.,with the size of their team these silly mistakes shouldnâ€™t be happening.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
people putting thousands of comments and view into his channels is the clear give away they believe about everything he says.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think if this was a one off it wouldn't be serious.,the fact that it happens regularly is - at least for ltt.,"they wants to go in hard on labs, but if they keep screwing up like this nobody is going to trust their results, and it shows from the comments here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no this is actually correct.,intel's non k parts are really bad.,even the 13600(non k) which could have been decent has so little cache it is not good for gaming relative to the competition.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
he's right in terms of how they hold up to amd's non-x cpu's.,"(they don't)

intel's 13400f is a rebranded 12600k without the infinite boost behaviour.","i wish intel didn't rebrand last gen for the non-k's but what can you do, eh?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"as annoying the constant plugs for merch and other bullshit are, what made me cut them out were the sponsored videos.","like all the reviewers get review units from the manufacturers, but they actually took money to make positive videos about the product.","they'd mention it at some point, so technically it's kosher, but watching 15 minutes of them gushing over a product only to realize it was just paid shilling turned me completely off.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah it is true they put criminally amount of money in youtube advertising, the youtube feed is littered with their videos recommendation when you watch 1 video.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38k-39k is a perfectly fine score for an 13900k at stock 253w.,40k and over is only really achieved with unlimited power limits (around 300w or higher).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

intel sponsored like their entire staff with $5000 setup updates.,i dont know about that...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,he like the other major tech youtubers are not team anything.,also he does far more collaborations with intel than with amd (because intel does a lot more projects with media).,he had a whole fab visit video series with intel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hey i saw that you said you got a g.skill 7600 and could get it to run stable at 7200 i have the 6400 kit cl 32-39-39 and can't seem to get it stable with dual channel i have a z690 asus rog strix -e board i'm thinking of replacing it cause i got the same kit again and it still is giving crazy errors with memtest 86,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"which motherboard, cpu and ram kit?","&#x200b;

sounds like more a nightmare with ddr5 xmp stability.",just for some reason cannot be completely stable the way ddr4 xmp at 4000/3800 or less gear 1 is.,"&#x200b;

i think people who run ddr5 xmop and say it is stable it truly is not quite there but close but if they ran occt large data set variable enough times an eventual freeze or bsod may show randomly.",its just many consider cinebench stable the ultimate end goal.,though lots of reports of an occasional bsod when gaming with ddr5 i have heard reading around.,"&#x200b;

ddr5 works brilliantly on spd default 4800, but xmp something is just not quite rights in many cases and someone over at [overclock.net](https://overclock.net) even told me to avoid buying any system with ddr5 as such as there are issues if you want perfect stability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>did you ever try the g.skill gets too see if it works on the msi?,i have a z690 asus rog strix gaming e and have the same 6400 kit you had and i run memtest86 in dual channel with xmp ii on with crazy amount of errors even got the same kit again still errors,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the corsair 6600 vengeance is the same hynix m  die as the g.skill trident z5 6400 and has a little faster timings and is 6600mhz and uses same voltage.",so i think it would work on msi unify x as long as your cpu imc can handle it.,13900k should be able to almost for sure on msi unify x at least cpu imc.,not sure about the 13700k or 12th.,silicon lottery imc in cpu plays a role.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i had that exact same ram kit and also that board.",xmp was not fully stable and at first i thought my cpu overclock is not stable until i put it at stock and even downclocked it and still randomly got errors with occt large data set test and realized to turn off xmp and low and behold passed occt easily with no errors multiple 1 hour runs.,"&#x200b;

then i gave up and tried hero and same problems.","also tried 6400 trident kit and same issues, even lowered ram clock a bit and same problems though took longer to show up.","then tried samsung die 6000 kit and still problems

&#x200b;

tried a z790 apex with corsair hynix m die 6600 kit and still problems.","&#x200b;

and for those who say well occt is not a realistic test you only need to run cinebench to prove stability.",i disagree especially for whole system an d not just cpu overclock stability.,heck cinebench actually puts more heat and power draw on cpu than occt large data set variable.,i can see the argument for cpu stress testing that prime95 small fft and such is unrealistic and not needed as it puts an unrealistic insane power and heat draw through cpu chip.,occt large data set variable though does not put any insane power draw and if it errors stability is not good even if you are game stable.,this is not at all a comparison to power virus like prime95 small ffts with avx on.,"&#x200b;

and this is memory stability with ddr5 anyways triggering other system related instabilities even if small, t still is not good.",there have been reports afterall of bsods during gaming with ddr5.,"&#x200b;

iâ€™m gonna pitch in as a previous owner of 7700kâ€¦ that chip is undeniably super hot.,"if youâ€™re not delidding the cpu, you wonâ€™t see much overclock improvements without hitting 100c, even with a crazy cooling setup.","i was able to delid, add bit more voltage, and was able to go 5.0ghz all cores without much temperature issues (somewhere in 70-80 on load).","if youâ€™re not increasing voltage because of temperature issues, iâ€™d recommend you for a delid.","if thatâ€™s not the case, increasing voltage is fine to make sure it gets stable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why are we constraining the voltage?,they love voltage.,the chips will happily run at 1.5v and that is intelâ€™s stock voltage cap.,donâ€™t be scared of cranking the voltage and getting at 5.2ghz or better.,"i use to delied+liquid metal, bin and sell them off.",all of them would run 5.2ghz and a small handful could boot windows at 5.6ghz or better.,average was 5.3-5.4ghz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you have a 7700k.,that line of cpus cannot keep up with current games and really does not hold up.,intel cpus average lifespan are around 8-10 years.,770k is about 6 years old?,even if you oc i guarentee it will not make a big difference.,as to your question about degredation.,any voltage below 1.35 during all core workload is considered safe.,but again i want to point out that your cpu will probably be obsolete in 1-3 years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

most of the other competitors left the market.,"via, via centaur, almost re-entered the market a few years ago with haswell level cpus- but intel bought their cpu development teams from via.","this was probably to stop via from continuing to help the other maker of x86 cpus advance - zhaoxin, a chinese cpu company which currently makes chips roughly equivalent to fx cpus in performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the answer as discussed in alot of posts is the voltage being set too high in bios.,if you look at the vid its pulling (at leats it thinks so) 1.3243v ... this is way above what it needs.,if you have an msi board go into oc > advanced cpu configuration > msi lite load    its most likely at 12 by default.,set it to 5 or even lower and check if the performance is the same.,me personally i have the same setup but overclocked to 5.4 on p cores and 4.2 on e cores and my max temp during stress testing is about 75 c. i maxed it out at  1.17 volts and could probably go lower.,edit: if you dont have an msi motherboard you can try changing the cpu core voltage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there has been plenty reports about this issue.myself also had this issue.,what really fixed it for me was using a contact frame.,there's plenty youtube videos and also written guides that's talking about the lga1700 socket and explaining why this socket is so bad.,"for example gamer's nexus: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyu1oskby-q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyu1oskby-q) (i recommend watching this video to also see how to apply the contact frame... it's not hard or anything, but you really don't have to tighten it a lot...)

here's a very good article for instance: [https://www.igorslab.de/en/german-engineered-bend-aids-for-intels-lga1700-thermal-grizzly-cpu-contact-frame-and-alphacool-apex-backplate-thermal-testing/](https://www.igorslab.de/en/german-engineered-bend-aids-for-intels-lga1700-thermal-grizzly-cpu-contact-frame-and-alphacool-apex-backplate-thermal-testing/)

you can either buy the more expensive contact frame from thermalgrizzly (the inventor of those) or take the thermalright, like i did: [https://www.amazon.de/thermalright-anti-biege-schnalle-cpu-befestigungsschnalle-cpu-biegekorrekturfixierer-spureninstallation/dp/b0b64xq96x/](https://www.amazon.de/thermalright-anti-biege-schnalle-cpu-befestigungsschnalle-cpu-biegekorrekturfixierer-spureninstallation/dp/b0b64xq96x/)

"can also replace the contact frame on your motherboard with one made by thermal grizzly or thermalright, gamers nexus did a video on it dropping cpu temps by up to 10c",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
get yourself a 360mm aio and make sure your board isnâ€™t letting your cpu go bonkers on power draw.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if you're considering 360 or 420 aio, and have room for the latter .... af ii 420mm, and call it a day (or a decade).","if you need rgb light show (for the dust particles flying around in you case) or fancy display that you will never look at after a week....then i won't help you choose one, as i'm from the performance oriented crew and useless gimmicks mean nothing to me.",\-99,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most accurate response.,"this chip is unique in that you, not the manufacturer, decide which temp(wattage) you want to run at.","otherwise, balls to the wall.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to be a bit more realistic: of course you can cool 300 watt of power dissipation, that's not that much.",a modern gpu can go to 700watt and they are air cooled.,"the actual problem is that the vast majority of coolers are designed for something like 150 watt, they use a couple heat pipes to a air cooler or a tiny pump to a huge radiator.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for the answer!,will take my time to decide what cooling solution to choose.,for the moment i limited the power to 253 watts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hi there, i just purchased this chip - how do i actually limit the watts used by the chip?",i have a d15 and it's rated to cool ~220 watts.,"sorry for the question, just trying to get my temps under control",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's horrible .. it uses a tiny baby pump that barely manages to cool 100watt, not to speak about 250-300.  
it comes with a radiator that could cool 1000 watt and doesn't get more than warm because of the low flow rates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you have the 253 watts limitation on?,what temperatures you get on full load?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have the same cooler and a i7-13700k and it almost instantly is pegging out on r23 runs.,"what tim did you use, and did you use the new mounting hardware or the legacy?",any power limits on your motherboard?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for the answer!,i have limited the power draw to 253 watts and will upgrade the cooling soon.,"so far it performs relatively the same, but with lower temperatures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great suggestion!,will do that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for the answer!,limited the power draw to 253 watts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if i leave it unlimited it goes beyond 300 watts.,"wonder where it would stop if you can keep it really cool, i guess using custom cooling with liquid nitrogen would tame this cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with any af  aio you can call it a minute.,they have pumps designed for 100watt continuous power usage combined with radiators good for a whole apartment heating solution.,but on the bright side: they have lots of leds instead of a proper pump.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah it's a wild chip.,it took me sometime to realize that it wasn't plug n play like your usual chip.,this one wants to run as wild as you will let it.,a lot of that has to do with the motherboards encouraging unlimited pl1 pl2 settings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we need better off the shelf cooling solutions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or a bad ihs...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what did you choose?,i am looking into this myself right now and i thought the ls520 would be a good decision.,only have the possbility of 240mm aio because of my case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which motherboard do you have?,i ask because in your bios there are two settings and they may be name differently depending on who made your motherboard.,the official name for these two options is pl1 and pl2.,"power limit 1 and power limit 2.

so in your bios you may see them.",they can also be called long duration power limit and short duration power limit on msi boards.,from those names you can kind of guess what they are.,this is where we define the wattage limits for the cpu.,the short duration power limit (pl2) is the wattage your cpu can run at for a short period of time before it switches to the long duration power limit (pl1).,"once it switches to pl1, it will run at pl1 for a period of time (that you can define in the bios) before it switches back to pl2.",these help keep the cpu running cool while also running as fast as possible as it cycles between short bursts of more power and longer periods of lower power.,"ok... 

so what do you do?",set pl1 and pl2 to 253w.,that's the intel spec.,the cpu will handle the rest.,"actually you could set pl1 to 125w and pl2 to 253w to really match the intel spec but you wont be happy with it because how you set the pl1 and pl2, has an effect on the way the cpu boosts it's core speed.","if you set pl1 to 125w, and pl2 to 253w, you likely wont see 5.5ghz often during all core usage because the cpu will be very conservative with it's boost clocks.",so try pl1 253w and pl2 253w and check the frequencies of the cores and temperature of your cpu while running cinebench r23.,use hwinfo to monitor the cpu package temp and the core frequencies as it renders on all cores.,"if it hits 100c immediately when rendering in cinebench... dont worry, the cpu will handle it and throttle accordingly.",the trick is to find a pl1 and pl2 that fits your cooling capability while also getting the most performance out of the cpu while observing it's boost behavior.,a lower short duration pl2 value is going to limit how fast your cpu will boost.,you may want to go higher than 253w.,"many of us with aios are running with unlimited pl1/pl2 because it lets the cpu run as fast as it can, while the aios keep it at just about 100c.",so find the balance for your cooler.,play with the pl1 and pl2 settings.,start with 253/253 and test.,from there you can adjust the cpu lite load mode.,if you have a good motherboard with a powerful vrm you can possibly lower the cpu lite mode value from the default (auto) to a couple steps lower to keep your cpu cooler while not hurting performance and stability.,"some of the motherboards with more power vrms can delivery more than enough power, and in some cases a little too much by default, so cpu lite load can be changed to bring the voltage down during cpu lite loads.","remember if your cpu defaults to lite load mode 9... try mode 8, or 7. dont go up in value.",that is going the wrong direction :) also dont go to low or else your system wont be stable.,try one step down first.,this will help keep your cpu a little cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i didn't make any changes in my bios before i ran tests.,"cinebench was 38,404 and temps were in mid-to-upper 80â°c range.","i was going to disable mce and the intel adaptive boost technology, but so far i haven't seen the need to.",edit: not sure if those temps are accurate though.,i was getting them from armoury crate.,"however, the cinebench score was correct.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how does one do this??,?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you do that?,i was also looking into that!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not sure i follow your not so obvious ""complaint"" here, but you should definitely reach out to steve and tell him how improper the af design is, as he seems to rate af better than most others:

...and as to leds?","af = the least gimmicky aios, no?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no it's the pumps primarily.,"that cpu copper block can go to 100 degree c while the radiator stays cool, that's not a ihs problem.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the great detailed answer!,i have an msi pro z790a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mine does not go higher than 35000 in cinebench r23 with temperatures sitting around 83â°c.,do not understand the low score in cinebench though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you ever figure out how to limit the power draw in on an asus z690 mobo with a thermal grizzly contact frame with a corsair 360aio and iâ€™m still seeing temperatures on the package of 80+ im only using this machine for gaming.,any tips for reducing temperatures would be appreciated.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have no doubt that steve from gamers nexus is aware of that, he is one of the few non idiot reviewers out there.",but he is comparing available coolers and most coolers are as horrible as the af2's or worse due to bad mounting or even worse pumps.,"that video was 2 years ago, so afaik there are 2 or 3 with significantly better pumps out now.",just look at the tiny size of the pump of the af2's.,the only thing that transports pumps from the cooling block to the radiator is the micro-pump.,"and on top, the cooling block is pure copper but it's very light, it has barely any thermal storage capacity (copper is expensive) which adds up, more metal in that area would permit the micro pump solution to be a bit better in spiked loads.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fyi: i added an edit to my post while you were responding.,"iâ€™m not sure about my temps, but my scores seem to be what i should expect so i doubt iâ€™m throttling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you ever figure this out?,"if using an asus mobo, you may have the 90c throttle turned on within the auto setting of mce.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

is this even supposed to be a feature?,"intel has stated that the hdmi 2.1 output ist not native, but is via dp-to-hdmi conversion with a dedicated adapter, just like all the external adapters.",and so far none of them has supported translating adaptive sync to hdmi vrr.,"also intel has largely equated ""vrr"" with dp adaptive sync, so unless intel stated somewhere explicitly that they support hdmi vrr, i think they might still only support dp adaptive sync.","and unless some dp-to-hdmi 2.1 adapters come out, that support hdmi vrr you will probably not be able to do that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i have the qn90b and i'm able to use vrr over ""hdmi 2.1"" aka dp 2.0 to hdmi 2.1 pcon there, although it isn't working flawlessly.","i tried out some games and i discovered, that most aren't using vrr at all, which seems pretty weird.",the qn90b auto detects 4096x2160@120hz with hdr and vrr.,"games i tested and which seem to work with arc hdmi vrr:

\- metro exodus enhanced edition: vrr not working- assassin's creed valhalla: vrr not working- riders republic: vrr not working- the witcher 3 next gen update: vrr working- dishonored 2: vrr working- deathloop: vrr not working

this is weird because my lg cx was displaying it was using vrr upon first boot of the a770 until i until it off in the graphics control panel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nvidia -dunno about amd- supports vrr via hdmi 2.1, which is to be expected tbh.","as for adapters, i could buy one but i fear it might not work and also i rather prefer if they support the feature on other ports, not only displayport.","other than that, the a770 16gb is one heck of a gpu, specs wise, it's really working surprisingly well with my games.","older games might need some tweaking in some cases, but still... a great gpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thanks for the help.,"but alas, it didn't work for me.","i event went to install the beta version of the app, but to no avail, although a new option appeared regarding games compatibility.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great info!,"good to know that you got in touch with them, because knowing that vrr works perfectly fine with other gpus shows that maybe the drivers are to blame and intel might have to work on it.","vrr works superb on my 32"" 165hz monitor, but on my tv, that's a totally different story.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so i know what's causing problems with vrr.,first of all for op: are you connecting your arc via hdmi 2.1 to input hdmi-port 4 on your tv?,"it's important to use hdmi-port 4, as the other ones don't support 4k@120hz.","even if you plan to use 2k@120hz on every other port i could imagine that there isn't enough bandwidth for vrr and that's because:

intel arc is using full 10-bit color depth instead of 8-bit dithering.","most people trying to get vrr running are using a monitor with dp 1.2 and a refresh rate over 120hz, which isn't enough bandwith for vrr due to the color depth that arc uses.","in that case the users would need to reduce the refresh rate manually to 120hz (maybe 144hz works, can't confirm, as i don't have dp 1.2 on my monitor).",disabling hdr could also help to reduce the bandwith.,"furthermore:

the games that i tested have different full screen implementations.",i noticed that older titles (like before 2010) all work with vrr but newer ones are hit and miss.,so i deactivated the full screen optimizations for those particular game.,"this can be done by right clicking on the .exe of the game and select sth like ""disable full screen optimizations"" in the compatibitlity tab (could be named differently, because my windows is set to german).",this fixed my vrr issues on all the games that weren't working properly before.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
does it still work for you via hdmi 2.1?,'cos i don't see the adaptive sync option anywhere in the command center.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"according to the hdmi forum, hdmi 2.0 has been replaced by hdmi 2.1. technically all new products are hdmi 2.1. but as this number is basically just the version of a pdf, it says next to nothing about the supported features.","officially, manufacturers should have to list all of the optional features of hdmi 2.1, such as vrr, max resolution or for example the maximum bandwidth (48gbit/s frl would be the maximum).",>you cannot use version numbers by themselves to define your product or component capabilities or the functionality of the hdmi interface.,"https://www.hdmi.org/spec/hdmi2\_1

"it depends on the temperature of the cpu during the benchmark, 3.25ghz for an all core workload is technically within spec though.",if you can't keep it cool enough to boost higher though then it will throttle the core clock speeds.,you can easily check the default core clock limits with something like hwinfo64 / intelxtu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that 4.2ghz is single core speed.,you're not going to maintain those clocks with an all core load on a laptop.,the all core speeds you're getting are likely normal and unless you can undervolt or find a way to cool the laptop better i wouldn't expect to see your all core clock speed increase any.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"that's cool, i got mine but the motherboard didn't come in yet :(
what temps are you running and what cooler do you use with it?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, the temps are no where near what reviewers reported.",my processor is chill af on a 140mm aio in an itx case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

in the video he mentioned setting a power limit of 65 w for the 13900k, the fps in battlefield 2042 experienced only a 9% loss, in other words, visually imperceptive loss.",however the power draw experienced a 50% reduction from 126 w to 65w.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what are the ecores good for?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, you should upgrade if you play cpu demanding games and play 144hz or higher.",games are getting more cpu bound as recent gpus need more cpu power to avoid bottlenecks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, iâ€™ll check that because iâ€™m curious.",maybe it is pushing 100c like the reviewers say.,but good performance overall  so far.,i will rarely use all 32 threads at once so not too worried about high temps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah the cpu advancements over the last 5 years have been great.,the competition between intel and amd is great for us.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have a 7700k as well.,do you think i should wait?,was thinking of buying a 13700k or a 12700k.,not sure which to pull the trigger on yet or if i should wait.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i ordered one for my 1600t2 from cablemod - it shipped already.,will clean up cables a lot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably depends on whether it has any power limits set?,37.7k sounds like what you'd get with a 250w limit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 38k ish score done by reviewers is fresh os and nothing running in the background.,they make sure to turn all mce related settings off as well.,so with stuff running in background 37k is pretty accurate in real world scenarios,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'm running a 12900k on win 10 (aorus master z690) and am looking to swap up to the 13900. sounds like you did something similar....did you reinstall windows or just let it recognize the new cpu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no it matters a lot !,!!,you need minimum 500fps in csgo to actually be able to play good !1!1!!,ðÿ¤¡,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ah ok, reason i ask is because of the ihs being somewhat bad, and the contact frames gave quite a lot better seating for the cooler.",in turn giving better temps.,"this was in the 12th gen case, and seeing as the socket is the same i would assume the same thing on 13th gen",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hi sorry can you tell me what multi core enhancement does?,i have mine coming today and an asus x790 board... i am unsure if i want that setting on or off?,can you explain what on does and what off does ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
340 watts 100c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"don't use enhanced turbo, it's a terrible setting.","it'll set each core to it's maximum multiplier, for a 13900k that means 2 cores at 58x with the other 6 at 55x.",you'll get mostly 55x multiplier performance with vastly increased vcore requirements for that 5.8 ghz frequency.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if the system has been stable with that setting enabled, you can use it as a baseline for a manual overclock.","basically, keep the same clockspeeds mce/et was running and try reducing the voltage in 0.0250vcore increments until the system is failing stress test, then bring it back up one or two ticks.",my 12700k can do 5ghz p-cores @ 1.250vcore while et tries to run the same speed @ 1.300vcore (sometimes spiking upwards of 1.320v),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

probably whatever limits are set by the motherboard.,iâ€™be never messed with them so iâ€™ll have to dive into the bios to find out.,edit: i closed as many background programs as i could and left the computer alone while it ran the test again.,came back to a score of 38989 which seems more accurate.,"cpu: i9-13900k

if you only play games on it you'll see exactly zero performance difference between unlimited and 150w power limit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's basically an overclocking profile, it's forcing the cpu to work on higher frequencies across all cores, but it takes more voltage to do so, therefore more power draw and more heat.","i would recommend to turn it off - difference in performance is small (about 5% in cinebench, in real life tasks, it's gonna be lower) but power draw is higher (about 250w vs. 320-340w on cpu package power) and the temps are way higher (80â°c vs. 100â°c even with best aio, you basically need a custom water loop in order to have good temps).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what do you recommend doing instead?,iâ€™m not too knowelgeable with over clocking.,and the gaming power use is very tame with these settings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not a bad idea to reduce the voltage.,iâ€™m still shocked it used 340 watts of power during cinebench.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

mce is short for multicore enhancement.,asus and motherboard vendors usually have this on by default.,what it does is it removes power limits when under full load.,so if you watched reviewers.,some cpus took more than 300+ watts under full load.,disabling mce caps the max wattage to 253w which is intels default .,now these chips run extremely hot anyway.,almost no reason to have mce on as it will 100%  make your cpu throttle as no cooler can get that under control unless a custom loop.,i saw 0 performance issues with turning mce off.,i went from 100c package to 75-85c average with some hot cores hitting 95 once or twice.,now this was 10 minutes of cinebench r23.,so it was extreme stress test.,if you are gaming you will be nowhere near the 253 limit.,games do not make the cpu hit power limits so it doesnâ€™t matter for gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so the problem was asus.,i did intel mei update no i have full ram speed and a score with 38000 points,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ultimately every chip up to the 10900k has the exact same ipc.,"clock for clock, there's no difference there.","that means that if you're playing a game that only really needs anywhere from 1-4 cores, you gain absolutely nothing going to the top skylake based chip.","having more cores is nice, if you can keep them cool, but they aren't always necessary.",what *is* necessary is ipc gains as that's what really pushes performance forward in gaming.,not every workload can be heavily parallelized to earn effective gains by splitting it over several cores.,"unfortunately, we only really saw one major leap in ipc over the last 7 years, and that's alder lake.","now we're getting 13th gen which is nothing more than a refresh of that now old series, since it's based on the same architecture and manufacturing process.","yeah it clocks higher and that's nice, but i'd rather wait for a new architecture on a new node that will deliver better clock for clock gains in performance and potentially match at least a ryzen x900 in terms of core count (12 big cores is my ideal for a next gen pc upgrade.)","if i'm going to invest damn near $1000 or more into a system upgrade, i'm going to make it count, and i can't do that by buying a refresh of a 1 year old cpu.","i got burned that way with my 7700k, i won't do it again.",i predict 14th gen will do to raptor lake what coffee lake did to kaby lake.,we'll see.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

iâ€™ll just say that the 13900k has more cores and will definitely be hotter but when gaming 50-75 during gameplay (not loading the game as something like that makes cpu go hotter) is perfectly normal and fine as thatâ€™s what i get.,i get around 65c in warzone which is cpu heavy.,iâ€™d definitely make sure to disable mce if you do and other than that your golden.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

we'll see about the results for this last quarter but as for intel's dc decline for q3 and beforehand amd definitely played a large role looking at marketshare figures.,"back when rome launched (zen 2, q3 2019 iirc?)",amd was sitting at just under 5% market share in dc.,as of q3 last year that had shot up to 17.5% (aka >3.5x growth in 3 years).,and this is just market share.,revenue share would be significantly higher as milan is selling for considerably more per-unit than ice lake is.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

however, if you are arguing that 2022 q3 to q4 ""growth"" in datacenter is notable, that is stereotypical myopia and a gross lack of understanding of how datacenter sales work.",it is typical for companies to do end-of-year upgrades which explains the expected q3 to q4 uptick.,the q4 should be the local maxima of any year in datacenter revenue.,they should have a hump there given how many companies plan for sales then.,that is typical of datacenter any year.,"if they didn't have that hump, that would mean their datacenter revenue is in even worse freefall.",never mind that 2022's q3->q4 revenue slope is only barely a hump unlike 2021's q3->q4 progression which means 2023 is going to be a bloodbath for intel in datacenter.,it is year-over-year that are the real tell-all here of their long-term customer retention.,"the most telling statistic is that from q4 2021 to q4 2022, revenue nose-dived from $6.426 billion to $4.304 billion, or a third of revenue simply evaporated.",that would put me in panic mode if i were the executive manning this company.,that is why their datacenter business is in dire straits right now and especially so as arm and amd combined are growing rapidly in the same sector.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's very accurate.,you need to port software to use arm.,arm's share is well under 5%.,"it says end of 2021 their share was ""one in twenty"" which is 5%.","so if the marketshare grew 40%, you are still at 7%, which is only 2% extra.","in contrast unlike xeons, genoa beats all.",there was a servethehome article where it said this particular arm chip offers amazing performance outperforming milan by 20%.,but genoa is 60-80% faster than milan.,"[https://www.servethehome.com/arm-based-alibaba-cloud-t-head-yitian-710-crushes-specrate2017\_int\_base/](https://www.servethehome.com/arm-based-alibaba-cloud-t-head-yitian-710-crushes-specrate2017_int_base/)

yitian 710 gets 520 in specint and dual genoa gets 1800. since single milan get 440 while dual milan gets like 840, this means single genoa gets 900+.",yitian is only 18% faster than milan while genoa is at least 70% faster than yitian and more than twice as fast as milan.,"and the author of the article claims yitian ""crushes"" milan.","switching to amd requires zero software infrastructure changes, and they have the fastest chip.",who do you think took the most?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

exactly my point.,"money or no money to burn, that is alarming.",you have to look at it with the whole year in perspective.,you can't just judge adjacent quarters relative to one another.,it is a truism that most datacenter purchases for companies occur at end of year.,"it should balloon at q4, much like christmas shopping season is prime time for retail consumer purchases.","for example, in 2021, q4 pulled in over $600 million more than q3, or 11% more revenue ($6.426 billion/$5.788 billion), or it ballooned.","by comparison, we see just under $100 million more than q3 in 2022, or 2% more revenue ($4.304 billion/$4.209 billion).","whichever way you cut it, that's one third of end-of-year customer datacenter sales simply gone year-over-year.","if they continue down this same road of year-over-year q4 performance, they will have virtually no business in 2-3 years, meaning just a quarter to a third of their current datacenter revenue (~$1 billion - $1.5 billion).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you're asking way too much from this cpu.",my guess is that it's a relatively pedestrian sp rating that you're trying to get golden sample overclock out of.,for an everyday gaming system you could push all core voltage to 1.4-1.45v and probably be ok long term.,there's also no issue with 1.5+ when it's an unloaded single thread boost.,high voltage overtime and heat is what kills the cpu.,"with what you have going on here, i'd say you need to cut that oc back to 5.1/5.0 and manually test for stable voltage.",even then i'm not sure if you'll be able to stick it.,i'd also suggest bios overclocking.,"the xtu is easier to get a ball park and maybe iron out a few kinks, but once you get it close manually set things in the bios.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

well there is your stolen performance :) good luck fixing it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you serious?,1.7v will obliterate your cpu.,1.5v will cause long term degradation if used continuously.,edit - you should be targeting somewhere between 1.375 and 1.425 for a higher overclock.,"the 1.425 isnâ€™t really recommended either, but you should be fine as long as you manage temps and you donâ€™t care about the cpu being dead or not holding clocks in a few years lol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it will be interesting to see meteor lake and emerald rapids this year.,they had so many delays in the past :(,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

intel products get delayed?,what a surprise!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"says they wouldn't confirm, but picture shows a mobile part which is suggestive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
neither of these announcements are officially a delay.,"mtl was always slated for 2023 officially by intel

lunar lake was marked 2024+, so clarifying that it is 2024 rather than 2024+ as in 2025 is a good sign if anything.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there's no delay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's only 14th gen mobile that's releasing this year.,desktop chips will be raptor lake refresh.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, indications are still that itâ€™s only mobile meteor lake parts for 2023, and desktop is going to be raptor lake refresh.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
emerald rapids has no chance.,i assume they'll try to cut the lifespan of emr but we'll see.,granite rapids is the first chance at a turnaround.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i don't think they can compete, they still have node disadvantage and for servers chiplets are more cheaper to manufacture.",when intel will be on their 3nm/18a in 2024 then they can be competitive again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ah that makes sense, kinda like the situation with tiger and rocket lake.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it could also make sense that we get a refresh of the 13900 and meteor lake for everything else as lot of users are concerned by the number of p-cores.,"at least, i hope that.",i would prefer to get a 14700 instead of a 13900 refreshed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so iâ€™m in happy with my alder lake cpu i should wait tell this happens to max out my z690?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh really?,"i got the idea that itâ€™s desktop ones, anyway weâ€™ll see",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
like indications that meteor lake was canceled?,where did you see that intel won't launch a desktop version of meteor lake in 2023?,i have a 11900k.,"this was a cpu that was disruptive considering the 10th gen but, at the same time it was the last cpu in 14nm.",alder lake has been launched few months after.,for now i have only seen rumors.,"rumors of meteor lake canceled, rumors of raptor lake refresh, rumors of roadmap that would confirm rumors...  
  
is there, anywhere, one intel announcement of this raptor lake refresh?",this is not a rhetoric question.,i really would like to see something official.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
won't amd be on 3nm by that time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you want to pop the best cpu you can into your z690, wait until this fall to see what raptor lake refresh brings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nothingâ€™s ever official until itâ€™s officially announced like a month before release.,"leaked roadmap slides show no signs of meteor lake for desktop in 2023, and instead indicate a â€œraptor lake refreshâ€ for the end of the yearâ€¦ which kind of confirms even older rumors.",what little official stuff intel has out on meteor lake for 2023 is suspiciously vague and only visually depicts a mobile cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they would be at around equivalent nodes at that point.,"spr vs genoa - intel 7 vs tsmc 5nm

2023 emr vs genoa - intel 7 vs tsmc 5nm 

2024 gnr vs turin - intel 3 vs tsmc 4nm or 3nm 

2025 diamond rapids vs amd zen turin or venice?","intel 3 or intel 20a vs tsmc 4nm/3nm/ maybe 2nm at the end of the year if venice...

alright bet ðÿ‘,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nice, there will be war with at the server side lol.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i don't know of any official confirmation of raptor lake refresh, but one thing to consider is that the last time intel was developing a new node, frequency regressions and low yields meant that laptop dies were the only ones that would make sense to make.","intel 10 nm's first major release was ice lake mobile, limited to 4 cores and 3.9 ghz.","then, they released tiger lake-u with 4 cores and up to 4.8 ghz, then tiger lake-h which got up to 8 cores and slowly increased the frequency.",only 2 years after their first real 10 nm lineup did we get alder lake with 10 nm for desktop.,will a similar process play out with intel 4?,"i have no idea, but the precedent is there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
go with raptor lake.,raptor lake turned out better than expected and there is not really something coming in this year.,"a raptor lake refresh could be coming, but itâ€™s unknown what this refresh is about.",because raptor lake is basically a â€žrefreshâ€œ.,probably one of the best refreshes ever made by intel.,"a well known leaker said the naming scheme will be like i9 13950k if a raptor lake refresh is happening, so i would expect its a very small performance uplift.",meteor lake is a high efficiency focused product (like lunar lake).,i expect only laptops will equipped with them this year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if by disruptive you mean a much more expensive 11700k that offers nothing extra then sure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
meteor lake will be released for laptops first in september.,it will have up to 6+8 configuration.,"intel may release a desktop version in november or december, but i'm not sure.","there's no sense in raptor lake refresh, because now intel has pushed the 10nm+++++ process to its limits.","yes, we may see another 100-200 mhz bump, but it won't change anything.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there will be interesting update on 14 or 15 gen. heard some rumors that there will be twin cpu or 2 cpu.,its still in testing ðÿ¤·ðÿ»â€â™‚ï¸.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"meteor lake is in 2h 23, all we know",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no it makes total sense because meteorlake won't be competitive with amd considering the redwood cove core is not 15-20% improvement as mlid suggests but more like haswell in the range of 10%.,"also they need to bring up next gen nodes fast, so by skipping meteorlake they get to do that.",arrowlake-s is coming only about 1.5 years after raptorlake so the greatly improved cpu will more than make up for needing a refresh in between.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not just last time, happened at 14nm too.","we got haswell refresh and then when we finally got a 14nm desktop part, it was just a handful of broadwell parts.",at this point a desktop launch of a new intel node on time would be the exception.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10nm was an efficiency disaster with icelake.,if 7nm follows the same pattern that means intel failed in their attempt to catch up in node development,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i saw in the intel presentation slides that they will be making desktop cpus for 14th gen, which is what you would expect.","typically, refreshes don't offer any meaningful increase in performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it doesn't make sense to see mobile raptor lake cpu on january 2023, meteor lake mobile in september 2023 and nothing for desktop between that and lunar lake.","the raptor refresh won't be a serious concurrent for amd cpus....

for now, what i ve seen it was rumors that meteor lake was delayed to 2024. however it seems the rumors were wrong.","i really hope we will get something for desktop even at the beginning of 2024. 

from my point of view rocket lake (11th gen) is the technology just before intel 10nm.",i am not sure it would make sense to change my cpu for a raptor lake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have to agree there... sadly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's exactly what i think.,"moreover, it would be, in my mind, put intel behind amd.","raptor lake refresh doesn't seem, for me, interesting.","well, i guess we have to wait and see as nobody knows the intel plans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ivy also didn't oc nearly as highly as sandy.,maybe that's when they stopped soldering the ihs?,"either way, it's a recurring theme.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mobile raptor lake is a refresh of mobile alder lake.,in only bumps up frequencies a litlle at the cost of power.,they don't even include more cache.,so meteor lake mobile is desperately needed for intel in order to compete with rembrandt and phoenix.,yes it is strange to have nothing in between raptor lake and arrow lake.,so intel came up with raptor lake refresh that bumps clock speed by 100mhz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i dont think we're nearly informed enough to say whether or not pat is 'the answer'.,but i do think that intel has set themselves up for disappointment with such an extremely aggressive roadmap.,"they cant afford to keep tripping up, yet they're already showing that they cant keep up with their claims.","not just with sapphire rapids, but now with intel 4 and meteor lake as well.",does anybody really believe that 20a will be ready in late 2024?,"they wont even be on intel 4 til late this year, then there's still intel 3, and this is all still while remembering that intel 4 is seemingly only used for a very small part of meteor lake to begin with, with an increasing reliance on tsmc.","i'm not betting against intel big picture, but i do think they're acting overly arrogant in terms of what they can actually do and when.","tsmc is looking like they'll give intel a lifeline to catch up to a decent degree in the next three or four years, but intel \*needs\* to steady their execution to actually take advantage of this.",they cant afford more more trip ups.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
economy hitting recession did not help for sure.,at this point just having great products alone will not confirm the turn around.,whole marketplace has evolved.,dc is moving mostly to gpu based processing.,arm based cpus are impacting client and data center markets.,intel used to have this overall package advantage making products beyond just cpu.,now they have excited several markets like optane and now barefoot network products.,"so i am not sure if they will be able to turn around their business like what it was during their peak, even when they have competitive process (18a) and great products(lunar lake, granite rapids and falcon shores).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they have to have agressive roadmaps to catch up.,"afaik mtl being h2 2023 leaked quite a while ago, so maybe it was always intended to launch in this timeframe.",power on for mtl wasn't that long ago too i believe.,also intel 3 is a half node over 4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

â€œup toâ€ refers to officially validated speeds.,"and the â€œup toâ€ part is because the officially validated speeds differ depending on the exact memory configuration (motherboard style, number of modules, and types of modules), and of course, it will work fine with slower memory too.","for ddr5 on 12th gen, the official maximum validated range is 3600-4800mhz (which ranges from 4 dual ranked modules at the slow end, to 2 modules on a 2-dimm motherboard at the fast end).","you can use faster and get better performance, but itâ€™s considered overclocking and is not guaranteed.",k-series cpus will often be able to run faster memory than non-k due to unlocked imc voltage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it means ""this cpu can natively support (i.e.","without overclocking) memory speeds under and including, ddr5@4800 and ddr4@3200"".","this is exactly the same as boost clocks - ""up to xghz"".","you can still overclock it higher, it will be faster, it just wonâ€™t be stock.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the rated speeds are jedec standard profiles, and it looks like if there's no faster jedec profiles the 'up to' rating won't go higher.",and 'up to' is probably from systems running dual rank (and/or 2 sticks per channel) being more stressful on the memory controller.,i.e.,they don't guarantee 4800 on something like four 32gb ddr5 sticks running together.,"edit: motherboards could affect ram limits too, although i don't think it is listed in the cpu specs, as these are generally higher than what intel rates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol that â€œup toâ€ is really the bare minimum you would even run.,"i would just ignore the jdec, those timings are very easy to get working with xmp on almost any recent intel chip.",and yes more performance for sure with faster ram.,in productivity apps the gains can be large.,in gaming more like 10 percent improvement max.,example: my 13900ks says up to 5600 and i turned on xmp and itâ€™s stable at 8000 with no tuning.,for a 12700k you could aim for 6600 working.,anymore than will be quite difficult without a 2 dimm board.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the 13500 is listed on best buy's website in the us- so it's coming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's available in uk

i was able to buy a 12500 in an actual retail store called memory express in canada.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"13400 is already priced almost the same as 12600kf, there will be no 13500, untill alder lake is gone or its price is ramped up to a point nobody will buy these anymore.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
must have been a recent add.,i was looking everywhere this morning.,thanks for the heads up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i compared the cpu's and the ark page let's you export a great table in csv with a full comparison breakdown.,"i may do a separate post and highlight it, but honestly the 13600 (non-k) which is up for spec but seemingly also not available is the best option.","the 12500 is nearly better than the 13400 except lacking e-cores, but the standard clock is much better and it has more xe cores and 770 instead of 750 igpu....after looking at all of it basically you might as well try and find a 12500 or just get a 13600 and skip everything in between.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i donâ€™t understand your logic.,the 13500 exists.,iâ€™m not asking why intel isnâ€™t making one.,they made it.,theyâ€™re just choosing not to make it available in north america.,why?,what benefit is it to intel to sell it in indonesia?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"because 13400, the entry level raptor lake is already priced at the level of flagship alder lake i5?","13500 will not sell in its supposed price tag, which will exceed 12600k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 13500 is 6+8 core config opposed to the 13400(f) and 12600k 6+4.,so it's very different from the past non-k skews and might have a place in the market for ppl wanting more cores.,"also might outperform the 12600k in some applications, because of the cores.","yea the pricing of 13th gen is pretty high, [especially in europe](https://i.imgur.com/pi7hxot.png)(not the cheapest retailer and some of the 12th gen pricing is all over the place, but it's the one that had 13th gen non-k listings, also curiously no 13600), but that for all the skews not just 1 of them.",so it's pretty weird if it's not sold in america.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe.,but they raised alder lake prices today.,the 13400f is $209.,at $259 a 13500f is realistic.,thatâ€™s cheaper than the 12600k.,"if they want to push older inventory of alder lake, raising prices doesnâ€™t make sense either",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is there even a 13500f?,only 13500 was announced.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i upgraded my old 2x8gb 2666mhz ram set to 2x16gb 3200mhz before, it gives me like 1% increase in fps only, and that's due to the slight difference of ram speed only not related to the ram capacity.","the only difference is for video editing program or installing cracked games, since those utilize crap ton of ram.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"more ram only helps if you need the extra ram, however considering you're only running 2666mhz ram, if that's not a chipset limitation, upgrading to faster ram could help.","although, with how cheap ddr4 is atm, it's not a bad idea to buy faster/more gb ddr4 while price is still low (at least if you aren't planning up upgrading to a ddr5 platform anytime soon), i recently upgraded to 32gb, for just gaming it's not worth it for me, however i usually end up leaving way too many tabs open and don't exactly like to close them often, so definitely helps with performance there, no longer get performance drops since i no longer reach 90%+ of my ram.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,"ram capacity isnâ€™t usually a factor in games, especially if you already have at least 16gb.","ram speed might make a little bit of a difference, something like a 3600 kit could help.",donâ€™t expect anything massive though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's 2023 the time to upgrade from 16gb to 32gb for gaming was ~two years ago.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i mean that is completely wrong now adays and has been for a couple years.,"you are right about the speed also making a big difference, but if you are running any modern game and especially on w11 you will be extremely close to or over 16gb of ram usage.","there are some games that still use only 4-8gb but alot more are now utilizing more ram, combined with w11 using more than w10 and any background apps you might use the need for over 16gb of ram is very real.",you can of course utilize the pagefile but that should be avoided at all costs if you care about performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is mostly wrong.,16gb is enough for nearly every game if it's the only active app running on a pc.,"now for multitasking and other purposes, 32gb is the new standard, yes, but not a requirement and op specifically said ""for pure gaming purposes"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i had that case and put a mini itx build in it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's likely that 8gb is said to be faster in the manual because when it was written single rank 16gb sticks didn't exist or weren't common.,"memory controllers don't usually care about dimm capacity, but do care about the number of ranks per channel.","this means 6x16gb (dual rank dimms, one dimm be channel) would be about as fast as 12x8gb (single rank dimms, 2 dimms per channel) and also about as fast as 12x16gb (single rank dimms, 2 dimms per channel).","6 single rank sticks would probably be the fastest in terms of memory speed, but likely worse in terms of performance since going from one to two ranks (one ddr4 at least) improves performance quite a bit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i did a quick check just for curiosity sake and according to tom's hardware site the w3175x vs threadripper 2990wx is a tie.,for pro workstation applications like mine the superior memory architecture gives the edge to intel.,"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-xeon-w-3175x-vs-amd-threadripper-2990wx,38557.html",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1) use some masking tape to secure the back plate of the default ilm, the backplate will fall off when you removed all 4 screws.",2) put the cpu in the socket before unscrewing the ilm.,"this will protect the motherboard pins, the screws are not overly tightened and can be removed easily with very little force.","3) don't overtighten the screws when installing the frame, stop when you feel resistant and then do a 90-degree turn to tighten it a bit more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i didn't notice any temp gains, all within margin of error.","imo its worth it for peace of mind and to help with thermal paste overspreading., plus it kinda looks cool, but then again no one sees it.","its just four screws, very easy.",since you will be doing that i'd suggest to take the opportunity and apply quality thermal paste e.g tg kryonaut extreme.,also careful not to drop anything on the socket pins.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i used the thermalright on my 13700k build.,didn't have any trouble but was definitely nervous doing it.,definitely watch youtube videos about install.,i put the cpu in the socket and then removed the stock bracket just incase something were to fall on the socket.,then counter rotated the screws till they clicked and then cross tightened till i hit a wall with two fingers on the little tool.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just ordered a thermalright frame as well and recently discussed if i should get a different aio.,"i'm hoping it's fine considering i've had this build for a year so hopefully whatever bending or deformation happened, can be ironed out and that's not permanent.","i am in the same boat as you but after i get it installed, i'll edit this comment to let you know about the results.","from what i've read through numerous posts, the contact frame mods works best with a flatter coldplate so aios and waterblocks like the lfii should benefit greatly.",asetek aios which are slightly convex may not benefit as much.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just installed the thermalright one on my z790 board with a 13900k.,i'm actually impressed that it does what it's meant to.,dropped my temps and keeps the cpu package temps just below 100 degrees for the most part.,there is the occasional 1-2 cores that still thermal trottle when you are running a long benchmark but on the whole i'm quite impressed with how easy it was to install for the benefit at least in my scenario.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i just installed it on msi z790 carbon gaming with i9 13900k and z73 kraken 360, i was suffering from thermal throttling on xtu once i run it immediately and gaming temps (simracing titles) reaching 72c and idle temps reaching 45c, now idles between 30 to 35c, gaming i'm between late 50s to early 60s.",it did a great job for me to be honest.,"by the way, i'm not into benchmarking, just simracing only.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it was real ez to install.,the only thing that concerned me was dropping something on the motherboard pins.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
does it still work on cpus that have been used with the standard ilm already?,as far as i understand if you use the standard motherboard ilm for a while itâ€™s already â€œtoo lateâ€ and the cpu will have bent permanently.,maybe thatâ€™s why some people donâ€™t see any differences in temperatures?,i could be wrong though but i think iâ€™ve read that they could measure the bending after taking out the cpu hence it should be permanent (?),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have the thermalright and used it with my 13700k and nhu12a.,iâ€™m not noticing a huge difference in temps if any tbh.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
saw no gains with my 13600kf on z690 a pro.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i dunno tbh i wanted to buy one, people say grizzly is easier to put on but at the end of the day if you understand it then itâ€™s not hard to put on.","the thermal right has like a better or the same effect as the grizzly one, everyone will say grizzly is better since it has the measurements on the screw inserts but the thermalright kinda is just as easy.",youâ€™d have to do do even tighten pressure so like x-pattern till you feel tension with the cpu pins and then stop which i kinda like more.,(just be carful and do like 90â° on each screw at a time).,but yeah i think it wonâ€™t become common that contact frames replace the originals since itâ€™s not as user friendly.,"anyway 


tl:dr. contact frames are better but look up a video on correct usage",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i mean when you start feeling the screw is not loose any more.,what you want is something that is not lose but also no overly tightened.,if you get to the point where it cannot be tightened anymore then just go backwards in like 90 degree to loosen it a bit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"could you specify what continuous power draw you were ""fully loading"" the system under?",its rated 125w/160w power limits?,or uncapped?,i was using a thermalright pa120 and at the uncapped 200w it was pushing 92c.,at 160w it was a much more reasonable 75-80c as you noted.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
agreed.,i have the fuma 2 rev b on my 12600k and it works just as well as the 240mm aio i replaced.,the idle temp is even a few degrees lower with the fuma.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

your graphics cards is a severe bottle neck id say you would be lucky to get 60fps 1440p medium.,1080p is what that card is good at tho so 120+fps at 1080p low should be possible,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

just upgraded to the 13600 k from the i7-7700k and it like almost tripled my fps in a couple games,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
canâ€™t wait to upgrade from ivy bridge i5 in a year or so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
former 10700k owner here.,upgraded to 13600k.,there was about a 20% difference in gaming even at 1440p.,"basically, my 10700k was bottlenecking my 3080.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just bought my 13700k today.,should arrive by the weekend.,currently on 10700k and it definitely bottlenecks my 3080 12gb at 1440p.,with dlss set to quality it's just under 1080p native so i guess i will see a big performance jump.,i went with ddr5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would now be a good time to upgrade my 8700k and gtx1080?,"i only play fps shooters, mainly csgo at a high framerate and high refreshrate (390 hz).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i went from a 4790k to a 12700k and i can't tell you how much difference because it changed my life,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
going from 9900k to 13700k was also nice :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same here on am4 from 1700 to 5800x3d.,all on a single motherboard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what site is this?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thank amd, some of us jumped 4 generations just for a 20% increase.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i just upgraded from 7700k 1080 to 13900k 4090. yeah uh itâ€™s a little better ðÿ˜‚,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not really a fair comparison when your gpu is different every time you run the benchmark.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
went from i5-6600 to i5-13600k and difference **it's huge** (that's what she said).,:p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for gaming this raw performance doesn't matter as much though.,my old i7 2600k ran everything fine for like 12 years and only with the most recent most demanding titles did it start to struggle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just switched from ryzen 5 1600 to 12700kf after five years.,benchmarks show x2 improvement in single core and x3 improvement in multi-core.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
has anyone seen any benchmarks going from a lower cpu to a higher one in high resolutions such as 6k/8k?,"i've seen that the 4090 is bottlenecked in some titles at 4k but that's not really helpful to me since i run only vr games, at 6240x3120 resolution.",would like to know if i need a new cpu or not if i get a 4090 (i have an 8700k).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have a 9900kf, you think it it time upgrade?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in 2 days i'll go from 4790k to 13900k.,can't wait,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm using a 10. next upgrade will be 15. aha!,big boost.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what about games in 4k?,i am not sure if its worth it to swap 9900k if i play only in 4k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i went from i56400 to i9 9900k to i9 13900k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thinking about getting the i7 13700k coming from the i7 9700k.,would i keep my ddr4 3200mhz ram of go with ddr5?,and would ddr5 6000mhz cl36 be enough?,also do you guys recommend any mobos for an atx build i'm thinking about getting the msi mag z690 tomahawk wifi if i go the ddr4 route or msi mpg z690 carbon wifi with ddr5?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so weird i made the exact same upgrade as you:

7700k to 10700k, was thinking about 13700k but iâ€™m planning to finally go amd for the x3d cpus, i want that cache for the games that i play in particular.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"former 10750h, 2070s laptop owner here, the switch to 13600k w/ 4080 was a massive jump.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hopefully i'll be doing the same soon!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my brother just upgraded his i5 3570k oc @ 4.5 to a 12700k.,world of difference!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
next year will probably not have much in the way of excitement for new cpu's outside zen 4 vcache products.,though prices for existing stuff should hopefully be a bit better by this time next year.,"2024 seems like it's gonna be the next 'big leap' period, with zen 5 and arrow lake.","and yea, i'm still on a 3570k myself, so i feel your pain.","i know i could upgrade now, but without upgrading my gpu with it(which it feels like a bad time to do), i just dont want to bother.",got enough games to play in the meantime that wont kill my piddly 4c/4t retirement home cpu.,:p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hi, which games do you play?",because i went from 9900k 5 ghz 3600 c16 to 13900k 5.7 all cores 7200 mhz ram but not so much difference with my 3080 strix oc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
interesting.,"i also game at 1440p, have a 10700k, and was thinking about getting a 13600k.",the only difference being i've got a 3070ti and not a 3080.  did you go with a ddr4 or ddr5 build and what games do you play?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you'll see some uplift but the most consistent improvement is always 1-5% lows in most cases.,"i'm running my rtx 4090 with my i9-10850k and since i'm gaming at 4k, most benchmarks aren't *too* far off of what they'd with a newer cpu but that's in average fps.",the lows can easily be doubled with a newer cpu which makes the gameplay experience much more enjoyable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sob... i knew my 10700k was bottlenecking my 3080. i upgraded from a 1080 and it still felt like something was off.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

which mobo?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes if you have the money,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"csgo is very cpu intensive, so youâ€™ll see an impact.",in heavy gpu games youâ€™ll probably see a bottleneck.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you see a big difference?,"i'm still on a 9900k platform with a 3090 and thinking of a cpu+mobo+memory upgrade, just not sure if it's worth it yet.",probably going to skip  the 40xx series gpus unless they go on a fire sale.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

tech power up has never steered me wrong.,they are showing a 13.5% difference relative performance at 1440p between stock 10700k vs 13900k.,this build uses ddr5 @ 7400mhz on a z790 and an evga 3080 ftw3.,my 9900k (effectively a 10700k) is not at stock 5.05ghz all core with 3232mhz ddr3).,i do not suspect it's holding my 3080ti back so much that a 10% difference in performance is going to affect it.,"https://www.techpowerup.com/review/intel-core-i9-13900k/19.html

perhaps someone has a pcie generational comparison that can convince me there is more to gain?","i have no plans on upgrading, but i'm fortunate enough to have money to do so if there is something there.",hell the thing that has gotten me closer to upgrading is storage more than anything else but i have a 980pro gen 4 in both my x15r2 and my lemur pro and neither feel faster than my desktop (they both feel slower actually).,convince me!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
although this upgrade path still required 3 different motherboards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

exactly.,just bought a 13700k to replace my 2600k@4.4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think you would notice a difference between 8700k and 13900k.,"with vr, i imagine youâ€™d appreciate an improvement in 1% lows, average fps, stuttering, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in a good way or a bad way?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™ll migrate from ddr3 to ddr5, atx 3.0, sata ssd to nvme, lots of excitement still!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i went from a 5ghz 9900k on ddr4 4000 (nothing special, just hynix) to a 13700k on ddr5 6400 cl32 and feel like it was a noticeable upgrade, granted i'm using a 3090. somewhat boosted my max fps but really feeling it on the dips and 1% lows, where it stays a ton more consistent at a higher frame rate than before.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for budget reasons i went with z690 mobo that only accepts ddr4.,"i think i maybe missing about another 10% if i did go with ddr5, but i would end up spending more.","the games that were giving me the most bottleneck was, spiderman, forza 5, farcry 6 and a bit of a bottleneck with cyberpunk.",overall you will be happy with the upgrade if you were to go with the 13600k route.,i mean i ended up with a high end system at a budget price.,it is neck and neck with the 12900k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"respectfully, i donâ€™t think thatâ€™s worth it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bottleneck was pcie3.0 lanes.,3070ti uses pcie4.0 but still doesn't really need it since the max memory that 3.0 reach is 32gb/s.,3080 would push that above with pcie4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"it depends on the temperature of the cpu during the benchmark, 3.25ghz for an all core workload is technically within spec though.",if you can't keep it cool enough to boost higher though then it will throttle the core clock speeds.,you can easily check the default core clock limits with something like hwinfo64 / intelxtu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i've opened hwinfo64 and the maximum core clock is at 4,291.6 mhz.","i couldn't find the 3.25ghz anywhere (or the 3,25x.x mhz)  


it's probably as you said, the thermal throttling",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that 4.2ghz is single core speed.,you're not going to maintain those clocks with an all core load on a laptop.,the all core speeds you're getting are likely normal and unless you can undervolt or find a way to cool the laptop better i wouldn't expect to see your all core clock speed increase any.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"iâ€™ve never heard of an update doing this, so the fact that an update occurred around the same time might be completely coincidental.",especially since it â€œsometimes fixes itselfâ€.,if youâ€™re getting bd_prochot then something is sending that signal.,it could be a faulty motherboard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
unfortunately im unable to disable bd-prochot for my mobo using throttlestop.,however this issue only came up after a windows update.,is there a possibility that its a bug with the update rather than a faulty sensor?,replacing my mobo is the last resort seeing as my rig isnt even 2 months old,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"theres a significant amount of cases on the internet but all of them are coming from laptop users, which get solved with either throttlestop or unplugging their charger which i cant do.",i guess worst case scenario im gonna have to replace the mobo if theres no fix for the windows bug :/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why not just roll back the update using system restore and try that?,given that you have a snapshot that goes back far enough.,normally windows makes snapshots right before an update.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

are you loading the cpu?,"if not, youâ€™ve got your answer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
stress test the cpu.,and you have an actual number.,those are just idle states.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in idle - absolutely, it basically reflects how loaded the cpu is.","if under load - absolutely no, this means you're either limited by power or you're clock stretching, the latter is reflected by clock staying at given frequency and effective clock being lower.","this is an indication of feeding too little voltage, this also reflects in actually lower performance than supposed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if i'm understanding this correctly, the ""core effective clocks"" number in hwinfo64 is showing the clockspeed that my cpu cores are actually running at.","here in the screenshot you can see that highest ""core effective clock"" reported after a few hours playing various different games is just 4201mhz.",is this normal behavior?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this submission has been randomly featured in /r/serendipity, a bot-driven subreddit discovery engine.",more here: /r/serendipity/comments/10oanjt/12700k_hwinfo64_core_effective_clocks_is_this/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how did you manage to go lower than 400mhz?,my 12700k p cores stay at 400mhz at idle and e ecores at 2700 mhz on win 11. i capped p cores @ 4.6ghz and e cores @ 3.6ghz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you toggle the power options to high performance in control panel youll see higher clocks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
effective clocks average in the sleep states.,the cpu uses sleep states to keep itself cool and not use power while it has nothing to do.,"so at 5ghz if it does 10,000 cycles worth of work then sleeps 10,000 cycles then the effective clock is 2.5ghz since it was sleeping half the time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"effective clock is roughly the set clock speed multiplied by the load percentage on that core, i think.",so if a core is idle expect a low effective clock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my always run at the highest clock speeds.,donâ€™t know how to change that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no effective clock is where it averages in sleep states.,"from the author of hwinfo: https://www.hwinfo.com/forum/threads/effective-clock-vs-instant-discrete-clock.5958/

> hence a new approach needs to be used called the effective clock.","this method relies on hardware's capability to sample the actual clock state (all its levels) across a certain interval, including sleeping (halted) states.","the software then queries the counter over a specific polling period, which provides the average value of all clock states that occurred in the given interval.",hwinfo v6.13-3955 beta introduces reporting of this clock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"isn't it thus just a completely fictitious number, and has no bearing on the actual functionality of the chip?","like for instance if i set my pc's power plan to high performance, my 7700k runs at max turbo clocks nonstop regardless of load.","if i'm idling, the effective clock will still show ridiculously low numbers, but my cpu is clearly still functioning at the locked clock speed and performs as such.",so what's the point of this made up measurement?,what's the benefit?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if on windows, go to power options -> balanced power plan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the benefit is being able to see if there's some kind of clock stretching.,"the cpu _reported_ clocks can be let's say 5ghz, but effective clocks even at full load are 4.5ghz, that means you have 0.5ghz (or 500mhz) of clock stretching where the performance will be the same as 4.5ghz with no clock stretching.","reported clocks mean fuckall in modern gpus and cpus because the clock stretching has become more and more noticeable if you pay attention, it kinda tricks the user into thinking they are running at a very high speed but they are really not, if anything, effective clockspeed is a more trustworthy measure of the actual clockspeed when you are running at full load.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s not fictitious.,it actually counts the clock pulses in a given time interval.,your chip can report the clock at 5ghz but that matters little if the clock is shut down most of the time.,basically it tells you how much work the chip currently does.,it combines the information in clock speeds and the average c-states.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"is there a particular starting point in hardware ""modern""ness where this starts to become a problem?","because on my 7700k, it doesn't seem relevant whatsoever.","example scenario: cpumark99, a single threaded cpu benchmark app.","if i run it with all core affinity active, there will be one core that shows effective clocks rising but never coming close to my peak turbo clock.","i'll get a score like 855. but then i go and force affinity to a single logical core, and now effective clocks shows the correct max turbo boost, but guess what?","my score remains identical, 855, despite the load being the same.",it's a made up measurement that doesn't actually read hardware information to come to its conclusion.,"it's an idea, some basic algorithm that looks at cpu usage vs clock speed and comes up with some imaginary number to represent what the cpu core is actually doing.","it's still operating at a given clock speed, and that's reflected in things like lower dpc latency system-wide when forcing a locked max turbo clocks using power plan for instance, despite this supposed effective clocks showing clocks are still lower.",it's fake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you cant arrive to the conclusion something is fake because it doesnt affect you individually on the 6 yo arch you are running on an edge case scenario that's just very poor logic.,"for intel, past skylake aka 12th gen upwards; gtx 1000 upwards for nv gpus and bulldozer and upwards cpus for amd clock management helps to make the chips more stable and more efficiently thus reducing the effective clockspeed they are running.",this behavior is okay for the average user because the average user wont see bluescreens but for overclocking is _really_ annoying.,you have to be careful to check if your effective clocks are actually matching the reported ones thus having 0 stretching or the performance wont make a lot of sense on the overclock.,"on amd cpus is kinda easy, you can check effective clocks on hwinfo, for nv cards the effective clock same thing, you can read it off of hwinfo.","i know for a fact that in alder lake you cant really measure it through the states of the core, the clock gating system intel might be using cant be read the same way hwinfo gets it, but the performance drop on benchmarks is noticeable.","edit: appreciate the immediate downvote after posting even though i gave a completely reasonable explanation, thanks!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"how do you reconcile the fact that despite this metric showing the same exact idle effective clocks whether using balanced or high performance power plans, it is only with the latter that dpc latencies are dramatically reduced?",you skipped over this part of my post.,the chip is running at the higher clocks and that's proven by the significant change in dpc latency.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

im pretty sure itâ€™s not always an optimization issue tho.,"for example in cyberpunk, theres some way too cpu intensive parts where my cpu is running at like 80-85% and it canâ€™t push my card further than 80% either.","and from what iâ€™ve seen from benchmarks with the 4070 ti, the  13700 solves the issue.",i agree that with the other 2 games it pretty much comes down to horrible optimization.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this dude is using 2x8gb slow ddr5 ram and 1080p.,"please explain him that no matter the cpu, it will always have bottleneck in crap optimized games like cyberpunk.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i believe iâ€™ve found your issue, i think your ram is horribly bottlenecking you, 8gb sticks of ddr5 are not even technically single rank, they are half rank which essentially means you are only running a single rank overall which kneecaps the performance of the memory as well as the cpu.",i would seriously considering finding a decent 32gb kit with 2x16gb sticks.,"and a quick edit, a 4070ti on 1080p will easily bottleneck most cpus so a 1440p monitor will be equally as important to balance out your system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"dude honestly just get a nice 32gb ram kit, dual channel of course and a nice 1440p monitor.",who the f has a 4070ti and plays at 1080p?,you can get even the unreleased 14900k and it will still bottleneck you at that resolution.,"of you dont care about what people are suggesting around here, just be stupid and get that 13700 and see you around here complaining about the same issues.",you would be better by a mile by getting 32gb ram and a 1440p144hz monitor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is not.,even with 13900k there are gpu usage issues in cyberpunk not related to cpu.,"dude, just enjoy the cpu that you have.",you are going down the rabbit hole with new generations to come every year and will stop enjoying your hardware.,12600k and 4070ti is a great combo and changing the cpu will not going to do any miracles to bad optimized games like cyberpunk 2077.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so why did you ask around here if you are dead set on what to do.,please do me a favor.,"after you upgraded, be honest and post here an update.",i will bet it will be the same situation.,dude you are using high end hardware at 1080p!,just educate yourself that any cpu will bottleneck high end gpus at that low resolution.,especially in crap optimized games like cyberpunk or worse watch dogs (lol).,"ddr5 is standard for 16gb per memory stick, it will work amazing with 2x16gb to benefit the architecture.","go buy some higher mhz ram, and i repeat for ddr5 should be standard 2x16.","edit: you asked a small youtuber my ass, just search on youtube cpu benchmarks in cyberpunk at 1080p with any raptor lake cpu, it will not be fully utilized.",add that your crap 2x8gb ddr5 and you will have even worse performance.,go watch hardware unboxed benchmarks and see for yourself how nice ddr5 ram help in bad optimized games.,also high mhz ram help a lot in games where you want a lot of fps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so the cpu you got now is more than enough for next few years.,hypothetically you will get 13900k for 200-250 used in few years.,sell yours for for 100. or 150 and the upgrade will cost you 100. the.,you get another 5-10 years on 13900k until it becomes beyond obsolete.,you get more years on your z690 platform that way for very little money.,the advantage is in multicore perf wich if you got that spec pc you should be using it for.,in terms of gaming perf my 12600k overclocked to 5.2ghz.,"does 2030 points in r23 single

very relatable line of inquiry.,answer depends on what resolution you are targeting and if you are saturating your gpu with the cpu you have.,"generally it is more economical to saturate the gpu, or be â€œgpu limitedâ€, at your gaming resolution, so if your current cpu is doing that, then youâ€™re fine.","itâ€™s easy to tell if you are gpu-limited with hwinfo64 or msi afterburner or even task manager; if during gaming, your gpu is at 100% usage most of the time, thatâ€™s gpu limited.","if your cpu is 100% and your gpu is nibbling about from 60-80, then your cpu is the bottleneck.","butâ€¦ id you are getting the frames you need, then it doesnâ€™t matter really.",the computer always has a bottleneck.,itâ€™s just more common to gpu-limit yourself by playing at 4k.,13th gen cpus will hit more fps than 9th gen in any cpu-limited situation (like 1080p gaming over 300fps)â€¦ the clock speed is only part of the equation.,more cores helps with multithreaded stuff which gaming isnâ€™t so muchâ€¦ but the newer architectures can process more instructions per clock than the older ones.,"for gaming you donâ€™t need the 24 core chip, thereâ€™s not really much benefit of the extra cores for games.they benefit all-core workloads like blender renders and video encoding.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i was in the same situation as you.,same graphics card and same cpu.,i did upgrade to 13900k and i am getting 20-50% more fps in all games and i even feel the speed increase in daily task.,i am gaming in 3440x1440 and my cpu was the bottleneck.,i would recommend to upgrade.,edit: i forgot to mention that i often got mini freezes in demanding games which are also gone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, it will be a significant boost in everything.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well i upgraded from 9900k to 13900k.,did i need to upgrade?,"absolutely not, but it made me happy.",i was also on 3080 and upgraded to 4080 just 2 days ago.,i play good bit of squad.,"there was a big jump in performance with 13900k especially when i was using 3080. so if you can afford it, go for it because it will make you happy.",keep in mind you have to get a new motherboard too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
waste of money to get a 13900kf for anything other than production.,"you can put that money you wouldâ€™ve spent to upgrading more frequently than every 4 years by getting a 13600kf or 13700kf, end up much better off.",i write this having bought a 13900kf for work.,ideally would suggest a 7700x3d from amd for just gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i was just looking at various reviews on 9900k with 3090 and those reviews suggested that the cpu performance was just fine:

[https://www.guru3d.com/articles\_pages/msi\_geforce\_rtx\_3090\_gaming\_x\_trio\_review,31.html](https://www.guru3d.com/articles_pages/msi_geforce_rtx_3090_gaming_x_trio_review,31.html)

i would expect that your situation is pretty similar.","if you want more performance, the lowest hanging fruit for you would be either upgrading ram or overclocking your current ram.",looking at briefly your ram kit specs it seemed  that your ram has a good chance to be samsung b-die (some of those same corsair kits are and others are not).,"if it is samsung b-die, then it is the best kit you could hope for to overclock your ram.","ram overclocking is somewhat tricky though (to say the least), but it is also where the best free performance gains are.","so up to you for what you do :-d

anyhow for now: no need to upgrade.",to verify this you can just open some monitoring programs to see that your gpu runs at close to 100% load when gaming (that is a sure sign that your cpu can give the gpu all the frames to show that it needs).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good for you to share this view also.,it is contrary to the advice i was giving op which was based on some independent reviews.,i guess both cases can be valid based on other system specs and resolutions etc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i went from an i9 9900k to an i9 13900ks and the difference is very noticeable in quite a few games.,"for me it isn't about average framerate, it is often about the 1% and 0.1% lows.","with my old system i experienced much more hitching in numerous games, for instance ff7 remake or elden ring.",with the new 13900ks based build the hitching disappeared.,in game engines there are often occasional moments where there is significantly more for the cpu to do than usual.,"depending on the engine, this could be some type of garbage collection event, transferring data to the gpu, and more.",these moments where the cpu is under more load can translate into hitches with a weaker cpu (bad 1%/0.1% lows).,this is very noticeable and can ruin the experience.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for your advice!,very helpful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i'm using around the same performance cpu as his 9700k (8700k 4.7ghz) and rtx3090 and i had alot of severe cpu bottlenecking on newer games, such as plague tales requiem, spider man remastered and miles morales, forspoken etc.",currently considering to go for 13600kf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
um i have an alienware aw3423dw so i believe thats 3440x1440,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh not necessarily does anything run bad this whole topic was moreso if it's just worth the upgrade in general.,"there's a couple games that come to mind that i struggle keeping a steady 60fps in namely things like minecraft (with mods), red dead 2, metro exodus, spider man, but those are all likely faults of my own such as optimization issues and how heavy rtx can slam performance.",which is why i asked this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah the answer always lies with the game(s) you play.,war thunder is basically all i play and itâ€™s cpu limited up to 4k.,frame rates at 1080p and 1440p are nearly identical because only a single thread is loaded.,"if you feel stuttering and hardware monitoring software is showing that even one of your threads is fully saturated, itâ€™s time for an upgrade if you can swing it.",or a significant overclock but that isnâ€™t always enough.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh ya for sure the 1% and 0.1% lows will be very noticeable.,"what i wanted to tell op wasn't to upgrade or not i mentioned options for both, but that the 13900k is not necessary for gaming over the 13600k or 13700k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"refresh, new cpu, whichever.",your current combo will do 1440 for a good couple of years still.,"now if you're thinking of using a gen4 nvme drive you could upgrade to 700/600 mobo, 13600k, and ddr5 probably for what the 13900kf costs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just jumped on the microcenter 12700k and mobo deal.,iâ€™ve been noticing a lot of bottlenecking recently even with my delidded 8086k running at 5.2 ghz.,excited to try it out tomorrow.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i would say so, thereâ€™s been some good advances since the 9th gen processors.","i believe minecraft with mods is super cpu heavy but from everything that iâ€™ve heard and what iâ€™ve been told from my friends, youâ€™d benefit a good amount.","unless youâ€™re running like video creation and editing, an i9 is completely unnecessary.",youâ€™d probably bãª good with a 13th gen i5-13600k.,"apparently these days, the i7-9700k has similar performance to the i3-12100, which is crazy how much thereâ€™s been an advance in cpu performance",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you very much for the advice.,i'm looking heavily into the 13600k atm big time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i was thinking in buying the 13600k but i will go for the 13700k since i am a software engineer so having the i7 is better for me for gaming and a better performance in my work, i decided to not buy the 13900k since i won't need such power, so you should think if you are going to use all the power that the cpu offers to you",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have an msi laptop with an i711800h, using throttlestop to undervolt cpu to -80mv, cache to -70mv(the combo has been tested for over an hour in prime95).","for the igpu, im using uniengine to test, undervolt to -80mv was fine, but at -90mv gave me this.",no bsod happening,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

and no, 117w is pretty much impossible to hit with reasonable voltage.","different programs stress the cpu cores differently, so '100% load' doesn't always mean 'highest power draw'.","intel ratings seem to be hit-or-miss, with high end cpus close to/even surpass the limit, but low end is often overrated power figures for even generic stress tests/benchmarks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

could be load line calibration as i have no idea what vcore compensation means either but llc does change the votlage behavior under full load and op has an asrock board which i'm not familiar at all and that might just be asrocks naming for llc.,"so the auto-llc is probably too low, so at full load, because the default voltage is already low on a 12400 it causes clock stretching(so it still reports normal clcok speed, but it's not actually running at that, but not crashing either) and setting it higher causes the voltage to drop less when under full load hence fixing the issue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no.,"they have stopped selling intel-based systems, but the last ones were sold in 2019 and they typically commit to a 7-year support cycle, so macos support for x86 will presumably hang around at least until 2026. i can't imagine a vm-based solution is going to be a good long-term strategy anyways, so it will probably be fine for a bit, by which point he'll have to get an arm-based system or switch to running under full system emulation (e.g.",under qemu) instead of virtualization and take an even bigger performance penalty.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

do you mean 30w from wall power or soc reported power in hw-info?,30w soc from software reading is indeed not normal and something is preventing your cpu from idling down.,mine out of the box correctly idled down to 2-3w.,"maybe your power profile is set to performance, instead of balanced?","or you have software that is constantly pegging the cpu running in the background (virus, bad software, etc).",can be 101 things and google is your friend as you try and narrow the issue down.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what node update typically does (in addition to being able to use more transistors) is allow similar clock speed with lower voltage.,that affects the power consumption when the silicon is working.,"however there might be side effects such as higher leakage power when going to smaller transistors, which might actually result in higher power consumption in low intensity workloads (the whole ""race to sleep"" concept was invented because last gen planar transistors leaked so much).",this is why you can't say that node upgrade automatically makes all power consumption smaller.,for idle power consumption the sleep states and power gating will actually always be more relevant than voltage curves because actual idle by definition only has leakage power consumption.,the chip that can do more power gating uses less power on idle regardless of which node it's being produced on.,"i would guess that the problem with the io die is related to cache coherency between the chiplets, which would necessitate constant communication if even one core does anything.",but that's just a guess.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

dx12 had a unique way of loading shaders which causes stuttering the first time you load an area.,usually you get a few stutters early then it smoothes out.,but if there is some kind of driver issue it might not load textures and have prolonged stuttering.,that's just my guess without looking at the bench marks.,"also, is resizable bar turned on?",have you run ddu and fresh installed drivers?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

a) you can use a k version instead a none k version.,b) nuc or regular pcs without a gpu.,i guess intel simple produce more k than none k versions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they've been releasing the high end enthusiast lines to market first.,that means k processors and z series chipsets.,lower end options follow later.,nvidia and amd do the same.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you want the k cpu!,if you buy a non k cpu it uses last gens alder lake p-cores.,that alone is worth the extra cost and the ability to overclock is icing on the cake.,don't listen to the people telling you to not get the k cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can easily configure its power consumption to whatever you want.,13900k with 65w - easy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13600k can hit its max turbo clock speeds at 135 watt power draw.,both single & multicore..   it can go to 5.1ghz.,that's crazy.,that's a great efficiency without over clocking.,you can configure down your power requirement.,its unnecessary to overclock unless you really need that last drop of power.,there is so much misinformation about power draw.,don't overclock unless you need it.,"although intel cpus are good for overclocking, its an expensive hobby.","ref:

ok everyone.,i get it.,i got a k and plan to run i5 at 65 tdp.,it's meant to run proxmox and truenas.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

my 13900ks hits 6ghz at 130w got it turned down at the moment because i only have a 92mm cooler on it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you can control it's power consumption, the k just gives you extra headroom if you want it.",it's worth it for the negligent price difference,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the tdp values are recommendations for how you choose to throttle the cpu, not actual power consumption.","the boxed coolers with the non-k suck, so intel recommends throttling down to 65w.",you can set either cpu to throttle at 65w though (or 95w or never).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ignore the lower number.,"thatâ€™s just an arbitrary number picked by intel, and you can set it to whatever you like.",look instead to the higher number for an idea of what the cpu would potentially use under 100% load.,"for example:

- 13600: 154w / 13600k: 181w
- 13700: 219w / 13700k: 253w

the k models are clocked higher so they use more power, but you can set these to whatever limits you want.",want the cpu to use no more than 35 watts?,done.,"performance will suck, but you can do it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you just drop the cpu into the motherboard and use the default/stock settings, then the k version will consume more power than the non-k version.","however, you can go in and reconfigure the limit.",so you can limit the k cpu to use the same amount of power as the non-k cpu's.,"this will also result in non-k levels of performance, which in actuality isn't much of a performance hit as you've probably noticed.","in some ways, you can think of the ""k"" chips as already factory overclocked, but you can always go in and undo the overclock.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"christ man, i wish i had seen your post earlier.",we basically have the same laptop.,had i seen this first thing i would have told you is to either change performance profile from whisper to performance in the myasus app and then check out throttlestop to see if plâ€™s needed further adjusting.,so many people crying that a 12th gen h series processor in a laptop makes no sense but iâ€™ve absolutely fucking loved the performance this thing gives for me external gpu needs so itâ€™s a shame a lot of people went with the wrong idea here.,"pro-tip, repaste with gc gelid-extreme.",can get 50w sustained on a hot day and 55w on a cold one.,in my profile you can find my long review for the laptop and benchmarks for it in case youâ€™re interested in reading.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

when performing stressing tests, the computer doesn't heat that much and i almost can't hear the fan.i did a fan diagnostic test and at the fastest rpm, it was so powerful that you could from another room.",i would conclude that asus didn't properly optimize these settings.,edit: i have added screenshot about temperatures (60â°c) while stressing cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this one : https://www.amazon.de/dp/b09qlgmv72,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks, i've seen your other post.",glad to know that original performance mode pl1 is 45w and asus didn't lie.,i'm starting to think that the myasus app can't change those values like intel extreme tuning when hyperv or virtual machines are enabled.,i need to make tests...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they have optimized them.,for battery life.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't believe you.,"if you can't or don't want to fix this misconfiguration, i suggest returning the laptop.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you could try if you wanted to return it, iâ€™d look for other products they make/the retail sells then ask to replace with that now you know a bit more about this stuff",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so this is essentially identical to the space edition, which scores well over 11k in cinebench r23 multi-core.",the zenbook 14 oled i had with the 1260p was also scoring over 10k.,my best guess is that you have some sort of power saving mode enabled.,i assume you have already looked inside the myasus.,the fan profile option there actually controls the cpu power behavior as well as the fan profile.,you will need to set it to performance mode for best results.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the thing is that iâ€™m pretty sure it can.,"whisper mode almost always sets pl1/2 to 15w-25w, standard sets it to 35w but not sure pl2, and performance should set it to the max it can go that i mentioned.","iâ€™m positive on the whisper plâ€™s since iâ€™ve seen pretty much all other zenbook reviewers show these exact watts, and for standard one specifically ran their benchmarks in that mode (for some reason, only that mode) and it indeed showed 35w as the side mode on their graphs.",forget the source but yeah.,"it just seems that your myasus is borked for some reason, or not really sure what is at play then.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i like better having the choice.,"for battery life optimization, you would choose a battery life power plan right?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in that case, why not use the 1280p, which is the same exact chip except configured to a lower tdp?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i can change this configuration, but as i said, i'm afraid of damages, i don't know anything about it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fan performance mode and best performance power plan were chosen.,"as my tests showed, it's the power limits.","now i would love to know:
- the power limits on the 1260p model you had
- if other same specs models have the same power limits / issue",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
reinstalling intel dtt solved the problem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"personally, i agree with the choice part, and i'm disappointed that certain manufacturers make it so hard to make changes that are built into the cpu & gpu (not to mention windows allowing oems who install windows to arbitrarily lock up performance/power saving settings).","that said, one of the biggest selling points for ultrabooks is battery life, and they don't usually have a lot of thermal tolerance (though 15w-35w isn't the end of the world) before they start getting loud and burning laps - 2 features that average ultrabook owners would be very displeased by, were they the default.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think, quite simply, because benchmark shoppers would be less likely to buy it (and pay a premium to do so).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a quick look at the intel website shows that the 12900h is a 45w base cpu, supporting up to 115w boost.","obviously a zenbook is not going to get anywhere near that, but you currently have your boost settings set to below the base spec of the cpu.",something isn't quite right there.,"double check exactly how much power the cpu is drawing while under load with hwinfo, and if it is anything less than 45w, you should be boosting those power limits.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>i don't know anything about it.,sounds like a great time to start learning then.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't remember what the power limit was set to but under the performance mode the p-cores would run at 2.5ghz and the e-cores at 2.2ghz during cinebench r23 multi-core run.,this was the case with standard mode as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh, now i saw your new edit.",was looking at the bottom lmao whoops.,glad to hear then.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what exactly was your problem with intel ddt?,i'm curious.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's very deceptive marketing though, sell an ultrabook with a i9 12900h in order to command prestige and a high price but power throttle it to hell so it performs worse than a 15w u-series i5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yah a lot of mobile chips are going this route now...    my amd ryzen 9 5900hx has configurable tdp but defaults to 45w.,i actually reduced it down to 25w to keep thing thing at a reasonable temp and not have the fan just screaming!!,i get the feeling a lot of system vendors are being conservative on the tdp with these newer chips to keep things running cooler & quieter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

are you loading the cpu?,"if not, youâ€™ve got your answer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
stress test the cpu.,and you have an actual number.,those are just idle states.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in idle - absolutely, it basically reflects how loaded the cpu is.","if under load - absolutely no, this means you're either limited by power or you're clock stretching, the latter is reflected by clock staying at given frequency and effective clock being lower.","this is an indication of feeding too little voltage, this also reflects in actually lower performance than supposed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if i'm understanding this correctly, the ""core effective clocks"" number in hwinfo64 is showing the clockspeed that my cpu cores are actually running at.","here in the screenshot you can see that highest ""core effective clock"" reported after a few hours playing various different games is just 4201mhz.",is this normal behavior?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this submission has been randomly featured in /r/serendipity, a bot-driven subreddit discovery engine.",more here: /r/serendipity/comments/10oanjt/12700k_hwinfo64_core_effective_clocks_is_this/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how did you manage to go lower than 400mhz?,my 12700k p cores stay at 400mhz at idle and e ecores at 2700 mhz on win 11. i capped p cores @ 4.6ghz and e cores @ 3.6ghz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you toggle the power options to high performance in control panel youll see higher clocks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
effective clocks average in the sleep states.,the cpu uses sleep states to keep itself cool and not use power while it has nothing to do.,"so at 5ghz if it does 10,000 cycles worth of work then sleeps 10,000 cycles then the effective clock is 2.5ghz since it was sleeping half the time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"effective clock is roughly the set clock speed multiplied by the load percentage on that core, i think.",so if a core is idle expect a low effective clock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my always run at the highest clock speeds.,donâ€™t know how to change that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no effective clock is where it averages in sleep states.,"from the author of hwinfo: https://www.hwinfo.com/forum/threads/effective-clock-vs-instant-discrete-clock.5958/

> hence a new approach needs to be used called the effective clock.","this method relies on hardware's capability to sample the actual clock state (all its levels) across a certain interval, including sleeping (halted) states.","the software then queries the counter over a specific polling period, which provides the average value of all clock states that occurred in the given interval.",hwinfo v6.13-3955 beta introduces reporting of this clock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"isn't it thus just a completely fictitious number, and has no bearing on the actual functionality of the chip?","like for instance if i set my pc's power plan to high performance, my 7700k runs at max turbo clocks nonstop regardless of load.","if i'm idling, the effective clock will still show ridiculously low numbers, but my cpu is clearly still functioning at the locked clock speed and performs as such.",so what's the point of this made up measurement?,what's the benefit?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if on windows, go to power options -> balanced power plan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the benefit is being able to see if there's some kind of clock stretching.,"the cpu _reported_ clocks can be let's say 5ghz, but effective clocks even at full load are 4.5ghz, that means you have 0.5ghz (or 500mhz) of clock stretching where the performance will be the same as 4.5ghz with no clock stretching.","reported clocks mean fuckall in modern gpus and cpus because the clock stretching has become more and more noticeable if you pay attention, it kinda tricks the user into thinking they are running at a very high speed but they are really not, if anything, effective clockspeed is a more trustworthy measure of the actual clockspeed when you are running at full load.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s not fictitious.,it actually counts the clock pulses in a given time interval.,your chip can report the clock at 5ghz but that matters little if the clock is shut down most of the time.,basically it tells you how much work the chip currently does.,it combines the information in clock speeds and the average c-states.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"is there a particular starting point in hardware ""modern""ness where this starts to become a problem?","because on my 7700k, it doesn't seem relevant whatsoever.","example scenario: cpumark99, a single threaded cpu benchmark app.","if i run it with all core affinity active, there will be one core that shows effective clocks rising but never coming close to my peak turbo clock.","i'll get a score like 855. but then i go and force affinity to a single logical core, and now effective clocks shows the correct max turbo boost, but guess what?","my score remains identical, 855, despite the load being the same.",it's a made up measurement that doesn't actually read hardware information to come to its conclusion.,"it's an idea, some basic algorithm that looks at cpu usage vs clock speed and comes up with some imaginary number to represent what the cpu core is actually doing.","it's still operating at a given clock speed, and that's reflected in things like lower dpc latency system-wide when forcing a locked max turbo clocks using power plan for instance, despite this supposed effective clocks showing clocks are still lower.",it's fake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you cant arrive to the conclusion something is fake because it doesnt affect you individually on the 6 yo arch you are running on an edge case scenario that's just very poor logic.,"for intel, past skylake aka 12th gen upwards; gtx 1000 upwards for nv gpus and bulldozer and upwards cpus for amd clock management helps to make the chips more stable and more efficiently thus reducing the effective clockspeed they are running.",this behavior is okay for the average user because the average user wont see bluescreens but for overclocking is _really_ annoying.,you have to be careful to check if your effective clocks are actually matching the reported ones thus having 0 stretching or the performance wont make a lot of sense on the overclock.,"on amd cpus is kinda easy, you can check effective clocks on hwinfo, for nv cards the effective clock same thing, you can read it off of hwinfo.","i know for a fact that in alder lake you cant really measure it through the states of the core, the clock gating system intel might be using cant be read the same way hwinfo gets it, but the performance drop on benchmarks is noticeable.","edit: appreciate the immediate downvote after posting even though i gave a completely reasonable explanation, thanks!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i just did this exact upgrade 9700 @ 5.0 and all.,it's over kill but holy crap what a difference.,i kept my 6900xt and it unlocked that gpu.,the 1% lows got a massive improvement and the avg fps also got a big bump.,for me it was about 30-40 fps in 1% lows and about 20-30 gained avg fps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just upgraded from a 9900k to a 13700k, knowing completely that my average frame rates in war thunder would hardly move because i was *almost* gpu bound (88-94% utilization).","the big difference is that with the 9900k, thread 1 was pegged at 99-100% utilization at all times during games.",after the upgrade (7200mhz ddr5 included) that single thread utilization is down to around 55% and my gpu is pegged at 98%.,so final performance is still around 180 fps on average but with much better frame time stability.,havenâ€™t felt a stutter in any game since.,wish i wouldâ€™ve upgraded earlier.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"13900k is firmly unnecessary for gaming, you're paying so much more for such little extra performance that won't really matter anyways over the 13600k.",e cores don't benefit gaming and rather it's the opposite so all those extra ecores don't really matter.,are you happy with your performance?,you could wait another year and see what 14th gen has to offer but if not and you do want to upgrade and you live near microcenter they have an incredible deal going on right now $250 for 13600k and $330 for 13700k so now is a great time to get one of those.,msi z690 pro-a is a good board on the cheaper side.,your current aio will work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

very relatable line of inquiry.,answer depends on what resolution you are targeting and if you are saturating your gpu with the cpu you have.,"generally it is more economical to saturate the gpu, or be â€œgpu limitedâ€, at your gaming resolution, so if your current cpu is doing that, then youâ€™re fine.","itâ€™s easy to tell if you are gpu-limited with hwinfo64 or msi afterburner or even task manager; if during gaming, your gpu is at 100% usage most of the time, thatâ€™s gpu limited.","if your cpu is 100% and your gpu is nibbling about from 60-80, then your cpu is the bottleneck.","butâ€¦ id you are getting the frames you need, then it doesnâ€™t matter really.",the computer always has a bottleneck.,itâ€™s just more common to gpu-limit yourself by playing at 4k.,13th gen cpus will hit more fps than 9th gen in any cpu-limited situation (like 1080p gaming over 300fps)â€¦ the clock speed is only part of the equation.,more cores helps with multithreaded stuff which gaming isnâ€™t so muchâ€¦ but the newer architectures can process more instructions per clock than the older ones.,"for gaming you donâ€™t need the 24 core chip, thereâ€™s not really much benefit of the extra cores for games.they benefit all-core workloads like blender renders and video encoding.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah at present 1440p gaming is typically gpu limited not cpu, so if you're liking where you are stick with it, the 600 and 700 chipset will be replaced by 800 series and some newer chips middle of this year anyways.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what resolution do you play at?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it will be a huge jump.,i would recommend the 13700k tho,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have pretty much the same system as you minus the overclocked cpu.,what are you aiming for?,i run 1440p 165hz and my system runs pretty well on that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was in the same situation as you.,same graphics card and same cpu.,i did upgrade to 13900k and i am getting 20-50% more fps in all games and i even feel the speed increase in daily task.,i am gaming in 3440x1440 and my cpu was the bottleneck.,i would recommend to upgrade.,edit: i forgot to mention that i often got mini freezes in demanding games which are also gone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, it will be a significant boost in everything.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well i upgraded from 9900k to 13900k.,did i need to upgrade?,"absolutely not, but it made me happy.",i was also on 3080 and upgraded to 4080 just 2 days ago.,i play good bit of squad.,"there was a big jump in performance with 13900k especially when i was using 3080. so if you can afford it, go for it because it will make you happy.",keep in mind you have to get a new motherboard too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
waste of money to get a 13900kf for anything other than production.,"you can put that money you wouldâ€™ve spent to upgrading more frequently than every 4 years by getting a 13600kf or 13700kf, end up much better off.",i write this having bought a 13900kf for work.,ideally would suggest a 7700x3d from amd for just gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i was just looking at various reviews on 9900k with 3090 and those reviews suggested that the cpu performance was just fine:

[https://www.guru3d.com/articles\_pages/msi\_geforce\_rtx\_3090\_gaming\_x\_trio\_review,31.html](https://www.guru3d.com/articles_pages/msi_geforce_rtx_3090_gaming_x_trio_review,31.html)

i would expect that your situation is pretty similar.","if you want more performance, the lowest hanging fruit for you would be either upgrading ram or overclocking your current ram.",looking at briefly your ram kit specs it seemed  that your ram has a good chance to be samsung b-die (some of those same corsair kits are and others are not).,"if it is samsung b-die, then it is the best kit you could hope for to overclock your ram.","ram overclocking is somewhat tricky though (to say the least), but it is also where the best free performance gains are.","so up to you for what you do :-d

anyhow for now: no need to upgrade.",to verify this you can just open some monitoring programs to see that your gpu runs at close to 100% load when gaming (that is a sure sign that your cpu can give the gpu all the frames to show that it needs).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good for you to share this view also.,it is contrary to the advice i was giving op which was based on some independent reviews.,i guess both cases can be valid based on other system specs and resolutions etc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i went from an i9 9900k to an i9 13900ks and the difference is very noticeable in quite a few games.,"for me it isn't about average framerate, it is often about the 1% and 0.1% lows.","with my old system i experienced much more hitching in numerous games, for instance ff7 remake or elden ring.",with the new 13900ks based build the hitching disappeared.,in game engines there are often occasional moments where there is significantly more for the cpu to do than usual.,"depending on the engine, this could be some type of garbage collection event, transferring data to the gpu, and more.",these moments where the cpu is under more load can translate into hitches with a weaker cpu (bad 1%/0.1% lows).,this is very noticeable and can ruin the experience.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for your advice!,very helpful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i'm using around the same performance cpu as his 9700k (8700k 4.7ghz) and rtx3090 and i had alot of severe cpu bottlenecking on newer games, such as plague tales requiem, spider man remastered and miles morales, forspoken etc.",currently considering to go for 13600kf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
um i have an alienware aw3423dw so i believe thats 3440x1440,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh not necessarily does anything run bad this whole topic was moreso if it's just worth the upgrade in general.,"there's a couple games that come to mind that i struggle keeping a steady 60fps in namely things like minecraft (with mods), red dead 2, metro exodus, spider man, but those are all likely faults of my own such as optimization issues and how heavy rtx can slam performance.",which is why i asked this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah the answer always lies with the game(s) you play.,war thunder is basically all i play and itâ€™s cpu limited up to 4k.,frame rates at 1080p and 1440p are nearly identical because only a single thread is loaded.,"if you feel stuttering and hardware monitoring software is showing that even one of your threads is fully saturated, itâ€™s time for an upgrade if you can swing it.",or a significant overclock but that isnâ€™t always enough.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh ya for sure the 1% and 0.1% lows will be very noticeable.,"what i wanted to tell op wasn't to upgrade or not i mentioned options for both, but that the 13900k is not necessary for gaming over the 13600k or 13700k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"refresh, new cpu, whichever.",your current combo will do 1440 for a good couple of years still.,"now if you're thinking of using a gen4 nvme drive you could upgrade to 700/600 mobo, 13600k, and ddr5 probably for what the 13900kf costs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just jumped on the microcenter 12700k and mobo deal.,iâ€™ve been noticing a lot of bottlenecking recently even with my delidded 8086k running at 5.2 ghz.,excited to try it out tomorrow.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i would say so, thereâ€™s been some good advances since the 9th gen processors.","i believe minecraft with mods is super cpu heavy but from everything that iâ€™ve heard and what iâ€™ve been told from my friends, youâ€™d benefit a good amount.","unless youâ€™re running like video creation and editing, an i9 is completely unnecessary.",youâ€™d probably bãª good with a 13th gen i5-13600k.,"apparently these days, the i7-9700k has similar performance to the i3-12100, which is crazy how much thereâ€™s been an advance in cpu performance",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you very much for the advice.,i'm looking heavily into the 13600k atm big time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i was thinking in buying the 13600k but i will go for the 13700k since i am a software engineer so having the i7 is better for me for gaming and a better performance in my work, i decided to not buy the 13900k since i won't need such power, so you should think if you are going to use all the power that the cpu offers to you",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thank you very much for testing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you know the reason for the 1st and second run time discrepancies?,"is the 2nd run a cached event of the first and is not actually ""generating"" anything?",i'm using linux and in the past have set up automatic1111.,it will be interesting to see when/if hte oneapi gets folded in.,thank you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can you give a link to the fork?,"i can't seem to find it

edit: 

i fount it.",use the oneapi branch at [https://github.com/jbaboval/stable-diffusion-webui/tree/oneapi](https://github.com/jbaboval/stable-diffusion-webui/tree/oneapi) and follow the instructions in arcnotes.txt.,also check out this issue https://github.com/automatic1111/stable-diffusion-webui/issues/6417,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's definitely generating things on the subsequent runs.,you can change the prompts and settings and get different results all at the higher speed.,"&#x200b;

i'm not sure what specifically is the reason yet, and i haven't dug in.","but there is all sorts of just-in-time compiling and optimization supported by the code, and it could be any of those things.",or something as simple as a big memory transfer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"you shouldâ€™ve bought a 13600k, honestly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can set pl1 and pl2 around 150w.,on my 13600k with a thermlright pa120 i have it set around 140w and it doesn't exceed 80â° c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for gaming purposes, you can limit it even to 90w and your fps will be around the same.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rma the cpu and get another one.,basically youâ€™ve paid a lot of money and now youâ€™re trying to make it work like a lot less expensive cpu.,get 12700 or 13600k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i can understand the idea of getting lower tier 13600k, but suggesting 12700 is absurd.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why?,12700 is pretty similar to 13700 but with much much lower power consumption and a bit lower frequencies and costs a lot less if itâ€™s on sale or 2nd hand.,just what op is trying to achieve.,the extra 4 efficiency cores does not matter in 90% of cases.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no.,"they have stopped selling intel-based systems, but the last ones were sold in 2019 and they typically commit to a 7-year support cycle, so macos support for x86 will presumably hang around at least until 2026. i can't imagine a vm-based solution is going to be a good long-term strategy anyways, so it will probably be fine for a bit, by which point he'll have to get an arm-based system or switch to running under full system emulation (e.g.",under qemu) instead of virtualization and take an even bigger performance penalty.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think zen 2 cpus are too weak for current driver overhead for the arc gpus.,"i read of another user on a ryzen 4k series apu having performance issues on cyberpunk 2077.

their driver has bottlenecks even in modern apis such as dx12 and likely even vulkan.","the golden cove cores in 12th and 13th gen are stronger than zen 3 nevermind zen 2, so low end 12th gen/13th gen/ryzen 5k/ryzen 7k is good.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whats the stick setup.,"3200 is also relatively slow for zen 2. would see a significant uplift more than likely from 3600-4000, depending on what your imc can handle.",even those speeds with crappy timings should net you a large performance increase from the if clock being much higher and arc having tons of cpu overhead,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just picked up a r5 3600xt so hopefully,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m new i thought ram only play a part in like loading speeds not fps too lol i have to much into the build as is so looks like iâ€™m giving up on the arc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3600xt is zen 2+.,you need 5000 series to get zen 3. and even zen 3 is slower than golden cove in alderlake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ram has nothing to do with loading speeds at all.,"i wouldnt give up on arc, so far lack of user knowledge is the root of your issues, not the card.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so would a ryzen 5 5600x be enough?,i canâ€™t afford the ryzen 7 5800x3d the other guy was saying to get?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well what should i do get rid of the ram i just dropped 100 on a few weeks ago and buy new stuff lol just keep dumping money until i get better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
idk i bet you i could put a 3060 in here it get it to run a lot better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think so.,the fact that it makes such a difference means the microarchitecture is what matters.,"because the single threaded performance is higher than zen 3 nevermind zen 2.

yes people seem to be fine with chips like 12100.",5600x should be more than fine.,"also since this is based on the current situation of the driver, whatever deficiency there is, it'll get better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
look into and play with overclocking the snot out of your ram.,"i would not recommend spending a significant amount of money on anything, it seems as if your system is pretty well spec'd.","like i said tuning, and then playing with your software environment, will lead to better performance and experience improvements over new parts.",(unless you were to upgrade to the 5800x3d or gpu with 3070 ti performance or greater),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

depends on your cooler backplate.,if your cooler backplate isnt sturdy enough you could look into the thermal right contact frame just to be on the safe side,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have 12700k for a year now and no issues at all.,"30c on idle, 40-45c on gaming, cinebench was like \~85c.",kraken x63.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a contact frame makes sense on a 12700k and higher.,an i5 doesn't put out much heat.,and if you re still unsure derbauer made a video stretching a motherboard extreme and it still worked fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hi, yes buy the thermaltake contact frame it's cheap and it's easy to install, if you can find a 13th gen i5 13400f for only a couple bucks more than that would be my choice it's more future proof.","cpu bending on lga 1700 it's a real isue that makes the difference between  buying a 30 bucks cooler and one that costs more for your needs, buy the thermaltake contact frame i'm talking from experience.",ðÿ‘,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"short answer yes, 12th and 13th no difference the possibility is there.","&#x200b;

good news, steve from gn did testing and no matter which one you get if installed properly for the type you get, they all work.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i wouldn't worry about the bend, while using a contact frame can lower your temperatures by a few degrees, there's not a single report of a 12th or 13th gen cpu failing due to this.","i can also say having tested the thermalright contact frame, i'm convinced in some scenarios depending on your board, cpu and cooler, there are scenarios it won't apply enough pressure on the cpu and you can end up having situations were the memory won't post.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
getting a contact frame for a 12400f is not worth it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how bad has the bending been on the motherboards you've worked with and has it caused any issues other than temperatures?,also does it occur on the lower watt chips too?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yâ€™all wonâ€™t spend $50 more for a substantially better cpu but will waste $15 on a useless item that accomplishes nothing in opâ€™s case.,funny how that works,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"got a link, quickly scanned his channel and no video seems obvious.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i know its not needed for temperatures but what about preventing the mobo and cpu from warping?,that's something which is not just specific to the higher clocked intel cpus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's not the motherboard that's bending, as it's reinforced with a metal plate on the opposite side of the mounting bracket.","the cpu itself what is being is being bowed from the center based on the two ""wings"" being the primary pressure point when the stock mounting frame is locked down.","i have a small machinist square along with some thin feeler gauges i've used to check numerous cpu's when they are installed in the socket, and there are variances between how much deflection each socket creates on an installed cpu and the corresponding severity of the thermal or ram compatibility i've seen.",some coolers actually have convex contact surfaces to account for ihs bowing and may not manifest cooling issues as significantly as those with flat mounting surfaces.,"the model/wattage of the cpu has no impact on the issue, it's the metal mounting frame on the mainboard which is screwed into the metal backplate on the other side of the board so it'll screw up a 12100 just as badly as a 13900ks.","the two worst examples i found were on an asus strix b660i itx mainboard (ddr5) which was mostly just a ""thermals"" problem, and a gigabyte gaming-x ddr4 board that had severe ram compatibility issues with anything above jdec/2133 speeds until a thermalright frame was installed.","in order of importance i consider the value of the frame to be: improved memory timings/compatibility, thermals, and longevity + resale value of the chip.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wouldn't worry about the motherboard bending at all.,"if it is fully screwed down, there's little chance it will warp from using parts they're designed to handle.",the cpu bend is a different issue regarding certain coolers and how they rest of the cpu.,"i literally installed a contact frame on my cpu 2 days ago, it's easy, but likely not necessary.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
who said the op wouldn't spend $50 more on a different cpu?,they expressed specific concern with the ilm and bending/deflecting damage to the cpu in 3+ years as well as the thermal concerns.,for $15 they prevent the warping/bending issue (valid) and potentially pick-up some thermal improvements.,that $15 isn't enough to upgrade the cpu in a meaningful way so it's not like they are makin an either/or choice here.,are the thermal improvements important for a 12400 and a proper heatsink?,"not really, but it still addresses their specific concerns regarding warping/bending over time while also providing the improved thermals with whatever cpu they install now or in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmdmw4omd30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmdmw4omd30)  this one was my reference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the amount of warping is extremely small, you would need to hold a razer blade on top of the ihs and squint your eyes to see the gap from the ""bowing"" that occurs.",it really only matters when you are trying to overclock and you need to have the absolute best possible cooling potential.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you're worried about it, the investment is really minimal for some peace of mind.",they look kinda neat too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the explanation.,i was actually going to use a rog strix b660i itx mobo.,would you say the ilm issue is more pronounced on this board compared to others ?,and just to confirm even if a cooler has a convex surface it still wonâ€™t prevent the cpu from bending over time?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but iâ€™m talking about the long term effects.,over time donâ€™t you think itâ€™s possible for the warping to get worse?,and even disregarding temperatures wouldnâ€™t a bent ihs have performance and stability issues?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"as far as i know (i donâ€™t own one so please feel free to correct), 5.2ghz is the correct all-core turbo speed for the 13900k.",5.4ghz is the less-than-all-core turbo speed.,"5.7ghz is the preferred 1/2 core (turbo max 3.0) turbo, and then thereâ€™s 100mhz on top of all of these if tvb is enabled and the cpu is below 65 degrees.","so, if everythingâ€™s enabled and stock and you monitor general system usage for like an hour, 2 cores should hit 5.8ghz and the rest 5.5ghz, just not all at the same time.",a run of r23 should stabilize at 5.2ghz without hitting any throttles.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if you have stock settings (mce off and intel adaptive boost off) then it should start out at 5.5 p core and 4.3 e core.,after 5-10 seconds it goes to 5.1-2 p core and 4.1-2 e core.,if you have intel adaptive boost on which is usually default on motherboards it should be 5.5p core 4.3 e core unless thermal throttle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i just wanted to chime in that i too am getting 5.2ghz mce off with 253 power limit and i think not all chips will boost the same and the silicon quality will matter if one can do 5.2ghz or 5.5ghz with mce off.,tbh i didnt know what to expect for out of the box mce off 253watts power limit and i decided to try and apply a 0.07v offset and since the cores now consume less power it has more power budget to boost to 5.5ghz in r23.,though i am getting a whea errors and internal cpu errors as seen on hwinfo64 (no crashing)  maybe my chip cant do -0.07v,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, temps get to around 88c after long benchmarks.",i have done some more fiddling and can maintain almost 5.4 average p core and a bit over 4.2 average e core after applying a hefty offset.,core vids and vcore read about 1.20-1.21v with a -0.110v offset in xtu.,"seems that i should have been getting the full 5.5 before the offset though, since i wasn't throttling?","i throttle with unlimited power, getting to 99-100c.","although i do recall sometimes where hwinfo throttle flag is 'yes', but the max temps never broke like 87c, so maybe i am throttling?",i just figured the sensor was getting erroneous data.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
perhaps my temps instantly shoot past the threshold.,i figured as long as there was enough voltage/power and the cpu wasn't throttling these speeds were attainable.,i can score around 39.2-39.3k with my 1.2v fixed vcore and -0.100v offset at 240w pl1 and pl2.,just seems strange that going to higher voltage hurts my performance so much that all cores downclock 300-400mhz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is incorrect.",all-core turbo ratio is 55x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you using a fixed or adaptive vcore and what voltage?,maybe our chips just don't tolerate much voltage.,seems so weird as most of the overclocking guides i see are running 1.35-1.45v on the 13900k.,performance is much worse for me at those voltages.,at 1.45v windows is buggy and i can't drag windows around.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
somebody else suggested it only boosts to those speeds if you have thermal headroom.,i would think i do since my max temps in these scenarios are about 88c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"right, i can hit 5.5 all core with more power, but it seems a lot of people can do it with 253w, so i was thinking maybe it was voltage or something else.",perhaps my chip just needs more power than others.,is svid the same as sa vid?,"not sure i have seen svid in bios, but i will look.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
technically speaking you should get 5.5 with stock setup and mce off.,have you tried with sync all core 5.5 without the offset?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"then intel needs to work on their specs, since ark shows 5.4 as max p-core turbo, tvb should only apply at less than 65 degrees, and if every core is getting a 3.0 boost then wtf is the point of specifying it separately.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
speed only throttles at 100c.,if you arenâ€™t hitting that tinge.,you have thermal headroom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

iâ€™ve had failures with every revision and one board with it that has no problems whatsoever.,itâ€™s a gamble,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
v3 on a z790 board here.,"the auto-negotiation (speed drops to 100 mbit) issues i had seem to be solved by changing cables, despite the old cable working perfectly fine with a 1 gbit intel controller before that.",the whole i225-v controller completely vanishing from windows after a reboot seems to have happened every time a memory (!),overclock turned out to be unstable.,"for a few weeks i did not notice any problems anymore, so testing multiple cables of different builds and checking memory stability is something i can suggest to anyone experiencing problems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just built a coworker a new personal machine earlier this week with an msi b760 board where it just wouldn't connect to the internet no matter what i did.,"replaced it with a z790 (also msi), and same thing.",i always download the motherboard drivers direct from the manufacturer ahead of time to save myself some trouble but in this case it didn't help.,"turns out, msi have the incorrect lan driver on their website for these boards...it was realtek when it should have been intel.",found the intel i225 (3) driver elsewhere and everything connected immediately with no further issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how do you check for this revision 3 people are talking about?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my rev3 was dropping out for a few seconds, once every 12-24 hours.",i only noticed it by checking the event log in windows.,disabled power management and switched to 1gbps mode.,been fine since then.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have the ver 3 revision, using it on a pfsense machine, works like a charm, never had any problem or disconnect.",uptime more than 60 days.,stays at 2.5 all the time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"people say that the revision 3 of i225 does not have issues, but i have not verified it myself",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
j have had no priblem with mine on z690 force but others say they do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a z690 apex with the v3 controller.,had random short disconnects and low speed until i updated to the december driver.,after that speed was still meh but disconnects seemed less/gone.,i bought a usb 3.0 to ethernet dongle and issues were fixed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i get random disconnects.,bf2042 will randomly drop back to the menu with no warning after lagging out.,event viewer reports a disconnect and reconnect.,this happens over and over.,i had the same problem two years ago on a previous system.,currently using the 2.1.1.7 driver from intel.,the solution is to buy a $25 dollar non-intel ethernet card and never look back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i dont think intel had a product nevermind an ethernet product that actually works correctly or doesnt have a massive security hole in it forcing the performance to be downgraded, i have an x710 ethernet device which hasnt worked correctly since about kernel 5.15, i'll never waste my time with with another intel ethernet device.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, and so do the new i226.",the problems are in hardware.,they will never be fixed.,buy another board with a different chipset.,don't listen to the people telling you it's bad cables or a bad switch or other nonsense.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have a asus b550-a with a i225v r3 and it still has problems, tried turning of auto negotiations, driver updates, downgrades etc.",nothing helped.,got a cheap lan adapter from amazon in the end and it solved everything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if anyone is having trouble with this controller still, try doubling the transmit and recieve buffers.",this totally fixed all my issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i can confirm the auto-negotiation issue using a 20m cat7 cable from a different room.,"i was getting about one dropout a day with about 15h daily uptime, regardless of using windows or linux.",after a few seconds of no connection at all each dropout would cause the connection to reset to 100mbit.,my motherboard is a z690-i strix and the chip is also v3 with fw 1.73. upon reading this comment i ordered a cheap tenda sg105 gigabit switch from amazon and connected the cat7 to the switch and the switch to the i225-v using a short cat6.,this has made dropouts stop completely so i do think it's an issue of this nic being incompatible with certain cable types or lengths.,"i have never experienced any issues regarding the nic not being detected by the os, even during memory overclocking.","in my experience this nic is unreliable and motherboards with it should be avoided at all costs if there is an alternative, such as one made by realtek.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"for gaming purposes, you can limit it even to 90w and your fps will be around the same.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
rma the cpu and get another one.,basically youâ€™ve paid a lot of money and now youâ€™re trying to make it work like a lot less expensive cpu.,get 12700 or 13600k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i can understand the idea of getting lower tier 13600k, but suggesting 12700 is absurd.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why?,12700 is pretty similar to 13700 but with much much lower power consumption and a bit lower frequencies and costs a lot less if itâ€™s on sale or 2nd hand.,just what op is trying to achieve.,the extra 4 efficiency cores does not matter in 90% of cases.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes!,"same here, it just got installed but i'm uninstalling until they allow us to change it.","i play a lot of apex legends, so already use alt for my voice communication and i for the inventory, so the amount of times this would pop up in-game would be very annoying.","i consistently have to change app hotkeys from ""alt+(whatever)"" all the time, but at least they allow us to change them!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
going to follow this.,for right now i'll just uninstall it.,trying to use blender for work and unhide objects (alt h) and it's just coming up saying i can't change monitors.,would be nice to be able to change the hotkeys.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"also looking for a way to disable these, another application uses alt+i and alt+o, so i keep constantly hitting them just to be treated by the arc control.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the most stupid designers at intel wouldn't make such mistakes.,anybody got any idea how to resolve it?,i can see the option to change it but it is inactive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"came here seeking answers for this exact problem... has really stalled my modelling, and thats what i bought the graphics card for!",its my only complaint at the moment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think you give them too much credit.,surely they would.,"somewhere between the software designers, who, just like us, believed this should be changeable, and programmers, who for some reason didn't think so or just didn't implement it yet, or just thought that this is an interface for displaying not changing the shortcuts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i personally use only 8-p cores(hyperthreading on) have e disabled on the 12900kf for gaming, love it.",everyone does it differently ðÿ¤·ðÿ»â€â™‚ï¸,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
recently i watched someone stream cnc red alert remastered and it becames choppy.,later on the streamer show on his screen it was steam unlocking preloaded games that causes it.,he has ryzen 5900x.,"i wonder if steam will only use ecore in this case, i'll have to try that later if they allows preloading hogwarts legacy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i tell people more cores is better and they tell me you donâ€™t need that many and same with ram.,i have 32 gigs of ram and a 10900f.,my work programs and school stuff sit around 16/17gb ram and then iâ€™ll take a break and okay a round or two of cod 0 stutters because i have that many cores and ram.,best decision i ever made to go for an overkill cpu.,while playing it will be around 27 gigs of ram.,i cannot close my stuff as thatâ€™s how i work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this...isn't demanding at all?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is the equivalent of saying a high-end sports car will be better than a 1.0l hatchback at a track day.,"like, ok?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you bought this game very expensive.,nice?,i watch the demo video seem very nice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i really worship intelâ€™s platform stability.,their cpus have been working great with pretty much everything for decades now and still going strong!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i prefer 10 p cores lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
me with 10105f: listen i love you but you gotta do them job okay ðÿ—¿,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™ve always wondered about this.,can you really do side stuff while gaming like surfing the internet that utilize only e cores while p cores focuses on gaming?,will i not suffer from fps drops?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"meanwhile me with davinci resolve, lightroom, photoshop, discord, chrome & game on 7950x using less power.",ðÿ™„,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nvidia gpu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe not at 74 mb/s but that sound like a stupid usecase for 16 dumb cores,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 8 p-cores have hypertherading, meaning itâ€™s actually 16+16=32 threads.",op likely just mistook cores for threads.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"some games that i played did use ecores, iirc the priority is

p core > e core > hyperthread.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, some games will use all cores, even all threads.",thats why i dont understand why some people turn off e cores in the bios.,it just doesnt make sense to me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
on 12th gen turning off e waste cores is beneficial because you can then improve ring latency ontop of overclocking the ring much higher.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, every time i download while gaming, steam uses the e core only, its kinda amazing.","if you have a program maximized, p core and e core will be split",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they probably shouldâ€™ve used nvenc then.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i agree...people look at those benchmarks from all of these reviewers running them on a nice clean rig with nothing on it.,the thing is nobody is running those tests with a ton of programs running in the background because it creates inconsistently in their results.,at the same time they are not really testing a realistic scenario.,i have a feeling a lot of the more budget cpus they recommend would tell a different story with a bunch of background programs chugging them down while you game.,(especially the 6 core cpus),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"actually steam uses quite a lot of cpu to uncompress downloaded games, more so on unlocking preloaded games.","i used to have a 6 core system that is getting hammered on when downloading games on steam, its more noticeable when your internet speed is not the bottleneck.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
steam uses 75-100% of my 13600k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol.,"true

"it doesnt on my test, butter smooth",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes you can do things while gaming.,i let my p-cores take care of all of my gaming apps and certain workloads that i don't want going to the e- cores.,"_x000d_  
_x000d_  
i let the e-cores take care of background tasks such as web-browsers, video streaming, obs, streaming software, downloads\\uploads & other side tasks depending on the workload.","it also makes it easy to render workloads when you need to use your pc for other things, like playing\\streaming new games.",i love the multi-tasking options.,"_x000d_  
_x000d_  
i haven't noticed any stutter.",i'm using a 12900k undervolted with a slight overclock on the e-cores.,the e-cores are more powerful than they appear.,they are pretty decent.,i'm sure they are straight beast on the higher end raptor lake cpus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i saw a reviewer on youtube cap the fps and compare gaming and they actually were not that much different.,"sure intel keeps showing more power draw in gaming, but it is also producing more fps.","on top of that intel cpus have significantly lower idle power draw, so i would imagine the overall power usage between the 2 is not as drastically different as you think.",after all of the issues i had with the x570 platform and their numerous bios bugs throughout the years...i would gladly take a bit higher power draw to get away from that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s funny af ðÿ˜­ i went from an 11600k to a 13600k and the 8 extra â€œstupid coresâ€ let me process 30 minutes long openshot files while i game at 2k 140+ fps with no stutter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lmao,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea well threads != cores haha.,most games are only lightly multithreaded as many aspects of games require serialized rendering.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they say it's for latency and consistent/higher low % fps and that it ""steals"" cpu cache from p cores... thats just what i randomly read... but i also like to keep them, cause i paid for them, too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because especially on 12th gen like yours turning off e cores lets you overclock the ring clock significantly and improve ringe latency so much you probably are faster in gaming than using the e waste cores.,on 13th gen this does not apply anymore.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is this more waiting on software developers to implement or is it something the user can control like a priority hierarchy kind of things?,or both even?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"its a dual pc setup, nvenc doesnt help in this case.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think they don't run test that way because it also not the norm.,"im sure there are going to be some people with a bunch of productivity programs running on their pc when they game, but its not a normal situation for most people.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yea, downloading on steam use alot of cpu power , its gonna chew all the e cores available(depending on your internet speed)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"keep in mind 16 cores on ryzen (as for now) consists of 2 ccds, which would make a latency between cores from ccd1 to ccd2, while for now intel could win cause low latency communication between cores (monolithic duh, we didnt see tile based perf yet), it would be justified that those real i cores are doing its job while the e cores are doing a skylake ipc job which is fine actually.","also yeah, amd platform offers great hardware with more bugs on release, which is not okay but they dont have much soft and firm ware engineer as much as intel/nvidia ðÿ˜‚

so for amd user, a firmware update usually bought either bug or bless, as for now on am4 bioses agesa 1.2.0.7 is a blessing for all ryzen cpus, could oc ram pretty much better lol (yeah anything lower than zen3 need fast ram for better core to core latency) ðÿ˜‚",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"most modern games are very much multithreaded nowadays, what are you talking about?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""probably.""",or just overclock the e cores too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i disagreeâ€¦i never said anything about productivity programs specifically.,"people often have many background programs such as discord, chrome, rgb software, antivirus, etc running in the background.",this is not a productivity program user specific issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't know anyone who doesn't have multiple programs open   while gaming i fix computers for a side hustle and everyone of them i start up has loads of shit that starts at start up sucking down  tons of ram mean while the  people complain when they game they have problems due to low ram availability and they mostly only have 16 gigs of ram with a low end amd cpu or a  budget friendly intel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, it doesn't.","internet speed depends on various factors, including internet package, location, and router hardware plus the traffic load at any given time.. the cpu will not drastically affect the speed of your internet.",you would have to have a really fast internet connection and a super slow processor.,"even if this was the case, it would be a difference of 10 percent at best.",and i'm over estimating ridiculously.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is a difference between games using more than literally 1 thread and being highly multithreaded.,yea most games nowadays use in the range of 4-8threads.,however games do **not** scale linearly with your thread count.,"most games canâ€™t make use of more than 4-8 threads because as i said, games by their very nature tend to have non-parallelizable elements which limit how many threads are useful.",plus high performance applications ( such as simulation software or games even ) tend to only run on â€œphysical coresâ€ and ignore threads ( i.e.,1 thread per core ) because running multiple threads per core can limit the max achievable core clock on that core ( and therefore fps in a game ).,itâ€™s also why since time immemorial gamers have been turning off hyper threading ( tho nowadays thatâ€™s not usually necessary ),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the guy you replied to was talking about work programs.,i thought that was the discussion.,apologies.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i went from getting about 1.3gbps to 2.3gbps when i upgraded my 5800x to a 13900k on my 2 gig fiber.,this is when my system is not running a game.,the difference likely would have been larger if i was.,if he is running a game then the cpu could very well come into play there as the posters above stating that steam uses a lot of cpu are definitely not wrong.,"i just assumed that steam download servers maxed out around 1.3, but that was not the case.",it was just my cpu holding me back.,"the cpu is not affecting the speed of his internet per se, but it is affecting the speed that steam can unpack the files it is downloading.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
never heard of compression?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
holy shit someone who actually knows what they're talking about.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"while i think its probably accurate to say that games probably have lots of non-parallelizable elements that are hard to span out to threads, i don't think its accurate to say that high performance applications tend to run only on physical cores.","on windows, the commonly used apis for the major programming languages return the number of logical processors and not the physical core count (see system_info.dwnumberofprocessors/hardware_concurrency for c++ or environment.processorcount for c#).","from what i can see, it is very difficult to calculate the number of physical cores on windows, as the way its calculated varies per cpu vendor and cpu kind and windows does not provide a public api for it.","inadvertently i would suspect that most games, apps and libraries (think thread pools) scale their algorithms based on what the number the os provides.","for example, .net's thread pool starts (by default) with as many os threads as there are logical processors.","now i've never written a game, so i could be very off-base for them, but i work on a pretty well-used high performance app, and worked on low level frameworks for some major languages, and all of these are using logical (ie factoring in hyper-threading) and not physical cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no worries.,i took no offense to your statement.,i just wanted to clarify my point.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
compression of what?,compression scheme negotiation?,http compression?,"you purchase a package, it has a rated speed for download and upload and network traffic affects those speeds.",but according to you none of that occurs and its all piggly wiggly and some magic compression.,prove what i said above is false...your internet speed has nothing to do with how a application treats your negotiations to its services.,those are limits set/imposed by a host.,your connection isn't slower the speed at which its allowing you data is capped.,clear differences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
uh no windowâ€™s literally is aware which are physical cores and even which cores are faster and therefore prioritizes putting workload on the faster physical cores first.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i donâ€™t normally post and usually just lurk around reddit sometimes, but you are 100% wrong - u/tyz_twocentz_hwe_ret.",thatâ€™s why you are getting so many downvotes and you continued to go on and on.,steam uses a ton of cpu % when downloading games if the cpu isnâ€™t fast enough to handle the workloads.,my old cpu also gets hammered (1st gen 6 core â€“ 12 thread + x58).,if my old cpu isnâ€™t overclocked high enough my fiber optic speed is cut drastically.,"i first noticed it when my cpu wasnâ€™t overclocked and i attempted to download a 60gb game that usually only took minutes, perhaps less than 8 minutes when overclocked, much longer when stock or not clocked high enough.",my dl speed was trash and i know how long certain games should take to download.,"steam was literally pushing all 6 cores and 12 threads to 100%, a clear cpu bottleneck.",once my cpu was overclocked i was able to download games at the correct speed (900+ mbps consistently) and my cpu was not suffering.,"other factors does matter, but the cpu definitely matters depending on what you are attempting to do when it comes to download\\uploading for certain apps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"while windows itself knows about the speed of cores, and hyper-threading, the algorithms and ultimately the basic building blocks used by applications for scheduling work (for example thread pools) are not aware of them and will scale based on logical threads.","for example, my old team owned parallel.for in .net, one way of scheduling work in c#/.net.","you can see we're indirectly using environment.processorcount by default to scale the number of workers: https://referencesource.microsoft.com/#mscorlib/system/threading/tasks/parallel.cs,1072.",environment.processorcount returns the number of logical processors (ie 8 for a 4 core with hyper-threading enabled).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the 11900k gets a fairly deserved horrible rap for being barely better than the 10900k (10th 1382/15945 r23 vs 11th 1686/16211) - but that bad rap tainted the entire 11th gen series.,the fact that it only existed for 8 months before being replaced and had poor motherboard support also didnâ€™t help.,"below the 11900k, i really donâ€™t think they deserve such a bad rap.","some were decent upgrades over their predecessors (10700k: 1309/12678; 11700k: 1569/15011 which is +20% single and +18% multi), added pcie 4.0 support, dedicated ssd lanes, and were good gamers prior to 12th gen coming out.","but, itâ€™s now two generations old, and there are much better options.","so, for your situation: no, itâ€™s absolutely not worth the money.",use what you have (which is still pretty good) and save up for an entirely new system.,"with a 400 series board you canâ€™t even make use of 11th genâ€™s pcie 4.0 support or dedicated ssd lanes, so thereâ€™s zero worthwhile benefit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11900k heats up a lot since it's really pushing 14nm lithography.,if you have a good cpu cooler then its a 5-10%  upgrade.,unless you are getting a great deal on it don't get it.,much better will be to sell the system and jump to 13th gen even i5 13500 is on par with 11900k!!!,"else wait, for 14th or 15th gen than do a meaningful upgrade.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

simple: you need a better cooler than what you have.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

iâ€™m air cooling my 13700k in a fractal torrent compact case using a bequiet!,dark rock pro 4. only finished building it yesterday so not had much chance to game but initial impressions seem okay.,"on the timespy benchmark, the cpu test got to low 80s.","i played rust for a bit, cpu seemed to be in the 70s.",i could maybe get it lower with further tweaking but iâ€™m leaning more toward silence than coolness.,iâ€™m coming from amd so i need to get my head around how undervolting on intel works.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1. lock cpu power at 253w which is intel suggested stock power limit.,"2. enjoy, with capable dual-tower air cooler you won't touch 100â°c even at maximum load so no temperature throttling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wondering why you didn't get the 13600k for $50 more especially considering you bought a 700 series motherboard instead of 600.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
64gb ram?,return that cpu if you can and at least get a 13600k with that high end board.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13600k is on par with 12900k in benchmarks right now just saying ..it will slap right in that z790,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no way you got a strix z790 mobo with only ddr4 support lol.,what a bad deal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"good upgrade, enjoy!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice mobo but z690 for an i5?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i went from a 4770k to a 12700k i had the 4770k for 10 years and still really didn't need to up grade except for high end games.,i will have this 12700k for another 5 to 10 years and never need to to upgrade.,it is amazing.,4770k only has 4 cores going from that to a 12 core cpu more than enough go get by for a long long time.,i could still upgrade to the 13700k but no need.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's a pretty nice upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is a z690 version of that board for a 12600k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that motherboard is gorgeous,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i did the same with a 12600k about a year ago.,super happy with it.,congrats!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just make sure you stay away from that armory crate from asus.,just a mess of bloatware.,also for a z790 board.,you may want to return that 12 and get a 13600k at least.,the 13600k far outperforms the the 12600kf and still for a amazing price per performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for people saying he wasted money on a z790 over a z690 - youâ€™re right.,"but, the people who say that the 13600k is way more worth it might be wrong as thr 12600k and kf are heavily discounted in some countries right now, like here in canada",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have the same board paired with my 13700k.,"primary use is gaming, so ddr5 did me no good.",enjoy!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"specs: 64gb g skill trident z 3600mhz cl14, asus rog strix rtx 3080 oc 12gb, asus z790-a d4, i5 12600kf",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"itâ€™s way better a z690 with a 13600k than this combo, it makes no senseâ€¦",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
def should return the cpu and get the 13600k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
stupid combo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
should have gotten a 13600k with that mobo tbh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 7700k was fine in my opinion but ok,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ngl lots of weird build choices.,"as long as you enjoy it, though.",that's all that matters.,but what was the thought behind buying an expensive $350 13th gen board that also supports ddr5 and then getting neither?,13600k is like maybe $50 bucks more.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pro tip - when downloading chipset drivers from asus' website be sure to expand the box.,by default it only shows the latest one and doesn't show the intel drivers.,took me an hour to figure that out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great processor!,why cause iâ€™ve got same one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"overpays for motherboard, underpays for cpu.",i did that for about 15 years until i learned to buy better.,z690/13700kf for me!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wtf guys you act like the 13600k is double the performance of 12600k, are you even serious?","if the 12600kf was seriously discounted, it's a better buy than 13600k.",lets not mention the cooling you need for 13600k and the many threads of people complaining aboit getting 80+ degrees in games.,"if you read this and can get a 12600k/f at â‚¬200, just grab it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to those questioning the board and cpu combo, maybe op just wanted a white mobo, and wasnâ€™t really concerned about which chipset and got what was available to them?",or maybe they expect to upgrade 3 years down the road to a 13700k from ebay or something?,"to me the keys are: can op afford it, did they do some research to ensure compatibility, and are they happy with their choices?","if so, then good for them!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice i just got a 12700k and upgraded from a 7700k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and you got an expensive motherboard instead of a better cpu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just retired my 6700k for a 13900k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wouldnâ€™t switch from a k variant to a non k variant.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my 4770k with 1080ti is still running as my second box for games where multiboxing is required.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
trying to sell the i7?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
happy for you mate.,:),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good upgrade but why not 13600k and a z690??,iâ€™m confused,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i donâ€™t understand that parts choice here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
please please please get a 13600k instead you will love it so much more,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah the 13600k is way better tbh, but hey how will intel ever sell out of old stock if everyone was an educated consumers?",lul,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
isn't the 12600k like half the tpd and half the temps of the 13600k?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what gpu did you upgrade to?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same boat here.,was running an i7 4790 on a z97e-itx board until it died a couple days ago.,only upgrade i've done over the years (apart from ssds) was gtx 770 -> rtx 2080. amazing how well those 4 old cores hold up in modern workflows.,can't wait to feel the speed of newer cpus though.,currently debating if i should go for a i5 13500 or ryzen 5 7600(x).,"motherboard prices are horrible, but if i intend to keep my new cpu for nearly as long as that i7, i'm gonna have to go ddr5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that was my thought as well.,couldn't justify the extra cost for something that won't even be leveraged properly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why a z790 board if i can ask?,?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

who cares?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the use of ddr5?,maybe i dunno just guessing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes it does so long as the bios version supports it.,i have an asrock z690 board about to accept a 13600k next week :d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when it works it definitely works according to those that have used it.,but its also a major resource hog and it has been widely known to affect performance in games.,"granted i haven't used armory crate but i have seen many others use it and seen how much resources it takes on their screens, how buggy it is, negative performance with games, it being a absolute nightmare to uninstall.",i do alot of research on these company owned software because i want my new build to be as clean of bloatware as possible.,i seen and spoken to many owners of asus rog products and asus makes amazing hardware but has always suffered in the software department.,and this has been going on since 2018 apparently.,"when there is too many people saying the same thing, when there is too many people actually showing with video and screenshots of how much of a resource hog ac is.",i think ill believe that.,besides even if it does work fine with everything there is many other kinds of software that can handle rgb.,now it's entirely possible that everything can be fine for me but i do not want to even take that chance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah why the hell are you buying z790 board with ddr4 ram?,"i don't understand, most people get the z790 to run a 13th gen and run ddr5 since you can run up to 8000 mhz on it.",yet you choose to run 3600 mhz ram i had back in 2016. honestly go buy yourself a b660 mobo and save the money for future upgrades.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they were both on sale.,the board supports 12th and 13th gen with ddr4.,i didn't have the extra cash to splurge on ddr5 ram.,took the 12600k for now until i can pick up a 13900k that won't cost an arm and a leg.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i also have an 8700k and next month i will pull the trigger on a 13700k and msi tomahawk ddr5.,i also thought about waiting for meteor lake but if you search it seems that ml will be more of a laptop solution if it's released at all.,the next significant upgrade will be lunar lake in late 2024. so no sense in waiting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for you, even am4 would be an upgrade.",so its really more about how much you want to spend.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if your going to be gaming i suggest waiting for amds new x3d cpus coming out.,they could be decently better for gaming then intel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
im in the exact same boat and not sure if waiting is better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 13th gen will be relevant for years to come.,upgraded my i7 10th gen to a i7 13th gen and the difference was major.,depending on your use an i9 could be overkill.,i have a 360mm cosair and it stays around 60celcius and never seen the load over 50 percent gaming,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm also thinking about either upgrading from a 9900kf to an i7-1300k or the upcoming x3d cpus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i just upgraded from a 9900k to 13700k and it was a pretty massive leap in cpu performance.,13th gen is worth it honestly if you want to be set for a while.,"i went with the asus strix z790-e, g.skill ddr5-7200 and ek-aio basic 360.

i ended up undervolting the chip using the load line method and it dropped my power draw significantly from about 260w peak power draw down to 185w at stock clocks.",this also brought my temps & power draw down significantly during gaming which rarely exceeds 75-80w.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

just because you arent throttling while gaming doesn't mean the cooler is sufficient... gaming doesn't really push a cpu like this, which is why your temps aren't that high.","still, what are those gaming temps gonna look like, 80â°c at 20% load?","if your cpu hits a high load for anything longer than a couple of seconds, you'll be throttling.","higher levels of heat has lots of immediate and long term consequences, even if it is below thermal throttling.","not to mention, air coolers will increase case temperature for all your other components.",lots of outlets across the web have tried and failed horribly with air cooling unless some pretty serious power limits are put in place.,"the general concensus is ""don't even try it"", because they were throttling so much... and at that point, why buy a 13900k...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

meteorlake and arrowlake desktop is more like q2.,raptorlake refresh needs more time to be in the market.,i don't see most of meteorlake mobile until ces 2024. i can see 5w and 9w in q3/q4 2023. think broadwell launch.,"core m first late year, and rest coming early the year after that.",zen 5 is probably near arrowlake for timeframe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your amd laptop line is wrong.,it should be zen 4/zen 3+/zen 3/zen 2+/zen 2...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 so 13900k will get a refresh?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tsmc n3e is still set to enter hvm in 2h 2023. launch by early 2024 isn't unrealistic.,"but more importantly, zen 5 is also expected to use tsmc 4nm.",i suspect there are two zen 5 variants- 4nm and 3nm for premium mobile or server variants with higher core counts but lower fmax but better efficiency.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yea then i can't see how any meteorlake will launch this year.,that means they'll have to cut the lifespan of raptorlake mobile.,"and unlike desktop where you can easily upgrade, with mobile ones you can't.",think of a laptop company that just launched 13th gen laptop.,and what like 9 months later they need to get 14th gen?,when you can't even buy 13th gen laptops until sometime like end of february?,you think any company will do that when some are still launching 12th gen devices?,either that or they are launching an entirely new line like the m part.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there's been rumors that lnl might use n3 node for it's compute tile.,which is weird because lunar lake would be a perfect lead product for a new node based on how intel describes it as this small chip designed for <15w tdp.,what's interesting is that in recent presentations intel didn't mention lunar lake and 18a in the same context,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"meh,they don't talk about mtl/i4 in the same context but its clear its using that,i wouldn't trust rumors,especially for a product so far away,guess we'll see in 2y.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"18a is too early for 2024. i am also leaning into the n3 rumor as well, since leakers with good reliability such as raichu said it.",20a makes sense but i don't see that either.,apparently 20a is only for arrowlake mobile.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
some people talked about lunar lake as a pipecleaner product kinda like the first 14nm broadwell parts.,it probably has a 2+8 or 4+8 compute tile which should be tiny on both n3 or 18a.,"and it doesn't have to reach super high frequencies, so it's a perfect candidate for 18a lead product.","would be kinda awkward for intel foundries to be touting 18a as this ""industry leading node"" while simultaneously using tsmc n3 for their newest mobile chip.","this n3 rumor might also be outdated, a lot of products got redefined and ported to different nodes.","arrow lake was entirely n3 as well at some point, so maybe this rumor also originated back then.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's possible but if you look at the original roadmap that references lunar lake, it's ambiguous in that it refers to external before 18a, while in the meteor/arrow reference we see intel 4, then 20a, then external n3.",suggesting lunar lake is 3rd party and either an updated version or a different chip is 18a.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

try lowering your ram to 7000 or 6800 and see if that fixes it.,if it doesnt then your ram is not the issue and you got another problem somewhere,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
clock watchdog is usually a ram error for me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
try running xmp i instead of xmp ii.,it lets the motherboard adjust minor timings instead of using the ones built into the xmp ii profile.,in my experience this has helped with ram instability.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just a warning - the 12th gen non k parts had locked memory voltages which made higher memory speeds harder to hit.,"for example my 12600 wonâ€™t go above 3600mhz on ddr4, some only hit 3200mhz.",i think itâ€™s the same with 13th gen?,"tdp doesnâ€™t really matter - most motherboards, even b660 ones, can unlock the power limit ( just make sure you have the cooling for it).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if youâ€™re not an overclocker the 13700 is a pretty good deal but you definitely want to unlock the power limits.,"and know that it has higher power needs than a 12900, so you are going to want a good b660 or b760 with a strong vrm.","additionally, a b660 is going to need its bios updated for 13th gen support, so if it doesnâ€™t have flashback you will need a 12th gen cpu to do the upgrade or the local shop to do it for you.","edit: r23 scores per cpu monkey:

seems about right for stock.,95c is a bit hot but as long as you donâ€™t reach 100c you will still be fine since cinabench load is very heavy and not representative of real world daily performance unless you do some heavy data processing work or rendering.,if you want more performance without having to increase the power limit of 253w you can set the thermal throttle limit of cpu to 100c instead of the stock 90c and see if that does anything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what kind of cooler do you have installed?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"assuming you have an air cooler based n the temps, go into your bios and set up your power limit according to intel specs, which is 181w max.",most motherboards assume you have a high end cooler and have the power limit uncapped by default.,this will limit your performance slightly but it is working in accordance to intel's specs.,"that, or you can undervolt the cpu, if you have a msi board the easiest way is to lower your cpu lite load to something like mode 9 which is intel's guideline.",or lower depends on what is stable for you.,"if you have motherboard from other brands, look up how to do this.","btw, you forgot to upload your photos.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you were right.,i needed to 'turn down' the cpu and changed a cooler.,but even with 220w tdp cooler it was still able to hit 100\*c... now i undervolted cpu and it's ok.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just a warning - the 12th gen non k parts had locked memory voltages which made higher memory speeds harder to hit.,"for example my 12600 wonâ€™t go above 3600mhz on ddr4, some only hit 3200mhz.",i think itâ€™s the same with 13th gen?,"tdp doesnâ€™t really matter - most motherboards, even b660 ones, can unlock the power limit ( just make sure you have the cooling for it).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if youâ€™re not an overclocker the 13700 is a pretty good deal but you definitely want to unlock the power limits.,"and know that it has higher power needs than a 12900, so you are going to want a good b660 or b760 with a strong vrm.","additionally, a b660 is going to need its bios updated for 13th gen support, so if it doesnâ€™t have flashback you will need a 12th gen cpu to do the upgrade or the local shop to do it for you.","edit: r23 scores per cpu monkey:

"i'm about to upgrade from my 7700k/1070 to a 13700k/4070ti, i didn't want to wait out any more for an upgrade as i've gotten more into sim racing from fps gaming.",next upgrade will be a curved monitor for me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just put my 6700k to rest yesterday.,"it's seen me through high school, college, girlfriend into wife, first pets, first house... not to mention several thousands of hours of gaming.",i salute you old friend.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm shocked how 9700k costs as much as 13700k nowadays lol

i have a i7 11800h which i just bought   its a laptop.. is it good to go few more years?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
need to do this with my fx-6300,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
someone tell mine to retire!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

retiring mine next week too.,"legend of a cpu that i had paired with a legend of a gpu, the 1080 ti.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"funny, i just upgraded the gf's gaming rig to one of these.",from a ryzen 5 1400/580 4gb/8gb to an 8700k/1080 8gb/16gb.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yep, the first upgrade in a long while that felt like an upgrade.",it helped that it overclocked so well too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

imo it was actually amd's ryzen that set the fire ablaze.. the whole thing would've never happened without them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
didn't know pla deteriorates over time.,kind of a bummer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which printer do you use?,i'm thinking on buying one.,any recommendations?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think ltt has the files for their cpu cases somewhere online if you want to use theirs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i5 4670k here ðÿ‘š

the newest cpu intensive game i play is hitman 3 and that works pretty well still!",otherwise lots of indie games.,i've been in no rush to upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i retired my 4460 a few days ago.,farewell soldier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
right?,i'd sell it and make a few bucks back.,lots of gamers would be happy to still rock that.,still a decent cpu.,people get too hung up on the best of the best these days.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm on it with my 1080 ti ordered custom built by scan uk and really wanting to move on buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu the current market sucks and meteor lake is rumoured by raichu to have been cancelled entirely.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same.,have it clocked at 5ghz and its just chewing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"same, but i am eyeing a zen 4 x3d.",it can make a huge difference in some tasks/games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep.,just can't bring myself to upgrade yet.,"this 8700k and 3080 combo is working great, even at 4k for the games i play.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i gave my nephew an i3-8100/rx570 system a while back for his first gaming pc.,when he's ready to try upgrading i'll just give this chip to him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"used cpus hold their value for a while, but then eventually they become worthless used.","8th gen being supported by windows 11 might have saved it from that wrath, but their are some cpus that just aren't worth listing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the bed seems very uneven to start.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's a huge jump in speed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i did similar and went from 4770k to 13700k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sorry you got down voted, it's a valid question.",i'm going to give this one to my nephew when he's ready to install it himself.,for now it's a decoration.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes because its their property and they can do whatever the fuck they want to with it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm still so happy with my 9700k that i'm getting a new case and cooler for it to keep it going for a while as my backup for my drafting job.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™ve got a 8600k and a 3070. often thought about buying a second hand 8700k for some extra power,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5800x on a b550.,very snappy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8700k oced to 5.2 ghz with 2080ti is what i rock,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mine could only do 4.8ghz all core reliably.,after that the voltage i needed felt unsafe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice!,i have that exact cpu in a little mini dell pc that i use for a media center.,no lag decoding of anything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"clock for clock, i think the 3000 series was faster than 8th gen but at lower clock speeds like the 3600, it really didn't feel like it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"try bf2042, sometimes it hits 100%, most of the time it sits around high up in the 90%

just bought me a i7 13700k, and i see a big jump from my 8700k in games.","bf2042 was sometimes a little big laggy but no more, runs smooth as butter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
agreed for most games.,"i mostly play modded mc, rimworld and some dwarf fortress.",they all suffer from tick lag eventually.,the 5800x seems to keep the insanity going longer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i play elden ring almost exclusively this past year.,"with my old 8700k i was never bottlenecked but i was getting quite a bit of stuttering, hitching, etc.",upgraded to 13600k and pooof everything is smooth as butter now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the current cpu you have is more than enough for more than a dozen services running on one server.,it would be best to get a cpu of nearing performance if you have a lotttt of services experiencing performance issues or because of multiple clients.,best to do this with proxmox.,edit: words,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
slowing down the first layer would make sense here.,i commented elsewhere that this was printed on a very warped build plate with some 4 year old pla as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not really.,it will play most things just fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not at all, but the stuff i have here is faster.",5800x in the gaming pc and a 3700x in the server.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i went 5800x.,"at stock speeds, it was the only thing faster than the 8700k when i was doing irresponsible voltage level overclocks.","13th is faster than the zen3 stuff, so it makes sense that would work too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i replaced my 4790k with the 8700k :)   i feel like i had 2 of the best cpus intel ever made.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it should be fine for anything you want to do.,h means it's the high performance model.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14th gen is coming...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
getting ready to retire mine soon as i get a lga 1700 backplate from ekwb.,delidded an oc to 4.9. had a hard time deciding to let it go.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
going 13th gen or zen4?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>the cpu that marked the end of the quad core era for intel.,cries in 6700k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it takes on humidity and extrudes unevenly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you store it in a drybox it shouldn't be a problem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
after my current pla went to shit i will be switching to full petg soon.,harder to recycle but with less wastage i think it should even out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i only bought this thing earlier in the year.,"had an original haswell motherboard with a celeron, which in fact was still fine for surfing the net when on my ssd.",but now i do fortnite.,"the 4790 does okay (100+ fps on average), but i do get frame reductions sometimes bad enough that i am looking to upgrade soon.","this still kicks butt for roblox, though, so my daughter will keep it for that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the only problem with coffee was the lack of ht on the i5s.,8700 had one so all good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on the rest of the system and the games that people are running.,"in most cases, a 12th or 13th gen i3 will run circles around the 8700k.","it was a great chip, but modern games have come a long way with taking advantage of better cpus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well... when i see that an i5 12th gen cpu gets a waay higher waay higher score than the 8700k on some benchmarking sites, i can't help but feel a little envious.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
raichu?,the pokemon?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
havenâ€™t even overclocked mine yet so iâ€™m sure iâ€™ll get even more use out of it when i do!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"even if sold for fairly cheap, as long as someone who needs it gets it, you're reducing e-waste and keeping things lighter on the environment while also getting some money back.","the 8700k is old, but definitely not that old that it can't be sold (and used).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's even worse, mine is warped at this point.",it's a very old printer that needs some fixes.,i use a glass bed now and first layer is much more accurate.,this might have been the last print i did on the aluminum bed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ah, just level it.","it's quite easy, watch a youtube video",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh sorry, thought you were op",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm tired,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it also appears to be underextruding but it's somewhat difficult to determine without seeing it from other angles.,it could also be both.,i'd start by leveling and then printing a first layer calibration square.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it seems okay to me, i was going to get a 13th gen i9 but going to wait another generation i think",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
go 9900k for extra power if you want to stick with the same mobo.,8700k is not much of an upgrade to an 8600k.,you wouldn't notice much.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
exactly!,"for tasks not that much demanding, it holds up pretty well actually.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a friend with 8700 non-k until these days.,i had ryzen 3600 in the past and we had the same gpu card at the time (3060 and after 3070).,"he always had a little more performance than me playing warzone, pubg and other games.","not much, something like 10% and a better 1% low.",but clearly faster.,not to mention that he was using 2666mhz memory (oc) and i was using 3200mhz.,"8700 it's a very impressive cpu, performance is in between ryzen 3600 and ryzen 5600 (non-x).","i think it's the most impressive core i7 made until now, even more impressive than core i7 3770 or 2600.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'll give it a try.,only game that gets close for me is hunt showdown it gets to 90% on a single core but over all nothing above 57% total,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well the way rimworld ticks work is based on the host system.,so if the host has a better cpu then you do by a far measure.,it will always cause you to fall behind in ticks in the later game.,we have the same issue with a friend of mine on an older cpu.,i'm being the host and running 8700k while he is on like 4 gens older i5 cpu.,game runs fine until about 4 hours in then he starts falling behind in ticks and mine remain current.,its all based on who is host and if the people connected have hardware good enough to keep up with the host.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what resolution do you play on and what gpu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4 years old will do it indeed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice !,[gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|heart_eyes),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ohh okayy .. thankss:3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there will always be another generation.,the cycle never ends :/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that might just do it for me, yeah!",this really is a great chip.,"i ran an e8500 for a while, then a 2600k for a *long* time before bumping up to a 7700k, then finally an 8700k, which is where i got stuck it seems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it was a tough choice, but ultimately went for the 7700x because of the upgrade path going forward.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"*cries in 7700k*

seriously, still salty i bought it in early 2017 after amd showed their hand and then intel just decided to release a second series of cpus that same year, this one blowing the last gen away.","still using the thing, and now that i upgraded my gpu, im bottlenecking half the time.","to be fair ive owned it for like 6 years by now, and i couldnt upgrade it until i upgraded my gpu anyway because i wouldnt see many performance differences on the old 1060. 

hoping to go for an i5 13500 next christmas, or whatever the best deal is for the money by then.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
naive question: could you use a hair dryer to rid it of the water before printing?,should be well below the 60 degrees it takes to deform.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i see.,but what about putting it into a cardboard box and all?,so that as little air as possible gets to it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to be fair the 8600k was better than the 7700k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
every game i run on my 8700k + 2080ti at 1440p tops the cpu at 60-70% max.,i've yet to see a game bottleneck on my cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it depends on the number of frames - my 7700k was fine until i was using a 75hz monitor, very few games and scenarios made it a bottleneck.",even cyberpunk maintained 60ish with ray tracing (3080).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah mine's still running strong for all the things i currently play (not much), but i want to try vr flight simulator and i'm starting to feel the itch.",this might be the year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"leaker on twitter, very reliable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"when i first started printing, bed leveling was my bane.",even with a printer that has abl.,damn glass was warped from the start.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ah, ok. what printer?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah.,same here.,will just save up for a whole new system.,the 3070 should last a good while as well.,perfect still for 1440p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good call on the 9900k.,yeah that might be a good shout actually ðÿ˜œ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're right!,i guess it depends what you're happy with.,"i spend my money elsewhere, so i typically hang onto the hardware for a long time.","sitting on 64gb of ddr4 ram right now and a recently acquired 3080 ti, feels like the cpu is the last thing holding me back from another 6-8 happy years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if it works like am4 you should be able to put 3 more gens in there.,not a bad move.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i bought a 6600k around the same time, probably without enough research to know that the 7000 series was coming right around then.",got a good deal on it but dealt with the same issues until i recently upgraded to a 12700k with the microcenter deal.,"can't complain about something that lasts 6 years though, they were good quality cpus, just lacked the cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the worst thing is, if you would have bought that awful ryzen first gen instead, you could have upgraded all the way to the 5800x3d today.","the 7700k was a great cpu, but the timing was so bad.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just retired my 7700k for a 13700k.,going from 4 cores to 16 feels ridiculous.,my only complaint is the heat.,even with a 100mv undervolt it still thermal throttles in cinebench.,79c in full load gaming tho and thatâ€™s good enough for me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can just put it in the oven.,dries out perfectly.,i got a little heated chamber that dries it automatically from amazon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you intend to stand over the filament roll and blast air on it for solid 5 hours... you could.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"theoretically yes, but companies do sell dedicated filament dryers for exactly this, and they're rather cheap",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there's little ovens you can get to remove the humidity, but no biggie.","filament is cheap, you just buy more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i keep mine in a sealed rubber-made style bin with lots of silica gel granules that keep mine suuuuuper dry and ready to go.,"bin has pla,  pla+, petg, and abs rolls in it..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they probably wouldn't work either.,it may be better than just leaving it out in the open but you could seal it in a tupperware container and it would last longer.,most people just buy a food dehydrator or a filament dehydrator box.,several companies make them and they arent very expensive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
jsut because you aren't seeing 100% cpu use does not mean you are not cpu bottlenecked.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"warzone 2 will, unfortunately.",i had to go from a 9700k @ 5ghz all core to a 13700k in order to improve my frametimes.,"bf2042 was *unplayable* without restricting the game to 70 fps, since it was rendering my keyboard unusable with all 8 threads at 100%.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i had a warped z-plate, a warped build plate and the springs had uneven tension.",the frame is also wiggly.,anything that sticks to the bed is a miracle at this point.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
monoprice maker select (not the mini).,i don't believe they make it anymore.,prussia i3 clone with some cheaper parts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yer thats what im on is 1440p aswell, mind i would like 4k next",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's the plan!,getting the zen 5 3d next year should be glorious.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
eh the 7600k never really lasted very long.,by the time bf5 came out like 1.5 years later it was already showing its age.,"i knew with zen coming out that the market would soon change, and i originally waited for zen and wanted to upgrade to a zen processor with 6-8 cores.","but then amd pulled an amd, the performance was very lackluster and underwhelming in gaming, and the cpus punched well under their weight class otherwise.",it was a common problem with amd cpus up until around 2020 or so.,"amd would offer more cores but their cores would be worse, often a generation or several generations behind intel's, and often would do well on synthetic benchmarks, but fall apart in gaming for whatever reason.","having come off of a phenom ii and putting up with crap performance for years as a result, i just went intel.",but i knew thw 7600k wasnt gonna last long so i jumped on the 7700k on a microcenter deal.,it was the best move i had at the time and felt like i bit the bullet on that.,seeing intel come out with coffee lake like half a year later made me salty as hell.,because i couldve waited a little longer and jumped on that.,i prefer jumping on upgrades when getting massive price/performance jumps and i ended up biting the bullet on the last of the quad core generations with the next generation coming out prematurely.,"with gpus, i always seem to luck out and score big.","i bought the 1060, i had a 760 before that, a 5850 before that, just upgraded to a 6650 xt a few weeks ago.",with cpus?,i always seem to buy at the worst times.,"i always miss those ""legendary"" upgrades by less than a year and end up dealing with crap performance relatively speaking as a result.",i bought an athlon xp in 2005 just months before dual cores were a thing.,i bought my phenom ii the year before sandy bridge came out.,and i bought kaby lake before coffee lake came out.,i always seem to get screwed and miss the best processor deals by not much.,only thing that really saved me this time was going for the 7700k but if i had the 8700k i wouldnt be upgrading probably for another couple years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the only difference between 6th and 7th gen intel was a few hundred mhz clock speed increase.,"6600k and 7600k are the same cpu, basically.","i had a 6600k for a long time and it was a decent gaming cpu for its day, but it did not age well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the problem is there was no guarantee of that, ryzen was expensive, twitchy, and the performance in its day was underwhelming.",the 7700k was the safe option.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i'd like something that runs a bit cooler when i upgrade.,"i won't be doing so until the end of this year (so next christmas), but yeah, idk what i'll buy.","candidates right now are 13400, 13500, 13600k, 5800 x3d, or 7600 (am5).","not in the market for an i7, too expensive these days (seriously 13600k costs as much as my 7700k did) and platform costs are insane these days too.","really, depends on what price/performance i can get by then.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
awesome thanks!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can probably rig it to your spool holder haha!,or put it in the oven before.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is the smart thing to do.,i just pull my rolls off and stick them in drawers.,i have like 5 rolls of pla that are 4-5 years old that are probably even worse than this white roll i used.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as i don't have a 3d printer (yet) i had no idea about that all.,i am interested but i don't really have the usecase for one.,thank you for the information.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a little trick i use all the time: 

buy some elmer's disappearing purple adhesive spray, most dollar stores have it, and mix it with some high percentage isopropyl alcohol at a roughly 1:5 ratio of elmers:iso.",i keep it in a little glass jar with a dropper.,mix it real good and put a few dabs on the bed and just wipe it around.,i haven't had any issues since i started doing it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think i've seen it before.,"it definitely shouldn't be printing like that, you should probably buy a new heated bed or sell it and get an ender 5 pro or ender 3 v2",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4k is nice but 1440p @ 120hz is fine for me.,i donâ€™t see the need to go higher on the games i play ðÿ˜œ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

seriously thinking about the ender pro with the grid auto bed level.,"this maker select was warped out of the box, and has always been a challenge to work with.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thats fair enough, i tend to play everything at ultra and still get around 100fps tbf.",4k is mainly for the games coming out i wanna play soon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i have heard of people having warped creality beds too, just be careful.",if you need help you can tell me what your budget is and i could give you advice.,i don't live in the usa but i do know a bit about 3d printing.,"i personally have an ender 5 pro, i got lucky and my unit can only be described as perfect, i've seen resin printers that have worse print quality.","at 0.08mm layer heights it's impossible to even see that the item is 3d printed, you can even go down to 0.04mm but that's overkill.","it's fast, affordable and reliable, it may be basic but i prefer having less features and more reliability.","the first upgrade i did was buying a 0.6mm hardened nozzle, it doesn't impact quality but allows for faster printing and higher layer heights for large prints and vase mode.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah me too.,only cyberpunk and the witcher makes is drop to 60-80,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hey, there.",do you dabble in ray tracing in cyberpunk with your 3070?,"i'm planning on getting the gigabyte gaming oc, and i'd like all the juice for 1440p gaming.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have the same cooler on mine with similar results.,only in benchmarks was it getting that hot.,gaming was in the 60s.,i lowered the core voltage in the bios and cinebench hits 70c now instead of 100c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"same setup here, are you perhaps using an msi motherboard too?","what fixed it for me was changing the bios setting called cpu lite load from the default mode 12 to mode 9. not only did it lower temps to about 76â° in cinebench max load, it also lowered power consumption, and even increased my score to 24k stock!",the p cores stay locked at 5.1 ghz now no sweat.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you manage to solve this?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
might be worthwhile to check if the voltage and wattage are too high.,"ak620 should be okay for a 13600k, especially if you are not pushing it to its very limit (like not doing heavy multithreaded tasks all the time).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1. i reset my mobo bios to default (bios > f6)
2. changed the following under oc / advanced cpu configuration:
- cpu cooler tuning: boxed cooler
- cpu lite mode: mode 2 (default is 9/12)
- enhanced turbo: disabled

note: dropping the cpu lite load can cause instability (crashing, bsod) so if you experience this turn it back up +1 and retry until you no longer crash.","i did not test this personally, but i didn't see a massive performance loss overall.",maybe around ~20 fps in mw2; i still typically get 160+ on a 144hz monitor so that loss isn't big for me.,you can see the performance tests for various cpu lite modes at 3:20 on this video: https://youtu.be/-mkavitzoly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for this thread just upgraded was getting higher temps almost bought a nzxt 53x but saw this adjusted power level and works great!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
okay cool just making sure it was mounted well.,did a 1 big dot and 4 small dot and was slowly screwing each other screw every couple turns.,"yeah gaming brought me up to 75-80fps in cyberpunk rt 4k when my 3700x was making me be at 45-50 in demanding areas :)

how much did you lower the core voltage?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i've seen the 13700k actually perform cooler than a 13600k.,i have till january to return it.,i was thinking a artic liquid cooler ii 420mm my case is 7000d so it can fit it.,"wonder if i should just go that route

i regret not getting that frame but i just wanted to make sure all my components were working before i moved forwards",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah in msi bios there's a setting called cpu lite mode or something along those lines

it was on auto which is level 12... moved it to level 9 or 10 i think and temps are now mid 90s under full load cinebench 5.1ghz the whole time no throttling

it's basically like a leveled approach to undervolting or making less power draw available to the cpu.",but it doesn't matter as i'm not making it clock higher than 5.1ghz (stock) so having the extra power and heat isn't what i want,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i lowered it to 1.10v,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"none, in fact i gain some as i'm no longer overheating",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"huh, i turned it down to 9 as well and i think the temps dropped by a few degrees, but it still ran out enough to throttle down to 4.5ghz.",maybe it's because i just reapplied the thermal paste?,"still, i thought with the ak620 it would be cooling the cpu without a hitch.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i fitted this yesterday and noticed an immediate drop in temps by about 8-10c when stress testing.,this cost me â£8 but you can get it cheaper if you are happy to wait for it to come from ali express.,certainly a lot better value that der bauerâ€™s thermal grizzly.,i highly recommend watching gamers nexusâ€™ video on this for guidance on how to fit.,[gamers nexus](https://youtu.be/iyu1oskby-q),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is the best cpu retention bracket design imo.,"btw, none of these contact frames actually have any ""contact"" with the ihs once the cpu cooler coldplate clamp is installed.",there is a \~0.4mm gap between the contact frame and ihs once the cpu is driven to full seating depth by the coldplate clamp.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have one sitting on my desk that i'm about to play with.,glad to hear you also saw some good temp drops.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is it as simple as just mounting it and watching ur temps go down?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i bought this thermalright frame the same time i bought my 12700k so i have no previous results to compare it too.,i kinda wish i waited and got mine later to see the difference.,just doing the instillation itself though you can clearly see how much of an improvement it is over the stock retention bracket.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why do we even need this?,can't we just put cpu inside the socket and directly put the heatsink?,what's the point of ilm?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13700k here.,didnâ€™t bother with stock ilm as i read it bends the socket over time and gamersnexus showed the awful contact.,i run it with a noctua nh-d15 (2 fans on cooler) and idle around 30c and while gaming never really go above 60-65c in fractal compact with fans around 650-750rpm.,i donâ€™t know if this helps at all.,figured iâ€™d share my temps though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

don't stress it.,i've reinstalled mine 3 times now because of some upgrades and what not.,it's not as hard or surgical as people make it out to be.,just drop all 4 screws in and spin them in the opposite direction until you hear the threads set.,then just give each one a quarter or half turn alternating between them obviously until they're snug.,never had any boot or memory issues.,totally worth it.,those no post or memory issues you're seeing are mostly from people over tightening the thing.,that's the worst case scenario and to fix that all you have to do is just loosen up the screws a bit and it fixes the issues.,just make sure they're snug that's all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very carefully.,"i used the technique shown in the video i linked, where you wind back until you get a very noticeable drop.","then do 1/4 turns until you feel slight resistance, then small adjustments until you feel hard resistance, then stop.","no post issues, i did have to boot in to bios as it thought there was a new processor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yep.,highly recommended.,there is a thermal grizzly one designed by der bauer which is higher quality but â£35.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think that might explain the memory boot failures with some of the frames.,my cheukchi frame does not compress the leaf springs enough to press the cpu to full seating depth.,"using a 0.6n-m torque driver on the coldplate clamp definitely seated the cpu pcb deeper into the socket, although i'm not sure if it bottomed out or not.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

fair point.,they could improve the current ilm so that it doesnâ€™t just push down on two small parts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

8700k was the first chip that people started delidding and derbauer made a delid tool.,mine reached tjmaxx at stock speed and was refunded by intel because i wasn't going to risk a delid.,they used toothpaste instead of solder for the first time or some such.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's just people being lazy, not checking their work and giving the screws a once over.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

do you think i should use the stock ilm to prove the cpu is fine before i replace it with the contact frame?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no the solder wasn't faulty.,they didn't have solder.,they had some god knows how cheap thermal paste that was the equivalent of toothpaste.,mine hit 95c in under a minute at stock.,"intel support asked me run loads of tests and then offered a refund as they didn't have any replacement chips, so i bought a 9700k after.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah, probably gonna be using quad channel, is there a significant difference between 2133 vs 2400mhz ram in quad channel since the v4 supports it but v3 doesn't, and which would be the better option 1650v4 or v3, also btw these cpu are from prebuilts so they are locked down.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"as was previously stated by bas5eb you only really get one chance at a first impression, and if you start poorly you poison the well of public opinion which makes it less appealing to cover from the perspective of a tech reviewer as fewer and fewer people are interested in the product (and thus less likely to click on videos for it).",it's also not their jobs to directly market these cards to consumers it's to review them (and almost universally just the state they launch in).,"to be clear i'd love for intel to be a serious competitor in the market (hopefully their next release is solid out the gate), but this mess is all on them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thank you.,still very new to builds.,bought a prebuilt 4-5 months ago and have researched everything i can since then but cpus seem to be the most confusing part.,"im not rich, but i am patient (sometimes lol), but my main concern is just overheating, that's all.","it's all fun to learn/do, and it seems all i need is a contact frame, a good aio, and the cpu, so thats not too much money.",my worry is just that ill screw up with my limited knowledge/experience and fry the thing or just constantly find whatever other errors come with it getting too hot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

id just get a thermal right contact frame.,their cheap but effective and its idiot proof.,while the thermal grizzly is more expensive but you can also screw up badly.,i use the thermal right frame.,also you dont really need to undervolt or anything else.,just make sure xmp is on and let the cpu do its thing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"as crazy as this sounds, your temps are too low now.",you have undervolted the cpu to the point that it is now throttling quite a bit of performance.,your cb r23 score is within 5 percent of my 13700k.,"a stock 13900k runs at almost 40,000 in cb.",you'd probably be better off setting a temp target of 90-95c instead of 77c unless you just want to run your cpu gimped.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

honestly very little of my normal activity requires that much power.,have very few cpu intensive games and encoding is the rarity.,"fps remains consistent, thermals are under control, and honestly, still probly repaste with kyronaut for posterity sake(using stock corsair paste from the h150i).",hard to see the benefit provided by the extra heat.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for example, world of warcraft barely utilizes cpu maintains 100-200fps.",overwatch 2 350-400 fps.,"havenâ€™t tested something like fallen order yet, but it caps fps at 144 so donâ€™t expect much change there",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all at 1080p fyi.,itâ€™s very much an overkill build.,"but give me room for more later if i want, custom loops, etc.","unless thereâ€™s a visibility performance gain outside a bench score, iâ€™m pretty happy with the thermals.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it will be interesting to see meteor lake and emerald rapids this year.,they had so many delays in the past :(,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so if meteor lake is confirmed for this year, does that means that the raptor lake refresh is not coming?",maybe both could coexist if only the lower cost skus use raptor lake.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is the desktop meteor lake launching or just mobile?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hopefully a real launch and not what they did with arc.,arc launching in 1 laptop only available in south korea on the last day of the quarter was a bit much.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
only care about h class laptop chips.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel products get delayed?,what a surprise!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hehe, fell for 14th gen releasing in 2024 and upgraded to 13th gen last year.",i guess iâ€™m waiting for 15th-16th gen then,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i wonder if they will be able to compete with genoa, 96 cores is no joke.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"meteor lake for notebooks, raptor lake refresh for desktops.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"says they wouldn't confirm, but picture shows a mobile part which is suggestive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
neither of these announcements are officially a delay.,"mtl was always slated for 2023 officially by intel

lunar lake was marked 2024+, so clarifying that it is 2024 rather than 2024+ as in 2025 is a good sign if anything.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there's no delay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's only 14th gen mobile that's releasing this year.,desktop chips will be raptor lake refresh.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, indications are still that itâ€™s only mobile meteor lake parts for 2023, and desktop is going to be raptor lake refresh.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
emerald rapids has no chance.,i assume they'll try to cut the lifespan of emr but we'll see.,granite rapids is the first chance at a turnaround.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i don't think they can compete, they still have node disadvantage and for servers chiplets are more cheaper to manufacture.",when intel will be on their 3nm/18a in 2024 then they can be competitive again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ah that makes sense, kinda like the situation with tiger and rocket lake.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it could also make sense that we get a refresh of the 13900 and meteor lake for everything else as lot of users are concerned by the number of p-cores.,"at least, i hope that.",i would prefer to get a 14700 instead of a 13900 refreshed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so iâ€™m in happy with my alder lake cpu i should wait tell this happens to max out my z690?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh really?,"i got the idea that itâ€™s desktop ones, anyway weâ€™ll see",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
like indications that meteor lake was canceled?,where did you see that intel won't launch a desktop version of meteor lake in 2023?,i have a 11900k.,"this was a cpu that was disruptive considering the 10th gen but, at the same time it was the last cpu in 14nm.",alder lake has been launched few months after.,for now i have only seen rumors.,"rumors of meteor lake canceled, rumors of raptor lake refresh, rumors of roadmap that would confirm rumors...  
  
is there, anywhere, one intel announcement of this raptor lake refresh?",this is not a rhetoric question.,i really would like to see something official.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
won't amd be on 3nm by that time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you want to pop the best cpu you can into your z690, wait until this fall to see what raptor lake refresh brings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nothingâ€™s ever official until itâ€™s officially announced like a month before release.,"leaked roadmap slides show no signs of meteor lake for desktop in 2023, and instead indicate a â€œraptor lake refreshâ€ for the end of the yearâ€¦ which kind of confirms even older rumors.",what little official stuff intel has out on meteor lake for 2023 is suspiciously vague and only visually depicts a mobile cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they would be at around equivalent nodes at that point.,"spr vs genoa - intel 7 vs tsmc 5nm

2023 emr vs genoa - intel 7 vs tsmc 5nm 

2024 gnr vs turin - intel 3 vs tsmc 4nm or 3nm 

2025 diamond rapids vs amd zen turin or venice?","intel 3 or intel 20a vs tsmc 4nm/3nm/ maybe 2nm at the end of the year if venice... 

but the difference between each foundries packaging and chiplet technologies would also become more important as time goes on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"nice, there will be war with at the server side lol.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel themselves state that the maximum resolution over hdmi is 4k @ 60hz.,dp is needed for higher.,"the fact that it works on linux is because the linux driver is using reduced chroma subsampling (4:2:0 instead of 4:4:4) to lower the required bandwidth, which the windows driver does not seem to support.","i donâ€™t know if it can be forced, but that can be what you look for next.","intelâ€™s hdmi implementation is only hdmi 2.0, not hdmi 2.1, meaning it supports a maximum of 18gbps bandwidth.","if we do the math:

3840x2160 @ 60hz 8-bit 4:4:4 = 17.82gbps
3840x2160 @ 120hz 8-bit 4:4:4 = 32.08gbps
3840x2160 @ 120hz 8-bit 4:2:0 = 17.82gbps

so without reduced chroma subsampling, 120hz is impossible.",one workaround if you really must have 120hz without buying a gpu is to buy a dp to hdmi 2.1 adapter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you ever fix this?,"having the exact same issue, same cpu.",it was working perfectly for a while and now everything cpu intensive crashes with 0xc0000005.,"edit: i think /u/rulik006 was right, thanks dude.",i disabled turbo boost and prime95 works just fine.,gonna rma this cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hi just wanted to know if someone else has the same issue.,"after 2 months of pc working fine and some windows updates i started having some issues like usb ports not working anymore and some bsod, so i decided to reinstall windows so when i try to install the os i got error 0xc0000005 or 0x8007025d, after google it and reading that those are drivers or storage issues i tried with the other's ssd but getting the same issue, also tried to install windows 10 and got same issue, i tried the following:

- updating bios
- clear cmos
- remove 1 stick of ram (individually)
- switching ram sticks
- no oc at all
- remove all ssd and test to install one by one (no success)
- test ssd using crystaldisk, all good

after all this, i installed windows using another computer with hyper v, it was able to boot but when i tried to install audio, gpu, drivers and any other program i started getting the same error on window event logger so last thing i tried was switching the cpu, bought an i7 13700k and it works flawlessly no errors at all so no idea whats wrong with the i9 13900k should i get rma?","msi meg ace z690

the parts of your pc work together.,"the cpu being, given its name, in the centre of everything.",a bottleneck means a slower component can hold back a faster one.,e.g.,a very fast gpu cannot always be fully utilised with an old cpu present.,the cpu cannot deliver new data fast enough to the gpu.,"reality is a bit more complex, of course.",you always have some sort of bottlenecking happening.,"to avoid massive bottlenecks and disappointments, you should have a clear understanding of what you want to achieve and then figure out how to achieve this within your budget.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why would covid era's pcs need to be upgraded?,"i am still on a 4790k, and yeah it is very old now, it can still run plenty of games, i cant imagine a covid era pc (which is only like 3 years ago) would need to be upgraded at all?",?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"the performance, price, and wafer footprint of the e-cores help give intel healthy margins against the higher performing amd chips with more cache and all large chips.",today still most consumer software will not fully saturate 16 threads of full size cores let alone fully saturate the smaller e cores.,so most high performing gaming applications still benefit greatly from single core boosted performance.,that is to say that most of our cores in our cpus today is wasted just idling away.,better to idle smaller e cores than larger full cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

youâ€™re being dramatic.,my 6700k way back in 2015 set me back $360.,i picked up a 13700k last year for only $390 shortly after launch.,$30 in 7 years is nothing.,the i9 6900k was $1100 at launch and now i9s can be had for under $600.,mid range cpus have stayed mostly the same price while high end cpus have dropped significantly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i thought the actual eps were below estimated eps.,looks like i'll have to go check those numbers again.,still those gross margins are a big yikes compared to years past.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that's not exactly sound reasoning because you could say the same thing about any company that's not on the verge of bankruptcy and that's a pretty low bar.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
havenâ€™t had a 6700k since 2016 but the e-cores in the newer cpus are fine for their intended use.,the average person has no need for ecc and would be better off getting a higher-end z790 board than sacrificing performance and money on something irrelevant.,iâ€™m usually running my 13700k with e-cores disabled and p-cores at 6ghz so e-core are just a nice to have.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

also the 12400f is a very good budget cpu for gaming and will never bottleneck a 3060. however for production works also it isn't bad at all but it's worth spending on a 12600 and above since you will be earning from the work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have the same problem but with the i9 13900k.,brand new system.,i'm cooling it with the noctua nh-u12a.,after getting base temperature of 60 to 65 degree i thought we made a mistake when assembling the cooler ans redone everything but the thermal past was perfectly applied.,"but the strange thing is, that the cpu has a lot of usage.for example when i was working in unity my old ryzen7 2700x had a usage of about 12% with a heat of 40 degrees.when doing now the same tasks the i9 13900k i'm at 20% usage and at 80 degrees.how is this even possible?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that's normal.,it is bottlenecked by the tim - commercial silicone grease.,it normally has a low thermal conductivity of less than 12 w/mâ·k.,"so if someone tell you their 13700k/13900k can maintain <95c for 30min in aida64 fpu test or r23 multicore test using whatever aio cooler (assuming rt=20c), you can simply fk them off, because it is scientifically nonsense (just fkin conduct a simple simulation in solidwork will reveal it so clearly...)

one way to reduce the heat generation of the cpu is to reduce its power.","to do this, you can **reduce the voltage** of your cpu, so that p = uã—i can be reduced.","(so called ""undervolt"", but actually the wrong term used by so many kids, who needs to learn some <fundamentals of analog integrated circuit design> to understand why though)

my bet it is the bloody aoi.,"air bubbles, some dust or dirt or an issue with the pump motor being stuck.",the fans will spin up because they are controlled by the cpu temp.,your temps should be + 3-4 â°c above ambient in idle.,i've just run a cinebenchr23 on my i5-10400 custom 240 radiator (2 fans @500 rpm) with the d5pump @ 1300 rpm.,"idle 27, load 50 and 1 minute after back to 28 â°c.",so you have something for orientation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

side note: some of the older desktop chips (like pre-skylake) had an -s suffix that was essentially what the -t skus are nowadays.","at least that's how it appears on paper, anyway.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no 4-digit desktop cpus?,"4/5 figits is not just marketing, it relates to generation.","no modern 4-digit ones, but there are, for instance i5-8400, which is a desktop cpu.","the last three digits are related to the exact model (400 is a low end i5, 600 is a high end i5, 700 is a regular i7, etc.).",the rest will be generation number.,on a cpu with a single digit generation (eg.,"8th generation), you only need a single digit to represent the generation, so the whole thing becomes only 4 digits.","for 10th through 13th generation, you of course need two digits, so the first two of what is now a 5 didgit number is insead used, hence a i5-13600, which is a high end, 13th generation i5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"just to add a point, the cpus with a higher rated power draw can often mean better cooling in a laptop, as they can significantly exceed the 'power rating'.","&#x200b;

for example the i5-1240p and the i5-12500h, i think both of them are 4+8 cores.","if you find both cpus in similar laptops, chances are the h model will be much more performant, as the 'rating' seems to mean 'the laptop needs to be able to cool this amount of heat', and obviously laptop makers want to cut corners, so higher rating basically means more cooling.","&#x200b;

the different letters in the same generation won't magically make a cpu more efficient, but there seem to be slight differences that make idle/ low load usage more efficient on 'low power' models.","just beware of core count differences, like the i5-u/i7-u are almost the same yet probably brings a big price increase.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the 7700 and 13600k are basically the same in gaming.,i'd say that just get which ever is cheaper.,"plus am5 is ""upgrade proof"" compared to lga1700 which won't be used after intel 13th gen.  so if you find a decent board for the 7700 you can just drop a new cpu in the future.",am5 motherboards are more expensive so there are multiple pro's and cons to each.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
am5 and ddr5 are both more expensive.,iâ€™m also positive op has ddr4 already from his old build.,as long as there is a platform that supports ddr4 it will be the winner by default for people that are looking to upgrade as they will already have it and donâ€™t need to buy ram.,"the only exception is if price isnâ€™t a factor and they what the absolute best, in which case the upcoming amd 3d cpus are the clear choice.",otherwise intel wins for now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
base frequency is how fast intel thinks the cpu will run if you use all the cores on a typical workload while throttling down to the 35w tdp of the t-series processors.,"the 12700t has more cores, which use more power, so to stay under 35w it has to throttle harder.",are you actually planning to run a sustained all core workload while also throttling the cpu down to 35w (why ...)?,"if not, you can ignore the base clock.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
first: why are you looking at t cpus?,those are designed for systems with extremely limited thermal headroom.,"assuming you know why you want a t cpu, then the next point is that the base speed is essentially an estimate by intel of how fast the cores will run when under an all-core intensive load while maintaining the pl1 power limit of 35w.",it has no other practical bearing on the cpu.,it does not sit there at that speed or something.,it ranges constantly core-by-core from like 400mhz up to maximum turbo.,"so, stick a t cpu in a big desktop case and remove the completely optional power limits, and itâ€™ll maintain the fastest turbo speed indefinitely, assuming your cooling keeps up.","or, take a normal not-t cpu and apply the same arbitrary power limits, and itâ€™ll behave just like a t.

typically t cpus are used by oems in sff systems, and likely you will not be able to customize or remove the power limits.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"precisely, these are micro form factors (mff), so there's a need in this case.","all that being said, does the load actually distribute such that two equally benchmarked systems, one with 6 x 2.00 ghz cpu's and another with 8 x 1.40 ghz (p-core at least).","so yeah, different cores will do different things at any given time slice, but presumably with all else being equal, what cpu produces more here..the 12 combined ghz version of the 11.2 combined ghz version..i don't know how the cpu chooses to use e vs. p cores so i haven't factored that into the latter number.","and cache sizes, bus widths etc.","all come into play, but that's where engineers get lost in the weeks on this kinds of discussions and folks like me are trying to find answers for real world usage more so i'd say.","i guess the way i'm trying to say it is, the faster a computer is, the longer it can stay relevant to performing tasks without delay.","some i3 and an identical machine with an i5 today, might launch word 2019 just as quickly.","but maybe in 5 years, the i3 takes longer to do the same task as these things always go with computers.","so then extending that to the two cpu models mentioned above, i wonder when one or the other will start to show that lag.","for daily business use cases,, this isn't really a question for gamers (and i suppose if a t model i5 is your gaming cpu..solitaire must be a blast :) )",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is some very thorough info.,also calls into question my sanity because that's some serious thinking one has to do just to wind up with a well-selected solution.,i guess i'm off to read up on cpu's again.,:),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"while a higher-core count cpu at the same power level will generally get better performance per watt than a lower model, at a certain low wattage level thereâ€™s diminishing returns, and i donâ€™t think itâ€™s really going to significantly impact the useful life of the system, certainly not in the terms of years.","for example, i canâ€™t imagine a scenario where a 13900t (with base clocks of 1.1ghz p-cores and 0.8ghz e-cores) is somehow going to feel so much better or be worth the extra cost when actually run at 35w compared to, say, a 13600t.",unless you legitimately have a need for 24 low-speed concurrent processes (which certainly would be a thing for servers).,"do remember that like xeons, more cores at lower power/frequency means you can get more done at once, but nothing individually gets done fast.",thatâ€™s why xeons were crappy gaming systems but killed for parallel processing systems.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"12700k, at least you can upgrade it later in case you will need that without changing mobo and ram.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i see.,so i'm better off getting an i7 13700 non k?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"k means that the cpu is unlocked, not that power consumption is higher.","the non-k processors are a mix of current gen raptor lake and rebadged 12th gen parts that just launched, so they're not as widely available yet.","unless you can find the non-k a lot cheaper, you probably want to get the k part even if you aren't overclocking, especially if the alternative is a last-gen rebadge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"seems like the non-k versions are more for the oem market, so they're fewer and farther between on the diy market, but if you look thoroughly, you'll find some.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a) you can use a k version instead a none k version.,b) nuc or regular pcs without a gpu.,i guess intel simple produce more k than none k versions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they've been releasing the high end enthusiast lines to market first.,that means k processors and z series chipsets.,lower end options follow later.,nvidia and amd do the same.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you want the k cpu!,if you buy a non k cpu it uses last gens alder lake p-cores.,that alone is worth the extra cost and the ability to overclock is icing on the cake.,don't listen to the people telling you to not get the k cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can easily configure its power consumption to whatever you want.,13900k with 65w - easy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13600k can hit its max turbo clock speeds at 135 watt power draw.,both single & multicore..   it can go to 5.1ghz.,that's crazy.,that's a great efficiency without over clocking.,you can configure down your power requirement.,its unnecessary to overclock unless you really need that last drop of power.,there is so much misinformation about power draw.,don't overclock unless you need it.,"although intel cpus are good for overclocking, its an expensive hobby.","ref: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnfgswztvyc",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you're in the us, then it's mostly newegg with 13th gen non-k availability.","amazon has been a bit slow on picking up with it, i see a couple now though at a slightly higher price than newegg.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok everyone.,i get it.,i got a k and plan to run i5 at 65 tdp.,it's meant to run proxmox and truenas.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for the k version cpus, even the base tdp is higher however, so they must consume more electricity?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"unfortunately, intel tries to lock some features like undervolting with bios updates: https://www.reddit.com/r/intel/comments/10dcjd9/intel_blocks_undervolting_on_alder_and_raptor_lake/

there's a post here that says that undervolting has been disabled,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my 13900ks hits 6ghz at 130w got it turned down at the moment because i only have a 92mm cooler on it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you can control it's power consumption, the k just gives you extra headroom if you want it.",it's worth it for the negligent price difference,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the tdp values are recommendations for how you choose to throttle the cpu, not actual power consumption.","the boxed coolers with the non-k suck, so intel recommends throttling down to 65w.",you can set either cpu to throttle at 65w though (or 95w or never).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ignore the lower number.,"thatâ€™s just an arbitrary number picked by intel, and you can set it to whatever you like.",look instead to the higher number for an idea of what the cpu would potentially use under 100% load.,"for example:

- 13600: 154w / 13600k: 181w
- 13700: 219w / 13700k: 253w

the k models are clocked higher so they use more power, but you can set these to whatever limits you want.",want the cpu to use no more than 35 watts?,done.,"performance will suck, but you can do it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you just drop the cpu into the motherboard and use the default/stock settings, then the k version will consume more power than the non-k version.","however, you can go in and reconfigure the limit.",so you can limit the k cpu to use the same amount of power as the non-k cpu's.,"this will also result in non-k levels of performance, which in actuality isn't much of a performance hit as you've probably noticed.","in some ways, you can think of the ""k"" chips as already factory overclocked, but you can always go in and undo the overclock.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
undervolt and pl1/pl2 aren't the same things.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

get a realtek 8125 pcie card.,they are dirt cheap.,next time choose a motherboard with this chip.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"while they are unquestionably still problematic even in the latest revision, they generally do work most of the time.","i know exactly what triggers the i225v in my z690 board to stop working, and how to get it going again.",so what exactly is going on with yours?,has it ever worked or does it literally just not even show up or something?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

sad to hear this is still going on.,i went through this mess on the amd side last fall.,ended up with a board with onboard rtl8125 which has worked flawlessly to date.,"i suppose if i was buying again or higher end board, i'd have to seriously consider the other features included.","if the rest are good, then i may just install a pcie nic.",i have no less than 3 or 4 intel i21x quad port (intel i340).,can stick that into the chipset pcie slot (it's an x4 card).,"i really like the strix line of asus boards - x570-e. key features include lots of usb gen 2 ports, 8 satas, usb 3 gen 1 front header and usb c gen 2 front headers.","looking at the intel counterpart, the io does not appear to be there.","sure there are lots of ports, esp on the back, but at least 4 of them are usb 3 gen1.. on the amd side they're all at least gen 2.  on the amd there's 2 ethernet ports, i211 and rtl8125.",intel board has the wretched i255v.,so it appears there is no direct intel board with similar features.,ymmv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looks like the intel i226-v also has lots of issues... going to stay clear of intel nics and stick to realtek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"this

yours sounds faulty though so i would rma the motherboard

it consistently says there is no cable attached when i have tried multiple working cables.,"i've worked with at least 4 different drivers, updated the nvm firmware, fiddled with the speed and duplex just for no difference at all.",i'm assuming the nic port came non functional since there are no fixes that have worked so far.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i've done all of that but it never worked.,i'd have to rma the board to fix it.,i ended buying a usbc to ethernet adapter and it works great with it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would advise that for sure.,sucks having to take up a usb port for an ethernet adapter just because of the faulty mobo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"havenâ€™t had that specific one myself, but iâ€™ve definitely read about it.","in my case, i get â€œdevice cannot start code 10â€ when it seems, to me, that the device has completely locked up and is non responsive (activity leds indicate network activity but no active link)â€¦ until power is physically removed from the pc (rebooting does nothing).","as for the problem youâ€™re facing, what iâ€™ve read is it may be a compatibility/standards issue with the network port at the other end of the cable (your router, or switch), and some folks have had success adding an intermediary device in-between.","like, adding a completely different switch in the middle that it might actually be able to communicate with.","anyhow, the i225v is a buggy mess that i canâ€™t believe hasnâ€™t been fixed or simply abandoned and replaced years ago - and instead intel keeps forcing a subpar product onto manufacturers and end users.","when itâ€™s working, i find it great - fantastic, stable speeds - but when it suddenly stops and i have to crawl under my desk to switch off the power supply, i hate the thing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you can get a 12600k (basically the 13400), an asus tuf z690 mainboard and 32 gb of ddr5/6000/cl36 ram for $450...  or super size to a 12700k for $500.",this would compare against a 7700x + 32 gb of ddr5/6000/cl36 ram and a gigabyte or asus b650 board for $550.,there are no intel 13th gen promos at mc so you'd spend around $50-100 more for a 13600k rig to compare against a 7700x setup... and in that case the 7700x setup is the better buy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7600 is a far superior cpu.,iâ€™d also consider the 13600k if the price is reasonable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the real answer is to get the 13600k with ddr4 for 100 dollars more.,it is a better cpu than the 7600/x whether on ddr4 or 5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"personally i would go with the 7600 cause of am5 upgrade path that is of course if you upgrade your cpu every year or two like me

although more cpu-demanding games will see a large benefit, but unless you plan on upgrading your gpu later down the road, probably isn't worth the extra money.","most of their results ended up being completely gpu-bound (most results ended up basically identical), but there were a few outliers, notably watch dogs: legion (7600 ~13.5% faster than 5600 / 20.4% faster than 13100), assetto corsa competizione (7600 ~34.6% faster than 5600, ~41% faster than 13100), and cs:go (7600 ~25.7% faster than 5600, ~47% faster than 13100).","13400 should perform very similarly/*slightly* better than the 5600 besides games that are more cache sensitive (5600 would do better in this case) or games that are more single-thread sensitive (13400 would do a bit better in this case), but overall expect similar results to the 5600 in the the video i linked from hardware unboxed.","if you want to eventually upgrade to a better gpu and possibly a better cpu, you're probably better off going with amd.","another thing i should mention is you likely won't reach 3600mhz ram on the 13400, assuming it has locked vccsa like the 12400 did.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if youâ€™re an overclocker get yourself a non-k bclk enabled mobo and oc the crap out of that 12400-12500 (not 13400).,so it all comes down to do you want a pc just to use or youâ€™re feeling like tuning it and stuff.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
as much as i love my 12600k i would say for that little price difference i would say amd 7600. should be more future proof and am5 should have at least 3 years left of new chips.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if that's the choice then definitely the 7600: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77xdpmwh8s0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
amd.,if nothing else am5 will be supported much longer and next upgrade you can just swap the cpu and keep everything vs a full platform upgrade on intel and double the ram dir just $130 more.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why do you still want to game in 1080p?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

plus upgradable socket later too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because you can get 144 fps in the latest aaa games max settings/rt without needing a 4090?,1080p is still the most popular resolution for good reason,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a fairly decent benq monitor that i can't compel myself to retire.,what monitor would you recommend for a 6650/6700?,thank you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you dont need a 4090 for ultra on 1440. picture is much much better.,"i understand if people still using old hardware but building a new pc to game on 1080p....there is no good reason anymore to go for 1080p, its outdated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what type of games do you play?,if you donâ€™t care for ppi and arent a competitive gamer than dont even worry about it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i dont know the benchmarks of this card.,im using a 8700k and changed from 1080 to 6900xt + 3440x1400 144hz monitor.,day and night difference.,i love high fps too and want ultra everything.,with most aaa titles its no problem in ultra.,a lot aaa title are well optimized.,"yes some you get 80-90. but i think everything over 75 is pretty ok.
whats your budget?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pretty much all competitive games are 1080p high refresh rate.,even at 1440p you canâ€™t run a game like cyberpunk at 144 fps ultra settings rt even with dlss even on a 4080. you can easily at 1080p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well most of us play games for fun and arenâ€™t that worried about spending more just for having more pixels.,games are still basically just high tech toys.,1080p ultra with high refresh rate is possible without breaking the bank.,resolution isnâ€™t all that important to some people.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most competitive games are easy to handle these days.,what competitive games do you want to play and whats your grafics card?,cyberpunk on 80.fps in 1440p is much more enjoyable in my opinion than 144fps in 1080p.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
high fps already possible with higher resolution theses days without breaking the bank.,wouldn't recomend buying 60hz monitors 2023 either,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m not talking about myself as i play at 1440p on a 3070 personally.,iâ€™m just saying why others prefer 1080p.,almost all esports tournaments are all 1080p and there are gamers that legitimately refuse to play below 120 fps.,a friend of mine is like that.,he plays 1080p with a 3080ti to max out his 144hz monitor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"in competitive titles with low settings, 1080 vs 1440 doesn't make a huge difference performance wise.",i think it really just comes down to what you want to spend (or already have) for a screen.,"for op:
if you're going below a 6800xt for gpu and you need 144 fps +, i can understand going 1080p.",but you should probably go with an amd videocard and a 13600k: amd performs better at 1080p per $ (driver overhead); 13600k overclocks easily - you need more (usually single threaded) cpu in competitive games at high refresh rates.,intel outperforms amd stock -- especially when you look at 1% lows (more important than avg).,see gn graphs.,it all comes down to $.,but for competitive shooters in your price bracket ddr4 is the way to go.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

go by price difference and your budget.,rarely does one regret buying too much cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just save some money and get 12600k.,you will never feel any differences in games between those cpus even with 4070ti.,it will be like for example 130fps vs 140fps average at best.,"also do note that for 13600k you will need a much better cooling, just check in this sub how many people are complaining of high temps with raptor lake (80+ degrees in gaming and 100 in cinebench).",12600k is a great cpu and anyone who tells you to spend extra for it is just watching those benchmarks comparing these cpus with rtx 4090 at 1080p medium settings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

just undervolt without changing the speed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"undervolting doesnt decrease performance if done correctly, so no difference on battery or not.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
undervolting doesn't reduce performance.,in some cases it increases performance instead.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can also lower the maximum boost on battery to improve efficiency,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it does, but its a matter of what you want.",more efficiency will often have less performance as you will drop the speed to decrease volts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thats not undervolting.,thats power limitting.,"undervolting is lowering voltages while maintaining same clock speeds, therefore, you dont loose performance.",lowering voltages lower than required for your cpu max speeds is power limitting.,two different things.,"my 13600k used 190w by default on cinebench multicore test, and got 24k points.","i undervolted it, so it uses 170w, while scoring same 24k points.","then, i put a power limit of 160w, making cpu use even less power, but loosing a bit of performance, it was like 23500 points on cinebench.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
clearly you do not know the art of overclocking.,"overclocking is not just increasing the speed, undervolt is also an overclock.","when undervolting you are pushing more than the set voltage can do at stock, it doesnt need to be the top speed.","while power limiting is when you still stand in the stock speeds just with limited power, you are not exceeding what manufacturer has set.","&#x200b;

this is probably unknown to a lot of people in pc subs, overclocking is just as it sound going above set limits.",when max volt is 1.1v and speed in increased from 2 ghz to 2.1 ghz its an overclock and so is 0.9 volt max speed jump from 1.8ghz to 1.9 ghz.,"undervolt to 100w will be more powerful than a power limit to 100w, since its actually oc vs stock",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"clearly i know more than you, because you are talking in circles and havent said anything that would make anything i said incorrect.","undervolt is not an overclock, even by intel or motherboard oem definitions.","only k series cpus from intel unlocked for overclock, yet you can undervolt any cpus, not only k series.",so your definitions are wrong.,"undervolt is not overclock, its 2 different things, and intel, gigabyte, msi, etc think the same.","undervolt is increasing efficiency, nothing to do with overclock, which increases performance, not efficiency.","power limitting is limitting power so your cpu no longer performs as it would on stock settings, resulting in less performance, less power use, less heat.","you are talking nonsense, no one even mentioned clock speeds or overclocks, no idea why are you bringing that in.",intel cpus have standart clock multiplier and you wont change it simply by undervolting.,"i have no idea what are you trying to say with your examples, but everyone knows that, its not any secret knowledge.","undervolt is simply lowering voltage for the same clocks, thus, increasing efficiency, by using less power, but getting same performance.",not less.,that is undervolt.,"if you undervolt too much, you dont loose performance.",your cpu becomes not stable and crash.,"if you have undervolt protection turned on in bios, it wont crash, but you will loose performance, as something called clock stretching will happen when cpu doesnt get enough voltage to boost anymore.",this is no longer correct undervolt.,"so i repeat again, main point, which i said, and you didnt agree.",you dont loose performance with correctly done undervolt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you clearly dont know, nor understood what i said.","to start of intel is not locked from overclocks, its locked from increasing the clock above its maximum boost.",z boards can somewhat by pass it and on older motherboards undervolt was not even an option.,what can you do with the cpu depends a lot on the motherboard it self.,overclocks are meant for power not efficiency?,"perhaps, but what happens when you overclock with the stock power limits?",it gets 20% boost lets say and uses 100w (its max tdp) and somehow the one with 20% less power using 98w is more efficient?,not how it works.,"&#x200b;

i will repeat, overclock is when you go faster then what tha manufacturer has set.","so in case of undervolt stock is 0.9v 1.8 ghz if you were to lock it to that you would be simple power limiting, but if you choose to do 0.9v with 1.85 ghz thats an undervolt.","oc and undervolt  are eesentially the same thing, just when going below stock volts we call it undervolt and same/above overclock.",overclock example stock 1.1v 2ghz and speed is increase to 1.1 2.05ghz (funny how it is still same volt but more power.,sound familiar doesnt  it?)...,now i ask in what way are they different?,"sure the volts are different speeds are too, but are you going to claim that it is not the same thing just because the volts and speed differ?","no, you wont.","note, in both scenarios here you increase efficiency with power.","i used this in quite a few topics and everyone agreed that it was true, that undervolt is a type of overclock, yet you do not (its fine to object but you dont know both methods even go).",and more to that you confuse power limit with undervolt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thank you, you said it yourself.","intel non k processors are locked from increasing multiplyer or bus clock, which intel calls overclocking.","undervolt, you can do with any board, h610, b660, b760, z690.",when was undervolting not available on some boards?,20 years ago?,"it was always available, apart from plundergate.","so its not the same thing, because one is increasing performance, another is increasing efficiency, with possibility to increase performance.","you seem to be intent on arguing on sematics, and how things are called.","i really dont care man, undervolt and overclock are 2 different things.","my main point, which you still havent proven otherwise, you dont loose performance with correctly done undervolt.","thats a fact, thats what i said, and thats what you argued about.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10 year of cpus like 3570 cannot control the multi at all if its not a zboard.,and were not talking what intel refers to.,ok let me put it this way.,"if stock is 1.1v and you increase above its voltage speed its an overclock, but if you do it on 0.9v above its rated speed its suddenly not an overclock?",logic?,"well whatever, keep not knowing what undervolt truly is.",i tried all i can.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what does multi has to do with anything here?,we are talking about undervolting.,"you can undervolt 3570 just fine, by adjusting voltages, which is not locked on bios.",and  you are talking nonsense again with your examples.,here is your example in normal world: 13600k runs 5.1ghz on p core on default.,"if you undervolt it, it will run same 5.1ghz, but on less energy.",thats undervolt.,"just because it uses less voltage on lesser clockrate, like 4.9ghz, its still undervolt, because its not exceeding its stock clockspeeds.","no matter what undervolt you do, its not gonna go above 5.1ghz, because thats stock multiplyer.","when you actually increase multiplyer, or bus ratio, and it goes over 5.1ghz, thats overclock.","i know perfectly well what undervolt is, you seem to be in your own little world denying what is obvious to everyone.","even the world itself overclock, pretty much explains itself.",its going over the stock clock speed of cpu.,"jeez, its trully hilarious.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"again, what you can and cannot do will depend on the motherboard.","some can, some cannot mine could not.",the claim of undervolt not going above stock speed is not accurate.,"cpus who alter the speed by temperture with undervolt will go above stock speeds, because the algorythm says so.you do realize you cannot maintain the same multi with lower voltage.",all cpus have a voltage/frequency scale that tells if voltage is that the speed should be that (if cpu speed changes with temp it will be a bit different).,"i mentioned this with gpu in mind, since it literally shows points on voltage/frequency (same with cpu).","heres an example for you, auto settings are stock settings, if you decrease the voltage the speed will also be decreased unless you manually change it to its normal speeds that only should exist in higher voltages.",so if auto (that follows stock) setting tells you that lower voltage should run at lower speed and you force it up its not an overclock?,ok,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that cpu probably wouldn't even bottleneck a 4090. so it really comes down to how much you want to spend.,at 1440p i would be looking somewhere between a 3060ti to 3080. you can also look at the intel arc a770 le because your 10 series processor supports rebar.,would just need to update your motherboard bios.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
