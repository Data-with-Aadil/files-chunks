the main thing is that lpddr is soddered to the motherboard.,good signal integrity is easier to achieve so higher clocks are possible.,not quite sure how it can have lower power though.,maybe lpddr has different ram timings?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"last i checked being soldered to the board makes the power requirements lower, but don't quote me on that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i thought safe power consumption is 80% of breaker size and households voltage varies of 110-120 volts so more like 1300-1400 watts but iâ€™m no electrician,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah you're limited to 80% average current.,"you can get both 15 or 20 amp plugs in the usa though, so either 1440w or 1920w depending on which plug.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that much could be doable with e-cores.,"but without them you can get fairly close to the p-cores, which is the ""real"" limit for the ring.","depends on what you stress test with (as some apps are heavily dependent on cache and will be unstable at lower clocks), but even my 12700k does 4.8 ring while doing 5.1 on the p-cores.","those settings are only stable in-game and on the lesser demanding stress tests, but they do show that the (still somewhat practical) limit for the ring can be much higher without e-cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

am i?,no.,"i have 12700k and i look objectively, 15% difference isn't ""close"" (18% actually, when you consider 40k being the actual stock result), a close score is single digit, usually at around 5%, the extra cost may be for some unjustifiable and you're also at some very hefty overclock which require more expensive cooler, that add up to the total cost.","&#x200b;

"right now, i still use windows 10 with a 13700k, i had originally bought the cpu so i had an excuse to upgrade to windows 11 and take advantage of the e-cores properly, but it seems like windows 10 can handle them pretty well, i can even set a hotkey in the bios to toggle the e-cores on or off and just use p-cores if needed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
win 10 can differentiate between high power and lower power cores.,any task in focus will always be assigned to p-cores.,other tasks will be assigned to e-cores if all p-cores are busy.,"process priority will override the above, any task set at 'high' will always be assigned to p-cores, any task set below 'normal' will always be e-cores.",tasks set at normal priority usually run on p-cores if available.,"this behavior is good enough for most users, when you game it will be using p-cores first unless the priority is set below normal for whatever reason.","windows 11's thread director goes a bit further, supposedly it can analyse the workload type and assign the appropriate core while keeping power usage to the minimum.",this would be better for laptop users as the thread director will not use p-cores if e-cores are judged sufficient for the task.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just dont understand why people refuse to go to windows 11. it is literally just windows 10 with more optimizations and a reskin.,"you have an alder lake cpu, which will be more optimized for windows 11. i personally havent had any issues with w\indows 11 except for right at the beginning but they fixed it already.",also you get better fps in windows 11 (not much but can be 5% more in some cases),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

windows 10 performs better on my hardware.",it has fewer processes in task manager and runs faster due to not having transparency on every window and menu.,edit: i am being downvoted for stating facts lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
simple reason - taskbar restrictions on multi-monitor systems.,try having 4 screens and  all you want is the taskbar dragged to a secondary panel and put on the left hand side.,it's a total deal breaker for me and until that is possible i will sadly never use windows 11 on my main rig despite really wanting to make the move.,"it needs to be dragged away from the primary panel because that's the screen that games default to, and some games it's a pain in the ass to change screen number.","i don't want a taskbar on all screens, it's such a simple requirement that windows 10 does perfectly annd windows 11 utterly fails at.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe i just don't like the new skin.,"but also because they removed some basic features, like drag and drop wasn't working for a long time, and hovering over open items on the task bar no longer shows previews of the open window.","there are lots of small quality of life things that have been inexplicably removed or disabled on windows 11. i might just see if i can hold out until windows 12, or at least wait until they bring back some basic qol features.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

9900ks is probably going to be valuable for a very long time given it's last pure monolithic design (everything on one chip) and technically the fastest once you consider how high it can boost and how bad rocket lake's power consumption is.,everything else is technically a hybrid design now.,the 9900ks gives the max performance + max compatibility with older apps/games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i said *for gaming*, which implies you'd be using 200 watts or less.","6ghz all cores could draw over 400 watts in cinebench, but stay under 200 for gaming.","i'm not sure how good your chip is, since you don't have an asus board.",you could try just setting your cpu to 5.8ghz and see what vcore your motherboard assigns you.,set the power limit to 250 watts so you don't overheat.,play games and monitor temperatures.,"if the game crashes, raise vcore if temperatures are acceptable.","if no crash, then aim for a higher clock or lower voltages if you're happy with performance.","if you're overclocking for gaming, you should not be touching something like cinebench.",your stability test and your temperature test should be the games you play.,and here's an example of a gamer using a 6ghz all core 13900k.,"he's playing nfs unbound, which is one of the most cpu demanding games around.",power draw never goes above 200w.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pys1yduhmby,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

rightâ€¦ but what you said is still wrong.,a stable overclock isnâ€™t a chip teetering on the edge of crashing under a 30-50 percent load.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh, it's perfectly stable.",you would just get throttled instantly if you ran cinebench.,an overclock for gaming assumes that no more than 60% of the cpu will be used at any given time.,"most games average 10-30% usage, so a high vcore is perfectly acceptable.","in other words, you are maximizing your overlcock for a light, multi-threaded load (gaming) rather than an extreme load (synthetic benchmarks).","if you are only going to be gaming, then it makes sense to get the fastest cpu speed for that workload.",another way to do this is to use thermal velocity boost.,allow the cpu to clock to 6ghz if it's under 80 degrees.,that would cover almost all gaming scenarios.,"over 80 degrees, change the ratio and voltage offset to something your cooler could handle.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"highest you would probably want to go is the i7-10700 or i7-11700 non k, to keep the cpu tdp at 65 watts.",also make sure you have good air flow over the vrms since the board does t have any heat sinks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's hard to say exactly what's happening without knowing exactly what the game is doing with the cpu, how many cores, threads its using, what frequencies etc.",the chip is designed to max out thermals and if you're reaching 100c on 1 or 2 cores... its probably a cooler issue because 2 cores shouldn't generate so much heat that it stays localized to those cores.,the heat should spread... unless there is poor cooler contact or lack of thermal paste in the area.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

my temps were 60ish playing games and spiking to 80-91 on a few cores.,i read that it can be uneven mounting screwing it in vertical so i lay the case down removed and reseated my cooler (h150i elite lcd) temps are now 40s with a max of 67 in game so it seemed to have worked for me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah, one single 12vhpwr connector haha",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

having one cable instead of 2/3?,you could also easily send 300w+ on current 8-pin without any issue and without any long term hastened material/connectors fatigue.,8-pin standard is oppresively underestimated with the 125w limit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

would be nice to see arc also compete with nvidia with regards to ai.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so they do focus on efficiency.,the issue is the press obsesses over stupid benchmarks and will use words to dramatize the slight differences and include bait titles.,so because of that we live in a world where all the companies will increase power by 50-100w for a 5% increase in performance.,but we know to undervolt for a more balanced and quiet experience.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

performance-wise -> yes.,but is obvious to expect it to sell at a discount since they are not as well as established and have proper drivers as nvidia does.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sure xd.,some fries with it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but what's the point when your top end gpu trades blows with other low power cards?,"6600xt also have only one 8pin, consumes less than 100w in games, yet it outperforms arc 770 in most cases.","if you hate high end gpus, then don't buy them.",and btw.,"my 6800 runs on one power connector as well, it just never goes above 200w, not even when stress testing.","having 80+ psu is a standard, but more connectors are added just in case someone is using 10yo psu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"old thread but tagging on, except for limited sales intel arc in canada is *still* $50-100 cheaper than the rtx 3060 and rx 6700, and the rx6650xt see looted deals to price parity, so if you value the added features of arc over rdna2, it can be seen as a better value.",at this moment in time youâ€™re paying for consistency by going nvidia/amd over intel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, for no reason, the standard is extremely conservative due to being extremely obsolete as it origins from times, where having a psu outputting 50% of its nominal power was considered having a great power supply.",you can do a shunt mod to double the effective power draw and it will not create any long term issue at all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes and no.,daisy-chaining off of 1 8-pin connector can induce instability when on the bleeding edge of clocks/voltage.,"seen really well in all the issues with the 5700/5700xt launch, where using two 8 pins from *seperate* cables was more stable than using a daisy-changed cable when using an average power supply.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no apparently the bios has no es microcode so won't run any v2 processors.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"damn you're right, i thought it was still sandy bridge.",which is interesting because apparently the bios doesn't have v2 microcode yet there was someone that reported running the 4960x on this machine.,now i'm wondering if that was bs or if the bios does include v2 microcode.,hmmmm.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i did just find a list of apparently tested processors.,would any of these be better than the i7-4960?,it's mostly a gaming/photo editing pc.,"xeon e5-1607, e5-1620, e5-1650, e5-2643, e5-2640, e5-2667, e5-2650, e5-2660, e5-2665, e5-2670, e5-2637, e5-4610, e5-4620",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

looking up aurora r4 on luserbenchmark looks like the best cpu you can use is the e5-2690 3.3ghz on all 8 cores i believe.,"however, the 4960x while only being a 6 core is clocked high enough that it nearly matches the e5 in multicore, and almost certainly beats it in gaming.",plus you might be able to overclock it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
went from 9900k to 13900k with 3080 at 1440p.,no regrets.,something people always forget to mention when they say no on posts like this is older games.,i gained like 40fps at least in fallout 4 in cpu bound scenarios.,"even when you donâ€™t use more than one core these newer cpus have much better single core performance that still definitely makes it worth it, especially for older titles that donâ€™t use the 3080 as much and only use a single thread",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i play a lot of cities skylines and flight simulator.,both very cpu bound.,the upgrade from 9900k to 13900k was monumental in these games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nope.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no don't do it.,of course if you want to upgrade to the new stuff and eventually get a new gpu that's fine.,i think you will get better 1% lows and a few extra fps but that's about it.,9900k + 3080 is a great pairing.,enjoy it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you stay on a 9900k platform you won't have access to pcie 4.0 storage and your rtx 3080 will operate at pcie 3.0 bandwidth despite the fact it is a pcie 4.0 card.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you can afford it and it wont hurt the budget... sure, go for it...

thank you so much for sharing your experience.,could i ask why you chose the 13700k vs 13600k?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no difference on that front,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would just buy whats the best buy now and not worry about what you can upgrade into.,people usually keep their cpus for like 4 years or so and by then people would be on am6.,though waiting for the 7800x3d might not be bad since the performance on that should be pretty nice.,buy probably not as cost efficient as the 13th gen offerings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 13900k makes less sense for gaming only workloads and not worth the premium for gaming focused builds unless the user so wish.,performance is basically identical in gaming between the two chips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

for me personally iâ€™m excited by raptor lake - but 14th gen is extremely interesting because of all of the new technologies under hood.,"- multiple chips from different manufacturers/process nodes
- intel 4 - brand new process 
- seems to be a new core (vs minor refresh)

so the engineering is interesting for sure.",what comes after seems even more spectacular â€” but thatâ€™s another thread.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

protip: buy tok (not tick).,motherboard firmware is generally more mature after the first gen of an architectural change.,i would go with 13th gen (instead of 14) because of the many bios fixes established by that point and the stability is greater.,"to each their own, however.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

14th gen core according to leaks) will not bring major architectural changes to big cores (little cores will be new) like 12th gen. however, because of intel 4 process it will be much more efficient - *intel 4 (i4) promises a 21.5% improvement in frequency at the same power as the previous-gen i7 process, or 40% less power.",* i hope intel goes after 7ghz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whatâ€™s wrong with e-cores?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
efficiency gains will be used for performance rather than to reduce power limits.,"this was the approach with 12th gen which is actually very efficient even compared to zen 3, you will find the idle to medium load power draw is quite low compared to other cpus.","but, rather than reduce peak power usage you increase the performance/boost speeds.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is exactly what i'm doing.,"meteor lake will be a new node, new compute architecture, and disaggregated 'chiplets'.","raptor lake will be last and best of the monolithic dies and on a mature platform, with new pcie 5 and ddr5.",i expect it will be a very good platform for a very long time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
truth be told intel was right to rename their nodes.,it is not helpful if the node numbers aren't remotely comparable in performance.,intel 7nm is now marketed as intel 4. compared to tsmc that makes much more sense as what used to be named intel 7nm significantly outperforms tsmc 7nm and is in fact much closer to where tsmc 4nm would be (though it might lag that node slightly).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7nm and 10nm are marketing terms though that are rather meaningless and don't relate to anything objective in the process.,"the reason intel has started using the terms 'intel 7' and 'intel 4' is these make a more apple to apples comparisons to nodes from tsmc, samsung etc in terms of density and power consumption.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
talking about 10nm or 7nm just creates extra confusion.,the nodes are called intel 7 and intel 4. they compete against tsmcâ€™s n7 and n5 node families.,none of it has anything to do with nanometers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

12 is both a tick and a tock in the same generation.,"13th gen will count as neither, as it is same arch and process node.",hence the tick and tock is no longer being followed.,"yet 13th gen still has significant optimisations that will see a big performance boost, even though it's neither a tick or a tock.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,the performance increase from 10th-11th gen was basically nonexistent but 12th gen alder lake brought a huge upgrade.,13th gen raptor lake will just be a refined alder lake and would therefore be considered a â€œtokâ€,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"imo, tick-tock as a concept for intel process-architecture ended when 14 and 10nm generations had issues continuing that cycle.","there was briefly a third optimization cycle giving a [process-architecture-optimization](https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/intel/process-architecture-optimization) concept, which played out as broadwell as the first 14nm process, skylake as the architecture improvement, and kaby-coffee-whiskey-comet lakes all optimizations of 14nm while 10nm had issues.","cannon lake was supposed to be first process step of adaption skylake microarch to 10nm, still had problems, and icelake was architecture step where process started catching up as well.",tiger lake is optimization of icelake.,"now, i consider this end of p-a-o mindset in response to all difficulty and endless 14nm.","rocketlake fits here with tiger lake as gears shift and hybrid core enters alder lake(12th) and raptor lake (13th), which is kinda like an optimization or formerly a tock step, improving alder.",meteorlake (14th) is summarized best as disaggregated architecture.,"it's 4 different designs/silicon nodes together, it's both an arch and process step in that sense.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
correct.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's a completely different approach to chiplets.,amd is all about reusing and maximizing yield.,intel's approach instead focuses on making specialized products by mixing & matching different chiplets like lego building blocks.,also intel believes that product development cycles will be shorter with this tiled approach.,i guess this also makes dealing with process yield issues easier.,like if their 20a is terrible they can port it to tsmc or back port it to older node and still get the product out with a less severe delay.,"they don't have to go through the whole process again, only that exact component needs to be ported, and they don't have to touch the rest of the chip",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's not just a matter of refinement - that's i think more applicable to 14mm which they refined to the moon.,"what i'm talking about here really is the reported transistor density, which is arguably kind of in line with how the original nm nomenclature was used by all foundries - as a measure of physical dimensions.",the problem is that there was no consensus on what physical feature should be measured and it's kind of hard to reach a consensus because different designs may be equally small overall but differ in their subdimensions due to architectural differences.,that's why transistor density per square mm2 is now considered among the best easily understood objective markers that determine how advanced a node really is.,"with tsmc currently leading the market and with their 7nm and 5nm factual transistor densities given, it was a sensible move by intel to rename.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel 10 was always about the same density as tsmc n7.,tsmc itself has said the numbers no longer mean anything other than general improvement.,"this all started long ago, but became a runaway train wreck when tsmc/samsung named their 20nm nodes ""14/16nm"" when they added finfet to them.","when intel went from 22nm to 14nm that was both a node shrink and adding finfet, so intel 14nm was actually a half node (35%) more dense than tsmc/samsung 14/16nm nodes.","tsmc didn't actually have a node more dense than intel 14nm until they hit 10nm, which was essentially a half-node shrink vs intel's 14nm.",intel 4 is expected to be significantly more dense than tsmc n4 and land in between tsmc n3 and n4.,"see article below :

""to that end, we estimate intel 4 at 123.4 mtr/mmâ², 2.04x from 60.5 mtr/mmâ² in intel 7. our data for tsmc n5 is very much incomplete but our rough estimates based on known pitches put their hp library at 94.85 mtr/mmâ².","based on most of the recent publically available foundry data, intel 4 hp cells appear denser than tsmc n5 hp and are likely closer to or better than tsmc n3 hp cells and denser than samsungâ€™s 3gae.

there is a reason why e-cores are 4 times smaller than p-cores.,it's quite obvious that some (serious) tradeoffs has to be done to make it possible.,the beauty of not having e-cores was that you just don't care which process runs on which core.,they are all same.,now they are not same.,there is a serious problem for os to define what process should run on which core.,if you think a bout it a bit you will understand that this task is much harder than it looks.,"when i first heard something like ""p for foreground, e for background"" - that's when i got extremely alerted and started to think about this.","and quickly realized that salesman are operating with some ""generic usecase example"" where important processes are those that are running in foreground.",this is true for narrow spectre of use cases.,"the number of people in such usecases may be huge, but it's still the small portion of all possible scenarious for something that is called ""universal computing machine"".","now, the problem that i personally have is that i use computer for work / computation / stuff.","i will end up letting os to assign my custom soft and vms running in background to e-cores, while my browser or some light game will sit on p-core because it is on foreground and i'm just messing around waiting for computation results.","at the end of the day, my main work will take longer to complete, because e-cores are far from p-cores single thread performance.",it's like jumping on few families old cpu.,"magic will not happen, and 100500 e-cores will not make my 4-thread process to finish as fast as on p-cores.","avoiding even more specific things, that's pretty much it... as an example: i have 8 core cpu.",i can run 2 4-threaded computations in parallel.,if i buy 16p cpu - i can run 4 computations in parallel.,"if i buy 8p 666e cpu - i can run 2 computations fast and 2 computations slow, because i have only 4 computations to do, and extra e does not make any difference.",so for me 16p will be much better than 8p 999e.,what i am trying to say is that if you make a step away from marketing examples into other usecases that were totally ok on all-p cpus to the extent that nobody even realized it's beauty - you get many headaches with these e's.,and again - i just can not take it why they did not make all-p model?,"pack 16 p's on the die, put the price, and sell it.","why, oh why they take away this option in such crucial thing as cpus, where you only have 2 manufacturers and will end up in big trouble if both of them decide for a bad move!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i had a similar issue of my msi motherboard lite load setting causing voltages to hit 1.5v, reducing this took me down to 1.25v too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you're correct, they don't need that much voltage.","but if another motherboard manufacturer provides ll values that cause the exact same chip to droop to 1.25v with 1.375v vid, what would intel do in that situation?","fuse the voltage to what it's actually capable of (1.25v) and have it crash on the other board, or make sure it doesn't crash on any board and deal with all the comments about how hot it runs?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

likely your cpu will bottleneck like crazy.,as usual get 4090  if it will bottleneck... well if you can afford buying 4090  chances are you can afford modernise rest of the pc.,if you can't   then its unwise to get 4090 in first place.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's fine.,i'm running a 4090 on 8700k and it's holding up beautifully,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
should be fine going up to 4k120.,anything above 120 (roughly) would be cpu limited.,"so unless you need to game at those extreme refresh rates, i wouldnt worry about it

edit: also donâ€™t forget, regardless of cpu bottleneck, you can push through the bottleneck with dlss frame generation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what kind of fps do you get on aaa games?,*i have a i7 8700k and want to test it with the rtx 4090 i gonna buy - before i decide to upgrade the cpu - so what fps can i expect?,*,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"8700k would be fine for higher resolution, my 3700x is a massive bottleneck on my 3080 with 1440p/240hz, 5600x with a 3080 gets much better performance and a 5600x gets wreck in gaming by a 5800x3d.","higher refresh rates which the 4090 will be able to achieve even at higher resolutions means you want a top end cpu, what is the point of spending $1600 on a gpu to run it on some outdated hardware that lacks completely against newer hardware?",nothing wrong with a 8700k but it's dated now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"well, no.","the point is being able to run everything you throw at it, and being as future proof as one can be for gaming.",i game on a 4k 120hz tv.,it's perfect for that and i'm confident it will see me over the next few years....8700k included,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and here i am feeling dumb that i didn't even notice that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
40 fps isn't playable in an fps (for me).,the issue is getting more than 60 in busy areas.,that's a cpu bottleneck your can't fix with dlss (except dlss3 i suppose but that's a whole other thing).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tbh not a mistake that would warrant that dude's reaction.,not everyone is buying a gpu every year/under 4 years.,most of my friends are still rocking 980ti and 1080s.,rtx nomenclature is still new to them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you aren't listening to me.,that's all the 4090 can do on that game period.,all benchmarks online show this.,i was pointing it out to show my cpu is not bottlenecking that game because of its age.,it's performing exactly how it is on reviewer rigs using much newer cpus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i will reiterate i own the card.,"it's not cpu bottle necking, and dlss 2 does improve the framerate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i swear people talk about bottlenecking so much but they have no clue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's great to hear ill have mine setup tomorrow and let you know what fps i get in native 4k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hey.,what are you seeing fps wise with dlss on 4k?,thanks.,with 8700k/4090,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'll check later.,"i didn't turn it on, i was just playing it on native as i was actually finding 40-45 very playable with g-sync lol.",i actually didn't test dlss in any game i played because it plays all native 4k above 60 no issue (minus cyberpunk of course.,ha) i'll let you know later once i try it out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maxes out about 70. that's when the cpu bottleneck kicks in.,"i haven't overclocked mine btw so you could prob push more our of it, but cyberpunk is a cpu intensive game.",i'm getting 120-200 on other games.,lol.,so yeah won't get much higher in this game on an 8700k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not all your cores of your cpu are identical.,"due to small manufacturing defects, each of the cores use a sightly different voltage, get sightly more or less hot, and can achieve sightly higher or lower frequencies.","modern cpus report to windows the ""quality"" of each core, and windows prioritizes the best core.","your p-core number 5 is the best core of your cpu, so windows schedules the more demanding tasks in that core to gain a little bit of performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
windows can dedicate other cores to be a main workhorse for singlethreaded tasks and can even change each boot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this happen to me because of cpus are not always exactly flat

what does ihs flatness have to do with core utilisation?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nothing.,flatness would be more of an issue with per core temp/package temp.,0 to do with core utilization.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ask windows not me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but this is not even remotely related.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's good suggestion for new intel cpu like 12900,13900 families so why not helping others maybe it's the cause.",all can agree contact frame is important so why you are not giving good suggestions if you have many share it please.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes this is, but ops problem is a single core utilization, not temps :d",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think your confused.,ihs flatness or temperature has nothing to do with core prioritization.,only 2 of the best cores can get max boost frequency.,others cannot.,unless overclocked,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
literally no difference unless you overclock the ram.,"you may as well go for cheapest z790 available if you don't oc ram or get the best bang for the bank, that is z790-a or -p pro from msi, which are both great value and very good motherboards overall.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there is also the gigabyte aorus z790 master that's smilair, but does the gygabyte perform on the same level as msi and asus?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have the msi mpg z790 carbon wifi and 13900k.,i like it a lot.,i've worked with the strix a little bit.,it's nice but i'm impressed with the msi z790 carbon and happily own it.,it's my first msi board too.,i usually buy asus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"out of msi, asus and gigabyte for the mobo id pick gigabyte 9 times out of 10",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'd pick asus, then msi, last gigabyte

confirm your ram is in qvl before buying, though",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™d go with the carbon.,better power delivery and matching aesthetics with your 4090z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for the feedback!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have the master z790, works well with 13900k.",you canâ€™t really go wrong with any of the ones you listed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you overclocking the ram?,if not theres no difference.,if yes then neither gigabyte or asrock can compare to msi and asus boards.,oh you want 2x32 gb 6400 ram do you?,"no way that will work on a gigatrash board, stick to a high end asus or msi for that, and tbh asus are having a lot of problems with ddr5 beyond 2x16, so yea narrow it down to the msi carbon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

remember when you could get a 7800x with 4 channel memory and almost double the pcie lanes for less than the present cost of 13700k (or maybe slightly more correcting for the inflation)?,would be nice to see hedt back as a comprehensive product line spanning everything from midrange to ultra highend parts.,"hopefully those 8, 10 and 12 core w5 parts with quad channel memory are priced like with skylake-x.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

wrong.,sapphire rapids-ws is hedt and isn't intended for servers at all.,"they're for desktops, overclockable, have high out of the box clock speeds, and don't have server features.",sapphire rapids-sp (aka xeon scalable) is server and has already launched.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

to be honest i donâ€™t know.,both my asuâ€™s motherboards had the original shipping bios so i assume they had the original me firmware.,seeming i like to swap and play my various cpus in and out to tinker with it when i swapped in the 13900k i just updated them with my 12th gen cpus.,so would the 13th gen performed worst without the update or is it an asus thing i canâ€™t really say as i donâ€™t think you can roll back either beyond a certain me firmware version.,so if you are having no issues then leave it and enjoy your setup.,i treat all bios like nvidia drivers if it is working fine and doesnâ€™t offer me anything like nvidia drivers for games i will never ever play then i will leave it as is.,try running cinebench 23 and see what it scores if it is way off what a 13600k scores then you might need to update as it can yield extra performance.,if it is slightly under then forget about it.,as far as i know the me firmware deficit usually rear itâ€™s ugly head during a cb23 run as that generates a load which is far beyond the normal games player or video editor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

turns out designing high performance cpus is fairly expensive so very few companies want to do that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel and amd both hold licenses for different cpu things and only share with each other, cuz well - they need both",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because (correct me if im wrong) intel has the patent for x86 based cpus and amd for something else and they share them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most of the other competitors left the market.,"via, via centaur, almost re-entered the market a few years ago with haswell level cpus- but intel bought their cpu development teams from via.","this was probably to stop via from continuing to help the other maker of x86 cpus advance - zhaoxin, a chinese cpu company which currently makes chips roughly equivalent to fx cpus in performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what others have said is accurate.,the real fundamental reason is that it's very expensive to design cpus.,"so, it's very hard to startup a company to compete with the likes of intel or amd.",arm is starting to compete in the server space (nvidia has recently developed their own cpus!).,overall if nvidia enters the space (which might happen in the long future on the desktop side -- they already make arm server cpus) there will be plenty of competition.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

actually your observation is myopic and why intel is in deep trouble.,for pcs running windows like 80+% of the worlds pc run on on x86.,apple and microsoft though  have ports of their respective os to arm.,"bottoms line x86 dominates pcs because of a choice ibm made thirty+ years ago, and amd and intel own the x86 and wonâ€™t give those valuable goldmine rights to others.",intel made a ton of money maybe too much as it  blinded them and they missed all these other opportunities.,"arm and risc-v, power and other architectures made a push decades ago but volume is king and x86 still there but now arm dominates the low power and mobile world and apple has managed to tune their  custom arm to become competitive to leadership in the mobile and pc space.",everyone is now doing custom design ls most with arm with foundry so watch out x86 days leadership are likely limited.,amd and intel need to be careful as a billion+ arm sell to a few hundred million x86.,the installed base and volume of army will soon do to x86 what x86 did to all the other architectures 15-20 years ago.,"already the apple, mediatek, qualcomm volume is so large it has enabled tsmc to catch up and leapfrog intel in process leadership.","also they combined volume of arm is so large the foundry fabs are bigger, learning faster and fab cost scales better than intel.",that is the reason amd and nvidia all saw double digit growth the past couple years while intel stagnated and is need of government money and doing layoffs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"apple has proven arm can be at least equal in performance, the absolute best in efficiency.",it is up to qualcomm and microsoft to make arm great for windows.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because intel made a monopoly (x86 cpu brands).,"but there are more efficient (risc) instruction architectures like arm64 and riscv, so not for many more years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's correct.,you need licenses from intel and amd to make x86 processors and they typically only license to one another.,"nvidia for example tried to get a license, failed and then went back to arm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

oh right sorry i did not pick up on that.,but to chime in on your thoughts about 4k gaming.,you can run 4k without a 4090 but we have to be realistic here.,if we are running games that are old like from 10 years ago then fine.,but we are talking anout the latest and greatest games which are well known for being difficult to run anyways we have to lower our expectations.,i have owned nearly every 3xxx series card and as expected the high end offerings perform better and give you an excellent gaming performance.,but if someone was dead insistent on 4k gaming but had limited budget/choice then this becomes more and more difficult.,yes dlss will help massively but it only caveat is that if a game supports it.,if not then we are rlying on it rasterisation ability and not some software trickery.,from my own personal experience 3080 onwards is entry level and that what i would define as bare minimum.,i am sure there are plenty of peeps who use 3070/3070ti and are quite happy with it.,but it not for me.,i quite liked the 3080ti as that wasn;t as pricey as the 3090 ti but for the most part i was happy about the performance.,the 3090 ti i loved but it was pricey as hell.,but as you climb up you are getting marginal gains but the price is to make that jump increases more and more.,"which then leads to the 4090. massively hyped, massively hated on., massively loved.",it is all of those things.,it's a halo/showpiece product with a price to match.,i use an lg oled for gaming with 120hz refresh rate.,to be honest not since the 8800gtx or 1080ti have i been this impressed with the performance.,usually i just expect nvidia to charge 50% and to deliver like 15-20% performance increase like what they always do.,but this card feels like a generational leap in performance just like the 8800gtx did and just like the 1080 ti did at the time they were release.,but while this is the card at the moment i am using what i am really waiting for the intel cards further down the road and improved drivers/software.,7900xtx looks interesting and i can;t wait to get one of those to try out.,sorry for the rambling.,"my friend to wind me up sent a patrick roy autographed cap....

well to answer your question.,the 13700k and ddr 5 combo is nice.,i went with gskill 6400mhz as it was cheaper than corsair 5600mhz stuff.,personally i have the 13900k but i could of been equally happy with the 13700k.,"i use 2x asus z690 motherboard, one for the 13900k and the other one for my 12900+12700k.",i just update the bios then the me stuff and was good to go.,if you are happy enough with your setup then just keep using that until you feel unhappy with it.,i mean you can still use a strix 3080 for the meantime.,you might find that the performance it offers is adequate for your needs.,the biggest problem with teh 4080 16gb is that it is too expensive.,the 4090 is too expensive but people kinda accept it if they want the fastest 4k gaming experience.,if nvidia cuts the price of the 4080 more in linne with the 7900xtx then it may become a more atractive proposition.,but if i were to buy now and wanted the best performing 4k experience which is not the 4090 i would wait a couple of days until the 7900xtx benchmarks are out before making a decision.,you have already waited this long so what a couple of days.,?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"some (maybe all not sure) msi boards sets the power to the cpu higher than necessary under a setting called 'cpu lite load' ands defaults that setting to mode 12 while intel recommends mode 9.

hey!,i had issues with an asus board too!,"z690 tuf

i installed the termalright frame and was not beeing able to boot using xmp with 2 sticks of ram.","i tested with the original intel frame too, but didn't work!",i returned the board and i'm planning to get a new one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but will there be any problem with screw tightness and stability due to pressure.,and how should i tighten the screws and how much or does it not really matter??,"&#x200b;

i did find some video about 1/4 turns, but it does not say 1/4 turns after how tight.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
could i screw something up by using it??,i had already tried it on a rog strix z790-f board.,seemed maybe slight temp improvement.,but i had ram stability issues at xmp.,but i also did with the stock ilm as well no difference.,"&#x200b;

&#x200b;

so now going to a new asus z790 hero board tonight and wondering if i could screw something up permanently or is that not possible as long as i am careful?",?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i used thermalright's contact frame and tried asus z790 hero and z790 strix-f and both had same issues running ram fully stable at xmp settings.,"&#x200b;

i use the thermalright contact frame on msi z690 unify x with 32gb (2 x 16gb) 6600mhz cl32 39 39 76 corsair vengeance ddr5 ram.","so far ram perfectly stable at xmp settings

&#x200b;

not sure if it is bad luck.",i do not think so as i had issues with 2 asus boards of z790.,"&#x200b;

i also notice that with asus boards and ddr5, the cpu runs 8-15c hotter than with ddr4 3600 even with 12th gen when i tried them.","with msu z690 unify x, no such issue.","&#x200b;

i wonder if asus just does not play nice with ddr5 on intel 12th and 13th gen or if there is some hidden setting or settings that need to be manually tuned no one knows about that fixes the higher temp issues with ddr5 and also the inconsistent stability issues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i do use it and i think maybe it helps 1 to 3c at best or almost no difference to temps.,"&#x200b;

though maybe it is better anyways to prevent bending and warping of cpu long term.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it matters how tight or stuff will stop working.,gamers nexus has a video for the cpu bracket.,better looser than too tight.,cpu cooler will probably press down the cpu.,https://youtu.be/iyu1oskby-q?t=886,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just be careful,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you will not damage anything if you follow the directions.,the anti-bending bracket i have reuses the screws and back plate from the board's cpu socket .,just make sure everything lines up before screwing anything tightly and be careful not to bend any pins in the cpu socket.,maybe it's best to keep the black protective cover on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thats really strange, and does sound like maybe there is some bios settings messing things up.","i hope i didn't do a big mistake ordering the z790-f.   
did you happen to see anyone else with an asus z790 board stumble upon these issues?",i went with asus because the impression i got is that they have a good bios and less prone to issues (compared to other companies like gigabyte).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you still having stability issues?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nope not anymore.,works very stable.,"though full load temps are higher than i would like them to be as it runs 90-91c with an occasional spike to 94c in a 19.5c room running cinebench r23, it is within spec and that is with 2 140mm fans running at 1050 rpm.",and just reality that these cpus run hot and no way around it especially when overclocked and using air cooling with lower speed even large fans even with e-cores disabled and only 8 p cores running at 5.6ghz all core to cool.,"&#x200b;

though cpu-z stress test full load temps only average 85c to 86c with a rare spike to 87c.",so not too bad there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

intels max wattage spec is 253w for the 13900k.,so your motherboard is absolutely removing power limits.,i dont know what its called on your board.,you can search on google your motherboard and see for yourself.,but.,for sure you need to check your mount/aio.,as your cpu throttles at 100c but its going above that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"they're the same processor (just with or without overclocking unlocked), so aside from the more expensive k hypothetically being slightly better binned they'll have the same efficiency.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can power limit both 12700 and 12700k.,both will run at 65w.,the difference between them at 65w would be a lot smaller than difference between say 12600k and 12700k and for the most part it really doesnt matter what you pick,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
theyâ€™re very similar but the 12700k does have a 100mhz higher boost clock on the p cores and 200 mhz on the e cores.,"https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/compare.html?productids=134594,134591",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is true.,so the k might be slightly more efficient due to binning or slightly less efficient due to the 100/200 mhz difference.,i'd say it is probably a wash.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"exact same combo, just upgraded from a 2700x.",massive difference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've been seeing a lot of 10700k owners saying this.,i was hoping to get a high refresh monitor next year but i'll have to buy a new cpu for my 3080 as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how much diff in games,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my poor 9700k is struggling hard next to my 6900xt.,i'm currently waiting to see if the 7900x3d competes with the 13700k before i jump into this gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"lol, i'm the exact opposite.","i just managed to grab a 4090 to replace my 2080 super, but now my 8700k is massively bottle-necking the 4090 on certain games.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same upgrade path for me.,but i'm keeping my 1080 ðÿ˜… (i rarely game and needed the raw compute power),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"doing the same soon, what other differences have you noticed?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">46700k

why would you downgrade from such a powerful cpu?",surely 46th gen is much faster.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it never goes past 87c in cinebench although this is possibly because my room is quite cold this winter

i put -0.070mv offset undervolt, stable no problems could possible go down more but i never tried it, intel put too much voltage on these cpus, you should try -0.050mv offset undervolt pretty sure all 13600k can do this minimum.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a 10700k and itâ€™s very good still.,skylake 6 cores or better is still far from being bottlenecked with mid range gpus.,"also when they say it bottlenecks, probably means under 150 fps.",iâ€™m playing darktide and cpu sits at 50% usage with a ton of enemies on screen.,with heavily single threaded games you may notice the difference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
buying a good cpu is more important than a high refreshrate monitor.,"but, at the same time, 1440p 165hz monitors are pretty much the same price as a 1080p 165hz monitor.","1440p dropped in price, alot.",you just have to make sure they are 1ms.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
about 20%.... but for certain games.,"like spiderman, god of war, horizon, funny, because mostly sony-released games, since they do rely on cpu.","but, also forza, farcry6, and a little bit with cyberpunk.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"7900x3d ""should"" be able to take the top spot.","but, the issue is if you're willing to pay up?","because i know amd will jack up the prices even further, since they know people will be going after the x3d 7xxx series models.",especially with the current 7xxx cpu series not selling as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so... we should combine our resources.,i'll take custody of the 4090 this weekend.,you get it next weekend with the 13900k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for me just how quiet everything is now.,i have been so used to a loud noisy computer as my 2600k had to work hard to keep up and the fans were usually going at 60-75% all the time.,"also, still had a couple mechanical hdds.","with the new build, after limiting power, undervolt and tweaked fan cuve; it's so quiet.",i only have m.2 drives now and i hardly ever hear the fans; they usually sit at 30% and might spin up for a second or two once in awhile.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
jajajaja padre.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bad way of detecting a bottleneck.,cpu bottleneck is not detectable by cpu usage a lot of the time.,"you need to just check gpu usage, if it's not 99% or higher on uncapped frames then you are cpu or ram bottlenecked.","a lot of games do not use every single thread a cpu has so usage will never be 100%, even with a 4090 at 480p",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh it's still perfect for me right now, it can always maintain 60fps in cpu intensive games.",but moving on to a high refresh monitor would need an upgrade sadly.,the great thing is i can pass it down to my son.,btw how is darktide?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well i'd still consider the 10700k a good cpu, i currently play at 4k 60fps so it's my 3080 that's struggling a bit.",i was hoping to get a 144hz or 165hz 1440p monitor next year so i'll need to upgrade my cpu.,"i'll make sure i get a 1ms monitor, not sure if the g9 is but that's what i'm hoping to get.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ya, not including high cost of amd mother boards and ddr5.",i will factor everything in when the time comes next month or 2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the g9 is a good brand, but what ""inch of a monitor are you planning to get?","because anything beyond 27"" for 1440p, it won't look good.","for example if you were to get something like 32"" 1440p, it will end up looking like 1080p gaming, just with maybe slightly better lines.","but, one thing is for sure, my 3080 at 1440p is pretty much the perfect match, because 95% of my games match my refresh rate at 165hz, with a mix of ultra to high settings for certain games, and it is amazing.","i also have 4k 120hz monitor, but i find a better experience with my 1440p, due to the high fps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

do you have all the power ports plugged in on the mobo?,there should be a third 8 pin to allow the maximum draw.,after all the comments couldn't think of anything else.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"they shouldn't be, mine were both 288w (msi).","motherboard manufacturers do not put in the default specs, because apparently we all have water loops.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looks like i found my problem!,i checked my power management settings and it looks like my power maximum for the cpu was 95%.,turned it to 100% and now im seeing the exact 4.9 you had spoken about.,i had my old cpu limited at 95% to prevent crashing in the past and had forgotten to change it back when i moved my hard drives over.,"oddly enough when i took the dog off its chain, the temps were way better at a r23 score of 35k.",intel mustâ€™ve hard coded the cpu to go crazy and run hot when its chained up.,by chance do you remember the clocks/voltages you sent when you had the asrock m/b?,thanks for your help btw!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
288 is above 253 which is over what intel has.,so the motherboard is defining its own power limit/turbo timers.,you need to change that.,253 is still the pl1 and 2 in intels spec.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">off its chain, the temps were way better at a r23 score of 35k.","intel mustâ€™ve hard code

glad you're making progress!",to be honest i didn't do too much tinkering before i got rid of the board.,"with the bios setting i mentioned, i'd set it to around 330 a (which i think is amps?","), went into the os and messed with the icc max setting in xtu, tried to do a little bit of fine tuning, finding the sweet spot between clocks, voltage, and temperature.",i applied a -50 offset in the bios for voltage.,everything else was left on auto.,i probably could have gotten away with more of an offset if i played around with it more.,"keep in mind that 330 a may not be a good thing long-term, especially with this type of board, i'm just not sure.","as far as  clocks go, i hadn't done much before i reinstalled the asus board, just ended up playing with tvb more than anything else  (i think i ended up with 6 ghz for two cores, 5.9 for four, 5.6 for all eight).","i was getting up to 1.45 volts at that time on light loads, which doesn't seem safe at all (don't know what's considered safe for rocket lake).",i assume you'll get better results when you play around with it more.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's 125w and 253w.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
125w is the base watts for the processing speed.,that means if you set it to 125w then you will only get base clocks which is extremely low.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
on load my cores go to 5.3/5.4.,why would i want that at all the time?,"edit: re-researched it, yep my top clocks are time limited and fall back to pl1.","i'll set them both to 253, my 280 aio wasn't great at 288.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i wonder how much clock they can squeeze out of these.,also does that mean the ks version of the 13900k is off the table?,would be kinda weird releasing it then releasing a 13950k or something also with clock increase.,also seems like meteor lake is not making 2023 after all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i donâ€™t see why not.,if raptor lake refresh has the same socket.,and z690 boards already support raptor lake.,then probably a bios update will be needed for the refresh.,i canâ€™t see why it wouldnâ€™t be supported,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
different socket.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this makes sense but intel has been reconfirming meteor lake for 2023 for quite some time now.,feels like this refresh which hasn't been mentioned anywhere before untill now is a response to ml missing 2023 and intel needing something to go against amd's 3d-cache cpu's.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

probably arl on some n3 variant.,meteor lake wasn't going to impress in gaming nor productivity anyway due to core count&peak clocks regression.,but i think mtl will fare much better than raptor lake p against zen 4 mobile apus.,even though this new process probably won't be reaching 6ghz it should at least improve performance and efficiency at lower power range.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my point wasâ€¦ w680 and z690 are the same socket and cpu support.,folks might expect a similar situation from w790 and z790.,"of course the sockets are now different, but chipset naming here between the two generations is not particularly intuitive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

isn't yields and perf not being good excellent right from the start completely normal for a full node at the beginning?,yields improve as they ramp and enter hvm.,and meteor lake overall seems like an unexciting product for enthusiast market with desktop version rumored to have core count and clock speed regression from raptor lake.,"so maybe they don't want a repeat of rocket lake situation, with all the negative reception.",the cores themselves in mtl also aren't that much more powerful according to leaks.,so it makes sense to skip meteor lake on desktop or have it as a low to midrange option next to arrow lake which will feature a better cpu tile.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

even more if you consider the fact that your motherboard won't be able to exploit fully the 11900k.",compatibility doesn't mean that the chipset is optimized for a generation that came after.,"if you have a mb with a 400 chipset serie, you won't really benefit of the change.",like i said i have a 11900k and i took it for the single core performances.,"believe or not, i am more than satisfied of it.","however, i cannot advice you to buy it when i read that you have a 10850k.",personnally i wait for the 14th gen that will surely come in second half of 2023 (even if rumors say it will come in 2024),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"bro, since you already have 10850k, i assume the ""upgrade"" you meant is to upgrade to 11900k/11900kf???",here are my humble thoughts.,hope they are helpful.,"\- **performance**: 11900k, even at max overclock, is not much better than 10850k... even 12600k slaughters 11900k so badly in multi-threaded performance (by a huage 35%\~40%) and single-threaded performance (also by a huge 35%\~40%), let alone 12700k or higher or 13th gen... so for you, the 11th gen is out-of-date as an ""upgrade"" option, because you already have 10850k.","\- **sincere suggestion**: if you feel psychologically uncomfortable without upgrading, then upgrade to 12th/13th gen, now the z690/z690m motherboards are also very cheap and perfectly compatible with both 12th and 13th gen. but there's absolutely no point in switching to an 11th gen processor what so ever.!","[gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm) if you don't have enough financial means to upgrade to 12th/13th gen, please still save your money and don't buy 11th gen.

\- **if i were you**: i would sell my current 10850k+z490 and buy a reliable 2nd-hand 12600kf+z690m from someone who wants to upgrade to the 13th gen platform (i know there are people out there who even upgraded from z690 to z790, which doesn't make any obvious gaming advatange, but it is a good chance for you to get a cheap 2nd-hand z690/z690m)

\- **conclusion**: if you eventually bought a 11900k/11900kf, i would really feel bad, unless you got it for ""free"".","""free"" means you pay less than $20 overall.","if more than $20, i think spending any time re-applying thermal paste for a 11900k is a waste of life and not worth it..!",[gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|disapproval),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i'm using a d15 and it have ram clearance issues, mainly caused by the frontal fan.","i removed that fan and placed it on the frontal intake, so the cooler is basically a d15s.",it did not hurt my thermal performance by a lot.,"with this configuration i can do 200+w with 80-85 degrees, and hitting 100 degrees at 280-300w.",(room temperature is kept at around 20-25 degrees so the performance may be lower for singapore).,"i would suggest d15s if you are worrying about ram clearance, and d15 if you are not.",u12a is a little marginal for 13600k and may not be much cheaper.,"ak620 and fuma 2 should both be sufficient for 13600k, they are cheaper but may be a little noisy, especially for fuma 2 (i have used their 120mm fans in the same case as exhaust, and that fan is significantly noisier than the noctua fans, especially at 1000-1500 rpm).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'd go with thermalright's peerless assassin instead, it offers similar performance as both coolers but is much quieter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thermalright frost commander 140 is another good choice.,then again you can get away with way worse coolers if you bother to undervolt and/or lower power limits with minimal performance losses.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the ak620 not only performs better than the d15, it's also cheaper by a lot.",i see no reason to stick to noctua.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
has deepcool already promised adapters for the lga 1851 ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nh-u12a works great on my 12700k and i will use it when i change to a 13700k down the road also, a very important point vs which of those coolers to use is a: the case and how good of airflow it has.",b: that you verify that said cooler will clear your ram.,"&#x200b;

i have a fd torrent case and a asus z690 hero board, i changed my order on memory due to hard to get ddr5 at the time i was ordering and got corsair rgb memory, just due to availability and i got lucky it just barely clears the ram, the non rgb sticks would have been easy fit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nh-d15 has always been my choice (until i moved to wayercooling),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the conclusion i'm getting is the deepcool ak620 & thermalright peerless assassin 120 are 2 of the most mentioned non-noctua cpu air coolers for the i5 13600k in the comment section.,interesting observation.,come and share your thoughts why.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the ak620 is a great cooler, but i'll note that new stock for the noctua coolers should include the lga1700 bracket in the box, so requesting the free kit shouldn't be necessary now.",they've been bundling them for at least the last six months.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my d15s came with lga1700 hardware, dont blame noctua for vendors selling old stock.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thank you, insightful advice!",i live in singapore.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"soz vossky, but you didn't do enough research.","you have to read a few reviews, and check every so often for new reviews before making these claims.","i have had several noctua coolers, and fans, and like them well enough, but the d15 was dethroned years ago.",noctua has new d15 coming because it's been beaten in many reviews.,"it's well known that the dc assassin 3 is at the bare minimum as good as good as the d15, and up to 3 degrees cooler depending on the review.","lemacho grand also was in the same ball park, and the darkrock pro 4 is also right there.","i'm not sure about the thermalright fc140, but it's supposed to be as good, and has been on sale for $44 at amazon.","even if it's 3 degree's worse, it's less than half the price of a new d15.","that dc ak620 is within 3 degrees of the d15, but also noticeably less money.","i will recommend any of those, especially on sale, as a competitor, or better buy than the d15.","with noctua you are paying for the name, quality control/warranty, support, and fans that generally better than the competitors.","worth it vs some coolers, but probably not worth 30%-50%+ money.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">need an adapter for lga1700, that is a pain to find in my country

just write their support, they send it to you for free.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
some boards come with lga 1200 holes.,the bracket kit is free i believe from noctua or 15$(cad) from newegg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just bought an ak620 off amazon and it was one of the inventory that didnâ€™t come with the bracket.,contacted support and they verified shipment within a few hours.. wonâ€™t have it till next week.,iâ€™m in america though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is the thermalright bracket a must for the lga 1700 socket?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"could you specify what continuous power draw you were ""fully loading"" the system under?",its rated 125w/160w power limits?,or uncapped?,i was using a thermalright pa120 and at the uncapped 200w it was pushing 92c.,at 160w it was a much more reasonable 75-80c as you noted.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
agreed.,i have the fuma 2 rev b on my 12600k and it works just as well as the 240mm aio i replaced.,the idle temp is even a few degrees lower with the fuma.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it can draw power if you really want to crank it up, but honestly the performance gains are marginal and for 95% of people a d15 is absolutely plenty.","typically i like to go aio simply because i like to overclock, but i understand that it's not entirely reasonable lol.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah?,"white fans were coming in 2020, and now theyâ€™re q3 2023. if theyâ€™re having that much trouble with the color white, iâ€™m not putting much hope in a entirely new d15 replacement coming on time in q1 2023, especially since the new 140mm fan itâ€™s supposed to use was supposed to be out now andâ€¦ isnâ€™t.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is why i went with an ak620 for my 13900k.,best performing (noise normalized) cooler on the market.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i did the same upgrade, keeping the u12a with the new 13700k, but the temps are 10 c higher than with 12700k.",just so you know what to expect.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i guess it depends on stock, in france they have a different bundle that includes the lga1700 bracket for the same price as the one without it but i can't find it in stock anywhere and it's been a month since i started to build my pc (still waiting for the 7900xtx release).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
deepcool assassin iii is considered the best right now by many reviewers.,"that being said, there is a long list of coolers that are as good or within a few degree of the best.",read some actual 3rd party reviews to help you decide what's best for your build.,"along with the a3...

but why bother with that when you can get an equally good product at lower price and without this chore?,the very fact that you have to ask for an adapter for a platform that is out for well over a year is ridiculous.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to be honest i haven't tried the 13600k without it, but at the price and considering the ease of mounting there is really no reason to skip it.",watch the gamers nexus video about it if undecided!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to be honest i haven't checked the power draw as it runs stock with all cores at the rated clock speeds.,how and why it draws 200w when maintaining stock speed?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
overclocking is just pointless nowadays.,chips are so good at maximizing their efficiency and clocks.,"you gain a few % performance for much more power draw (including need more cooling), instability and much time spent tinkering.","so, unless you're trying to break some records, the d15 will do absolutely fine for any i5 and probably higher as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

in most of the reviews iâ€™ve seen the 13900k doesnâ€™t even go above 130w while gaming so if all you do is play games then even a good dual tower air cooler will do fine and you donâ€™t even need to set any power limits.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i mean if you put intel default power limits (i think its 253w?),you wont need to worry about running cinebench or high end benchmarks at crazy temps.,i've seen alot of threads about these cpus hitting 95c+ when benching them and the usual fix is to use intel power limits.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what!!!,mine can hit 150-180 watts in games if limits are removed and even up to 140 with limits.,the thing is an animal and runs hot!,even with a corsair block it thermal throttled like crazy with no limits and throttled with limits under very heavy load.,i'm hoping the bykski block does a little better because it's a little bigger and heavier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if i remember correctly the ring bus of the new intel cpus is gonna be higher by default.,for example the 12900k has a ring bus of 3.6ghz which goes to 4.6/4.7 with e-cores disabled.,"(anyone feel free to correct me)

new cpu's have a ring bus much higher by default without the need to disable e-cores and will have more cache which would should  help in performance and 0.1/1%.",i'd honestly get the 13700k for the better 1%/0.1% since im anal about frametimes but that's just me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
won't matter at all unless or until you have a 3090 or better is my thought.,"if you're getting or have a 4090, you should probably get raptor lake 13th gen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 13 series will be better.,the 4090 is showing some cpus are bottle necking the systems in 1080p and even 1440p.,"but depends on what monitor youâ€™re using, ram too because ddr5 is already showing improvements over ddr4",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's going to be better, but not enough that anyone should care.",most modern cpus are more than capable for most games imo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"entirely depends on what video card you have, what kind of games, and the resolution you play.","surly for 4k gaming, single-player ultra detail 1440p, is utterly useless upgrade your good cpu.","and tbh even for competitive online gaming, a 12700k is already huge in 99% of scenarios.","as a rule of thumb, the cpu has very little impact on gaming performance.","random people that comment below stuff like ""huge increase u must upgrade bro"" are just wannabe nerds without a clue.","finally, waiting a few days both for potential promos on alder lake or surprising increase in the performance of raptor, cannot hurt.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm fully expecting the 13600k to match the 12900k in most scenarios when it comes to gaming.,with the 13700k beating out the 12900ks across the board.,the 13600k will also have a lot of gaming performance to gain from oc.,"now if it means anything at all for the setup you are running, is another thing entirely.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m concerned about about max power consumption because i donâ€™t want to renew my new evga 550w knowing that many amd cpus are literally 100w less with same performance (just for gaming that iâ€™m focused on),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not going to be noticeable really in the real world.,but its nice to have better stuff so up to you :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for sure it will be a close call, especially in our everyday life and not taking into consideration games and other heavy stuff.","the question you should be asking is, how i am supposed to cool this thing, when it consumes 300 watts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you definitely wont need to upgrade to 13700k if you already have a 12700k.,the fps gains visually would most likely be pretty dissappointing.,"now it's not out yet, so maybe it's 50% better, but it's probably going to be more like 15-20% better, which in average would give you 30-50 fps more in games like overwatch.","maybe 10 more in graphic intensive games like the witcher, rdr2 etc.",just looking realisticly at how it will probably turn out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
see 12900k vs 12700k.,13700k should be tiny bit better than 12900k.,probably up to like 10% better in some games vs 12700k.,nothing game changing but it should be better.,"it should do better in 1% lows, that's the main advantage you should look at, no avg fps, that's probably very similar for anyone to care.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m going from my avx-512 12700k to a 13900kf.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
better imc will also help with frametimes (faster mem support).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
| for example the 12900k has a ring bus of 3.6ghz which goes to 4.6/4.7 with e-cores disabled.,"(anyone feel free to correct me)

they're supposed to, but on some motherboards you can disable that functionality (clockdown?)","and i've got some weird bug, that cache clock doesn't nudge from 4.4 ghz, despite having e cores enabled and in use.",it used to drop to 4 ghz (same as e cores) but now it doesn't.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i donâ€™t think hub is really taking into account how absurdly b-die scales (and furthermore dual rank b die on comet lake/zen 3 platforms).,sure the ddr5 may give you more bandwidth out of the box at xmp setting but for actual in game performance the average kit of b die can be tuned to match or slightly exceed tuned ddr5 in most games.,itâ€™s really hard to compete with stupidly mature ddr4 using newborn ddr5 dimms.,to be clear there is nothing wrong with purchasing ddr5 - and in fact at this point in time the price/performance is favorable especially if you donâ€™t want to tune timings since ddr5 doesnâ€™t scale nearly as well as ddr4.,i just wish they actually tried to tune both kits so you can see what both generations of memory are capable of.,using 3200 c14 b die dimms at xmp settings hurts my soul lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that was my take as well.,ddr5 prices have been viable for a while now but until very recently their advice was to stick to ddr4.,they have also been sandbagging the non 12900k alder lake parts with their 3200mhz ddr4 kits in their benchmarks even though we can now see from this test how much even the 12600k can benefit from a fast kit.,"but now that ryzen is getting mandatory ddr5 support, suddenly it's time to leave ddr4 and everything is unicorns and rainbows in ddr5 land.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes and it show that it performs similarly to trash tier ddr4 on a mid range cpu.,he has no point here.,there are so many problems with this test.,why he picked these parts to test ram?,seems like he thought up the conclusion first then came up with results to prove it.,recommending people to go buy out 8gb micron ics is probably the worst advice you can give to customers and you should probably get your ram advice from people like buildzoid who actually know what they are doing.,"that trash ddr4 kit has a lot of head room btw to tweak, that 8gb micron ics don't.",he could have included like a couple benchmarks but he didn't guess why... enjoy the 90ns latency on these with uneven fps in any high frame game.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"even if they did they probably would have made this comment anyways, as they're presumably the sort of person who just constantly makes authoritative contradictory reddit comments without actually having their own supporting data.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are a redditor here making authoritative comments.,go get your advice from a marketer with affiliate link in the description trying to sell you shit just ahead of a platform that needs ddr5.,you do you.,these kits dont get close to sweet spot for am5.,it's just a horrible advice he's giving to people.,this guy made a video last year just shitting on ecores and got told by pretty much everyone how wrong he is.,"but yeah he has a video with some excel charts and dubious tests, he must be right and everybody else is wrong.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

did you remember to put thermal paste between your cooler and your cpu?,there's clearly a cpu heat error.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is the cpu fan header plugged into cpu_fan?,are fans turning?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well there's surely no contact between cpu and cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

could it also be the cooler isn't strong enough?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you have extra thermal paste you can unmount the cooler and see what the thermal paste spread is like.,you might need to repaste the cooler which is why having extra thermal paste handy is mentioned.,cooler model?,could be other stuff also like a faulty sensor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i know i need a 1700. but it's possible that the 1700 socket wasn't released at the moment my cooler was made.,so it's not in the list.,but it fits.,so hoped to be safe.,but i got a new one now!,hopefully it works well tomorrow ðÿ˜š,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
people are saying contact between the cpu and cooler but that shouldnâ€™t necessarily stop your pc from booting.,"i would check that everything is plugged in correctly, reseat ram, that kind of stuff.","if that isnâ€™t it, you might have a faulty mobo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

its not mounted correctly.,has nothing to do with thermal paste or type of cooler.,your cpu is touching air instead of cooper.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

definitely try to remount it then and go from there.,make sure itâ€™s tightened down to give good contact to the ihs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no idea tbh.,it's a watercooling block,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just checked.,it is.,probably the wrong cooler.,wrong socket at least.,it's not on the official list of coolers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
huh never mind then maybe it was the cooler - glad you got it fixed!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

then it surely is not 1 milimeter by 1 milimeter square and it's surely not strong enough.,"it's got not contact with the cpu, is the correct bracket useed?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have a 13700k that is air coolled which i use for gaming and surfing.,"at stock, i would get a cb23 score of 31k and temps would go into the 100s with my 10 fans at 100%.",here's what i did.,in bios set pl1 to 90w and pl2 to 150w and did an undervolt of 0.1v.,"also updated the fan curve to only go above 30% if temps go above 50 and only max if it goes above 80.

when i run cinebench now, my max temp is high 70s and the fans only hit 75% for the few seconds the cpu has turboboost active.",otherwise fans are silent for most of the test.,still get a score of 21k.,i was playing darktide the other day at 120 fps and might hear the fans for a second or two every hour.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
stock settings are fine if you're fine with the heat and noise.,"if you want, you can keep the oc'd settings on but the gains in gaming will probably be negligible in most cases unless you're perhaps running a 4090 and a 1080p 360hz screen.","if the noise and heat of the stock settings are too much, you should be able to undervolt a bit to keep things under control.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why are you worried about cinebench if your goal is to play games?,the ideal overclock for gaming will result in instant throttling during cinebench.,games draw less than 200 watts.,you should be able to get at least 5.6ghz all core for gaming.,5.7 or higher is possible with a decent chip.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea highest clock you can get for games as long as temps/voltage aren't too high.,btw you can use thermal velocity boost to have the cpu step down to a lower speed when i set temperature is exceeded.,this is handy for keeping high clocks for games while stepping down for all core workloads like cb.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you don't have to pick between good all core vs good gaming (1-2 core) with 12 and 13th gen.

these cpus support setting different turbo ratios based on the number of active cores.",e.g.,"i have 58x/3c 56x/5c 55x/all

on top of that you can have different tvb ratios based on the number of active cores.",e.g.,"i have it as 61/1c 60/3c 58/5c 57/all cores, but that single core has to remain under 61c to run at 61x, etc.","now, the issue is that it is pretty complex to tune the turbo ratios to be stable (because of the complex frequency-based voltage curves and voltage request logic) and tvb ratios to actually happen (because they are temp based, so too high voltage will mean exceeding tvb temp limit and you will never see the higher multipliers).","i think unless you want to make this your hobby, it is better to get a motherboard that has good auto overclocking and rely on that as the primary way to oc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you might want to reseat this cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
impressive!,what do you use to cool that monster?,and does it stay under 100c or do you raise the max?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is this with xtu than you can set the turbo ratios based on active cores?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why is that?,what temps do u think i should be getting with an air cooler?,"eta: for most of the cb23 test, the p cores are low 60s with the e cores at high 50s.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"k, so let's back a step - what cooler do you have?","i judged it is something top tier, since you've said you have 10 fans, this amount of fans usually is picked for a reason.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah, u12a shouldn't see 90c under 230w on 13700k, you've got contact issues, you should not even remotely be in need to cut the power limit this drastically.","if it's not o11d chassis and a classic construction, like silent base or lancool or similar, then 4 good quality fans (2 front, 1 at the back, 1 at the back of the top) will easily maintain \~6c above ambient in a non garbage chassis at 500-600w heatload at 800 rpm.",and you will not end up with tons of turbulences this way too.,"also, it's a good idea to drive chassis fans by temperature of a chipset, a gpu or an other non-cpu temperature with only rear fan driven by cpu temperature.","air cooling effectiveness is affected by intake temperature, so raw cpu workload will most often not affect intake temperature.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't see 90c under 230 watts.,i only saw that at stock/auto settings when it's drawing the full 253w.,i reduce the pl1/pl2 power because i don't want the cpu to get that hot so it ramps up the fans.,my goal is to never hear the fans.,i don't need the extra performance as i'm just gaming/surfing usually.,"if i do anything more intensive, i'm fine with the reduced performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the paste application is before the bracket installation.,"the temperature difference is quite significant, at least 5-7c in average temps.","i still get temperature spikes because of high boosting, but overall the average temps over the same gaming workload is much cooler.",edit: original paste application was using the 5 dots method.,current application is also using the 5 dots method.,edit2: board is asus z690 prime.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

13600k consumes 230w at stock doesn't sound right.,how did you measure that?,but i think you are overreacting here.,90-95c in cinebench is not something abnormal.,60c in games is totally good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">  60c in games

i doubt it's an aio seating issue.",60c is fine for gaming loads.,another telltale sign is the liquid temp.,if the seating is really bad the liquid won't heat up.,with partial/ uneven contact you likely end up with significant temp differences between the cores.,"> it reaches 90-95c in cinebench

if you google for that it appears to be quite common.","cinebench seems to use avx, which tends to causes high temps.",if you run small fft in prime you will also see instant spikes to 90-100c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the motherboard must be supplying more than necessary voltage as many boards do.,i don't have the same cpu but 1.4v at stock looks high to me.,find out the normal voltage range for that cpu and try negative voltage offset if it's higher than normal in your case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

higher core and thread count better for managing background tasks and cpu intensive games/applications.,higher cache size.,better zip compress and decompression speeds.,obviously for productivity the 12700f is also far better.,only benefit i can see with the 12600k is option for overclocking.,but considering the tiny performance improvement i wouldn't say it's worth it for lower frame times in future.,overall the 12700 chip is better in every aspect.,that's why i'd pick that as your cpu if you plan to keep it a long time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well then i guess you're better of with a few more cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in my case i have 3600c16 memory.. it doesnt work in gear 1 mode at 3600. so i oc'ed it to 3500c14 which is even better.,but some poeple on reddit have reported that 3600 works for them.. guess it depends on the motherboard combo and the ram itself aswell.,but worst case scenario.. you can oc it to 3500c16 or something like that and it should work.. b660 allows for ram oc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

nice.,900 is alot considering you have a gpu already.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the lower resolutions are more cpu dependant, regardless of your gpu, 1440 is a mix and 4k the gpu does most of the work... that said a 12600k even will power my 1440p ips panel at 180hz on just the igpu and actually looks decent, and of course the graphics are even oc capable.",for anything that doesn't require a high gpu/compute workload you can scape away with a really good quality display without a dedicated gpu.,"i build pcs for a living for many ranges of customers, and every use case i have thought of and more.","last year i assembled over 150 pcs that had 11600k to the 12900k and all in between, and i will let you in on a little secret - the difference in normal use to even heavy gaming with a decent gpu from a 12600k to a 12900k is literally not even noticeable, a few fps is all, thus why i kick my own ass everytime i upgrade to the newest i9 because other than the 9900k, an i9 upgrade was totally unneeded for me, and i'm an enthusiast, a 12600k and a z690 board will do all a 12700 anything will all day long bc you can make up the extra few cores by ramping up the i5 core clocks if really needed... you can also do a bclk oc on any chip and board i've seen, but results are limited and stability will vary.. 
basically if you want high performance cpu that's snappy and can handle everyday workloads and even hardcore games anything more than an unlocked i5 is simply overkill, this goes for 12700k users as well as 12900k like myself, i will never use 24 cores for more than unrealistic benchmarks as i never see more than 35% usage even on the hardest games they just pull it from the gpu.. so literally everything i throw at my i9 i never use but 1/3 of its power.. i used a 12600k for 3 weeks while i waited to get another 12900k bc i sold mine and it only took me that long to upgrade to the i9 because i was using an apex and the 12600k i truly noticed no difference until i looked at numbers, you'd never think a new i5 could be that strong but they have come a long way last 3 generations.. save some money and steer away from the i7/i9.",some good ram you'll be in better shape..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the fact that msi in their newer bios sets 3600mhz and above in gear 2 automatically doesn't mean that that's the limit or that you can't manually try gear 1.  vccsa voltage adjustment is only generally required above 3600mhz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you can use something as old as a 3770k and be fine for 60hz 1080p.,cpu will be pretty loaded on 1440p 144hz.,my 10600k already hits 100% load breifly on games like horizon zero dawn with that resolution so i would recommend the 12700k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'm not sure why you've set the 'cpu1 temperature' to report in rtss instead of the 'cpu temperature'.,per core temperature readings tend to fluctuate a lot more than the die temperature and depending upon the reported core can often be higher than others.,doesn't mean the cpu is overheating.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

make sure your fan is properly set and that you used sufficient force.","when you tighen the cpu that is tight as hell, same goes for the fan.",it really has to be on it.,"thirdly, make sure you used sufficient amount of thermal paste.","don't fall for the ""its too much paste"", there can never be too much but there can always be too little and you'll be overheating like you are.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

well at lower resolutions (1080p) its going to use more of the cpu i believe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're not going to get 100 fps in areas with a lot of players.,the bottleneck in a lot of mmos seems to be memory bandwidth or memory latency related so the plan should be to stay with what you have or upgrade to x3d.,i doubt anything else will net you a meaningful improvement.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think derbauer said the next two gens will take the same ilm frames.,derbauer frame might not contact the mainboard at all vs other frames?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thats a typical marketing answer.,it is not preventing it from hitting boosting frequencies under what cooler?,"most of the processors dont even come with a coolerâ€¦ 

also, independent testing shows that major improvements can be made by installing a contact frame.",does it work without?,yes.,does that make a contact frame bullshit?,absolutely not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
otherwise they would be admitting to putting out a product that lacks fit and finish.,sure it's good enough to hit the target frequency but if overclock bench tests are better with the bracket then they shouldn't be discouraging anyone who buys a k chip from maximizing it's potential.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if it is indeed a thin and light laptop, i would go with the 1260p.","if itâ€™s a bigger chunky laptop or you must have the best possible performance, get the 1280p.","the current laptop trend is to put way too much cpu into a chassis that canâ€™t handle it, and just let it throttle.","most laptops will already heavily throttle due to thermal constraints, and/or have power limits adjusted way below theoretical ideals (for example, there are laptops that come with 35w cpus limited to 15w).","those cpus might have the same power limits, but a faster cpu with more cores will be capable of dissipating more heat, or hitting power/thermal limits and throttling faster.","often, a more powerful cpu will end up performing the same or even slightly worse than a more appropriately specâ€™d cpu due to chassis constraints.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

base frequency is an absolutely meaningless specification.,"all that says, is that at the rated 28 watts power consumption, the cpu will probably be running at ""this"" frequency.","increase the number of active cores, and of course that number has to go down.",i also daresay a yoga 9 is not going to allow either cpu to burst to 64w.,"if it's the same price, then you can certainly get the faster cpu - i would - but i would also spend some time in throttlestop to see if i can better configure its tdp settings.",although there's no guarantee you will see any practical real world difference over the 1260p.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thatâ€™s not really how boost works, it doesnâ€™t have to do anything.","the base frequency (which is really just a reference value, not an actual speed) is lower because it has more cores to use the power.",but in the end all the relevant variables are configured by the manufacturer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

love the builds on premium lenovos like the x1 carbon!,and reflected in the price too ðÿ˜.,"i'm using ts on a huawei matebook x pro and i was pleasantly surprised how a little undervolt made a positive impact to heat, fans and battery.",will definitely give ts another go on the next machine ðÿ˜ž,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hopefully ts still works!,"should be okay for at least power limits, though i seem to have some sort of dynamic tdp thing going on with my x1 that might make that tricky too.",i have to say my 4-year experience with this x1 carbon has made me 100% dead set on having another x1 carbon for my next laptop.,"itâ€™s definitely not a gaming or powerhouse system, but it is fantastic in every other way and incredibly durable (you donâ€™t even want to know whatâ€™s happened to it).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don't tell me you drove over it and it survived?,ðÿ˜… actually i've never played with power limits before but i think that's the path i'll need to take this time.,i read someone couldn't undervolt an i7 1260p.,do you have any tips or a link to a guide on how best to tweak power limits with ts?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ts is one of the most unintuitive programs iâ€™ve used, but there are some guides.",basically just mess about with both sets of pl1/pl2 values and observe the results in a program like hwinfo64.,"no, didnâ€™t drive over it.","but i literally tried to fold it in half, which is arguably worse.","i have a rocking leather recliner near a wall, and normally store my laptop beside it, leaning against the wall.","so one day when the laptop was like 3 months old i sat in the chair, and for some reason it wouldnâ€™t rock.","i couldnâ€™t figure out why, so iâ€™m literally using my entire body weight to try to get the chair to move normally.","then something clicked in my head, i checked beside the chair.","the laptop had slipped down from its vertical position and wedged the left side about 8â€ up on the wall and the right down against the base of the chair, so that when i sat the frame was pressing into the middle of the laptop and literally trying to fold it in half.","i panicked, pulled it out itâ€™s soft and completely unprotective case, and no joke the thing was bent into a curved v shape, with the middle about an inch lower than the two sides.","over the next couple hours, it gradually flattened itself out.","i took it apart, checked everything, and shockingly it was okay.","had to smooth out some speaker grille tape, tightened all the screws, but otherwise the only lasting damage is a slight crack in the carbon fiber on the top screen housing, and a small mark on the lcd (visible on dark screens) from where it must have been badly crushed.",three and a half years later and itâ€™s still working just fine!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"whoa, your machine has gone through a lot.","it's a miracle the thing isn't in 2 or more pieces, truly living up to its reputation!",ts feels like it was brought to life from some time between dos and the windows 3.1 era.,but great once you've hacked the hack.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wait until they are released and than decide,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
z790 is supposed to have more chipset-based pcie 4.0 lanes.,"havenâ€™t really heard about any other changes, but technically the chipset hasnâ€™t been announced/revealed yet.","about the only thing really known is that 13th gen will still max out at 16 pcie 5.0 lanes, rather than the earlier expectation of the 4x4.0 cpu ssd lanes being upgraded to 5.0, so iâ€™m not really sure what the benefits will be.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"z790 as a chipset is basically z690, but with an additional 4 pcie lanes upgraded to pcie 4.0 speeds.","the motherboards will likely have improved ddr5 layouts, meaning that we'll see higher data rates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've read the following blurb on the web a few times over the months.,does anyone have any insight on this?,better temps at same clocks over 12900?,"""the next-gen raptor lake cpus will reportedly feature a new digital linear voltage regulator (dlvr) power delivery system that is rumored to drop the power consumption of these 13th gen chips by up to 25% according to intel's internal research data...""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my z690 seems to have support for the new 13gen cpus with the latest bios ver.,get one z690 with bios flashback so you dont need a cpu to flash.,"and no, the tests you are probably reffering had crappy ddr4 sticks, thing it was 3600 cl 16-22-22, of course a fast ddr5 system will have better 1% figures compared to such slow ram.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we dont really know  but if you are buying rpl there is no point buying a motherboard right now.,rumor has it that intel is asking board partners to not release ddr4 based z790 board even though technically it can work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"z790 is rumoured to have more pcie lane from chipset and better memory support

though if you are not pushing the limits what either can do, then you will be perfectly fine with either",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wait till release, see what z790 offers over z690 and what prices are available on z690 boards.","the odds are that unless your going to be using something out of the normal a ""bargain"" z690 maybe the way to go.","the only question is will they still be available, i would imagine asus etc will shift to z790 only production so you may have to be on the ball to grab a deal.",this is may plan anyway.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
evga z690 classified is on sale for $299.,(usually itâ€™s $629).,heck of a deal.,i went with that and iâ€™ll be getting a 13700k for it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
other question: why not go for the newer z790 when you are already planing to buy a mb?,like i wouldnt want to save money on the most important thing in a pc.,50 to 100 $ bugs is nothing compared to the longlivity of the board and the supported stuff it offers.,i would rather ask: is it worth saving money just to go with an od 690 chipset!,?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"z790 ofc, what a stupid question.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
x690 was more than enough.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
unless u r gonna upgrade ur pc in 2 years z690 if u are thinking about upgrade every year or two then z790,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
some of the z790 gets 1x nvme ssd pcie 5.0 support...which means it will support corsair mp700 f.ex..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm curious to know if the higher amount of chipset pcie will result in more i/o on the back of the motherboard.,"one thing i was extremely disappointed with in looking for a good z690 board was how limited i/o was, especially on lower cost motherboards.","most have fewer than 8 total usb ports on the back, and even worse, many of them still had usb 2.0 ports as part of that total.","meanwhile, you go look at an equivalently priced am4 motherboard and there's literally a dozen usb 3.2 10gbps ports in a mixture of usb a and usb c. sure, you could solve this problem by purchasing a daughter board or something, but it would be nice to not have to...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ddr4 3600 cl16 isn't slow by any stretch of the imagination, so that's just a dumb statement.","by the way, what the hell kind of system are you running?",your ram is more expensive than your cpu and motherboard.,those are some ass backward priorities.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"doesn't make any sense, is this another mlid rumor?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
even in europe?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
please update.,did evga announce compatibility for raptor lake?,because i cant find it anywhere.,i also got the classified but now im sweating hard because i dont see any announcements from evga regarding raptor lake support.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> why not go for the newer z790 when you are already planing to buy a mb?,price and features?,what a dumb question.,"these chipsets are practically the same, but one is less money.",> like i wouldnt want to save money on the most important thing in a pc.,this is incredibly stupid.,"he's not buying a lower quality part, like a cheap power supply; he's buying a previous generation's premier component.",talk about a false equivalency.,> 50 to 100 $ bugs is nothing compared to the longlivity of the board and the supported stuff it offers.,"the longevity of z690 and z790 are identical, in that they are both lga 1700 sockets with ddr5 and pcie 5 support.",you're literally just spouting nonsense at this point.,> i would rather ask: is it worth saving money just to go with an od 690 chipset!?,yes.,"again, features and price.",there are some genuinely idiotic people offering bad advice on reddit.,"op, please educate yourself and avoid them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i probably would've gone for z790.,probably going amd now though as i'll be wanting that 7800x3d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol why?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[removed],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why would you want that just for gaming though?,even sata ssds are on par with pcie 4.0 nvme for gaming loading times.,it'd be just so damn expensive for no performance gains at all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thatâ€™s more a cost thing than a lanes limitation thing - as seen by most higher-end boards having plenty of gen 2 usb ports, and some even with thunderbolt.","the z690 hero i have has 2 x usb 4/thunderbolt, 7 x gen2, and 2 x 2.0, for 11 external ports.","internally thereâ€™s 4 x gen1, 4 x 2.0, and 1 x gen2x2, bringing the total to 20.

i would expect to see most boards having 5 full pcie 4.0 m.2 slots (most upper boards currently have four plus a 3.0), more expansion slots (which are typically extremely limited on z690), and maybe more boards with 10g ethernet and other frills like thunderbolt.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">meanwhile, you go look at an equivalently priced am4 motherboard and there's literally a dozen usb 3.2 10gbps ports in a mixture of usb a and usb c.

which motherboard has a dozen 3.2 10gbps usb ports?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"those sticks are the super slow, look at the timings, dont just stare yourself blind on the cas latency.","they are super trash ram for ddr4 sticks, basically jdec spec at 3600mt/s.","and about my sys in sign, well this is a temp system, got the sticks for super good deal and could not resist less than the b660i mobo, will be perfect for either a raptor lake cpu or the zen4x3d.",and to be honest tinkering with cpu/ram is so much more fun than with gpus because they are so locked down today.,"heck you cant even change timings or voltages to the vram today, heck you cant even change voltages to the gpu core.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sounds like it and glad as we have now seen the z790+ddr4 boards announced he's been proven wrong once again... god i hate that guy!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nope, we always get screwed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
beta bios states support for future processors.,so a safe assumption.,my classified just arrived today waiting on 13th gen release.,just say the price is back to $629 too.,good thing i ordered on monday at the $299.,lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"replying on necro thread, who is stupid here?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
materidian is totally right about this.,the usb ports are mostly a thing of the bord manufacturers.,"but if the bord you want has internal usb3 connctor available, you might use it for a usb-connector-upgrade - there are plenty of of options:  such ones that use the bord usb connectors, those that directly use a pcie slot.","and as most usb devices don't use the full usb bandwith, you can even use an (powered or unpowered) internal usb hub to get the conneciton for more ports.","i use 4 internal devices that must be attached to usb (multiple fan / rgb controllers), so i had to use an internal hub, works without any issues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i don't remember which boards i was looking at, but i believe it was an asus one.","something in the crosshair series i think, but im not sure.","i just remember seeing dual nic and a ton of usb ports all over the back, and i was very angry i couldn't find anything on the intel side with that level of i/o.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm using a gigabyte z690 aorus elite ax ddr4.,"it has 10 usb ports on the rear i/o (including one usb-c), albeit 4 are usb 2.0.  it's worked for me so far.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3600mhz cl16 is fine, you can tighten good kit so it's even better in the end.","i use 4000mhz cl15 quad channel kit for my skylaxe-x and it runs 14 - 15 - 15 -25, blazing fast.","there wouldn't be huge difference tho, good 3600 cl16 kit plenty good.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pretty much no motherboard has 12 3.2 10gbps ports,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not *all of them* are 10gbps like his comment sugvests,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3600 cl16 with low primary timings are ""good"" like trcd of 16 or 18, trp at 16 or 18 but when hose are at 20 or 22 then you got god aweful ic on your hands.",u cant just say my kit at this mt/s with cl16 is plenty good when it performs dogshit compared to proper ram.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well i replied to the wrong person anyway lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes , im able to run with a i3 8100t uhd grapics 630 

but the unreal 4 textures glich kills me 

im fix with low resolution mod",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what cooler and what max and average temps did you get during benchmark?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what are the ecores good for?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, you should upgrade if you play cpu demanding games and play 144hz or higher.",games are getting more cpu bound as recent gpus need more cpu power to avoid bottlenecks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"don't use enhanced turbo, it's a terrible setting.","it'll set each core to it's maximum multiplier, for a 13900k that means 2 cores at 58x with the other 6 at 55x.",you'll get mostly 55x multiplier performance with vastly increased vcore requirements for that 5.8 ghz frequency.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if the system has been stable with that setting enabled, you can use it as a baseline for a manual overclock.","basically, keep the same clockspeeds mce/et was running and try reducing the voltage in 0.0250vcore increments until the system is failing stress test, then bring it back up one or two ticks.",my 12700k can do 5ghz p-cores @ 1.250vcore while et tries to run the same speed @ 1.300vcore (sometimes spiking upwards of 1.320v),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if you only play games on it you'll see exactly zero performance difference between unlimited and 150w power limit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's basically an overclocking profile, it's forcing the cpu to work on higher frequencies across all cores, but it takes more voltage to do so, therefore more power draw and more heat.","i would recommend to turn it off - difference in performance is small (about 5% in cinebench, in real life tasks, it's gonna be lower) but power draw is higher (about 250w vs. 320-340w on cpu package power) and the temps are way higher (80â°c vs. 100â°c even with best aio, you basically need a custom water loop in order to have good temps).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what do you recommend doing instead?,iâ€™m not too knowelgeable with over clocking.,and the gaming power use is very tame with these settings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not a bad idea to reduce the voltage.,iâ€™m still shocked it used 340 watts of power during cinebench.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's not a setting on an asus bios?,but water cooling is the equivalent setting on msi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"they are, been using them for years",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mce is short for multicore enhancement.,asus and motherboard vendors usually have this on by default.,what it does is it removes power limits when under full load.,so if you watched reviewers.,some cpus took more than 300+ watts under full load.,disabling mce caps the max wattage to 253w which is intels default .,now these chips run extremely hot anyway.,almost no reason to have mce on as it will 100%  make your cpu throttle as no cooler can get that under control unless a custom loop.,i saw 0 performance issues with turning mce off.,i went from 100c package to 75-85c average with some hot cores hitting 95 once or twice.,now this was 10 minutes of cinebench r23.,so it was extreme stress test.,if you are gaming you will be nowhere near the 253 limit.,games do not make the cpu hit power limits so it doesnâ€™t matter for gaming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so the problem was asus.,i did intel mei update no i have full ram speed and a score with 38000 points,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ultimately every chip up to the 10900k has the exact same ipc.,"clock for clock, there's no difference there.","that means that if you're playing a game that only really needs anywhere from 1-4 cores, you gain absolutely nothing going to the top skylake based chip.","having more cores is nice, if you can keep them cool, but they aren't always necessary.",what *is* necessary is ipc gains as that's what really pushes performance forward in gaming.,not every workload can be heavily parallelized to earn effective gains by splitting it over several cores.,"unfortunately, we only really saw one major leap in ipc over the last 7 years, and that's alder lake.","now we're getting 13th gen which is nothing more than a refresh of that now old series, since it's based on the same architecture and manufacturing process.","yeah it clocks higher and that's nice, but i'd rather wait for a new architecture on a new node that will deliver better clock for clock gains in performance and potentially match at least a ryzen x900 in terms of core count (12 big cores is my ideal for a next gen pc upgrade.)","if i'm going to invest damn near $1000 or more into a system upgrade, i'm going to make it count, and i can't do that by buying a refresh of a 1 year old cpu.","i got burned that way with my 7700k, i won't do it again.",i predict 14th gen will do to raptor lake what coffee lake did to kaby lake.,we'll see.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

so i am thinking for just gaming i should prob just leave everything stock and forget about it?,"my 9900k i just checked in cyberpunk is hitting about 108w and 63c... if the 13900k is similar, then i will likely just leave it all alone

iâ€™ll just say that the 13900k has more cores and will definitely be hotter but when gaming 50-75 during gameplay (not loading the game as something like that makes cpu go hotter) is perfectly normal and fine as thatâ€™s what i get.,i get around 65c in warzone which is cpu heavy.,iâ€™d definitely make sure to disable mce if you do and other than that your golden.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the asus ai overclock is actually pretty decent at this point in time.,"it doesn't really give too much voltage if you care about avx2 stability, and will also throttle the cpu if it runs hot.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"overclocking manually is not good advice nowadays, at least with the asus aioc.",the most ideal way of doing things now is to use the ai oc to get a baseline oc and then make very small tweaks from there.,"but current uefis have too many settings that are all interdependent, and its not realistically possible to get a good manual overclock from scratch without rebooting 100+ times and even then you can't account for all the variables.","the traditional advice of manually overclocking is just not the best way of doing things now, with the sophistication of todays chips.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i think you're being power limited.,are both 8pin cpu power cables connected at the top left of the board?,cpu package power should be around 260-270w or beyond depending on your cooling capabilities.,go to the bios and check under extreme tweaker\internal cpu power management the cpu core/cache current limit max.,under it there is a greyed out value that states the current set auto current limit.,is it 511.75 a or lower?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's possible that you wont see issues with the 1720 bios, but for me, it broke several overclocking features.",it prevented the ringbus and igpu overclock settings for example.,"i don't know the full extent of the issues, but as far as i and other can tell, there are problems with it that break some features.","i would just recommend staying on the older, not broken 1601 until asus releases a new version that addresses the problems.","it's possible that if you don't do any overclocking and leave everything at default settings, you *might* not run into any problems with 1720, but i can not say for sure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes both 8pin are connected, and yes the current limit is 511.75a.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also when i try manual/ai oc the voltage and power draw will go up normally (they can go up to 1.4v/250w) so i think there's no hard power limit by the system?,it's just that when using the default stock setting the power and voltage are low.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i feel you brotha.,i have the same issue and still trying to fix it every day for the last 3-4 months.,things i tried mentioned here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/asustuf/comments/nsvl0p/comment/j44nxpu/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/asustuf/comments/nsvl0p/comment/j44nxpu/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i know bro it's really frustrating.,i found a temporary solution to this.,wifi adapter!,"if i am lucky and my laptop's own wifi card works with the wifi card i have incredibly fast internet (190mbs download, 100mbs upload), and if it fails as it always does 15-20 minutes after starting, i have a slower connection but at least i can use my pc and actually connect to internet lol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
someone correct me if i'm wrong but i think vcore is the more accurate reading?,my p-core vids on my 13900kf show a lower voltage than the vcore.,vcore being what i have my voltage manually set to.,but to answer your question i think that's fine.,i'm running my 13900kf at 1.37 (otherwise it's unstable in cinebench at least) and temps are decent for my use case of gaming.,so i think as long as your temps are ok then it's fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whatâ€™s your vcore while running r23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ok, thatâ€™s good to hear.",after 30 minutes of stress testing with occt the max temperature is 80 degrees c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
where is this voltage found?,i keep seeing 1.793 input voltage.,do you guys individually volt each core?,update: in hwinfo pro it says i'm at 1.45 volts... i used auto tune.... is this way too high?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
didn't you hear the new sensation thats sweeping the nation?,"it's out to oc 13th gen, since they are already so high by default.",undervolting is the new cool thing to do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1.261v with loadline calibration of 5. lower voltages cause system instability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if i lower the voltage it crashes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
under 1.3v under load and you should be good to go.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ouh?,"i wish i knew where to even begin since for some reason i seem to pick the mainboards with the most confusing bios ever... but your voltages look similar to mine, i didnt use cinebench, but just in idle the vcore jumps around between below 1v and above 1.3v

but i did limit my wattage to 125w and disabled intel turbo boost 3.0",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you should've gone with the ax210 instead of the ax211.,"the former is a full standalone card and will work on virtually any laptop with an a or e keyed m.2 slot, while the latter is a cnvi module (essentially a dumb card carrying only the rf transceiver), so it relies on silicon from the laptop's chipset in order to work, which in your case definitely lacks wi-fi 6/6e support...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i tought it would work the gaming 3i was delivered with a ax201 too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ax201 still is a dual band card (2.4 ghz / 5 ghz).,ax211 introduces a whole new frequency band (6 ghz) so it requires more than just a new rf transceiver (essentially what's in the cnvi module) to work...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes but i thought, that when i have a cnvio2 port, that i can use it.","it was very interesting to see that windows had bluetooth drivers that did not work, and it installed the wireless drivers but with error code 10",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the connector type does not determine pch support.,"despite what you might read, the ax211 is only compatible with 12th gen+ (it was released in 2021 alongside alder lake), and not 10th or 11th gen. the ax201 is compatible with 10th gen+.",you should purchase the pcie-based ax210 to avoid this issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ill just say 13th gen definitely utilizes ddr5 better than ddr4.,if you want to unlock the full potential of 13th gen id definitely recommend ddr5.,if your budget restricted stick to ddr4 now but upgrade later.,if your buying a new mobo for 13th gen then just get ddr5 now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i don't really see the point in having z790 boards with ddr4 unless intel plans to discontinue z690 soon and keep the ram option open for people who upgrade.,"ddr4 makes more since with the mid-range b760, but not so much for the high-end z790 since ddr5 prices have gone down and these boards can take better advantage of higher speed ddr5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"given all the problems the 13th gen has at the moment (you'll know if you watch oc forums), a tight ddr4 setup is miles ahead of performance, especially than gaming, than any ddr5 setup.",if you want to beat a tight ddr4 4600mhz setup you need ddr5 8000+,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

a decent ddr5 kit is much faster than generic ddr4 3200-cl16.,"itâ€™s true you can match ddr5 performance with highly tuned ddr4 samsung b die but these kits are much more expensive than ddr5 kits, and itâ€™s not a fair comparison at all as ddr5 can also be tuned in a similar way.",overall ddr5 is a better value.,see this: https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/y5u283/is_ddr5_worth_it/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

in ray tracing games ddr5 is 10% faster on avg over ddr4 eqaluvent cpus.,"but ddr5cost a lot more than ddr4, money is better spent on gpu, as we are talking about 150-200$ difference for equal amount of ram and 3600cl16 vs 6000cl32  to be even worth going to ddr5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"you have no idea, sorry.",just read around on oc forums.,lots of issues with ddr5 and 13th gen at the moment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the ddr4 in this comparison has some mighty tight timingsâ€¦like legit tight

keep in mind with this comparison that the ddr4 setup costs \~$100 more than the ddr5 setup.,both the mobo and the memory kit cost more.,and from what i understand the 36-36-36-36 ddr5 is not the way to go.,"you can get 30-40-40-40 for almost the same price, and i imagine you'll see better results with the lower latency.",to have to spend 20-25% more on older technology to achieve parity (or slight improvement in lows) against a not particularly good example of the ddr5?,"yeah, there's a clear winner there, and it isn't ddr4.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

those are cpu benchmarks to highlight cpu bottlenecks.,"unless you require 120fps+, the numbers are basically worthless.","at normal resolution/quality/gpu+cpu combinations, you aren't getting 11-15% difference.",you'd be lucky to see 5%.,most gamers consider 100fps (with 80fps 1% low) smooth enough and will push higher quality at that point instead of wasting power on more fps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

he is running gear 2 as can be seen in cpu-z mem controller freq.,so ds,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do take in consideration that the ddr4 is also running in gear 2. memory controller frequency is 1000 vs 2000 for the ram.,"at least they tried, but it seems that no tech review site still knows about gears.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

> to have to spend 20-25% more on older technology to achieve **parity** (or slight improvement in lows) against a not particularly good example of the ddr5?,"yeah, **there's a clear winner there**, and it isn't ddr4.",there is no evidence that lower speed ddr4 would perform significantly worse.,"you cannot say these speeds are necessary for parity, as there isn't evidence to draw that conclusion.",nor can you say there is a clear winner.,all you can really say is the comparison in this article is largely useless.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"well, for people who already have a good samsung b-die kit like myself.",i have a 3600mhz cl16-16-16 kit from 2 years ago.,i probably wouldn't sell my kit for $150 on the used market and try to buy a 6000mhz 36-36-36 ddr5 kit for 230ish if results are similar.,it's just different scenarios for everyone.,i will probably keep on using the ddr4 kit til a better ddr5 kit with greater pricing comes out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same question?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well from looking at multipile reviews (ltt, pc centric, gn, tomshardware, computerbase), it's specificity for 1080p and 1440p, at high/ultra settings with ray tracing enabled.",it's due to ram bandwidth at those higher settings.,it's up to 20% faster vs 3600cl16 and on avg 10%.,with ddr4 4000cl16 b-die difference could be smaller.,like said at 4k no difference and it just that cost is too much for improvements it bring at the moment.,but if anyone can manage to grab ddr5 6000cl32 or higher platform for cost simlar to ddr4 platform.,then going with ddr5 is an obvious choice.,personally i run 5800x3d at uw1440p.,"its best ddr4 gaming chip for me, as a simracer, mmo gamer and competetive gamer.","the 13600k is as fast on avg., but then it losses massively in those genres i specified and it also has 2 more big cores.","which will be helpful, when i keep it as my 2nd pc in family house.","will be upgrading to zen 4 v cache or zen 5 v cache, depending on ddr5 and am5 prices.","i got b550 in q4 2021 at a bargain and 5800x3d too, very happy with the purchase.",only other chip i would think of swapping it too would be another v cache chip for gaming or for people who dabble with content creation mt wewpon like 13700k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

and primary timings for ddr5 have little to no perforce uplift to your ram its just about subs and frequency and a sk hynix kit  the equivalent of bdie ddr4 clocks highest with lowest subs.,"and corsair just announced there new dimms aswell i thinks team group has at least one high binned kit announced aswell

if your talking specifically about gaming then its in the 1% and .1% lows in games.,if your on a higher resolution like 1440p and 4k then yeah obviously the difference is minimal as your gpu bound instead of cpu bound lol....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"no gear is not an xmp value, its independent of of that.","so when you set xmp 4000 which is what all the review sites do, it defaults to gear 2. you have to manually overclock the ram for gear 1 and to find the highest speed your cpu can manage.","i'm currently running 4800cl17 g2 instead as my g1 only goes up to 3800 and i have a 4400cl19 kit, and at 4k it doesn't make much if any difference anyway so i prefer the bandwidth over the latency.",i'll try again for g1 when i get a 13900k.,"i get 73k bandwidth, 53ns latency at 4800, but correct g1 settings are still 59k bandwidth and under 45ns latency.","for 99% of gaming, the latency is all that matters.",only game that prefers bandwidth so far is spiderman.,"no ddr5 setup i've seen on ocnet is yet able to hit sub 45ns latency, the lowest on the highest ddr5 oc and tuned timings is still about 48ns, and thats a single case.","most ddr5 latency is around the same or higher than my 4800cl17, because the timings on 4800+ ddr4 are a lot better.",the reason why latency matters is 0.1 and 1% lows.,"the lower the latency, the higher the minimum fps.",it doesnt matter if maximum fps is 200 if minimum is spiking to 30.,150 max and 40 minimum is still better for less lag and stutter.,"best way to compare ram is ignore maximum and average, and only look at 0.1 and 1% lows.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
some great info and thanks for elaborating on your other post with an edit.,"im hoping i will be able to enable xmp1 which is 4000 16 16 16 as well as set the memory controller to gear1 and not need to tweak anything else

have you seen anything on 13600k and 4000 gear 1 results?",do you think i might need to increase the timings after enabling xmp and gear1 or do you have no idea at this point?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah on paper but real world tasks dont really end up doing that like your implying, so say it did drop to 30 and the lows were what you say they ar this would not really happen much like almost not at all  average frames it will lose period and in workstations as well obviously with how much more data transfer ddr5 has.",every one cant wait to get new amd or intel cpus same with the gpus but the component that is also the next generation and an important one if your cores getting info quickly which leads to better performance everywhere no mater gaming or workstation applications all of a sudden its opposite day current cpus are slower than all of the ones that have been around 5-7 yeas about as old as ddr4 same with the gpus does that make sense well bout as much as most things now days or what i call ass backwards,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the other p-cores have to be below an activity threshold which makes hitting 5.8 a pain in the ass on a non-benchmarking system when a bunch of os tasks decides they want p-cores since you aren't using them.,"if you're willing to sacrifice some efficiency, set 1-4 cores to 58x, 5-8 cores to 55x, and then set the specific p-core multis to 58x for two cores and 55x for the other six.",the two other cores will be running 5.5 at higher than needed voltages but you get your 5.8 a lot more reliably.,you want the 58x p-cores to be on the starred cores so windows schedules onto them first.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

intel themselves state that the maximum resolution over hdmi is 4k @ 60hz.,dp is needed for higher.,"the fact that it works on linux is because the linux driver is using reduced chroma subsampling (4:2:0 instead of 4:4:4) to lower the required bandwidth, which the windows driver does not seem to support.","i donâ€™t know if it can be forced, but that can be what you look for next.","intelâ€™s hdmi implementation is only hdmi 2.0, not hdmi 2.1, meaning it supports a maximum of 18gbps bandwidth.","if we do the math:

3840x2160 @ 60hz 8-bit 4:4:4 = 17.82gbps
3840x2160 @ 120hz 8-bit 4:4:4 = 32.08gbps
3840x2160 @ 120hz 8-bit 4:2:0 = 17.82gbps

so without reduced chroma subsampling, 120hz is impossible.",one workaround if you really must have 120hz without buying a gpu is to buy a dp to hdmi 2.1 adapter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably need to somehow force 4:2:0 chroma,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"**for anyone with this problem in future:**

it's the display that needs to have hdmi 2.1 to work with g-sync.,"my tv supports that, and g-sync is enabled and working with my 2070.  the problem is that the 16/20 series nvidia gpus only had hdmi 2.0b, meaning i can't do 4k@120hz; i'm limited to 4k/60hz.","i could drop the resolution and get 120hz, but for 4k@120hz over hdmi i need a new gpu.","my gpu does have displayport 1.4, which has enough bandwidth to run 4k/120hz, but dp 1.4 to hdmi 2.1 converters don't work with vrr (based on what i've read).","so my choices with my current gpu are 4k/60hz with g-sync (via hdmi) or 4k/120hz without g-sync (via dp to hdmi converter), unless i want to drop the resolution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that's interesting.,could you elaborate more on the performance hit and some temp numbers ?,i'm confused because i'm running 13600k with a good 240mm aio on the msi z790 mobo and after just 3 minutes in cinebench i'm hitting 97 degrees and power meter indicating 335w from the socket.,my case is brand new with good airflow- be quiet 500dx.,intel was saying that max tdp will be at 181 w,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on the task.,"multi threaded tasks perform about 20-25% slower, but use about 180% less energy!",single threaded tasks and tasks that don't utilize all threads (like gaming) perform identically.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">just 3 minutes in cinebench i'm hitting 97 degrees and power meter indicating 335w from the socket

335w is way too high for 13600k unless you're overclocking and/or setting an llc that's pushing too much voltage or something.","msi boards are known for having excessively high voltages under stock configs, but my 13700k is on an msi z790 and it only wanted \~255w out of the box in cinebench (with power limits disabled and only the slightest thermal throttling on my d15, just randomly dropping multipliers by 1x)

i'd start by grabbing hwinfo (latest beta 7.31) if you don't have it and going to sensors, check the vcore voltage while running cinebench (not core vid, but actual ""vcore"" under the motherboard heading in the long list of sensors).",my experience with this bios so far has been buggy in terms of voltage behavior.,could be worth doing a reset to defaults and just turning on xmp to see how it behaves with no tweaking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"there are a lot of reasons as to why, but the important part is that the core temp variation you are seeing is normal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i understand that, but the max temperature difference is about 10â°c, that difference is kinda large",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the perceptive of ""large"" is arbitrary.",the processor doesn't care about a gap where one process is cooler.,it will perform just fine.,you only run into problems when there is a core being a higher temp.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i was running cinnabench, and no matter how long i run, p-core 1 always have the lowest core temp",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then that's likely your highest quality core.,there will always been some cores that run cooler.,and up to 12 degrees or so difference is perfectly normal.,"if, on the other hand, you have a single core that runs 12 degrees hotter, then that's an issue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"psa to anyone who doesnâ€™t know but dxvk works on windows with any gpu (with vulkan support) but itâ€™s generally not worth using as native api/drivers perform better (except on arc of course, hence why theyâ€™re using it.)",edit: seen a lot of its better for amd comments.,that is very true as amd drivers are not good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is wonderful!,but i with intel would step in and contribute with code or money to dxvk.,"last time i heard that intel is a huge company, even compared to amd.",i'm sure that they have some money to spare to invest into this wonderful projects that benefits them too.,"as a both linux and intel user, i would be very happy about that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"hopefully windows can get some work done too if intel joins in, currently the developers will not work on issues reported from windows installs as far as i know.",that sucks cause a lot of games on windows get improvements from using it.,"i do understand that the main goal is linux though and all power to the developers, great work they're doing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, i'm honestly looking forward to the next set of $intc earnings for gross sales numbers if they touch on discrete gpu production.",i genuinely want them to succeed.,not just value oriented but to at least be another contender in the gpu market.,the end-user could be highly benefitted with multiple players in the field.,just like how amd made intel pucker a bit with their lax development from their cpu side.,look at what's on the horizon finally from intel's fab development.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"it's good for amd too, i don't remember if they improved their dx9 drivers or not but dx9 performance used to be awful on amd cards, so much that i switched from a 1050 ti to a 5500 xt (which is like 85% faster if i recall correctly), yet in one dx9 game i used to play a lot (a hat in time), the 1050 ti was actually faster and by a lot.","i ended up trying dxvk and it gave me a massive performance boost, something like 80% more performance or so.","i have also seen people reporting that dxvk improves performance on some dx11 games for amd cards, but that was before they improved their dx11 drivers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"amd gpus and nvidia still get some better perf with dxvk, specifically on some older titles.","amd also just has better perf for me on anything dx11 and older, but i don't know if that's still the case on anything newer than polaris.",dxvk also seems to be known for fixing some stutter on native windows.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

dxvk is a dx9 / dx11 to vulkan translation layer that is commonly used in scenarios such as linux.,intel is now using it for their windows driver.,"performance diff to ""native"" dx9 of a refined driver is generally negligible",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't know if you're serious?,"gta 6 will almost certainly use dx12 or vulkan, dxvk is a translation layer for older dx apis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
from what i understand intel arc doesn't do dx9 natively and runs all dx9 through some sort of translation layer.,but i might be misunderstanding what you are saying.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is no native d3d9 driver.,they relied on the d3d9on12 wrapper before.,"one existed from the pre-arc days but it probably didn't even work on the new architecture, and their dev effort went elsewhere.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'd love for intel to fully embrace the linux side of things with their gpus, as it sucked being limited to just amd for good compatibility which are subpar offerings imo.","hopefully it puts pressure on nvidia to focus on the desktop side of that sector, and/or atleast have another card maker providing quality compatible tech (if intel makes it that far in their journey).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i sure hope so,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i imagine their development resources are currently stretched a bit thin, hopefully once things settle down a bit more contributions will start rolling in.","[intel has already contributed immensely to the open-source graphics community](https://www.reddit.com/r/intel/comments/zf0ns3/comment/izd8a8i/), so even if the contributions to dxvk in particular are a bit thin, it's all still cool in my book.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just finished a play through of gta4 last month and for me using dxvk offered no advantage so i ended up switching back to dx.,edit: thatâ€™s actually how i know about dxvk working on windows.,saw it on the pc gaming wiki for gta4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> gta 4, without it the game it's a stuttering mess but if you use it the game will run locked on 60 fps and beyond

does it actually make gta iv playable?!","i've wanted to play it many times, i've heard the story is good, but i just couldn't stomach the framerate dips and never finished playing it because of how badly it performed on pc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cool ty,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in a recent blog post about the dx9 perf uplift intel said: ""we use a hybrid approach, i.e., a combination of api techniques, to take advantage of translation layers when a better experience can be delivered using one of our more modern api implementations.",these improvements will be delivered transparently to the end user through our normal driver distribution process.,"thedetails of this implementation may change over time as our dx9 driver evolves. ""","this sounds to me like they use a native driver,and then use an emulation layer  in situations when it can outperform their native driver,and according to op,they switched to dxvk for an emulation layer from d3d9on12(which comes bundled into windows)  
edit: it was thought intel was using a custom vended d3d9on12 in addition to dxvk but uggh : [https://twitter.com/mumeisaba555/status/1600796689836953601](https://twitter.com/mumeisaba555/status/1600796689836953601)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

intel already heavily invests into the linux drivers.,"in fact, much of the core of mesa (the opengl/vulkan drivers on linux) was created by people working for intel.","[nir, the internal format used by all mesa drivers, was created by intel employees.",](https://www.jlekstrand.net/jason/blog/2022/01/in-defense-of-nir/)  radv (the amd vulkan driver) was based off of anv (the intel vulkan driver).,"given mesa's architecture that emphasizes code sharing between all the drivers, intel's development efforts have substantially impacted every single driver, from intel/amd/nvidia vulkan/opengl drivers, all the way down to opengl(es) drivers for various arm socs.",the linux graphics world owes a lot to intel's development.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm playing it on my legion 7i laptop and the fps never dip below 110,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in fact, sometimes dxvk is even faster/better than fully native dx9/10/11 drivers (gta iv is a good example of this).",dxvk is definitely way better than the microsoft-provided d3d9on12 translation layer that intel was using exclusively before.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how would they decide which one to use though?,"is it a per game basis, or decided at runtime.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why is d3d9on12 so slow?,how can it be slower than vulkan?,also kind of weird that intel is still going to make a dx9 driver anyways.,nowadays there are translation layers to vulkan everything.,"you have dxvk for dx9,10 and 11, vkd3d for dx12 and zink for opengl.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the deets!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and they have to optimise for every single game that has ever existed.,it's not a feasible task.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
per game basis.,"popular games get the work first, makes sense",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my guess is this is a matter of priorities.,"microsoft in theory should have the advantage, considering they made directx, while the dxvk project basically had to reverse-engineer it.",d3d9on12 is developed by microsoft as basically life-support for older games on windows.,"i believe they do not have much incentive for improving legacy support, as they are pushing for buying/playing new dx12 games.",dxvk is in contrast an important project for running games on alternative platforms that support vulkan only.,"dxvk is open-source and made by independent community developers and business backed ones (notably valves)

perhaps intel might benefit from adopting dxvk for most dx10 and dx11 games too.",as for dx12 intels driver seems to be okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>why is d3d9on12 so slow?,slow is the least of its problems.,the compatibility is not good.,it's on github.,go look at the commit history.,it's barely seen any work.,dxvk on the other hand has had a ton of work put into it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah per game basis definitely seems to be the case considering what the team has talked about in prior videos and putting such an emphasis on csgo in this one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
d3d9on12 is also open source.,mit licensed.,it's on github.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep.,"every game uses the apis different when you're talking about older ones like dx9, apparently.",so they can't just go and do a base line optimization.,"and it's not like they only did one or two at a time, either.","they showed what looked like over a dozen, including league of legends.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"technically true, but it's only really developed by ms.  dxvk is funded by valve but also sees significant community contributions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
also since it's part of the driver you don't have to worry about games detecting dxvk as a potential cheat and banning you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the green oem pcbs run easily at 7400 cl32 1.47v on my dark with 12900ks.,"13th gen should be easier since it's said to have an improved imc, so i expect higher clocks.",the teamgroups i've had just a couple of hours and so far i'm only able to get 7400 cl34 stable which is still fast for ddr5 but not as good as the oem green sticks thus far.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you have raptor lake you can overclock m-die to 7200c32.,i use the 6400c32 kit to do it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

any oc update?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i just bought my 13700k today.,should arrive by the weekend.,currently on 10700k and it definitely bottlenecks my 3080 12gb at 1440p.,with dlss set to quality it's just under 1080p native so i guess i will see a big performance jump.,i went with ddr5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not really a fair comparison when your gpu is different every time you run the benchmark.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
went from i5-6600 to i5-13600k and difference **it's huge** (that's what she said).,:p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for gaming this raw performance doesn't matter as much though.,my old i7 2600k ran everything fine for like 12 years and only with the most recent most demanding titles did it start to struggle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just switched from ryzen 5 1600 to 12700kf after five years.,benchmarks show x2 improvement in single core and x3 improvement in multi-core.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
has anyone seen any benchmarks going from a lower cpu to a higher one in high resolutions such as 6k/8k?,"i've seen that the 4090 is bottlenecked in some titles at 4k but that's not really helpful to me since i run only vr games, at 6240x3120 resolution.",would like to know if i need a new cpu or not if i get a 4090 (i have an 8700k).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have a 9900kf, you think it it time upgrade?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"hi, which games do you play?",because i went from 9900k 5 ghz 3600 c16 to 13900k 5.7 all cores 7200 mhz ram but not so much difference with my 3080 strix oc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
interesting.,"i also game at 1440p, have a 10700k, and was thinking about getting a 13600k.",the only difference being i've got a 3070ti and not a 3080.  did you go with a ddr4 or ddr5 build and what games do you play?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you'll see some uplift but the most consistent improvement is always 1-5% lows in most cases.,"i'm running my rtx 4090 with my i9-10850k and since i'm gaming at 4k, most benchmarks aren't *too* far off of what they'd with a newer cpu but that's in average fps.",the lows can easily be doubled with a newer cpu which makes the gameplay experience much more enjoyable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sob... i knew my 10700k was bottlenecking my 3080. i upgraded from a 1080 and it still felt like something was off.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes if you have the money,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"csgo is very cpu intensive, so youâ€™ll see an impact.",in heavy gpu games youâ€™ll probably see a bottleneck.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you see a big difference?,"i'm still on a 9900k platform with a 3090 and thinking of a cpu+mobo+memory upgrade, just not sure if it's worth it yet.",probably going to skip  the 40xx series gpus unless they go on a fire sale.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

tech power up has never steered me wrong.,they are showing a 13.5% difference relative performance at 1440p between stock 10700k vs 13900k.,this build uses ddr5 @ 7400mhz on a z790 and an evga 3080 ftw3.,my 9900k (effectively a 10700k) is not at stock 5.05ghz all core with 3232mhz ddr3).,i do not suspect it's holding my 3080ti back so much that a 10% difference in performance is going to affect it.,"https://www.techpowerup.com/review/intel-core-i9-13900k/19.html

perhaps someone has a pcie generational comparison that can convince me there is more to gain?","i have no plans on upgrading, but i'm fortunate enough to have money to do so if there is something there.",hell the thing that has gotten me closer to upgrading is storage more than anything else but i have a 980pro gen 4 in both my x15r2 and my lemur pro and neither feel faster than my desktop (they both feel slower actually).,convince me!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i went from a 5ghz 9900k on ddr4 4000 (nothing special, just hynix) to a 13700k on ddr5 6400 cl32 and feel like it was a noticeable upgrade, granted i'm using a 3090. somewhat boosted my max fps but really feeling it on the dips and 1% lows, where it stays a ton more consistent at a higher frame rate than before.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for budget reasons i went with z690 mobo that only accepts ddr4.,"i think i maybe missing about another 10% if i did go with ddr5, but i would end up spending more.","the games that were giving me the most bottleneck was, spiderman, forza 5, farcry 6 and a bit of a bottleneck with cyberpunk.",overall you will be happy with the upgrade if you were to go with the 13600k route.,i mean i ended up with a high end system at a budget price.,it is neck and neck with the 12900k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"respectfully, i donâ€™t think thatâ€™s worth it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bottleneck was pcie3.0 lanes.,3070ti uses pcie4.0 but still doesn't really need it since the max memory that 3.0 reach is 32gb/s.,3080 would push that above with pcie4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is debatably the future of graphics architecture.,"expose your gpu raw to new protocols (dx12, vulkan) and leave it to shims (dxvk, d9vk, whatever) to translate older protocols.","drivers get to stay light (a pure vulkan driver is basically a gpu shim), performance stays high (see steam deck), etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is what i've been saying amd should be doing for their gpus for years.,they also have abysmal dx9 implementations and translation layers to newer apis is the least fragmented solution to provide consistent results.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
technically this is the right move.,but in the marketplace they just ended the platform.,adding translation bloat to an already hobbled architecture it's a solution.,they will not be able to compete.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

is that bad?,"i mean, for the 10 or so people still enjoying dx9 titles it sucks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah plenty of older games run better with dxvk than native dx9.,if translation layer prove to be faster why bother running it natively.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the alternative is hand coding pseudo-apis for hundreds or thousands of dx9 titles.,this is way better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that's not how dxvk works.,dxvk is not an end user api that programmers can use to write games for.,it's a translation layer.,"dxvk that is installed on your os translates directx 9/10/11 runtime code into equivalent vulkan runtime code, and then this vulkan code is read by the vulkan driver installed on your os that your gpu is using.","you can not just directly make your gpu compatible for dxvk without using dx9/10/11, that's nonsense.",dxvk is a middle level layer.,you will have to firstly make your gpu compatible for dx9/10/11 by providing dx9/10/11 support from your graphics driver's side.,when any application that has been written to use dx9/10/11 is executed read-the-previous-paragraph.,"intel had two options: 
1) go write millions of lines for that outdated dx9 api for their new arc gpu's driver in these modern time when nobody even writes their games for native dx9.","or

why go through two emulation layers (d3d9 > dx12 > vulkan) when you could cut out the middle man and just go directly d3d9 > vulkan with dxvk?",you say d3d9on12 and dxvk are fundamentally different but i'm failing to see how.,"ultimately, they both translate d3d9 calls to the equivalents for either d3d12 or vulkan.","you say right here:

it is a little different.,"this implements the d3d9 ddi using d3d12, which preserves the d3d9 system library.",dxvk replaces that system library.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"you make sense here when you talk about vulkan support on arc on linux, but you forgot a little but very important thing, that this isn't just about linux where dxvk and vkd3d is obviously the main thing these days for linux gamers, you have to account for 98%+ gaming market and that is windows.",dxvk is such a niche thing on windows world that at least more than 99% windows users don't know or care to download dxvk on windows.,you do realise that vulkan is not a primary api on windows os.,"the saddest thing is somehow most game developers are not writing games for vulkan, they are writing it for garbage like dx12.","again, you have to understand, that, for dx9 games to run natively on windows on arc gpus without having the 99.99% of customers to go download dxvk, intel needed to make driver code for dx9, writing drivers for dx9 stack is exactly what intel appears to be refraining themselves because they find it too cumbersome to allocate time for such an old api in the fastest moving market like gaming technology.",intel can't rely on dxvk on windows for dx9 because most customers are not going to download dxvk on windows.,it's simple.,they chose d3d9on12 because it's closest thing to dx12  that allows dx9 execution.,and dx12 is the main api on windows.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they are dropping ""direct"" support for dx9, but whatever is based on that api will still be compatible nonetheless.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

for most amd cards dxvk performs better and with asynchronous shader compilation some people use it in games with shader stutter to eliminate it completely.,i use it in arkham knight because for some reason it runs 10-15 frames faster than dx11 and has better frame pacing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"because that's exactly the difference between *support* and ""it might work idk we're not involved"".","the way the announcement reads, it's ""intel is completely dropping support, but hey there may be a workaround"".","not ""intel is dropping hardware support for dx9 and will be instead using a translation layer *to support* dx9 games"".","no ""we will be working with microsoft"" either.","they're just dropping support, and that's all there is to it.",something that everyone who rushed to downvote me seems to have missed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
may be they thought maintaining coding conventions specific to d3d12 api with its compatibility layer like d3d9on12 would be more convenient in long term.,with that mindset they would need to maintain only two apis - dx12(with 9on12 as subproject) and vulkan.,i think there could be business and political reasons for that decision too.,"my gut feeling has always been that microsoft in their heart just hate projects like dxvk, they just don't show that in public.","it makes perfect sense too to my mind, just within last 3 years the number of linux gamers have doubled according to steam survey (yes it's just within 2% but it's more than significantly bigger number than what it was say 5 years ago).",projects like dxvk and vkd3d is the biggest danger to microsoft in terms of attracting pc gamers.,i think intel supporting dxvk could have created cold war/poison their relationship with microsoft with the whole whql certification bs.,but now i am going from speculation to conspiracy theory mode lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"this whole time i've been wondering why the keys aren't made available earlier, so that we could have had extra access to the beta/campaign/preload

now i have that question even more, as waiting till the full game releases has overloaded everything",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they don't care... let's be ready to play for the holidays... poor joke - intel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
out of codes all the time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
finally!!,after trying the entire day got it redeemed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've got the redeem button like 30 times now and keep getting the out of stock message.,seems like some accounts are bugged or something.,very frustrating,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hang on got site maintenance again ðÿ˜„ðÿ˜„,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"maintenance again, its 3.30 am here now

"post title should read ""not redeemable""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
finally managed to redeem at 21:57 bst - 16 hours after release.,first world problem i suppose but still a crap showing from team blue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've linked my account.,"i've gotten the ""redeem"" button a couple times, but clicking it did not add the game to my account.","now, in place of the redeem button, it just says ""an error occurred while attempting to add the item to your account, please try again later.""",fml.,any suggestions guys?,edit: has anybody had success unlinking it on the battle.net end and doing everything over?,"might be what i need to do, but i'm hesitant because every step so far has been broken in some way...

edit 2: removing the link and starting over seemed to do the trick!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh my god!!!,"i have gotten the ""redeem"" button about 20-25 times, but every time i click it, it just disappears and then i have to click the ""here"" button for [battle.net](https://battle.net) which i have already done...

then the ""ref 002"" error keeps popping up.","this is just stupid, there is no reason the ""key generator"" or whatever they are using should be this broken, especially since were a little over 4 hours from it being live for 24 hours.",this is beyond frustrating.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah been trying for more than 24 hours after buying the cpu with the offer for a copy of mw2 2 months ago.,not that it was bad enough that we didn't get access to the campaign like everyone else a week ago but now you cant even access your copy on the 28th like it says .,iv been dealing with pages not loading and various errors since midnight on the 27th .,its shameful.,if intel had half a brain they would of just given us a code to download directly from [battle.net](https://battle.net) app directly a week ago .,un f%$king believable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you intel for wasting my time :))))),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"eu here and the site [softwareoffer.intel.com](https://softwareoffer.intel.com) doesn't even work, i tried to open dashboard and it says download your copy of mw2 but that's it, no link no nothing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this is ridiculous, no codes, servers down.",intel are so stupid that they didnâ€™t reserve the codes for people who have entered the master key.,so on launch they would be released to everyone.,instead of putting up codes and itâ€™s every man for themselves,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all i want is this game bro why they making it so hard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the site is down for scheduled maintenance.,"hmm, i sense a lie in the scheduled part",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this is some kind of joke on their part, they knew how many keys they would have to spend and they didn't do anything to make it go smoothly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
site is back online.,can click on the redeem button but still out of codes message.,this is really getting on my nerves now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that amazing that a billion compagny in 2022 can do a site properly since 7am the site is down , there is no key etc... what are they doing looks like the fact that they don't care about the customer is true.",that amazing that a compagny can do something properly in this year...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can anyone help????,it says my items has been successfully redeemed after linking my battlenet account and its not even in my battlent account.,i did this over 8 hours ago.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so i can multiple time go to the final page where you can click en ""here"" but when i click it , it just got me back to the page where you can acces to your bundle w t f",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i clicked the final ""redeem now"" button, which immediately disappeared, but the game was not added to my battle net account.",what now?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18 hours since first trying and the site is even more broken than ever.,thanks intel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oops something went wrong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
edit: i recommend doing this on a computer.,"use multiple tabs, open any new link in a new tab and just refresh that tab if it fails.","eventually you should get a ""redeem"" button like i just did.","now just 62gb download through shitty comcast...

so the site is back up, but can't redeem a code.",the page is literally empty.,makes me regret not sticking with amd.,"i could have gotten a comparable cpu for cheaper, and used the savings to buy this game outright, and i would have been playing days ago.",i'm not sure why the keys weren't available days/weeks ago.,"this is just terribly managed, and i'm leaning back towards amd for my next build.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
finally got it!,us 4:35pm pt.,"once i got to the page that actually showed the games available in my bundle i didn't click the mwii link, instead i right clicked it and kept opening fresh tabs until one loaded and was able to link/redeem.","many, many errors and timeouts but this is what finally worked for me.",frustrating experience... hope everyone can get their copies soon!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no codes available yeah thatâ€™s some bs, like fix this right now cause i know for sure iâ€™m never gonna be waiting for something like this ever again shouldâ€™ve just bought the game",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"redeem button shows consistently, but keep getting ""ref.",002: an error has occurred.,"please contact customer support for assistance.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"really easy to tell these guys donâ€™t have the right people to get this fixed like come on this couldâ€™ve been avoided so easily but just emailing the damn codes when the game release simple, like you have a bunch of traffic on your website that you cannot handle which is why all this is happening",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
apparently the maintenance will last for 4 hours,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think this is not the first time they did this, i remember they have gave the free bundle of some other games three years ago, and they also ran out of codes and website issues in the first few days, but eventually everyone got their code.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"update: maintenance will finish â€œvery very soonâ€

as in terms, perhaps 30 minutes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
great success just now!,"downloading on battle.net, just 4 hours to go now ðÿ˜‚ðÿ˜­ðÿ˜‚",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"no clue how, but i clicked the redeem button hours ago.",i haven't seen the redeem button since.,just checked my battle net app (after checking over and over) and it is randomly letting me download.,this has been a sh\*t show,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gonna switch to amd next time i guess,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"can we talk about the loading times btw..... takes 20 mins for each page to load, would expect better considering they are intel....",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they better be working on this still idc, they said we would get the codes at launch so much for that iâ€™m sick of trying to access the website when everyone is trying to do the same",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the worst part is they can't say they didnt realize how many of us would be trying to get our codes at once.. they should have sent them out.,"in 2022, this should never be a problem.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i've been at this for days now still getting error after error site down after site down when will the suffering cease?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well they finally decided to respond this time not asking for proof but saying they fixed the issue and they combined all of my 15 tickets into one lol and then i went on to blizzard's website and i could not see my purchase and then i logged out and logged back in and now i'm installing modern warfare 2 it literally takes them responding to your ticket before the problem can be fixed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i suppose it's always something but now that it's finally downloading they got it downloading at 60 mb a second instead of $780 which i am capable of lol this is going to take a while,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
got an email back from them saying its fixed after i provided proof but i still cant download and its been 6 hours since they emailed me saying its fixed.,im still getting ref 002 error,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ref 002 error finally resolved for me.,i opened 2 tickets and sent a dm on twitter to intelgaming.,i included a pic of my original receipt and the email with the master key as proof of legit purchase.,thanks to everyone on here trying to give tips/advice on here.,"it kept me sane knowing other people were going through my same frustrations, and were also equally stubborn to wait it out to get the game we were promised.",good luck to all those waiting!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hello guys,   
i was getting ref002 error for 3 days.","when i tried again today ""battle.net error occurred.","please contact customer support.""",i started getting the error.,i've never had this error before.,has anyone encountered this error before?,how can i find a solution?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have had the issue now for 5 days.,intels website says its been redeemed and added to battlenet however it has not shown up in battlenet.,"i have downloaded the battlenet app, i confirmed a phone number is added to battlenet.",i have relinked intel with battlenet.,i have tried every single troubleshooting option.,emailed intel 5 days ago with my purchase receipt but keep getting standard faq/troubleshooting options i have already told them ive gone through.,genuinely the worst experience i have ever dealt with... any other ideas?,intelgaming on twitter has told me to just use the support ticket... which is what i have done for 5 days.,i have tried messaging intel employees that have replied to other tickets on reddit.,"&#x200b;

if another intel employee sees this please have my ticket expedited, i am tired of waiting 2 days for a response just to get another copy and paste troubleshooting answer i have already told you i have used

"iv got 002

ref.",002: an error has occurred.,please contact customer support for assistance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
any idea on what these ref.00x codes mean?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you pointed into their own faq where it says once master key received no proof of purchase required.,do they really want another thousands of opened tickets?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you provide proof of purchase?,beacuse everyone who bought the master key from ebay don't get a response,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what browser did you use ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at the time of 1st mw2 beta i didnt get a code for the whole beta uptime so lads im real fuckin close to just buying the game.,fuck intel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

jealous!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
still not sure whether the problem is with intel or [battle.net](https://battle.net),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i believe it was only arc, 11th gen, 12th gen, and laptops with 11 and 12th gen",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"redeeming master key is only step 1, now you need to link your battle.net account, then redeem code, then download

most of us are stuck after step 1",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what page were you refreshing?,"this is where i'm stuck now, too, but the redirect keeps taking me back to my dashboard

edit: this worked!","great tip, thank you!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hi mate, i did also see some comments saying the same thing last night youâ€™re not alone donâ€™t worry",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
now it's telling me they're out of codes.. you must've gotten the last one haha,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you just keep refreshing or what?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
u gonna have to contact intel they are flagging accounts that they think have not bought the product themselves they will not let us redeem the keys unless we really bought the intel product from selected retailer if u dont have evidence forget about it money is lost.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
contact intel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sounds like you never intended to keep it and did it for the free game.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
agreed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"please tell then that better servers wouldâ€™ve solved an issue, suggest them try amd maybe?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you see ref 003 error before you success?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">2th gen only...

i got it with my 11900kf that i bought 3 weeks ago,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"looks like it's 11/12 and arc only at the moment, but surely they'll pull 13th gen in.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lmao wow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i got this screen but nothing shows up in my game library, did you take any extra action?",thanks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i got the website load several times, but when redeem always got out of codes :(",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i have the same issue, no idea what to do.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i get the same screen without having linked battle net even lmao thanks intel i guess,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"mine linked and when i hit redeem it says ""error try again later"".",it's some small comfort i'm not alone in this at least.,edit: i got it boiiisss,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've been staring at that fucking screen for 2 hours refreshing it in 3 different tabs some go to the next stage but most of the time it takes so long to load it just times out.,every company in this stupid offer is about to loose every penny from me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11th+12th gen cpus and arc.,not 13th gen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lmao 502 error now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you also get no codes for a while and then a code apperead or what ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
out of codes bwaaahhhh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
east coast usa no codes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3 to 4 hours and still struggling lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[nope](https://softwareoffer.intel.com/campaign/learnmore/4cd0775b-4ed3-4471-934b-80e2596e1589),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
once i linked it was able to be installed from battlenet for me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the box with the blue border where it says ""how to claim"" this should have a blue ""redeem now"" button at the bottom",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
were you sitting on the blank white screen before the redeem button appeared?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"rough, wonder how they plan to tackle some of the european countries that dont have anything but pre-paid phones...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i cant even redeem it keep saying temporary not available,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
of course there wouldn't have been a problem they would still have codes.,the fact they said to wait till the 28th and the codes come out on the 27th is fucked imo.,i got on the website 5 min after midnight and there all gone.,edit: i want midnight fucking releases again.,why is everything digital its stupid especially with drm.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"https://imgur.com/hf2hnfu

going to keep trying, hopefully get one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, this is bs.",they know how many people registered and could have prepared for this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for the response.,will keep an eye on your site.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
those employees knew exactly how many people would be redeeming codes.,can you please ask whoever is in charge of this if he's enjoying focking everyone?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i had purchased the game on steam but refunded it due to this free copy, but in reality, having it on steam with pre release benefits would have been worth.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, you got focked by intel!",like all the rest of us.,ðÿ˜­,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its better than leaving it broken my dude.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"day 1: huh, the website is down.","thatâ€™s annoying..

day 2: yay, website is up.","but now i got error code, buuu :(

â€¦

day 22; finally, ive reached ref 099, soon now, soooon",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"we're not obligated too, faq says there's no need to show proof of purchase if you provide master key",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
today they wrote back to the email?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bout 10 min ago.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hey folks.,"due to the overwhelming response to our cod campaign, our redemption site is temporarily down.",we are working quickly to resolve and hope to have back up very soon.,thank you for your patience.,we are not running out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bro the website will probably crash again because everyone's waiting lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
keep refreshing eventually you will get it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no words ðÿ˜„,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same here!,"(eu too) trying to refresh the page, and waiting for the magic...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yep, same here.. my day off and no kids either!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
some guy on twitter said.,and everyone else confirmed it.,but i donâ€™t believe it iâ€™m just saying what i know.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was about to do the same thing but figured i'd wait it out.. \*facepalm\*,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its just bs.,a big company like this messing up a deal that was made with a purchase of their products.,"intel sincerely, f\*ck you",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel is a bilinear company but they can't do a site those it look normal to you.,"plus, they had many months to do that...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"out of the few times i managed to get to the ""redeem now"" button, either nothing happened or it said that they were out of codes.",they should've released the codes at least a few days ago given that there are apparently so many people in this campaign.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you get the 003 error before?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is an extremely bad way of treating potential customers intel is not doing themselves any favor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm getting the same thing.,i did manage to get a support ticket sent but i don't expect to hear anything any time soon.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how long till it loads.,been sitting on that blank page for like 30 mins...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i am also close to giving up, i've been trying for 10 hours to redeem.",i have resorted to the 20 open tabs and constantly refreshing but everytime i try and redeem it just says they have no keys.,this is getting beyond a joke.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, i just kept clicking the link to [battle.net](https://battle.net) and it finally redirected me back to intel's site and the button was there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've seen that page like 40 times at this point.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm terrified the deal will be gone because it's 'redeemed', without actually redeeming it :).","get so much errors though, i can't check anything.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i got it bundled with a 10400 from bestbuy for my work pc build and got it downloading now on my gaming pc :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i bought a 13th gen already, any chance they will honor it if pull 13th gen in?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i was also afraid of that based on the comments out there,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"happened to me too, check it on dashboard, its still there, sometimes it shows the not found page.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dropped 2k on a laptop because of the deal what is this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just open your battlenet launcher on your pc.,mine showed up there and not on the webpage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i hope they fix it asap im really worried,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it lists 13th in the eligible skus section on the website.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 i cant even see the bundle yet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no i didn't.,"the steps i did were: click the game bundle, choose cod, click ""here"" to link battlenet to intel account, click the 'redeem the game now' which is the same page where you click ""here"" to link account.","once clicked the redeem button, i noticed that i could download the game on battlenet client.",i juet keep refreshng each paga if it didn't load.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah lol  
i pressed the redeem now button then that out of codes crap showed up again",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
east us just claimed mine 2 minute ago,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it appeared when the page loaded.,just got lucky i guess,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
support wont even email me back,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ive been trying for hours and nothing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i notice opening multiple tabs works sometimes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
got it like 20 times.,"just gotta keep refreshing, itâ€™s annoying asf but it worked for me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wait did you get it from ebay or something??,cuz thatâ€™s where i got mine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've sent them the receipt and code email and no response,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've been trying for 2 hours no luck,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
now the site is down for maintenance !,[gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm here now!,"tried it 5 times already, but everything get the 'oops' page.",how many times you tried?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ive seen this page more than my dad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so why would you return the cpu to the store if the game didn't matter to you?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i can barely load the page, half the time i get a 502 error.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"me neither, it just says the expiration date.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i couldn't see the bundle most of time either.,i just kept refreshing the page if it didn't load.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well after i link account i have to redeem and it says no codes.,f,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
north or south?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"same, trying for the past 5 hours or so and nothing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"too many lol, still no luck.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

same dude what the fuck is happening?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you get it now?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
north or south?,just open 20 pages and wait for a redeem to show up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it will be fixed, but let's face it.",you returned before these issues arrived.,you had no intention of keeping it to begin with.,there is no principle here.,most likely just return fraud at this point.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"same shit here, hope we don't wake up with some no more keys for you to redeem.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i can't even submit a support ticket lol like how the fuck could they not predict this type of traffic today,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no luck yet.,"when i click on the page on my dashboard it just loads a page that says ""download your software"" but nothing else.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol bet lemme try,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
soon as i hit redeem it was on my bnet client,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i get to the bundle expires screen and mw2 doesnt pop up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
get to a bundle expires screen that shows fhe mw2 button.,then smash that bad boy for 20 tabs and keep the ones that actually load into the cod page,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so basically duplicate the tab where mw2 pops up?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1. no one can tell you which boards support 13th gen out of the box because that depends on the date the board was produced.,don't count on this.,"if you want out of the box support, buy z790.",2. any z690 with bios flashback will support 13th gen. look for that on the specs list.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
look for one with usb bios update support.,it's when you can update bios without cpu on it.,"for gigabyte it's called ""q-flash plus update bios without installing the cpu, memory and graphics card""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i just built a 13600k system with this board: [https://pcpartpicker.com/product/bpymp6/gigabyte-z690-aorus-ultra-atx-lga1700-motherboard-z690-aorus-ultra](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/bpymp6/gigabyte-z690-aorus-ultra-atx-lga1700-motherboard-z690-aorus-ultra)

although i got it on sale for $199.","i did do the qflash plus to update the bios, but it went very smoothly even though i had never done it before.",i followed this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cujwytnuwrg&t=0s,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"since z690 chipset motherboards manufacturered long before introducing raptor lake cpu (13th gen), it is practically impossible to say which mb has preloaded latest bios.",you can assume by comparing the bios release date and import date.,"good news is all leading brands has option to update latest bios without cpu, ram and gpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"got the msi z690 edge ddr5 version, flashed the compatible bios without the cpu, and then i was able to use it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"any that has bios flashback functionality, after flashing a bios you'll also need to install newest intel management engine, most conveniently from your motherboard support page.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got a gigabyte aero g ddr5 z690 and flashed it using q-flash.,works great!,(running a 13900k),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
msi mag z690 tomahawk.,works perfectly with bios flash before installing cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"aorus z690 master 

not out of the box but have flash bios without cpu so u can macke the bios file on a stick..plug it in and press the button ... only wait for stop blinking and done ðÿ«¡",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"get a mobo that you can flash, i learnt the hard way and spent 4 hours trying to figure out why my 13600k wouldn't work...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
asus tuf gaming z690 with wifi worked for me out of the box with my 13600k.,i specifically have the ddr5 version and i did note my local microcenter has a ton of mobos on clearance which were probably returned opened boards that were old stock without the bios update needed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the asrock z690 extreme or extreme wi-fi supports bios flashback and i dropped my 13600k in just fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"as others have said, look for usb bios flashback as a feature, it'll usually be advertised on the product page.","i made the mistake of putting a build together with 13th gen and z690 without it and had to take the 12th gen cpu from my current pc to flash the bios to a newer version, and this was with parts bought a while after the first bios versions which supported 13th gen were released, so don't count on a newer z690 board coming with the proper bios.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
im using an asus z690 hero (bios updated before hand and not out of the box) and an i9 13900k.,"if you're looking for out of the box compatibility, buy a z790 board.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lots of good advice here.,"another option if your target board doesnâ€™t have bios flash, if you buy from brick and mortar they might be able to do the update for you with a drop-in 12th gen cpu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
any aorus z690 supports 13th gen but you need to update the bios to at least f20 for compatibility.,i doubt any z690 boards support 13th gen out of the box.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13600k owner here... just put a post about it.,pretty much all the mobos z690 to b660 i wanted to get for this cpu didn't come with a bios update.,i had to speak to staff here in canada prior to purchase for them to do the bios update for me.,"so, your best bet is to talk to staff to update your mobo bios.","they should have no issues doing so, especially in a place like microcenter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
usually you have to do a bios flash and a me update firmware and windows update.,once that is done you are good to go.,i run a 13900k on an asus strix z690-a and an asus formula z690.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
any board that supports flash bios will work just fine.,i have an msi edge wifi ddr5 and flashed the bios without any cpu or ram in and works like a charm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"bought the aorus pro z690 for 13th gen support even with the latest bios, unstable af.","returned it and got the z790 aorus master, happy camper now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just got the 790 it worked fine with 13900k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got the z690 prime and it supports it out the box ðÿ¤·â€â™‚ï¸,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
msi z690 boards my tomahawk z690 had bios flashback,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have the msi pro z690-a and i used the bios flashback.,you just follow the steps listed on tgeir sute and its very easy.,i have it paired with a 13900k and it works perfectly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i installed a 13700k on a gigabyte z690 ud ax  this week.,it needed a flash via usb but it was simple enough by following a blog post.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have msi 680 z pro series for 12 gen intel i 5..all fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i paired the 13900k with a asus rog z690 maximus formula and worked right out the box.,loving it so far.,could of got a 790 but this board beautiful.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"all z690 should have bios update, personally i brought msiz690a +13600kf i had to flash bios offline though it wasn't booting out of the box, hopefully i have a secondary computer i use to recover from problems like this one lmfao, always have a backup computer guys",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i know the hero/ strix e and f / extreme z690 board will support it.,all you have to do is use the bios flash back tool which doesn't require a cpu to be installed to update the bios.,the msi unity mini itx z690 also has this feature but it booted up with the 13900k and posted without an update.,it wouldn't go to windows though until it was updated .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have gigabyte z690 aero g ddr4 that works great my 13900k.,no issues at all.,i picked the ddr4 version because i wanted to use my ram from my last build.,you can use qflash to update the bios.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most if not all of z690 should support 13th gen. you can look at the manufacturers website for a specific motherboard model that youâ€™re interested in to see if the latest bios update supports raptor lake.,"i have a z690 formula and ran it with 12th gen, then asus released a couple of bios updates that brought raptor lake support and the latest bios 2103 supports raptor lake very well.",my 13900k boosts to 6 ghz on 2 cores no problem at all raptor lake is a monster.,"the only thing i would caution is if you choose to go with z690 and raptor lake, you may need to do a bios flashback to first upgrade the bios to support raptor lake before you can post.",so make sure whatever board you buy has flashback support.,otherwise you will need to insert an alder lake cpu first to update the bios.,"the second thing to keep in mind is if you go with asus z690 (and perhaps other boards from other manufacturers but i canâ€™t comment on them) in addition to updating the bios, you will need to update the management engine to support raptor lake.",it is extremely important to do this.,otherwise your cpu may not run at full speed and you may not be able to use the m.2 slot closest to the cpu.,"unfortunately, you need to load the management engine updater from within windows as you cant do it via flashback.","so you may need to install your m.2 in one of the pch slots first, run the management engine updater and let it update the firmware etc and then you can put your m.2 in the slot closest to the cpu.",and you should be good to go.,but other than that raptor lake is pin compatible with alder lake.,lga 1700 goodness.,good luck to you !,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you go into the website for the manufacturer you should see supported cpus along with the bios version needed for the 13th gen lineup for example.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i bought the exact same board except ddr4 version.,i flashed the bios with the included usb and put a 13700k in and it's been working perfectly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
does the msi pro z690-a have bios flashback?,(pairing it with i7 13700kf),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
costs a metric fuck ton more than a decent z690 with ddr4 support...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"amazing, good to hear!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looks like it has bios flashback.,try [this guide](https://youtu.be/itkxunuarie).,one important thing this video fails to mention is that your pc has to be off before you press the bios flashback button.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,i have the board and it was easy to update.,just do it before installing anything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"depends on where you live though, it was only 125$ more to get 2 16gb ddr5 sticks and the ddr5 version of the mobo compared to the ddr4 version and 2 16gb ddr4 sticks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
alright thanks!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
doubt it was the cpu that caused those issues bud.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i would say the extra 8 e-cores would mostly be useful if youâ€™re doing a lot of long video renders, or any other multicore intensive workloads.",otherwise 16 cores is likely way more than enough power for music production.,butâ€¦ can you afford it?,do you want it?,then why not?,however i would probably suggest upgrading that cooler as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

iâ€™m having this issue on my 13900k!,itâ€™s driving me insane!,iâ€™ve switched from my asus z790 apex motherboard back to the z690 aorus xtreme and still same issue.,"reinstalled windows 4 times, updated all drivers multiple times.",went back windows 10. switched my 4090 back to my 3080ti and reinstalled drivers.,switched my 7600mhz ram back to my 6000mhz ram and still the audio/mouse stutter continues.,i have been pulling my hair out trying to figure out what it could be but i guess itâ€™s gotta be the cpu.,"itâ€™s definitely not the motherboard, i have tried a total of 3 motherboards and they all experience the same problem.",i put my audio gear back on my 12900k with the aorus motherboard and everything worked fine.,iâ€™m glad to know iâ€™m not the only one experiencing this.,i guess iâ€™ll reach out to intel about the warranty cause iâ€™m past the return point for newegg :(,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"after installing my 12900k, the problem still persists.",ðÿ˜­ðÿ˜­ iâ€™m literally losing my mind.,the last thing i can think of is a bad 980 pro that my boot drive is on?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so i downloaded samsung magaician about a week ago and switched my boot drive to their â€œperformance modeâ€ and i just switched it back and now all problems are gone!,thank you lord!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah it was likely a mobo issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wasn't trying to imply that the processor caused the issue my bad(but just to be sure i've sent it back as with the mobo).,it was probably the mobo.,"i've tried everything, replaced every part, and still got the audio stutter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah it's crazy.,my system has been stable with the new mobo and cpu.,hopefully intel can swap your cpu!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"fair enough, but i already bought the 3090 for 800â‚¬ which in my country is pretty cheap.",i won't be spending another buck for a graphics card right now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes.,however most games these days are in the all-core frequency.,you have to find some really old game to find them running a singular thread these days.,"so, you will have to oc the all-core sector, which is a lot more difficult since it draws upward of 300w for most chips in order to get that high up (going from 5.1 to 5.5 ).",that part entirely depends on your silicon lottery luck.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> you think the 3090 will not be sufficient in a few years from now on with my new build?,it is not that 3090 will not be sufficient in a few years.,it is more than 4090 is a really good value for the performance.,"you are spending an extra $400 to go from 13700k to 13900k for the cooling, and what fps does that give you?",almost zero.,"you spend an extra $100 or so for the 7200 ddr5, what fps does that give you?","again, next to nothing

sorry for taking so long.,"first my test system, i5-12500h (45w) with 16gb ddr5-4800.",i disabled the e-cores and lowered the power limit to 28w to best approximate yours.,our iris xe are both the 80eu version and run at 1.3ghz but i can't do anything about the faster ram so your results should be lower but i don't know by how much.,"at lowest settings i got 29fps at 1080p, 36fps at 900p and 44fps at 720p.",vram usage was around 3.9gb and it didn't decrease much by lowering the resolution.,i also tested 900p with textures set to ultra like someone else recommended and the vram usage increased to 4.7gb while only dropping 2fps and looking noticeably better.,"this game likes to use a lot of ram, the minimum requirement is 8gb and that's for a system with a discrete gpu, [this article](https://www.tomshardware.com/features/red-dead-redemption-2-gpu-test) talks about how it could run out of memory and crash while playing it in integrated graphics with only 8gb of ram.",i would upgrade if i were you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> the car is the ram smartass,

in this analogy, the engine of the car is the gpu.",there's no way you're ever going to see an iris xe igpu perform well in games requiring more than 2gb of vram,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"> and the i/o card is 8x pci-e 3.0

you can think of this as the equivalent bandwidth of 4 lanes of pcie 4, and that's probably the better way to think about it; total bandwidth instead of lanes.","i'm going to guess you'll run the gpu and i/o card bifurcated, so they'll each get 8 lanes directly connected to the cpu.","8 lanes of pcie 4 bandwidth is an awful lot for the gpu (it's equivalent to 16 lines @ pcie 3), and there aren't many cases where that will limit gpu performance in any meaningful way (except for some rare edge cases).","i can't imagine this would pose a problem for just those two cards (and maybe some additional bandwidth for decent audio, which doesn't take that much bandwidth, and that will likely be delegated well by the chipset anyway).",you'll have to go pro-sumer if you think running the gpu at pcie 4.0 x 8 will be an issue.,that's going to be your deciding factor.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> the 4090 is 16x pci-e 4.0, and the i/o card is 8x pci-e 3.0

problem is that a lot of intel boards won't have an 8x electrical pcie slot, so you'd have to shop around and find one that either lets you split the main cpu lanes into 8x/8x (which realistically will be fine) or (ideally) has 8x to the chipset.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to clarify.,"there are only 16 lanes of cpu-based pcie 5.0 (and 4x 4.0, thus your total of 20), but there are tons of other pcie 4.0 and 3.0 lanes available from the chipset.","the problem is, no alder/raptor lake motherboards route pcie 4.0 or 3.0 lanes into an x8 electrical slot.","the closest would be asus with their x4/x4 slot for use with the hyper card, however as far as i know this is forced to be bifurcated as x4/x4 and cannot be combined into a single x8 (so your i/o card would only get 3.0 x4).","so, your best bet is to buy an advanced z690 or z790 motherboard with dual pcie 5.0 slots.","these will be capable of running 4.0 x8 for your gpu, and 3.0 x8 for your i/o card.",running your gpu at x8 will slow it down - by a bit.,"even on the 4090, the performance hit is minimal and should only impact things by a few frames.",there have been reviews detailing exactly what type of performance hit to expect (remember 4.0 x8 is the same bandwidth as 3.0 x16).,"beyond this, you need to look into a hedt platform (a new one might be coming out in 2023, otherwise youâ€™re limited to x299 and 10th gen cpus from intel), or server grade stuff.",i donâ€™t know if there are any w680 chipset boards that might have a different pcie slot arrangement.,the chipset doesnâ€™t have any capabilities over z690 (and lacks overclocking) but itâ€™s more for a workstation environment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thank you everyone solution and reply, because currently we're lenovo p620 and hp z4 which is both woekststion cpu, but unfortunately both case and the psu is not enough for the card and the card is so huge, so i'm thinking the cheapest way to use the 4090 and the io card together.","if i buy a motherboard which had the thunderbolt usb, is that ok for the external case for the io card, and let the gpu in the pc case?",or the thunderbolt bus is also shareing the same bus to cpu?,thank you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> you can think of this as the equivalent bandwidth of 4 lanes of pcie 4, and that's probably the better way to think about it; total bandwidth instead of lanes.","that works for bandwidth, but not for electrical requirements.","while his 3.0 x8 i/o card has the same bandwidth as a 4.0 x4 slot, itâ€™s still a 3.0 card.","so plug it into a 4.0 x4 slot, and itâ€™s only running at 3.0 x4.","for an i/o card thatâ€™s probably x8 for a reason, running at half bandwidth might be very noticeable.","i know you personally understand this, but your first paragraph about the i/o card wasnâ€™t followed up in your post, so it might be confusing to some.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i sort of figured he'd plug into a x16 pcie slot, not a x4 slot.","that's a different scenario, and i agree with you if an x4 slot were used.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not too many x16 slot options on z690/z790.,"as you mention in your post, i think x8/x8 is going to be about the best.","one thing that throws users is a lot of motherboards install full x16-looking slots that are only, electrically, x4 or even x1.",(and no one reads manuals or studies specification pages to learn different.),"so then they plug a more advanced x8 or x16 card in, and performance sucks or the card refuses to work, and they have no idea why.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're right though.,a 4090 may physically obstruct the second pcie slot that's wired for x8 operation.,"so the safest bet would be to go with a pro-sumer board (or put the gpu in the lower slot, and the i/o card in the upper slot).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh my, i didnâ€™t even think of the 4090 factor.","theyâ€™re 3.5 slots wide, right?","and iâ€™m quite certain every board is spacing the 5.0 slots only 3 apart, not 4.

and if the gpu is in the lower slot, youâ€™re going to need space in the case for it to hang down, and might have some obstructions with connectors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hey bro!,did you find the way to fix it?,i got the same cpu and the same problem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh no, the fan definitely works, it sounds like a jet engine all the time.","it blows hot air too, so the problem must be the cpu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i did, i used the arctic mx-4 i had lying around and it didn't make a difference to the idle temperatures.","the only thing that changed were temperatures under load, those seemed to have gone down by maybe 5 degrees.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the laptop found a solution by itself.,it died.,runs super cool now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if it's that loud, the fan is probably damaged, if the heat's not from the cpu, it's probably from the battery.",i'd see about replacing the battery and fan.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the fan might be damaged actually, it ramps up randomly and, after a heavy workload, it won't slow down along with the cpu temperature decreasing, a system reboot is always necessary.","as for the battery, it's dead, and i can feel the heat only where the processor and cooling assembly are located",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do the fan first,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gotcha!,i'd try that and also just making sure the airway is clear of blockage.,"sounds like it's just time for a new machine though, i know easier said then done stuffs expensive.","maybe give onlyfans a try for solving this fan problem, i've heard it's a good site.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if they are the same price, grab the 12500h for sure.",you can always go into your power plan in windows and set the maximum frequency and power usage to 95% so that they match the 1240p but you still get that extra cache.,these new cpus are so powerful that for web browsing i would choose a power plan that has a max frequency / power limit of 80% to just totally reap the battery savings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ofc your temps will drop dramatically if you swap to airplane fans.,but you'll also have unbearable noise,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well that's a bummer.,you did all that and just dropped 10â°c?,an aio seems just so much more simple and better performing solution.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

games only take up to like 10-30% of the cpu comapred to a benchmark's 100%; hes going to be at like 50-70c during games.,"technically, you can turn down the e cores and get even less heat, youre just not gonna look good on benchmarks, but be perfect in games.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes but im more safe and relaxed like this.,"i dont really had good experience with aios 2 corsair leakage in the last 10 years and the last lfii was defective and started to lose performance, was already anounced on official site those made between 2021-2022 and my unit was afected.",so after all this i have enough of whater,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what's the price difference?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i recently decided on the i5-13600k over i7-13700k because it's:

getting generic ddr4 memory with the 13700k would waste a good chunk of its performance.,iâ€™d go with 5600 or higher ddr5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you're getting new ddr4 ram with a 13700k, get 3600 or higher.",the advantage of gear 1 ddr4 is that you can run the imc at rates that require $400 ddr5-8000 to hit with only $140 ddr4-4000.,this will help with gaming performance while not being that much more expensive than ddr4-3200.,at least get 3600 which is only $10 more than 3200 for 32gb,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all the benchmark videos i have seen so far all indicate ddr5 won't make some massive difference to warrant the price of the mobo's and ram sticks.,what i have seen others say is that ddr5 is at least still a couple years wait.,so for the 13700k whenever i get it i will more than likely pair it with 32gb 3600 ddr4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

all the benchmark videos i have seen so far all indicate ddr5 won't make some massive difference to warrant the price of the mobo's and ram sticks.,what i have seen others say is that ddr5 is at least still a couple years wait.,so for the 13700k whenever i get it i will more than likely pair it with 32gb 3600 ddr4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ah yes forgot to say i will also be going from 16gb to 32gb since 16 isn't really viable anymore (for me).,"anyways, i consider myself somewhat knowledgeable when it comes to working my way with a pc but this is the first i am hearing about gear 1 and all that a quick google led me to somewhat understand?",i think?,but essentially get 3600 to match with the cpu.,"i'll see if i can find something to work with, currently have $650 to spend on all of this so its kind of tight hence the inquiry on seeing if the holidays will actually have a sale.",(though once i get the cpu/mobo/ram i will probably just sell the old three all at once for whatever price to recoup.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've never played cyber punk yet however everything g on high in warzone i lock my frames at 144 with my monitor.,when unlocked in multiplayer with those settings i get around 170. this is high preset with all the babble of motion blur off depth of field off gun motion blur off and texture resolution and spot cache set to the highest they can go.,same again for 2042 i lock my frames however some scenes i drop to about 110 120 ish in 128 player multiplayer but the game is pure eyegasms.,all in all i'm more than happy and i know i have the power for a while yet too.,"ps
dlss is set to quality on both too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in general ddr5 results in a substantial uplift in 1% lows https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/y5u283/is_ddr5_worth_it/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"to support ddr5-8000+, the memory controller can run in a geared mode where parts of it runs slower.","the base imc clock can go over 2000mhz but to hit ddr5-8000 the memory interface itself would need to run at 4000mhz, so there is almost a 2000mhz shortfall if the entire memory subsystem were clocked at the same rate.","this is why ddr5 runs in gear 2.

but for ddr4, you don't need the gearing so you can run the controller, phy, and ddr4 in 1:1:1 mode which allows you to max out the memory controller clock.","if you get 3200 instead of 3600/4000, your memory controller will be running at 1600 instead of 1800/2000",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ddr4 is not worth buying now!,ddr4 13th gen is just for people who already have high end ddr4 kits!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks!,have you tried the â€œextremeâ€ preset?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i see, so what would one do to get that 1:1:1 mode you're talking about?",all that i have been doing for years is just enabling xmp in bios and calling it a day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

on warzone?,il gibe it a try now i've just logged on give me 20 mins and il let you know what i get,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thats only for 11th gen onwards.,pre 11th gen there was no gears.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
very bad move.,"all those sites only use stock xmp, usually 3600cl16 vs 6000cl32.","the one site that tried 4000cl14 had it running in gear 2.

you can buy 2x16 gb ddr5 hynix ic for the same price currently as 2x16 3600cl16.",that ddr5 when correctly oced and tuned to 7000+ and tighter timings will outperform tuned ddr4.,tuned ddr5 > tuned ddr4 > anything at stock xmp.,13th gen ddr4 boards are only advisable at current ram prices if you already have high end ddr4.,otherwise a ddr5 board with hynix ic and manual overclock is better and the same price or just $10-30 more as new ddr4.,"you will then also be able to upgrade the ddr5 further when 8000+ is released, ddr4 you are stuck.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ya warzone.,i think they all share the same graphics options?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i see, so is that something you have to manually do in the bios alongside xmp or would that automatically be done when you enable xmp?",just so i know what to do when i install everything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well the benchmarks i was referring to were mostly youtube channels who focus on tech and such.,"as to the prices all that i am finding of ddr5 mobo/ram will seriously run up the price and is really expensive, i've been checking all the standard places such as newegg, amazon, microcenter, etc.",for cpu/mobo/ram/psu i am working with $650.,"though i don't even know if i want to buy a new psu because i would just be going from 850w non-modular to 850w fully modular, since my current one has thick ugly cables and is nearing 10 years old.","(1000w would probably be preferred but again, price).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
extreme in open areas i was getting no less than 120 frames.,and over 150s when in buildings etc.,i like a stable 144 so i'm going back to high.,this i'd at 1440p btw,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it is, as per your other replies, ddr4 is comparable to high end ddr5 only if you are willing to tune and oc it in the bios.","if you don't know how to do this / dont want to, its better to get the best xmp profile ram you can afford.","however, its not worth overspending on ram, if the next one up is $10-20 thats ok. if it $50+, its not worth it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just to point out we are discussing this thoroughly on actual 'tech' forums like ocnet.,"these 'tech' youtube channels are a joke, they dumb everything down and none of them have configured the ram properly.","if you're looking at oc3ds video, thats the worst of the lot, the ddr4 was only running in gear 2 so its imc latency would be halved, and comparing 4000cl14 which is like the best ddr4 can do against plain 6000cl32 ddr5 is an unfaair comparison.","to buy new 4000cl14 ddr4, you have to spend way too much money 6000cl32 ddr5 is cheap.",3600cl16 costs the same as getting good ics on cheaper ddr5 and manually overclocking to top tier.,"i've personally pointed this out to oc3d in several comments, they reply with 'we just run the settings people would at home because gears is too confusing'.",their tests and everything is dumbed down to the point that their advice is basically like building an office pc to run msword.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i took the time to put together what my pc currently has through pcpartpicker minus some things that i either couldn't find or can't recall what it is exactly.,[https://pcpartpicker.com/b/vqp2ft](https://pcpartpicker.com/b/vqp2ft),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice!,you're at 2k standard or ultrawide?,"all in all, you think it was a worthwhile upgrade from the 9700k after cpu/mobo/ram?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i can see that haha.,as to the ram are you able to link any that would beat this?,[https://www.amazon.com/dp/b08tr1bqm3?tag=pcpapi-20&linkcode=ogi&th=1&psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/dp/b08tr1bqm3?tag=pcpapi-20&linkcode=ogi&th=1&psc=1) i know its cl18 but i think i can tighten the timings a little bit.,"or i just stick with 3600, i don't know my brain is exploding and parts are expensive, i don't know if i'm just not filtering right but i just see expensive parts everywhere.",seems like its just better to just call it a day with ddr4 3600mhz for $90 than ddr5 5600mhz or + for way more.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
standard 2k mate.,and yeah i mean i know i wanted the frames to match my monitor but i like the candy too so wanted the power.,all my games are hitting what i want them to no sweat so to me i'm pleased i upgraded.,"ps, cod is still a mess tho i have crashed i don't know how many times i've just had to roll back the drivers there because i know they were more stable.",on the new ones released i've crashed 3 times in around 5 games and just crashed there doing the test for you.,so yeah find a driver that works well for you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"unfortunately i haven't kept track of which kit has which chips on ddr5, just that you dont want 5200 because the are all micron and oc the worst, and hynix chips are the best.","theres two types on the hynix, m and a die.","one clocks higher with looser timings, the other runs a bit slower but with much better timings, both are about the same when tuned.","samsung ddr5 is middle ground, not as bad as micron, but not as good as hynix.","this ofc will change when newer ddr5 is made, but for now hynix chips are the best.","there are some 4800 and 6000 kits that have it, but they are starting to phase out the 4800 as loads of people are buying them and getting 7000+ ocs.",but not all 4800 are hynix.,"you would have to ask on a new thread somewhere, or ask on a decent tech forum like ltt or ocnet to confirm which have hynix chips.","in general kingsron use hynix, g skill use samsung, crucial use micron, but there are some g skill kits with hynix and not all kingston might have it.","only way to confirm is by checking from people who already bought the same kit, you can only tell which chips ram has after checking in taiphoon burner.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
holy shit!,that upgrade was much more substantial than i thought it would be.,thanks!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"non-k have vccsa locked to 0.9-0.95v, so expect being stuck to 3600 mhz in 30% of units, most die on 3466mhz when trying to stick to gear 1. nothing will affect the lifespan of anything in cpu, unless you push 1.5v and let it constantly run above 90c.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you can try undervolting the cpu or getting a better cpu cooler.,this will reduce cpu temperature and may allow it to boost higher/longer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
could try taking off power limits but thatâ€™s about it.,"also f means no integrated graphics, doesnâ€™t determine overclocking ability",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what should i do,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you don't already have a good laptop cooler stand then i suggest you get one or at least elevate the back of the laptop a few inches when you game.,"also, if your laptop has a max fan option turn that on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you say it never booted and that the ram is not being picked up.,if i am correct cpu testing on mobos comes first so if you made it into ram testing you should have made it through cpu testing.,"i think boot start up steps goes:
1: cpu
2: ram
3:video output
4: boot/os

did you happen to take out the cpu at one point then put it back in the packaging?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fifuj9vs5ja,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looks like the resistors are missing/shaved off!,"i've heard of this issue where if the cpu was put into the plastic shell container flipped (which can be done easily), there is a good chance that it shears the resistors off.",perhaps this could have happened ?,bad package design on intel :(,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is so bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that's actually what i been looking at as well.,2x singlecore performance is a worthy upgrade.,"my hold ups are:   

* is it actually 2x performance per core, or just while turbo-ing?",ideally i'd just lock the multiplier as i've done with the 4790k@46.,* i want 64gb of ddr5 using 2 sticks so i can overclock them.,"seems too expensive though, considering just going fast ddr4 but idk if this a wise decision, so i wait...

"i ended up getting my 13700k, im running 5600mhz ram kit c36 from corsair, havnt dived into overclocking the ram yet, was hoping faster kits get cheaper so i can get one of those but i guess by the time that happens, intel will have new cpus lmao (i may try just a simple overclock to 6000/6200 with at 1.3v, same timings, i doubt it will boost performance in any meaningful way, except maybe it will be unstable) both my sticks are able to run its xmp profile.","not sure if this is a great way of overlocking, but what ive done is, i used aioc, and then from there, enabled a manual overclock with a voltage offset.","right now im running 5.6 ghz all p core, and 4.4 e core, about 31.5k to 31.6k in cbr23 at a load voltage of 1.279/1.288, temps about 83c.","regular voltage is 1.296, ll6.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

for example:   

- ddr4 can't be chosen
- >16gb of ram isn't offered
- >512gb ssd isn't offered

part of the reason i think it's slower is because of the crowdstrike monitoring and security software.",seems like it's always bogging it down and using multiple cores.,"i think it's the primary reason i never see high turbo speeds because anytime there's file io or an app is launched, it's scarfing down a few cores to check everything.","so i never realize the turbo benefits because all activities become a multi-core operation, usually to the tune of 40% consumed just by crowdstrike.","on the desktop i have all security stuff disabled such as scanners, realtime protection, speculative execution, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"where did you put the voltage offset can you send a screenshot
thanks in advance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i didn't see much of a difference at reasonable sound levels, the ml120s can cool more because they have twice the rpm ceiling (2400rpm vs 1200rpm) but they pierce your ears on the higher end.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

> mmmm so the performance is tanked by software?,"it appears so by company software, yes.","i had thought you said you were getting one from work as well, but i must have glanced at my own post while reading yours.","> i have no problem with it, i will format and clean install windows anyway.",i'm not sure what is normally all on it.,i believe my company just images them.,you might be able to get by without needing a reinstall.,it still throttles pretty fast though.,50% load near instantly takes it down to sub-4ghz.,sometimes when it's busy doing stuff i lay it open on its side vertically so the intake is drawing from open air & the vent exhausting up.,it'll usually do low 3ghz then.,here's the hwinfo64 temps and power usages from merely opening visualstudio 2022.  it's throttling@2.4ghz@100c with just 32watts of load.,"total cpu usage is only 16%, and it's throttling...  it very briefly hit 70watts and 106c.",https://i.imgur.com/vverhwy.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my goodness what a shame... did you try to undervolt it?,maybe a problem with the cooling?,it's for work but i can wipe it without any problem and just use it as clean.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the bios is completely locked down.,i also noticed the ram is running at 2666mhz when it has 3200mhz modules.,i am considering bringing it up to it maybe just to see if it's normal to throttle this much.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it can clock down when not in use to save power and heat.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
boot windows and see what the clock speed shows when you put some load on the processor.,the bios is just displaying the speed of the processor at the time of rendering that screen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it just doesn't do anything when you look up that number so it'd be wasteful to run at full speed while idling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you can change that behaviour in power settings' profiles

not sure there's any benefit to forcing it into higher clocks when idle though",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this screen doesn't mean shit.,download throttle stop or cpuz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hwinfo64 and run cinebench.,"hwinfo64 will give you temps and speeds, cinebench should give you a result that you can compare to an equivalent system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's what it clocks itself down to if it hits a thermal limit.,"found out that all you need to do to hit that on the new -30 series inspirons is to have a single sheet of paper between your laptop and your desk, and the intake fan will be too obstructed (meaning that the fan is tight against the laptop body, preventing intake from inside the chassis, should the bottom be blocked).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"this is a good thing, as when the processor is at idle/low utilization it will lower the frequency to save battery life.",the -u series cpus are designed to be as efficient as possible which is why they usually only have 15w tdp or less.,"they can also be altered to be scaled up to 25w tdp which allows for higher clocks and longer sustained turbo duration, but this is more beneficial when you are connected to the charger and do not have to rely on the laptop battery.","if i recall, some oems may have restrictions for the tdp on a bios level, since some configurations may not have an adequate enough heatsink or vrms to handle the higher power draw.","i have an older dell gaming laptop with the i5-7300hq, and despite its tdp being rated for 45w, i believe it's limited to only 35w (maybe even less) as i have observed it only using 27-33w during full loads.","though to be fair, it is still able to achieve the 3.5ghz single core turbo and 3.1ghz all-core without any issues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my amd 3700x did that, and my motherboard ended up shitting the bed, replaced and all was well",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my old 8250u would also sometimes clock down to 400 mhz after a few years of heavy use under bad thermal condition.,"but when it happens the pc is practically unusable, so if you can still operate normally when on low stress, then it's definitely not running at 400, and even if it happens it only lasts maybe half a minute at most",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
marketeers at hp are con artists of the highest grade in tech world.,"they use the worst kind of i7 cpu (a dual core i7) in a laptop and then call it ""elite""book lmao.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe he has a burnout and needs some time to get back up on his feet again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"is normal, for 100%mhz all time go control panel => power alimentation => option mode=> processor power=> minimum power =>100%",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i once started a job where ht and half the cores had been disabled in the bios of my computer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you should boot the pc in windows and put some pressure on it and then check to see why its saying then,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's a bios/firmware/heating problem
download throttlestop for windows and troubleshoot accordingly...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably not what you're experiencing but it's common for laptops to lock the cpu at its lowest frequency if you plug a laptop charger that can't be correctly detected or that it's defective...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have always wanted to see how space engineers runs on arc cards,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is strange but ryzen 5 3600 with 5500xt was running better than i3 10100 with 6600xt and this a770 is a surprise i'd say.,"transition from 1050ti to 6600xt wih ddu was not without issues and now from integrated graphics it is flawless so far, at least for my use case",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what case is this?,i really like the side panel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
excited to see what the future holds for intel gpus!,with how shtty nvidia and amd have been with pricing i would love to see intel give a highend gpu for a cheaper price and since my cpu is already intel i'd love to have an intel gpu too and go full on team blue!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel arcs dont look buff enough for my liking,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

can you at least tell us what generation is that i3?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looks like the u9s chromax 90mm tower cooler.,definitely far more then the i3 needs but it's pretty small,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its okay since it blows in wrong direction lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ah that makes sense if you have a use case that overwhelms the memory bus.what made you go 770 over say a 6700xt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10th as you can see on ccleaner screenshot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is due to the clearance and max temp i have ever seen was 56c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i don't know 
just look at it :)
6700xt was available for a long time and i have upgraded from 5700xt to 3060ti strix oc on my main rig so for this second one, used for traveling i wanted something i can tinker with and learn something new too",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh ok,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you flip the fan around?,push vs pull doesn't make all that much of a difference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ah that's fair.,i always enjoy tinkering with things to a fault sometimes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is my ideal scenario to try out the new tech if the budget allows - keeping a secondary system to try out new hardware.,"i have another system thatâ€™s capable and currently running integrated graphics, though sadly i have not the budget now to buy another gpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if the editing program can utilize igpus to speed up rendering times you should get the 5700g,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

glad intel is really pushing out new tech faster than ever keeping up the competition and forcing amd to drop their pricing.,was disappointed in zen 4 and am5 motherboard pricings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the am5 mobo prices are stupider than 4080 prices.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the z690 since you can overclock the 13600k while the b660 board would not let you overclock.,just make sure that board has bios flashback to update bios or else 13th gen cpu won't work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
msi pro z690-a very good value z690 motherboard.,go for it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i see it's too late, but i went for a budget b660 with my existing ddr4 sticks and eye a ddr5 upgrade later with a z board.",i think it is the best path.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this was my initial idea too.,i even settled on 12400f and a b660 and then to maybe upgrade to 14th gen with a new board when it comes out.,"but then 12400f started to look like it may force me to upgrade too early, to basically mean money i paid for it would be wasted.",(also extra cores in 13th gen useful to me because of my work.),"so i went with 13600k but was not sure about b660, hence this thread.",if 13400 was out i would have probably got that and kept b660.,"right now, plan is go as long as i can without upgrading.",maybe ocing in later in the life of the build if it comes to that.,drr5 right now is not looking very hot especially with the price of the sticks and the boards.,i would wait a couple of generations of boards for the tech to iron out it's kinks and price to come down.,"after this purchase i probably would not upgrade to ddr5 on lga1700, i got 32gb 3600 cl16 ram, i may add some of the same as an upgrade down the line

i do not have any (easily accessible/borrowable) 12th gen to update b660s firmware, z690 can be updated without a cpu.",this was a big point in the decision too.,"another big issue for me is, we are in a big economic downturn as a country and upgrading later or delaying the build may be too costly.",it looks like i may not be able to build the very same system for 1.5x the price in local currency in about 6 months.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i understand, where i live we're past the big fx drop, so i've actually paid more than $500 for the 13600k in 2021 rates.","ddr5 is maturing fast however and based on hub reviews  better ones do provide a substantial overhead, much more than cpu oc, especially as raptor lake boosts pretty good as stock.","i think in 1-2 years a good kit will be even better yet come down in price, which is a nice option as i want to keep the cpu as long possible... so yeah, i've paid about half as much as a z690 for the b660 matx, including the bios update so it was very cool as it could boot out of the box.","my plan/hope is that as rates normalize it will allow me to do a mobo/ram update at reasonable price while better memory and oc add 30+% performance, especially as eventually i'll move on from the 3080.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

mate if you can hold out until the i5 13500 is out it's going to be a little beast and it's not that much more money and definitely worth it.,its going to have 6 p cores and 12 threads and 8 e cores so thats 20 threads.,i currently have an i5 12600k and even that blast through anything and everything i do from gaming to video editing and streaming.,"[https://www.eteknix.com/intel-core-i5-13500-benchmark-50-gain-i5-12500/](https://www.eteknix.com/intel-core-i5-13500-benchmark-50-gain-i5-12500/)

"so, i got the bbmc1b1, it's the one that has the x16 slot at the bottom and x4 slot above it so you can use both a multi slot gpu and a capture card, well that's what my plan is.","as for how to power the nuc w/o a nuc psu, actually the only baseboard that needed a special one was the 1st baseboard from the nuc 9 extreme, that one uses a proprietary 10 or 12 pin connector.","the nuc 11, 12, and i am assuming 13 extreme baseboards all use a standard 24 pin atx connector, and you just need to short two of the front panel io pins on the nuc (or jerryrig a power button to it) to turn it on!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

oneâ€™s above the gpu slot.,with a heatsink.,that is your primary slot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, is that normal?","i am pretty new to the m2 slots, when i installed this motherboard back in april i had always used external sata ssd's and just installed the m2 ssd in slot4.","i just bought a new ssd and it is a ""crucial p5 plus 2tb"" and is a lot faster than the ""samsung 970 evo plus ssd 2tb"" i already had in there.",i never even noticed the slot with the heatsink on it!,seems strange they did it for that single slot.,"i was reading the manual, something i tend to not do much of :(

i went ahead and installed the new crucial ssd in slot1 and left the current system samsung ssd in slot4.","i guess sometime i can copy the system over, even though it seems fast enough to me now.",crystal disk mark says the new ssd is 3 times faster than the old one at around 6000 mb/s where the old one was around 2000 mb/s,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you for your answer!,so it has its own heatsink?,meaning if i want to use that slot i should get an ssd with no heatsink of its own?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"more expensive motherboards provide heatsinks for all m.2 slots, but these days theyâ€™re as much about appearance as functionality (not that any ssd should really overheat in a desktop case, even without heatsink).","there will not be a massive performance difference between a single ssd installed in a chipset or cpu slot, however it is â€œbest practiceâ€ and â€œbest possible performanceâ€ to install your system ssd in the cpu-connected slot.","with that said your old ssd was pcie 3.0 and your new one is pcie 4.0, so i would recommend installing that one in your top slot regardless.","i personally would also want to make that my system drive, but a lot of people prefer to put the os on a smaller drive, even if itâ€™s a bit slower.",so thatâ€™s a perfectly valid choice too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well, if you got a ssd with a heatsink you wouldnâ€™t be able to put the motherboardâ€™s heatsink/cover back.","which isnâ€™t too crucial for that slot unless you like the styling, but is more awkward when itâ€™s one heatsink for a double slot (not an issue with this board).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yea i may try to install all my games on the new drive, and see how that goes.",thanks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hmm, ok. so would you recommend saving a bit of money and get a nh ssd if i intend to use that slot?",i'm looking to buy a corsair mp600 pro 4tb and the nh variant is like $13 cheaper than the one with heatsink included.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i wouldnâ€™t bother getting a heatsink version, no.",just use what the motherboard includes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

so annoying.,i'm debating going back to windows 10.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it is the 22h2 update causing it.,i just reinstalled to the earlier 21h2 and it fixed my issue.,cpu score is back to 25k win 10 levels.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"haha i am still testing the performance difference on these two os before i can decide, but i will finalize today, iâ€™ve been wasting so much time on this.",i am guessing this issue happened because we did a clean installation of win 11 (version 22h2) and not upgrading directly from win 10?,i know that the current 22h2 version has a really bad reputation and is very buggy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah thats weird isn't it.,i know it's capable of more as i had 23k on win10 for cpu with exact same setup.,i'd have to check.,never used those benchmarks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
one thing i have noticed is that on a stress test (intel extreme tuning) it used to pull nearly 300w and thermal throttle when it hit 100 degrees.,since windows 11 its pulling 200w on a stress test and sitting around 80. i noticed my cpu temps are lower now in the timespy benchmark too.,my last benchmark the average temp for cpu was 80 whereas it was 87 on windows 10 when it was performing better.,cpu clock speed and everything is exact same though!,im baffled,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so a clean install might fix it?,or the opposite?,i upgraded from windows 10 but chose to remove all files,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this doesn't tell folks anything new.,it's already known applications brought to the forefront on the desktop gets put on the p-cores and applications running in the background get put on the e-cores.,the problem is that this is not what intel promised.,"say you're rendering, exporting video, or doing whatever project.",said project size will take 30 minutes to complete.,"in the meantime you want to open a web browser to watch some youtube, do some shopping, and browse reddit.",you open your project and wonder why it's been an hour and it hasn't completed.,"well, the scheduler moved your project to the e-cores and placed your web browsing on the p-cores since it is what was in the forefront.",that's a big problem.,"it was promised that the ai built in the windows 11 scheduler would intelligently divide workloads to proper cores seamlessly, and it doesn't.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tldr: itâ€™s updated.,how?,itâ€™s better.,how?,"letâ€™s show a demonstration of how things work already, and that should clear things up.",sigh.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
isn't this what people have been complaining about?,i've seen several threads of people saying their p-cores aren't being used when they minimize handbrake,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it does, but it assumes that whatever is going on you want the foreground to be snappy.",the p cores are and should be available for foreground tasks.,the problem is more that you need sufficient e-cores to guarantee sufficient background performance.,and the variance here is big.,i had a 12700k and now a 13900k.,that's 4x the background performance.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
man i remember i got shat on for simply suggesting w11 is better for alder lake on a thread asking which version should  they go for with their alder lake cpu.,"""w10 has the updated scheduler"" what they said.apparently not as updated as w11 it seems  if what this guy is saying is the truth.","still this video is still vague ""updated"" how updated?i don't get why w10 would be exampt from a scheduler tweak when w11 is basically a reskin.",(and there's already some scheduling changes made for alder lake+ on w10),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep.,"one way around this is to put handbrake on a second display, then it stays ""in focus"" and remains on p cores and you can then do something else on your main display like browse.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"honestly the cost of replacing/upgrading the ram usually isn't worth it, if you can move up a cpu tier instead (like 13600k to 13700k).","so ddr4 might have a performance hit in some extreme cases, but is it worth the cost of upgrading to ddr5?",probably not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

people often time forget about the cpu being the limitation.,"even if you can get better ddr5 later, you still have to upgrade your cpu to get that because the 13th gen pretty much top out at 8000 on the cpu side.","and since the motherboard won't support next-gen, you will have to replace everything to get any significant ddr5 speed improvement.","if you can get around 6000-7000 you can just settle down, cause there is no realistic way for you to get any higher without a lot of uncertainty.","your 13th gen could top out as low as 7200, and the most exotic sample only goes up to around 8000. even if you wait, you can't get much more to make it worth your while.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"personally i went with a high end motheroard (asus rog strix) and a 6400 kit to pair with a 13900k

the cpu should have fairly good logevity given its a monster and im banking on the fact the motherboard will support future ddr5 speeds, possibly i overspent but either way i will get as much performance in the present as i could reasonably purchase

"emphasis on ""current"", i would think.","ddr5 is likely to be around for the next 10 years, but cpus in 2028 will probably be wanting 7200 mhz ram officially and overclocking might go up to 9,000 mhz.",i wouldn't be surprised if the 14th gen cpus have official support for 6400 mhz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'd say yes.,to get most out ddr4 you will need 4000mhz kit with low latency.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, if you mix 3000 and 3200 then xmp will take the worst timings, ie 3000. but you can always try manually overclocking.",but i will say that mixing ram speeds is never a good thing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think ddr5 speeds will move much higher than that and rather quickly.,"""obsolete"" is subjective, they will still work but there will be faster options.",in the same way that ddr5 4800  could be considered obsolete now.,it will still work but only budget conscious would buy it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

for strictly office use it will be fine.,just make sure the laptop comes paired with 16gb of ram (and a ssd)if doing lots of browsing on the net.,edit: it should be fine for low res esport games also if not using a discrete gpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

what mobo are you using for the g7400 and how did you measure the wattage of your cpu?,were you specifically looking for either a celeron or a pentium over an i3 besides cost?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"some asus b660, i donâ€™t remember the exact model.",i chose the pentium because i decided i donâ€™t need i3 level cpu performance and it was quite a lot cheaper than the 12100. and there is no difference in the ugly when it comes to encoding power.,cpu power consumption is reported by powertop.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"hey, i did say it was rough!",looks like most estimates in this thread are from 4 ecores = 1.3-2.0 pcores.,that doesnâ€™t severely change the math.,"instead of 9 we go to 9.3-10.0, and from 8 to 8.6-10.0.

so itâ€™s either at a slight deficit or the same (plus raptor lakeâ€™s improvements).","so while it should match the 12700k or statistically beat it, is it really going to be at the same kind of significant margin as, say, the 13400 vs 12600, or the 13700k vs the 12900k?","anyhow, looking forward to some real benchmarks to sink my teeth into.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's going to depend on the rest of your build and quality of silicone.,"that being said, unless you're chasing benchmark leaderboards, there's no real-world benefit.","if anything, you're better off undervolting a bit to keep the chip cool.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
where is the rumored 13900ks?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"overclocking via tvb is probably the easiest, where you can adjust the overclock ratio of p-cores based on usage and temperature bins.",most i9 13900k can probably hit a boost of 6 ghz stable on a few cores.,"i can get up to 4 cores boosting at 6 ghz, and 8 cores boosting at 5.7 ghz using tvb.","my overclocking headroom is limited, as my factory vf curve has 1.43v to hit 5.8 ghz.","i can get a few cores boosting stable to 6 ghz, but requires about 1.5v.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its actually showing as only 3ghz stock in the bios and within windows.,i did see a post from asus that they managed to oc this cpu to 9ghz which broke the world record.,they used liquid helium at -160c to adhesive it though.,like we all have that laying around lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"vcore 0.954, base 100.00, ring 2,700mhz",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes and no.,as i said in the bios itâ€™s only showing as running at 3ghz.,windows reports the same.,initially i thought buying it stock at 5.7ghz was good enough.,so oc i wasnâ€™t going to bother with.,itâ€™s a legit intel chip i got it directly from intel so why itâ€™s only showing at 3ghz iâ€™ve no idea.,the bios has been updated and iâ€™ve changed nothing other than the boot order.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it kind of depends on your cooler and how much headroom you have.,what kind of temp are you getting in stock?,afaik the 13900k at stock speed can hardly be tamed even with the best coolers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no lol.,sorry the chip isnâ€™t oc yet.,i posted just wondering if it was worth oc or not.,but considering what iâ€™ve been told so far i donâ€™t think iâ€™ll bother as it has enough balls to spare for the job without it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i know!,thatâ€™s why i got a 1200w psu.,my long term goal is to get rid of the aio and completely water cool the entire setup including the gpu.,custom loop.,i didnâ€™t bank on having to use a 3060 though so thatâ€™s another plan for the drawing board.,until i get the time though itâ€™ll have to sit on the back burner for now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s actually why i asked.,"thereâ€™s so many different views on what to change and what not to change, high voltages then lower voltages etc.",and they all just contradict each other.,i know every machine is different thatâ€™s why i asked if anyone specifically had the 13900k or a system similar what numbers they found to be the sweet spot for them.,by the look of it though i donâ€™t even need to oc it as itâ€™s ballsy enough stock.,"iâ€™ll be putting it through its paces next week when iâ€™m off work, iâ€™ll see how well it can run demanding apps and games.",thanks for the info.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"as it has been said, the 3ghz is the base frequency when the cpu is idle/under light load.",when you put it under load it can boost up to 5.70ghz if it is supplied enough power or has enough temperature headroom to keep it from being throttled.,put your cpu under stress (actual stress test like cinebench/occt/prime95/kombuster cpu burner/etc and not just gaming. ),"if you can't get it to reach at least 5.7ghz, there could be a few reasons:

1. cpu is  power is limited, the first time you go into the msi bios it should ask you to choose your cooler type, that change your power limit, if you pick ""water cooling"" it will technically have your power limited uncapped, if you choose box cooler pl is limited to 181w(this will limit your 13900k's performance) and tower cooler will cap your power draw to 288(iirc).","2. you have avx offset enabled and the stress test is using avx instruction, this lower your frequency when avx is detected to keep your cpu from reaching the max temperature and getting throttled.",3. your cpu has reached the max temperature and is being throttled.,"gaming can boost your cpu to the maximum clock speed but it will not put your cpu under full load, giving you the wrong idea that there is more temperature headroom than you have.","ps: if the only thing you have changed in bios is the boot order, make sure you go back in and enabled xmp or your ddr5 rams will not run at advertised speed.","when you are in the bios, look for cpu cooler tuning, this is the cooler selection mentioned in 1), make sure water cooling is selected.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m running a corsiar h150i elite triple rad.,my base temp when itâ€™s doing nothing is only 28c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no worries i thought it was so people at work didn't get pi**ed cause your score is better then theirs.,ðÿ˜†,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ye that's a good plan.,i have a 360 aio and this thing still goes to 90 c under sustained all core load.,"as for overclocking i could get 5.7 on all p cores and 4.5 on all e cores with the ring set to 5 ghz at 
1.45v, but it was drawing 355 w (also 105 c over temp disabled).","a much better oc was 5.656 on p cores and 4.444 on e cores with a base clock overclock and this will go up to 98 c and 330 w with the vcore set to 1.390 v

edit: oh and if you are wondering this gets me just over 42000 points on cinebench, single core is 2220 (obviously lower than stock as it doesn't go as high as 5.8)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oops, thanks, fixed",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what's your e cores got to do with anything?,and your p cores aren't going to be what they are set to they will dynamically increase to 5.5 as long as there is power and thermal room to do so.,which there should be with a light load like gaming,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have every intention of enabling xmp.,when i built the rig i had to boot from usb thatâ€™s the only thing i changed within bios.,i havenâ€™t had time yet to get all this setup due to work.,i have 7 days holiday next week so iâ€™ll be fine tuning it all then.,given what you said though i donâ€™t think iâ€™ll bother overclocking it if it can turbo to 5.7 if needed.,thanks for your reply my friend very much appreciated ðÿ‘,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'm still running an overclocked 9600k.",it rarely hits workloads of 100% even when gaming in 4k.,i have three 120 mm fans on the tower.,"pushing, pushing and pulling, and pulling.",i was watching a linus tech tip video from a few years ago where using three fans on a cooler is slightly better than using one or two.,i find it comparable to water cooling.,you'll only get a few degrees better temps with water anyway.,so is it worth the value to do water cooling over air cooling?,for some i guess.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i was going to say that's not great being 100â° but the quest i've had to go on to push beyond the 350-400 watt range has been wild.,my delidded 10980xe using direct die with lapped waterblock is still >90â° at >430 watts so for a completely stock cpu to get to 340 watts without exotic cooling is not bad at all.,i don't like that it's 100â° but you gotta be realistic with your expectations if you're not going to go above and beyond for the cooling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i have been building pc's for 30 years

there are many things that help

pipes down

good mount

perfect spread

good case setup

good bios setup

spec llc with droop

1mm nylon washers in regards to lga 1700

many many things

all these small things add up
and that results in being able to cool 454w on a 280mm aio in my setup

im not the only person there are loads of people able to do this
but when you try telling the normies they just downvote you
and seem incapable of accepting they are doing things wrong

when i learn something new i accept it but it seems people these days are incapable learning things 

and are stuck in some sort of loop

my son's pc is also able to cool just as well as mine
as i set it up for him

i also fixed his friends pc that was unable to cool over 200w
it cools just fine to well over 300w with the same crappy corsair 280mm aio that was incapable of over 200w when he set it up",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

bios settings have nothing to do with cooling 450w.,"only the case air flow, paste and cooler position would affect that.",450w is more than most 360mm radiators can do in open air full fan speed and 10c delta over ambient.,doing that on a 280mm is certainly possible but the coolant would have to be uncomfortably hot.,especially if the radiator is in a case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i didnt say it does, but thats not strictly true you have to setup the fan curve in the bios properly, oh wait nobody know's how to do that these days and uses an external box thats software controled

and i didnt say its coolable at 454w i said thats the limit of my cooling 
i wouldnt like to keep it bouncing 2 cores off tj max at 454w for more than a few mins

i was infact talking about setting up the cpu properly or close to to intel spec
and not just whacking in random voltages and load line values (llc) and expecting to not have bad transients and such but yes in general cooling 454w isnt much to do with the bios


good job",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[removed],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for maximum cooling capacity that really isnâ€™t relevant as outside some special cases you would be running the fans at maximum.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"no shit sherlock
thats half of the problem though

alot of people here have no idea and have a corsair control box and such running the fans / aio at 600rpm and wonder why they can only cool 200w

my fans run at 100% when the thermistor under the cpu hits 45â°c
which is about 55â°c die temp this allows plenty of time for ramp delays

and also results in a silent pc for daily use

do you *need* 32gb of ram?,adding more ram when you already have enough will literally do nothing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
32gb of ram is becoming common in new enthusiast builds more because itâ€™s the *price* sweet spot in how vendors are selling ram.,most people definitely donâ€™t need more than 16gb of ram.,"while 32gb is definitely future proofing and good for niche tasks, itâ€™s more or less because ddr5 ram is like $100 for 16gb or $140 for 32gb.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i've been at 64gb for a couple years now, solely because cities: skylines eats so much damn memory and relying on pagefile destroys performance in game.",my typical game loads eat between 48-52gb of ram alone (~50 mods and 7000 assets).,even the base game with no mods at all is pushing 16gb these days with all the dlcs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ram is pretty cheap right about now, so might as well - e.g.",i just got 32gb of 3600 mhz cl16 ddr4 for about \~120 eur a couple of weeks ago.,should be good enough for the next several years!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"32gb is the new ""16gb is enough"" and has been for quite a while (a couple years).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"32gb is the new 16gb, wanna sit back and not worry just because yes, well, 32gb is your deal, although the only game that i've heard of benefiting from that much is scam citizen.",16 is absolutely fine for a good while.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s not.,people are using 32gb so often now because legitimate ddr5 kits only really start at 2x16gb.,"16gb is still the value sweet spot, because almost no games scale beyond that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"most boards support up to 64gbs of ram, so since sticks come in pairs and its the easiest way to max out - you buy 16gbx2 (32gb) now and if you bought another set down the road 16gb x 2 you're good.","if you don't plan on maxing your ram, you could go 8gbx2 (16gb) and be fine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i use 32gb ddr4 sodimms(cost bout 90$ total), never came close to maxing it yet.",no vram problems now tho.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i only ever saturated my 16gb of ram using a 7900xtx playing forza horizon 5 at max settings.,strangely though at the same settings i haven't hit my cap on my 4080. generally still have 2-3gb remaining.,in your situation i think you'll be fine with 16gb.,i watch videos in the background while playing games and haven't saturated my ram.,"if you ever run out of ram you can always add some later on, i wouldn't bother â€”  just have fun playing games.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
everything just eats up the ram these days 16gb of ram the last couple of years has been a struggle from time to time 32gb is just keeping ur mind at peace knowing an average user will prob never max it out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oddly enough i kept getting ram error codes from my motherboard (tried reseating) pair with my 12700kf and when i upgraded to 32gb the problem disappeared and been fine since.,i don't have in-depth knowledge so can't speculate that my mobo prefers 32gb to 16gb but found it odd.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for ddr5 you canâ€™t go lower.,itâ€™s where it starts.,"8gb sticks are bad, they are like trash ddr4 basically.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i come close to maxing out 16gb pretty often.,"if you just run one game at a time with maybe a few browser tabs open, 16 could be still fine.",but really depends on what you're doing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"32 has been the sweet spot for 16 years, \*literally\*",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you are only using that pc for gaming, just stay at 16gb.",just make sure it's dual channel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's more or less use case specific, there are certain games that are pretty ram hungry but they seem to be few and far between.",it's one of those situations where the price of ddr4 has dropped so much that it doesn't hurt to have extra in the event that you need it since you can get 32gb kits for dirt cheap at this point.,i would recommend faster ram if you're using ddr4 on a 12th gen and up cpu though as it really does make a difference on these processors.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16gb is still the standard but 32gb is a real nice to have especially ddr4 being cheap now.,"as someone who has 3 browsers and 50 tabs open and photoshop, it's very nice not closing anything to open a game.",purely just gaming 16 is still good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if youâ€™re on ddr5 itâ€™s the standard as i havenâ€™t seen 16gb kits.,"for ddr4 16gb is the minimum imo but if you rendering or something that requires more ram iâ€™d say 32-128gb depending on your needs
would be the sweet spot.","for strictly gaming, 16gb.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
32gb like in 2019?,"now 2023, everyone is running vms and mini k8s clusters in their computer.",128gb is bare minimum bro.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have 32gb because games like anno 1800 loves eating ram.,"also when i played battlefield 2042 back when it first released, 16gb wasn't cutting it.",fortnite (nanite and lumen on) also somehow uses 24gb of ram lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

one of the reasons 32gb is also making more sense is that due to the way ddr5 works it's actually going to be slower to run 16gb of ram.,"i am no expert on the matter, but it's similar to single vs dual rank or something along those lines and means effectively that with 16gb of ram you're limiting your speeds as well which does matter for gaming.","on ddr4, it's just what you said where it's $75 for 32gb and $45 for 16gb so just go bigger.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you are having the same issue as me.,"i noticed that when i ran cinebench, i would have my cpu pull 253w (pl2 limit set) and would draw on that power for about 30s and then limit down to 4.2ghz (its my pl1 limit of 125w so makes sense) till i stopped cinebench.",my temps were staying low 90s high 80s so it wasnt thermal throttle in my case and i just think its the power limit from pl2 and the duration set.,i think you need to set your pl1 (long term power limit) higher.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thanks for sharing your findings.,til i could inspect the ac and dc loadline values set by normal lite load (msi z790-a mobo).,"i've been using ""mode 7"", and hwinfo reports ac/dc ll to be 0.35/0.80 mohm.",any idea what unit the ac/dc ll values are under advanced lite load?,"first time i turned on advanced, ac/dc defaulted to 45/80.",could these be 1e-5 ohm (100 x mohm)?,> e.g.,"z690-a pro on llc8 has impedance of 1.00mohm, on llc4 it's already 0.28mohm

how did you find the llc impedance?",the manual and in-bios help only give unhelpful graphs of the 8 llc modes.,"for undervolting purposes, i want to manually set my dc ll to match whatever llc mode would be highest impedance, which i assume is llc8.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it will, you can set dc loadline to 10000, and you'll see all cpus report 0w power draw while running cinebench",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i didn't test that and quite honestly, i have no idea.","i'd expect dc loadline having no effect on pl1/2, but i'll check it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it does have an effect on pl1/2, i'm getting downclocked when i set pl to 220w and dc of 1.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the cpu is outputting the same amount of heat, but incorrectly setting dc loadline will cause reported power draw to become incorrect.",this is a flaw on every intel processor made in the last 10 years or so.,"amd also has an issue with power draw possibly being misreported, as the max current setting will effectively limit the maximum reported current draw to the cpu (the cpu will still pull more current than the limit if it needs to).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's explained in the text.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
units are dc x 100(mohm).,"good, that seem that *at least some* z790 boards set dc to be not equal to ac, but check if your vid matches vcore under full all core load (r23, y-cruncher, aida64 as example), that way your dc is being set correctly.","you don't need to know the value beforehand, you will end up knowing the value once you've set proper dc loadline empirically.","i also forgot to mention, that vcc sense voltage sensor has different impedances than socket sense.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"thanks, that's helpful to know.",i found the z790-a (msi.,"asus also has a mobo of the same name lol) has 8 llc modes plus an ""auto"" option.","the graph shown in the help text has 8 curves plus a ""no ov"" one that's lower than the rest.","it seems ""auto"" doesn't select any mode out of the 8 and uses this highest-impedance ""no ov"".",auto mode llc seems to be 1.0mohm after i set dc ll to 100 and saw vcore/vid match for the most part in cinebench r23.,"i also tested llc8, thinking it's 1.0mohm but got vcore > vid, so dc ll overestimated llc.",llc8 on this board is probably 0.8mohm?,i don't know.,"[cinebench r23 results](https://imgur.com/a/6kaqei1)

i figured you'd probably ask about it.,i did a quick aida64 before going to work + i don't want to go over 80 degrees for a long time.,6:30 of 100% load.,you have to believe me the temperature hovers between 85 and 88 for the whole time (i did a 1hr test right after i finished the build).,clocks for p-core hover between 5.5 and 5.8 all the time.,https://i.ibb.co/ysfggch/32.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my msi motherboard pushing 340watt everything stock and cinebench test i get 97-98 with a score of 40514 and the tjuction of the cpu is 100c so itâ€™s safe.,but i will not recommend a cheap aio tho,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"honestly, then something is wrong.",there is no aio on the planet that will cool over 300w sustained or even for a couple minutes.,im not calling you a liar by any means.,what im thinking is that your cpu isnt actually pulling that many watts.,maybe around 180-200w.,and if thats the case then yeah something isnt right.,the max is 253w intel limits.,and cpu pulls probably 300-330w with power limits disabled.,check your cpu package power under full load.,if its lower than 300 then your cpu isnt actually pulling that much power,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's kraken z73.,i was honestly shocked by my results.,"many testers on yt were reaching 100, even with 420mm aios.",i'm almost 100% sure it's getting full power when i was checking it with aida for the first time.,i remember the power draw chart was going over the scale lmao.,"i have no business lying, i'm literally just enjoying my rig.","on a side note, with the same cooler and paste, intel core i7 9700k had 23 degrees in idle and never reached anything over 62.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
id still look at cpu power draw when under cinebench r23.,just to make sure your cpu is actually pulling the right amount of watts.,"if its not then its a problem

like i said i am not calling you a liar, by all means enjoy your pc as its a beast of a cpu, just make sure everything is working correctly because even reviewers were doing tests on open air benches and it still hit 100c in seconds.....",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

looks like they're pulling 360w+ and it's actually in the range of temps i'm getting.","if something is wrong, please correct me.","i'm at work right now, so it's harder to focus ;)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you checked with load like prime95 or cinebench?,1 or 2 cores should hit max boost freq.,"another question is ""removing power limits"" what exactly do you mean?",because by default there's no limits to stop you from having boost clocks.,"however, 13700 will have higher frequency, question is, will you notice difference anywhere besides benchmarks?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4.9 is turbo 3.0. in my experience it *never* works.,"my 12700 only hits 4.8 during web browsing,  and 4.7 is the sustained actual 1 and 2 core turbo.","the only way to force 4.8 is to use a core parking program to turn off 65% of the cpu, then it hits 4.8 reliably but performance is terrible because everything has to run on 2 to 3 cores.","it's bullshit marketing and it's annoying because turbo 3.0 worked perfectly on older products, but now is basically vapoware.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
silicon lottery.,my 12700 boosts to 4.6 with pl2 set to unlimited in xtu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no worries about temps?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah im not sure if removing power limits is the correct description but basically i have it set to ""water cooler"" which i think allows for the highest power draw and then i also have all the sliders in xtu all the way up...i believe they are for sustained power draw (pl1/pl2).",well i'm hoping i will notice while gaming as my 12700 bottlenecks the 4080 in all the cod games ive tried but im not sure tbh...all the reviews i see are wiith a 13900k or a 5800x3d.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s not bullshit marketing.,"12700 is non k cpu, which i donâ€™t think is able to clock above stock because of how intel locks it down.",tvb3.0 is only available on i7/i9 k series cpu if iâ€™m not mistaken.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok yeah now i see why you were asking about cooling/temps...thing runs hot lol.,luckily for gaming its fine but i don't make it through benchmarks without hitting the tjm.,i might try a different paste and contact frame to see if it changes anything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i suppose its an msi mobo because i haven't seen other vendors limit power by cooling system u use lol.,"to make sure you can use hwinfo64+prime95 or similar software occt, anything.",just make sure one of the cores hit 4.9 and power cpu draws is same as datasheet says,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you are mistaken.,turbo 3.0 was put into windows and doesn't do anything.,"and it doesn't matter if the cpu is locked, turbo 3.0 is part of the boost profile for all modern intel cpus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you're complaining that your current cpu isnt going any further than some clocks, debating on which clocks you may have with unlocked (!!)",power on a difference 253w cpu while not touching the cooling part at all.,"is that for a reason, or do you not care and don't want to put those temps and cooling into your equation?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
!,[gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|trollface),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12700 can boost two preferred cores up to 4.9ghz if conditions are met.,works fine on my 12900k and windows 11 (i had no issue getting 5.2 to register in hwinfo64).,"with that said, i think tvb, if enabled, overrides tbm3.","like after enabling tvb+1 i saw 5.2 on all cores, and tvb+2 5.3ghz, but never higher.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i see...well i have 360 deepcool aio so hopefully it's enough.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i personally have taped it over after a few days.,i didnt know about the led control software tho,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the a750 doesn't have controls for its led lighting.,black tape is my suggestion.,"otherwise, you'll have to open up the card and pull out the led cable thats powering it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i figured that much by now.,"it's really a shame, just a simple dip switch on the side of the board offering maybe 0%-33%-66%-100% would such an appreciated quality of life improvement.","i don't mind the branding, just don't make it a glowing sun.",it's taped over with some transparent but really dark packaging film i had laying around now (subjectively blocking 90%+ of the light): https://i.imgur.com/fpixw0m.jpg i like it - it's fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i agree.,"i mean, what's the point of putting leds on a gpu if you won't let users control it.",or at the very least an on/off toggle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i guess we will never know.,"meteor lake seems to be mobile processor only, since raptor lake refresh is coming late 2023.
arrow lake (mtl successor) should definitely see bump in e cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mtl will be mobile only and that is the critical part as current chips are at huge disadvantage against 5/4nm chips.,raptor lake is more than competent against zen 4. arrow lake should provide huge advantage for intel across the board as that will be on gaafet.,"unless amd leverages samsung 3nm for gaafet, they wont have it in that timeframe.",but that is lots of ifs/buts.,let us see how this year goes and then revisit 2024.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"supposedly, raptor lake is the next desktop range that'll focus mainly on efficiency (as in power draw) which i think is really needed.","obviously there'll be some performance increases, but nothing major.","i'm honestly excited for whatever the next big cpu thing is, because the 4090 really makes a lot of games cpu bottlenecked nowadays.",7000x3d chips are right round the corner which will most likely be the faster gaming chips on the market for a few years now.,i just wonder if intel has something unique like the e-core idea in mind.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think desktop meteor lake is tbd, i think mld and others was saying highest end desktop product was 6 p core i5 only or something mid range.",itâ€™s looking like raptor lake for the i7 and i9 again.,its like skylake all over again.,i hope we donâ€™t get a 15100f clocked at 5gigs because intel keeps speed bumping raptor lake because meteor lake is not ready.,zen5 i think the ccds are going 12 core up from 8. so a 50% core bump across the line.,plus x3d and amd probably chugs along for the next few years on am5.,probably get to 200mb of cache or some crazy number.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just going to toss this out.,everyone does realize that the 7xxx series zen was meant for launch in 2021 not 2022 right?,i have a feeling we will see stacked 3d v-cache on upcoming model in 2023. i love this battle we have again!,an i5/i7 with e-cores at wonderful price points!,consumers win as long as covid doesn't wreck havoc again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the budget audience doesn't really need e cores.,and dont expect much from meteor lake.,"an efficiency boost, but mainly a mobile-based product meant as a proving ground for intel 4 and mcm consumer packaging.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol.,n3 isnâ€™t 50% denser than n5.,"50% core bump means a lot more die space, meaning it will get a lot more expensive to make one ccd.",the reason intel can chug out e cores like water is because e cores are super die-space efficient (4 e cores only take a space of 1 p core).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mlid.,"100% rdna3 performance gains, destroys ada lovelace.","arc is dead everywhere, no more development, no battlemage, forgetting the fact that thereâ€™s still data server and igpu where they need it.","oh yeah, this video also had a lot of mlid crying about intel calling out his lie about the a780.",salty much?,"oh yeah, 6 core suspiciously matches the top end for mobile cpu configs, p and u series, instead of any desktop chip configuration.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"are you really referring to mlid, the amd fanboy poster child, that is as accurate as a broken clock?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe with the lithography reduction on zen5 they'll be able to fit more chiplets on a single die for additional cores?,"but that's just wishful thinking lol, though bringing the 3d v-cache to more than *one* cpu this time around is nice.",hopefully we'll finally get a r5 that has it.,"tbh intel always takes forever to get a new manufacturing node ""ready"" for mass production, but i would've assumed they wouldn't stick to 10nm for longer than the current mobo chipsets.","at this point though, i think i'd be happy to just see the i3s get some love.","though without any direct competitor from amd, they will likely keep making at least one 4p + 0e i3 for now.",i was really surprised to see the 13400/13500 get e-cores.,"i guess that's why i'm really eager to see a desktop i3 finally get some, since even mobile alder lake i3s have 2p + 8e configurations (i3-1220p).","if they ever decide to bring back a -k sku i3, like maybe a 14350k with 4p + 4e, for less than what they'd sell the i5s for i bet they'd fly off the shelves.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did you see the announcement?,"amd already has the 7950x3d, 7900x3d, and the 7800x3d that will be released soon.",they've also introduced non-x 65w tdp versions of the lineup.,"honestly it's a good thing they're getting all of this out of the way now, instead of how they waited until early 2022 to do it for zen3.",raptor lake was definitely another gen from intel that's forcing them to try and keep up lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"eh, i would argue budget audience would definitely benefit from e cores.","for cpus with 2 p cores, e cores will help with bottlenecking in games.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah thatâ€™s true but if you look at it from a gen over gen process issue then amd has buffer since 7nm to 5nm didnâ€™t get a core bump.,i donâ€™t know the details from7nm to 3nm at tsmc but it should be much more palatable if you compare from 7nm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the â€œforeverâ€ happens i think because they were trying to get 7nm with duv.,once euv is in place (which it should be now) i donâ€™t expect much delay with intel 4 and 3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah i am with you, they had it in their pockets.",i think they will try and shoot for a x3d  next-gen version this year as well to gain traction back.,again this is great for us consumers!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
n3 wafers will be much more expensive.,and even n7 to n3 isnâ€™t 50% density increase.,"if amd wants to, they could do it.",but their margin will take a beating.,and i donâ€™t think thatâ€™s what their shareholders want.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just buy a pci-e wifi card.,much easier.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i used to have an asrock z390 taichi before it failed around 3 years ago and if you take off the cover and remove the wifi housing, you can upgrade it to an ax200 or ax210, don't use a wifi card that ends with 1 (ax201,ax211) as that's cnvi 2 (most z390 use cnvi - not compatible with cannon point based chipsets) and your board doesn't support anything but type e (since it came with a 9260 and not a 9560 which is cnvi1) so there you go.",oh and iirc mine came with an intel 3168 so i'm guessing you have the taichi ultimate however everything i said still applies.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

do you have the game installed in ssd or hdd?,my brother had the same problem with rx 6700 and when he moved the game to ssd the stutters gone!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

at least show your  specs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hdd of 4tb, my ssd is dedicated to windows",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
stuttering,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hdd or full spec?,the game is on a 5400rpm 64mb cache wd blue of 4tb.,"rest is i7-10700f, a770 le, 2x8 cl16 ballistix 3200mhz ddr4.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea that's the problem the game is stuttery mess in hdd,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"definitely the hdd indeed, more and more recent games do not cope well with an hdd.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sounds like dx12 stuttering, but like a million times worse than most people experience.","you've probably already tried updating drivers, but that's my first suggestion.","i would update them across the board, not just gpu.",i'd also run a benchmark after updating them to see if your components are performing in the expected ranges.,userbenchmark is a free option that you could try.,"random thought, is your gpu in the first pcie slot?","if you installed it lower, it might not perform to specs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
get a 7200 rpm hard drive.,"the problem is that you are running the game on a hard drive that slow, you don't need an ssd.",a 7200 rpm hard drive can run mw2(source me) and  i use a 7200rpm 2tb seagate for games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"f, i donâ€™t have any ssd for games and didnâ€™t plan to buy one.",never had any prob for games on hdd like this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have it on my hdd an it doesn't stutter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i now have a nvme ssd and it works fine, no more stutter and its smooth af with ultra settings",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
first pcie slot as it is the reinforced one.,"i dunno, why would dx12 stutter just for the first 2 min of a match then disappear?",stuttering would likely occur everytime and in solo if it was dx prob?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah the faster the hdd the smoother the game.,"i will check my two other hdd, they may be faster.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"its going to be a more prominent issue going forward, more and more games are designed for ssd.","you should invest in an m2 ssd, they're pretty affordable now, you can get a solid 1t for 100 bucks, hdds are probably going to be relegated to big media drives in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my hdd has 7200rpm and ~~60mb~~ 256mb cache.,i can run mw2 fine.,edit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dx12 had a unique way of loading shaders which causes stuttering the first time you load an area.,usually you get a few stutters early then it smoothes out.,but if there is some kind of driver issue it might not load textures and have prolonged stuttering.,that's just my guess without looking at the bench marks.,"also, is resizable bar turned on?",have you run ddu and fresh installed drivers?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok good luck.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

mine is actually a samsung 2.5 120gb.,what the best between m2 and 2.5 correlated to gb/tb size?,m2 for windows or games?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is no reason as of yet to buy an nvme over a regular sata ssd for games.,there isnâ€™t a game out there that can benefit from an nvme gen 3+.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i mean, they might start doing that.","consoles however are what most games are designed for first, we're only really getting into a situation where (3rd party) games are starting to take advantage of the really, really fast loading of platforms like the ps5, and osme of that is going to have to spill over to pc",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i don't understand why their can't be a sticky on how 12th/13th gen new users can get their temps down.,it is fairly easy to do if you take your time and it hardly what i would call rocket science.,i am sure any redditor here who has spent time with a 12th gen/13th gen could prove useful insight.,also they could include lesser known tips like lowering the sa voltage from auto or plugging in both eps 12v pci-e plugs in.,as soon as they enter the sub reddit if they having cooling/overheating issues they see it straight away.,"it like nearly every other post here is about some user having issue with a 12th gen and definitely the 13 th gen.

they could see the stickied post and try following the tips there.",if they  get stuck they can post for more in depth help and explaination.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hopefully you will be including the lite load issue for 13th gen chips.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"iâ€™d say no, because youâ€™re telling them the chip is not tuned to handle maximum loads.","â€”though you can tell
them such tests definitely far, far exceed normal use!",(you donâ€™t want to tell people the chip canâ€™t run programs.),"but you should point them in the direction of settings that ensure max loads can be run safely if that is what they want (power limits on, and lowering llc/liteload setting).",setting power limits on is easy and safe.,"but for llc or lite load setting change, youâ€™d have to mention having to run a check for stability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what issue?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes plugging in both eps 12 v in lowers the temps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most mobos seem to be setting the stock voltage too high on 13th gen which is making up most overheating threads currently.,"the lite load settings, also called ac_ll / dc_ll are set too high out of the box leading to instant 100c at stock settings, and for some reason aibs expect users to reduce these settings themselves.","funnily the issue is only present when trying to run 13th gen chips at stock, everyones that manually tuned and overclocked end up with far lower temps because the maximum ocs these chips can do takes even less than the voltage they use at stock settings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wait really?,i've never heard anything like that and a quick search didn't return anything either.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have very hard time figuring out a technical reason why that should be the case.,both eps cables feed the motherboard vrms which regulates the cpu power.,having two or one connected makes no difference for cpu power unless you go over the capacity of one cable (which is very unlikely outside extreme overclocking).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this!,and making sure power limits (tdp 253w on 13900) are on.,"my mobo switched me to no power limits when i answered a question about my cooler (i use an aio, but it definitely canâ€™t handle no power limit at max loads with a 13900k.)",(actually the mobo set a power limit of 4kwâ€¦!,but that is unlimited. ),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i never knew this until recently.,so myself and this other redditor were helping a fellow 13th gen user getting lower temps with tips and tricks.,he/she mentioned the eps 12v and how they should all be plugged in.,now i know i only had one plugged in as i wasnâ€™t concerned with overclocking.,funny thing is undervolting and that other jazz is overclocking as well.,so i plugged the other eps12v mine has 2x8 pci-e plugs and i will admit i was taken back when the temps were lower by quite a bit as well.,i do not know the reason why it lower temps but you can try for yourself if you have 2xeps 12v sockets and see if it works for you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you have a mother board with two eps plugs try for yourself with one and two plugged in.,use something like hardware info to monitor temps,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i just tried on my pc, and while my temps didn't seem much different it felt as if my fans didn't get as loud.","i might do more tests later, for now i just ran two quick benchmarks (occt and cinebench r23), so take this with a grain of salt as there are many more factors affecting the temperatures.","btw, what motherboard are you using?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

issue:â i started having some issues like usb ports not working anymore and some bsod, so i decided to reinstall windows so when i try to install the os i got error 0xc0000005 or 0x8007025d, after google it and reading that those are drivers or storage issues i tried with the other's ssd but getting the same issue, also tried to install windows 10 and got same issue  
have you done any troubleshooting?","can you reproduce the issue?â i   
i tried the following:  
\* updating bios  
\* clear cmos  
\* remove 1 stick of ram (individually)  
\* switching ram sticks  
\* no oc at all  
\* remove all ssd and test to install one by one (no success)  
\* test ssd using crystaldisk, all good  
after all this, i installed windows using another computer with hyper v, it was able to boot but when i tried to install audio, gpu, drivers and any other program i started getting the same error on window event logger so last thing i tried was switching the cpu, bought an i7 13700k and it works flawlessly no errors at all so no idea whats wrong with the i9 13900k

- updating bios
- clear cmos
- remove 1 stick of ram (individually)
- switching ram sticks
- no oc at all
- remove all ssd and test to install one by one (no success)
- test ssd using crystaldisk, all good

after all this, i installed windows using another computer with hyper v, it was able to boot but when i tried to install audio, gpu, drivers and any other program i started getting the same error on window event logger so last thing i tried was switching the cpu, bought an i7 13700k and it works flawlessly no errors at all so no idea whats wrong with the i9 13900k should i get rma?","msi meg ace z690

if you did the frame correction mod, it may also cause instability if the screws are overtightened.","if you are able to remove the heatsink for troubleshooting, check the motherboard for bend pins while you're at it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

nice to see someone get one.,i'm ready to give my money to the first online store here in the u.s. with one available.,i missed the release and it's out of stock everywhere here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cinebench r23 results please,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
congrats op!,enjoy it for us.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i've been saying this is the real gem of the 13th gen lineup.,"for the price, imo it's the best chip for most new builders.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
awesome!,thinking thisâ€™ll be the best value non-k 13th gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how much did you pay?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can they overclock on external bclk motherboards like 12th gen?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i heard anything below 13600k is not raptor lake.,is that true?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my mate upgraded from a i5 10th gen to this chip, runs cool and has tons of performance.",great chip,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"what are scores mate, like cinebench , 3d mark , cpu z",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
excited for you.,i'm thinking of this or the 13600 for a plex and small game server.,hoping to see them in stores soon and a few reviews benchmarks online.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is the price on these?,from the benchmarks it looks as though at max power level it almost matches the 12700k and 5900x for multi threaded performance.,"iâ€™m not really interested in upgrading my 12600k anytime soon, but itâ€™s great to see intelâ€™s continual progress in the budget market.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just had a look at some synthetic benchmarks and damn it is beating my 5900x in single thread!,impressive stuff for the price on this chip.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14 cores right?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gongrats.is it worth it next year this time upgrade from i5 10400f to this one?please share your opinion.thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
receiving mine tomorrow !,"need to update the b660 i've purchased, hopefully, it has a bios flashback button",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wait what?,i thought it was the 13600k?,what happened?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so what's better for gaming performance between this and 13500k if i'm not interested in overclocking?,is it worth the extra â£50 difference in price?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
congrats !,i love my i5 raptor !,!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

u/mirrorlessgeeks : what motherboard are you planning to use with this cpu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just got a 13500. what air cooler are you using with it ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
opinions vs 5600x?,"looking to upgrade, need more frames in my tac fps which is mostly few-core intensive.",need to build pc for friend so can pass down 5600x build if this better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
crazy how far i5s have come.,"for years they were just quad cores without ht, now they're deca-core powerhouses that can be used for gaming and even workstation/server scenarios.","well, i'd imagine someone wanting to do some more intensive workstation stuff would want to go for an i7/i9 but the fact that even the lowest tiered i5 (13400) in the lineup has a whopping 16 total threads is honestly amazing.","i'm glad amd pushed intel to get serious, otherwise they might still have only 4 total threads to this day lol.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yup, although it's quite depressing having this box on my desk and no computer to use it lol... i sold my i5 9400f system to do a full rebuild.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it is almost up there with 5950x, seeing how 13600k is actually better than 5950x in some case.","i still wish they do something to i3, i3 is underwhelming.",intel should have give them 6+0 or 4+4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how does it compare to 12700f that i was about to get but didnt and thinking about 13500 :d ?,i mainly care about gaming and ideally would like ddr4 instead of ddr5 and need it to last 4-5 years :d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

does it really matter?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
where are you getting the benchmarks?,i've been waiting to see how price/performance pans out after this latest round from intel & amd but haven't seen anything yet.,which is strange because they're available in stores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah giving 6 p-cores seems overkill for i3.,"good value for consumers, not good for intelâ€™s business.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
worth the extra money that you will have to spend on z790 board ?,somehow 13500 is like 70$ cheaper here lmao,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a 13500 is not a 13600k just with lower clocks, so you can't say they saved $86.",the 13500 uses the alder lake 8p+8e die.,it's basically akin to a 12600k with 4 more e-cores with locked sa but comes with a heatsink.,"with current canadian list prices neither the 13100, 13400, nor 13500 are better deals than what we had over the last month with existing 12th/13th gen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i sold my i5 9400f setup and to be honest i didn't get much for it lol.,so any savings towards other components was necessary!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"nah, the 13100 is just a up clocked 12100.  basically no change between 13100 and 12100 other than a few hundred mhz boost clock speed bump.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it does become even better for a budget build a year later though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

11400 is unfortunately locked down.,"meaning no official overclocking supported, and non-official is limited through bclk overclock.","you can bclk overclock the chip to 102.7-103mhz and achieve 4.3ghz - 4.35ghz

something else you can and should do is change the cache limit to maximum.","i'm not sure what max cache limit is on the 11400, but you can set the min/man cache limit to the same value to lock this in and prevent cache downclock when the cpu is loaded which will give a small perf bump as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"because 4.4 is single core boost, 4.2 is all core.","use bclk of 103mhz and it'll be 4.35ghz, guaranteed to work flawlessly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
windows task manager showed average clock speed for all cores.,hardware info can show peak clock speeds for individual cores.,there you will see some cores do infact reach single core clock speed of 4.4 ghz.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks guys.,i will wait for my aio return from rma and will try some tweak on bclk.,it remembers the oc on old core 2 duo e pentium dual core.,but i don't need to care to anything else?,just need to increasing the bclk?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"theoretically you also need to look out for memory controller related voltages (system agent and vdd2) too, especially if you're with 3600mhz kit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you using the arc driver?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel has a â€œhiddenâ€ power management called power balance - you can control it via throttlestop (and also a few other ways).,you might be able to get something out of this.,"for most games, a hard balance of 1 for cpu and 31 for gpu provides a fairly substantial power boost.",depending on your temperatures you can also increase the tdp of the processor (same app).,"finally, you can adjust epp (throttle stop calls this something different - i think they call it speed shift).","besides what others mentioned, itâ€™s possibly also your cpu is thermal throttling, so you want to be paying attention to temperatures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it must be tdp then.,i guess it's no wonder that bulkier laptops with exactly the same specs go a bit further gaming-wise,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

case?,"galax andromeda, iâ´am pretty sure.",i have one :).,itâ´s among the few ones that supports 3x140mm fans in the front.,excellent case.,"i have 2x120mm fans at the top, 1x140mm in the back, 3x140mm from arctic freezer ii in the front with + 3x140mm pushing fresh air into the front.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how do you like the cpu and how is it getting along with the 3080?,kinda looking for a new cpu for mine and thinking about intel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"nice, that motherboard is great",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would be perfect if you got rog gpu but otherwise it is simple and nice build,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3080 8gb?,whats the story behind that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"lmao, you are right.",i already bought a sag bracket and installed it.,it looks much better now,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"got it today and installed it, looks much better now lol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thank you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s an evga rtx 3080,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"mostly price, i was initially gonna get the 12gen i9 but ended up going with 13gen i7, theyâ€™re pretty much the same price range.","the 13gen i9 seemed unnecessary for me, since the 13gen can easily handle most games i play
but i am upgrading my gpu to a 4070ti",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"already installed, yeah thing gpu was sagging heavy lol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"itâ€™s a corsair 4000, i wish it had enough room for 3 fans on the top lol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™m bottlenecked by my gpu, my cpu never goes above 40-50% while gaming, the only way iâ€™ve been able to push it higher is by running benchmarks or stressing the cpu directly.","so i just sold my 3080 and bought a 4070 ti , itâ€™s on the way lol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i sold my 3080 after 5 days and have a 4070ti on the way lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you.,"it was a life long dream lol, finally got to the point where i could afford it 
also upgraded my gpu from 3080 to 4070ti",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"those are very hard to find and hella expensive, i really wanted one but ended up settling on evga.",but iâ€™m not happy with the 3080 so i just sold it and bought a asus tuff 4070 ti lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

how many different architectures do their cpus use now?,"ive seen arm, risc-v, x86, and whatever me uses (iirc it's 90's intel risc core).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's a total mess dude.,this is basically the movidius company's ip which they acquired a number of years ago,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it doesnâ€™t matter what cpus do internally.,what matters is the binary interface that is shown to programmers.,the internal workings is basically just messaging between different parts of the chip.,a â€œriscâ€ system just means the processor uses simple instructions or even direct micro operations (which are basically literal control signals to turn registers or processing units on and off) that tells it to do something and doesnâ€™t use resources to encode those in a too fancy way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you work in a store or something,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is msrp on the 13400?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh look!,glad the rebadged 12600ks are  in stock now :d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bros scalping or works at a tech store.,there's only two reasons to have that many.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"does your store recommend 10400 or 12100, 12700k or 13600k, 12900k or 13700k?",if you don't mind me asking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would be interesting to know if this is alder lake (c0 stepping) or raptor lake (b0 stepping).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when is the giveaway?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol how much did you buy?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"do 13100/f, 13400/f, 13500 processors work with 12th and 13th generation motherboards?",i couldn't find official support on their *support* page.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
does this mean they'll be available the same day intel officially announces them for ces?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i want to get a new pc and give my old one to my brother.,i had 12100f and 6700 compo in mind but now i have to worry about the motherboard having bios flash for a h610 board because i really want that 13100f.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can i ask what tech store and which country?,i'm interested if they are already selling it to wholesalers and retailers in europe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 13400f is out?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i couldn't work in a place like this.,my whole paycheck would be gone every payday.,"sometimes i hate i don't live by an awesome pc store, then i remember the stupid amount of shit i'd buy at compusa back in the day (only semi related pc store i hade near me ever)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep.,i'm a tech guy in a store.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think it's $240 or $215, one of the two",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
at least they give it to us cheaper and with a cooler now!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do 13th gen none k still have vccsa locked?,if so then it's worthless compared to 12600k as you can't xmp/oc your ram worth of shit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"tech store, right.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i wouldn't say scalping if they sell it around msrp... you do realize people can buy the cpus in bulk directly from intel and get them for cheaper right?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we don't sell 10th 11th gen intel cpu's only 12&13s.,"we run many benchmark test on many many setups, my opinion is 12100, 13600k, 13700k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"13600k = 12900k, at least for gaming",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
definitely c0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
looks like he works in a retail store,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12th gen mobo prolly needs a bios update.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bro?,it literally says lga1700 on the box.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
scalper lacking simple platform knowledgeâ€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you misunderstood me guys, thanks for your *downvotes*.","i meant on the motherboard manufacturers support page that there is no official bios support for 13100/f, 13400/f, 13500 processors.","also, yes, i know it says lga1700.","and yes, i build dozens of computers for my clients.",https://www.msi.com/motherboard/meg-z790-godlike/support#cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bro?,look at the box.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's because these cpus are still under embargo.,"that means no official mention of their existence, no photos, nothing (*yes, that means you should not be posting photos like these, as it is breaking nda*).","once the embargo lifts, there will be reviews and official support.",https://ark.intel.com is the website which houses the specs for all intel products and will contain all the details of these processors once they officially launch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you posted the photo, and why the hell on earth are you even asking such a cant-be-more-dumb question???","you must be ""spy"" of intel tripping us...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there is a no data page on [ark.intel](https://ark.intel) for 13100f, 13400/f & 13500.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm going for the 13400f next year i have a 12100f too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 13100f is the same as the 12100f except for slightly higher clock speeds.,"it's not a real raptor lake processor, it's still using the alder lake architecture and literally everything except the clock speeds are exactly the same.",not worth the upgrade if you own a 12100f already.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
op works in a retail store.,"theyâ€™re gonna be announced at ces i think, in a few days",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is it hard to work there?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
then i am glad having moved to amd this time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wait the 13th gen ones are cheaper?,?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah but that always seems sus to me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes the problem is that i usually only need one cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"intel does not sell directly to retailers or sis, they use a network of distributors.",unless youâ€™re a company the size of dell or hp youâ€™ll never buy directly from intel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you guys have 13400/13400f models with b0 stepping or only c0?,"if you also have b0 models and you run benchmarks you could see if there are differences between b0 and c0, e.g.",benchmark scores and power consumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so?,there have been cpus that don't work with motherboards that have their socket.,it's a fair question,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i mean, of course there isn't any bios available for them yet since they haven't been officially released yet.",the bios updates are at least a couple of weeks away since the cpus will only likely be officially announced during ces.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"also, we can't open and test a processor box and a motherboard in random.",no customer wants to buy an opened product.,"that's why i wanted to ask here, but i think i made a mistake...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
he isn't under embargo though.,that's for tech tubers as far as reviews go,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, i only install 13 generation processors on **x670** motherboards.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ah ok.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's a hard ware,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"people are buying computers like a crazy, some guys building full of rog setup, some of corsair setup, also new [nzxt cases](https://nzxt.com/product/h5-flow) are very hyped nowadays.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you do realize that's a 10 core cpu for $240?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 13400 is identical to 12600k, the 13500 is stronger.",how much is the amd equivalent?,"not saying anything against them, they popped off during zen2 and 3, but intel has won this year",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah.,i can definitely relate.,i have the i5-12600k.,"i've always used intel and never once used amd, but i'm upgrading to the ryzen 9 7900x.",the 7900x3d is supposed to be announced in january and that's what i'm gonna get.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
core count for core count yes.,"12600k/kf was the only i5 with both p and e cores, all the other i5s had p cores only.","with 13th gen you are now getting e cores on all i5s, and the locked i5 13th gen cpus have the same p and e core count as the 12600k/kf, while the 13600k/kf goes from 6p4e to 6p8e.","plus now you get a boxed cooler with an i5 w/ e cores, saving money for budget builds!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how's that sus?,"business do it all the time, they just don't show pictures of it or explain the process lol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and thats perfectly valid to buy only what you need!,but what i'm talking about is the business opportunity a lot of folks forget about when calling someone a scalper just because they have more than what one could actually need.,"it's not really fair to call someone a scalper just because they buy things in bulk (like any other business does), before they are out, so they can have inventory on day 1 of release.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but its widely known lga 1700 support the two generations 12 and 13th gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, i know, i checked many official sources but there is a no info for these cpu's.",thank you for understanding me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"donâ€™t care about the downvotes, like 30 stupid people downvoted you but there are thousands of people who saw this post.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but surely it still implies that people who somehow get their hands on it aren't allowed to just make it public as well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"upon receiving engineering samples and/or proper units for retail, you (or the company you work for) are also held liable for not releasing any information regarding these products until they are publicly released and also that engineering samples are sent back to intel and not resold (though a lot of people still take the risk to get a few quick bucks).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
aslo new [nzxt keyboard's](https://nzxt.com/product/function-minitkl-english-ansi#) switches cool af.,it has f13 key.,"i wouldn't really like the nzxt brand, but i think they're going to produce something nicer in the new year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
amd doesn't really have a true equivalent to the 12600k.,5800x is the closest but the 12600k outclasses it in almost every way for the same price.,"12600k can maybe compare to 7600x but that guy gets more fps, so it's like in between a 5800x and 7600x.",12600k and 7600x have pretty good tools for editing and streaming while 5800x cannot encode.,i root for amd but i have to give it to intel this year for underdog and best price/$$$ (besides amd's 5600 as the real best budget offering imo),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you're gaming i don't think there's much point upgrading.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i sold my 10105f paired with my asus prime b560m-k and 16gb crucial ballistix ddr4 for a good price last month.,i was planning to get the 12400/12500 or wait for the 13400. but i got so tired of the constant platform renewal every two generations of intel processors ~ rinse and repeat.,"thus, i went for the ryzen 5600 and gigabyte b450m-h which supported the cpu out of the box.",i paid around 154 usd for both in my home country (taiwan) and i am so glad about it.,"my main motivation was saving money, reuse my cooler master hyper evo 212 v2 and wait for am5 to mature as well as ddr5 to lower its price.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
correcting you: the 13400 is 6+4 and the 13500 is 6+8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
exactly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no it's not.,your average person won't have any idea.,even your average pc gamer won't know that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, they are as long as they didn't sign anything",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they didn't sign an nda, and intel won't come after individuals.","larger companies get in trouble, just like newegg did back in 2021 for releasing early 12th gen processors to some customers accidentally",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, but no one signs an implicit nda for having a product that's not released yet.","a company could surely be held liable though, but i doubt intel will come after individuals for posting a picture of a pre-released product.","newegg made a mistake in late 2021 in making available early 12th gen samples prior to the official  release of 12th gen processors and merely ""requested"" users not to post about it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lmao f13???,first time i heard of that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, the 5600 has great value.",maybe the 13100f will be able to topple it from the budget throne?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it makes sense for me.,i play star citizen and it conflicts with the e cores big time.,you have to disable all e cores or set the affinity in the shortcut or you get insane stuttering.,it's annoying and i want something that doesn't have p and e cores.,"i don't really need a 7950x, and a 7700x would work just fine, but i want the 7900 variant.",do i need to upgrade?,definitely not.,it would help in star citizen a bit though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you got tired of platform renewal and therefore you went to an end-of-life amd platform?,"what's the logic behind this, i don't get it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"honestly, the 12600k or 13600k are worth the money.",the 12600k outperforms the i9-11900k.,and the 13600k is up to 30% faster than the 12600k.,good value imo.,it's a great processor.,the only reason i'm upgrading my 12600k to a 7900x is because i play star citizen and it has issues with the e cores and you gotta fuck with some stuff to get it it to run right.,you have to disable all the e cores or set the affinity.,it's annoying and i don't want a p and e core cpu since i play star citizen so much.,i would recommend the 12600k or 13600k to anyone,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hmm interesting, so intel keeps segmenting the i5s in weird ways...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

they go all the way up to f24 iirc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
some spinal tap level marketing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13100f maybe!,but i'm thinking 5600 is going to be *the* $100 cpu soon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dayyum i wanted to play that game once.,hopefully they get a fix.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah, you can of course see it from this perspective, but for me it did not make sense to upgrade to 10400 or 11400. changing to lga 1700 requires more money to put into the cpu and motherboard.","to get what i wanted and stay within my budget, am4 made most sense for me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i love my 13600k, does it all for me:)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the i5 has always been weird.,"dont get me wrong, it has great mid-high end value but they have the 12400, 12500, 12600, and 12600k right now with the first 3 being basically the same.",not to mention the f variants of the 400 and the k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"they work at a store, op doesn't own those as far as i can tell",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's not slower, there about the same.",you might be thinking of the 5800x3d.,the 5800x3d does better in gaming than the 7700x.,i don't just game either.,"plus, i'm waiting for the 7900x3d that's gonna be announced in january and i guarantee the extra vcache in the 7900x3d will make it better in gaming than the 7700x3d (or 7800x3d if they call it that)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
honestly right now the 12600k/kf at a good discounted price (~â‚¬200) is the best deal.,you get a unlocked cpu that can do great oc with a z690 mobo.,"if i were choosing between 12600k/kf or 13500 for the same price, i would go with 12600k/kf without thinking too much.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i see my animosity was completely unwarranted.,i apologize for that.,im just so use to scalpers and their lack of knowledge sometimes i get a little frustrated.,sorry for misunderstanding.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ye he clarified, i apologize",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2 ccx zen cpus (this applied to zen 3 as well) can be slower in certain scenarios (related to gaming) than their 1 ccx counterparts likely due to drawbacks with that design layout and possible clock/power gating from the extra cores.,the 7950x in particular you can increase it's gaming performance in certain situations by forcing everything to 1 ccx.,"it's akin to the situation you are running into with e-cores with star citizen, although the mechanisms are not identical.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7800x3d will be faster for gaming than 7900x3d (if that even gonna exist).,there are issues with communication between two chiplets which lowers gaming performance.,it has already been proven than disabling one ccx on ryzen 9 boosts gaming performance a bit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i hve it at around 300$ cad rn, probably gonna pick it up",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no problem mate.,have a good day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"we will have to see, but i've been researching and from what i can see right now, the 7900x rarely ever gets more than 10 extra fps than the 7700x.","i personally haven't actually seen a gaming fps benchmark that shows the 7700x beating the 7900x, but like i said before, when i see the 7900x win, it's only by a few extra fps.",so it looks like i'll be getting the 7800x3d when it comes out.,i'm guessing it will be about the same price as a regular 7900x anyway and i'm sure the 7800x3d will have a significant increase in gaming performance over the 7900x for sure.,"but yeah, rumor has it that on january 23rd, they're announcing a 7700x3d or 7800x3d whatever they decide to call it.","a 7900x3d, and a 7950x3d as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i don't really get the question or see the problem here because you should enable xmp becuz you want to use the max speed your ram is capable of but if your usual temps are around 45 and it increased by 5-10 after enabling xmp that means from what i see ur temps are around 50-60 in loads but that's pretty normal no?,my cpu hovers around 60-70 degrees in gaming and video editing if ur wondering what game the most demanding title i have is fh5 which my settings are all maxed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i've got the same cpu, i did a slight undervolt (i can double check to what if you like) on mine and raised the clocks a bit, a mix of 5.1 and 5ghz on the p cores and 4ghz on the e cores.",temps at max got up to 70â°c on the package but only during benchmarking (still yet to try on cinebench).,"the temps don't go that high while gaming, everything's stable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
enabling xmp has increased my temps and power draw aswell on a 12600k.,went from 160w to 200w and the temps went up.,partly because it puts more stress on the memory controller but could be wrong.,havent had any stutters so far on my pc so not sure what the issue with your ram when it comes to the stutters.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45â°c on the cpu?,dude you are fine.,if it changes from that to 55 to 60 â° c is ok for a cpu.,"as for fps drops , check your game settings and tweak them to get stable fps.",your hardware should be able to perform really good in 1440p.,i do not own a 3080 or the 12700 so just check benchmarks for the perticular hardware combinations.,your ram or xmp shouldn't damage your cpu or gpu.,"just make sure your ram sticks are matched, you haven't mentioned anything about the timings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if i play war zone i get in the high 60s and occasionally break 70c which concerns me and thatâ€™s on basic settings.,i have a corsair icue h100i (240mm) which i read should be sufficient for my set up especially given that i donâ€™t overclock.,"most other games, my setup runs very easily and at low temps.",it was just very odd that it dropped frames that one time so drastically.,my psu is a 750w 80 gold.,which is also enough for my system (the 3080 only recommends at 850 if you oc).,iâ€™m really overprotective of this system lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you by chance know what the undervolt was?,iâ€™m extremely new with overclocking.,the extend of my oc experience is turning on xmp last night.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
from what i've learned the additional stress on the imc just means that your cpu/mobo combo will only run the ram mhz speed up to a specific limit depending on amountof ram sticks and whether they're single or dual rank.,but for my setup that limit exceeds my 3200mhz ram so its not an issue even with 4 sticks at single rank.,"&#x200b;

i jsut worry should i even bother with xmp or is it doing more harm than good?",going from 2400mhz to 3200mhz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sorry to clarify i'm not worried about 45c - i found it weird that my temps increased at all from just enabling xpm.,"also i have never experimented with timings, i used a preset xmp profile on my mobo.",heres the timings as i see them 16-18-18-36-74. i also listed them as they appear in cpu-z because i don't know if i included too much or too little.,"yes the settings match across all four dimms

cla - 16  
ras to cas - 18  
ras precharge - 18  
tras - 36

would this be enough to make my 12700kf jump from 40 to 60 while playing at 5fps for a solid 60 seconds during gotham knights?",that game only requires a intel core i7-10700k and a 2070 as recommended?,granted it was just that once.,"but agian i'm very overprotective of my system and any lag or fps drops or temp spikes makes me concerned  


maybe it was just the game isn't optimized well and it was a coincidence?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hmmmm then i guess you can try resit the aio or change the thermal paste?,i use a h100 which the cpu hovers around 60-70 on loads mostly i would say is bad when the cpu reaches 80 on load without overclock since is pretty high but mine stays at 60-70 degree i use almost the same psu as yours in terms of specs but my psu is in its own corner so yeah(but do note that 12th gen cpus do get pretty hot so i just try avoid the near 80 degree range),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if i remember rightly, i put it to 1.25v to help keep temps low (too low and it'd become unstable)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes it's quite a big jump going from 2400mhz to 3600mhz.,anything above will not give you the big benefit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your settings seem to be fine.,maybe it's an issue with the game itself.,try other intensive games and check.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i tested out in war zone last night actually and it my temps were between 60 and 70 as well randomly for a split second on occasion iâ€™d hit 70,71 or 72 but generally speaking i was 65 on average iâ€™d say.",since weâ€™re in the same boat do you think we got anything to worry about?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is so false.,plenty of evidence online that gets you much more fps in games.,i have a 4000cl14 kit myself and makes a huge difference in warzone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah maybe youâ€™re right, mw2 gives my cpu a run for itâ€™s money so iâ€™ll try it.","aside from cpu temps and the old bsod, what else should i look for to see if iâ€™m better or worse off with the xmp on?",and you said the timings look good for my ram?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'd recomend using process lasso if you don't want to change the affinity every time.,"personally, i'd set custom affinitys for any non-windows program.","i have a ryzen 7 cpu and i do, i think there's even more reason to with the new intel chips.","i put background stuff like spotify, discord, glasswire, to all run on one core.",games get all the other cores.,chrome gets a couple of cores so it runs quick but doesn't hog everything.,there's so much tweaking you can do depending on your preferences.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"when the game stalls and you look at task manager, what's consuming the cpu activity?",what does the storage activity look like?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my guess (and it is just a guess), is that that is an assassins creed odyssey problem and not a hw or windows problem.",i.e.,"the game itself or its drm gets confused, by being locked out from some cores or how its view of the processor looks with those affinity options.","performance-wise there should be nothing in hw or sw (of the drivers / os) that explains such a hang, that just affects this single game.",it would be an extremely low chance of that happening.,"&#x200b;

might be interesting to see what happens if you'd prevent the game from using the e-cores by other means (such as limiting cores to p-cores by msconfig limit, disabling them in bios, or using intels bios/scroll-lock-key legacy game compatibility option, if you have that)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i used to have a similar problem and the cause was the  windows wallpaper changer.,i had it set up every one hour.,and every hour my games would freeze for a few seconds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe ubisoft should know that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"e stands for excellent, whereas p is obviously poo poo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for your suggestions.,"i didnâ€™t want to make my post even longer than it already was, but iâ€™d actually already downloaded lasso and set it up to make the affinity settings for me when i run the game.",but i hadnâ€™t thought of doing the other things you mentioned to keep my games always able to get the lionâ€™s share of the machineâ€™s resources.,"i love to tinker, so iâ€™ll definitely experiment with this kind of stuff!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"storage definitely came to mind, but if this fixed it it's probably not that.","definitely worth looking at cpu usage when hitches happen, something is probably slamming all the cores for a second.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m actually interested enough to try disabling the e cores entirely just to see what the impact on the game would be.,"if i do that, i promise to report back here with the results.",i had read a while back that the hybrid chips were running afoul of some gamesâ€™ drm possibly due to the drm incorrectly seeing the p and e cores as separate cpuâ€™s entirely and preventing the game from running due to a licensing â€œviolationâ€.,i think i remember reading that ac odysseyâ€™s successor game â€œvalhallaâ€ was possibly affected in this way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sorry - kind of overlooked where i was posting i guess.,over-explaining is a thing i do sometimes.,working on it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just don't set your game launcher, like steam, to only have a core or 2 unless you want to check every time you launch a new game.",some games will inherit the core affinity from steam.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"for me, it works after disabling ipv6 from the router.",though i have the msi z690-a pro.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for that i would suggest

1. disabling the setting ""allow the computer to turn off this device to save power"" (in device manager, i225-v, power management).","2. a different ethernet cable
3. adding a different switch between the pc and the rest of your network.","i know it sounds stupid, but it's worked for a lot of people.","assuming gigabit, i'd recommend a netgear gs105 or gs305.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i should have followed up again.,it has been running stable for weeks now.,you know what fixed it?,"powering the pc off, unplugging the cord from the psu and leaving it for a few minutes.","plugged it back in, powered it back on and the nic has been running flawless for weeks.",i really don't understand it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"hi, iâ€™ve built a new pc and have a motherboard with this intel 225-v in it.",i had issues with the first one and returned it and got a different motherboard and am still having issues with the ethernet connection remaining stable.,youâ€™re saying youâ€™ve been able to somewhat reliably fix the issue by using a different pcie ethernet adapter?,would i have to disable the built in one for this to work or is it just plug and go?,thanks!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you want to get a new pcie nic card, then all you do is plug in and go.","the integrated intel nic is completely separate, no disabling is required.",in my case i was able to resolve the issue by unplugging the power completely from the computer and then plugging it back in after a few minutes.,i ended up not needing the extra nic.,"that solution is obviously not going to work for everyone, but it did for me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

while yes you absolutely can.,but that doesn't mean you should.,if your going to delid then i would say get a 13700k or 13900k so delidding  will actually benefit you in some way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just curious as to why you would want to delid it?,im pretty sure it is possible and there are probably some videos on yt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1- it is mediocre but it is exactly what you would expect from a 4-core laptop cpu.,"depending on the game, however, it may hold back the performance of the gpu for cpu-intensive games but in most cases, games benefit more from high-performance cores than core count, and the 12500h is ""good enough"".","2- the e-cores will help offload the background apps or the windows itself when you are gaming, otherwise these apps will be taxing on the main cores giving you less performance for gaming.",they will also help if the game is optimized to use more cores.,"in the case of 11300h vs 12500h, the 12500h is better because it has higher boost clock and more physical cores.",(p+e cores),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

im having similar issues with a 13900k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you should set a new aio for your brand-new and hot cpu.,"you can limit it even to 100w, it will still do great in games.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the u14s is a bit undersized for something like the 13700k.,even the d15 is limiting.,"with that said, i would suggest undervolting a little, and simply adjusting the power limits to whatever you can handle.","or, you can just let it throttle too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
honestly bf2042 is super cpu intensive and will heat it up.,i have a 13900k but i dont go over 85c in peak spikes (usually 60-high 70s).,before i changed my fan curves i had spikes up to 90-95c.,while that wont hurt anything its not ideal.,try changing your fan curve to more aggressive and see if that helps?,"&#x200b;

i highly suggest a 280-420mm aio as that will be better and it deals with spikes a lot better than air cooler.",i am no way saying your nh-u14s is a bad cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
280mm or 360mm aio required.,or a 240mm aio with a contact frame is sufficient (works well for me).,"if you want to stay with an air cooler, then dh-15 or nh-u12a will be good, setting at 253w pl1/pl2 should be achievable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i might do this with mine!,first time i reached 5.2ghz was with this cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

update your flair,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

imo it was actually amd's ryzen that set the fire ablaze.. the whole thing would've never happened without them,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
didn't know pla deteriorates over time.,kind of a bummer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which printer do you use?,i'm thinking on buying one.,any recommendations?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think ltt has the files for their cpu cases somewhere online if you want to use theirs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
right?,i'd sell it and make a few bucks back.,lots of gamers would be happy to still rock that.,still a decent cpu.,people get too hung up on the best of the best these days.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm on it with my 1080 ti ordered custom built by scan uk and really wanting to move on buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu the current market sucks and meteor lake is rumoured by raichu to have been cancelled entirely.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same.,have it clocked at 5ghz and its just chewing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"same, but i am eyeing a zen 4 x3d.",it can make a huge difference in some tasks/games.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yep.,just can't bring myself to upgrade yet.,"this 8700k and 3080 combo is working great, even at 4k for the games i play.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i5 4670k here ðÿ‘š

the newest cpu intensive game i play is hitman 3 and that works pretty well still!",otherwise lots of indie games.,i've been in no rush to upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i retired my 4460 a few days ago.,farewell soldier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i gave my nephew an i3-8100/rx570 system a while back for his first gaming pc.,when he's ready to try upgrading i'll just give this chip to him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"used cpus hold their value for a while, but then eventually they become worthless used.","8th gen being supported by windows 11 might have saved it from that wrath, but their are some cpus that just aren't worth listing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the bed seems very uneven to start.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's a huge jump in speed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i did similar and went from 4770k to 13700k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sorry you got down voted, it's a valid question.",i'm going to give this one to my nephew when he's ready to install it himself.,for now it's a decoration.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes because its their property and they can do whatever the fuck they want to with it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm still so happy with my 9700k that i'm getting a new case and cooler for it to keep it going for a while as my backup for my drafting job.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™ve got a 8600k and a 3070. often thought about buying a second hand 8700k for some extra power,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5800x on a b550.,very snappy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mine could only do 4.8ghz all core reliably.,after that the voltage i needed felt unsafe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice!,i have that exact cpu in a little mini dell pc that i use for a media center.,no lag decoding of anything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"clock for clock, i think the 3000 series was faster than 8th gen but at lower clock speeds like the 3600, it really didn't feel like it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"try bf2042, sometimes it hits 100%, most of the time it sits around high up in the 90%

just bought me a i7 13700k, and i see a big jump from my 8700k in games.","bf2042 was sometimes a little big laggy but no more, runs smooth as butter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
agreed for most games.,"i mostly play modded mc, rimworld and some dwarf fortress.",they all suffer from tick lag eventually.,the 5800x seems to keep the insanity going longer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i play elden ring almost exclusively this past year.,"with my old 8700k i was never bottlenecked but i was getting quite a bit of stuttering, hitching, etc.",upgraded to 13600k and pooof everything is smooth as butter now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the current cpu you have is more than enough for more than a dozen services running on one server.,it would be best to get a cpu of nearing performance if you have a lotttt of services experiencing performance issues or because of multiple clients.,best to do this with proxmox.,edit: words,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
slowing down the first layer would make sense here.,i commented elsewhere that this was printed on a very warped build plate with some 4 year old pla as well.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not really.,it will play most things just fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not at all, but the stuff i have here is faster.",5800x in the gaming pc and a 3700x in the server.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i went 5800x.,"at stock speeds, it was the only thing faster than the 8700k when i was doing irresponsible voltage level overclocks.","13th is faster than the zen3 stuff, so it makes sense that would work too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i replaced my 4790k with the 8700k :)   i feel like i had 2 of the best cpus intel ever made.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it should be fine for anything you want to do.,h means it's the high performance model.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14th gen is coming...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
getting ready to retire mine soon as i get a lga 1700 backplate from ekwb.,delidded an oc to 4.9. had a hard time deciding to let it go.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
going 13th gen or zen4?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>the cpu that marked the end of the quad core era for intel.,cries in 6700k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it takes on humidity and extrudes unevenly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you store it in a drybox it shouldn't be a problem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
after my current pla went to shit i will be switching to full petg soon.,harder to recycle but with less wastage i think it should even out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the only problem with coffee was the lack of ht on the i5s.,8700 had one so all good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on the rest of the system and the games that people are running.,"in most cases, a 12th or 13th gen i3 will run circles around the 8700k.","it was a great chip, but modern games have come a long way with taking advantage of better cpus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well... when i see that an i5 12th gen cpu gets a waay higher waay higher score than the 8700k on some benchmarking sites, i can't help but feel a little envious.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
raichu?,the pokemon?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
havenâ€™t even overclocked mine yet so iâ€™m sure iâ€™ll get even more use out of it when i do!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i only bought this thing earlier in the year.,"had an original haswell motherboard with a celeron, which in fact was still fine for surfing the net when on my ssd.",but now i do fortnite.,"the 4790 does okay (100+ fps on average), but i do get frame reductions sometimes bad enough that i am looking to upgrade soon.","this still kicks butt for roblox, though, so my daughter will keep it for that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"even if sold for fairly cheap, as long as someone who needs it gets it, you're reducing e-waste and keeping things lighter on the environment while also getting some money back.","the 8700k is old, but definitely not that old that it can't be sold (and used).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's even worse, mine is warped at this point.",it's a very old printer that needs some fixes.,i use a glass bed now and first layer is much more accurate.,this might have been the last print i did on the aluminum bed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ah, just level it.","it's quite easy, watch a youtube video",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh sorry, thought you were op",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm tired,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it also appears to be underextruding but it's somewhat difficult to determine without seeing it from other angles.,it could also be both.,i'd start by leveling and then printing a first layer calibration square.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it seems okay to me, i was going to get a 13th gen i9 but going to wait another generation i think",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
go 9900k for extra power if you want to stick with the same mobo.,8700k is not much of an upgrade to an 8600k.,you wouldn't notice much.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
exactly!,"for tasks not that much demanding, it holds up pretty well actually.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a friend with 8700 non-k until these days.,i had ryzen 3600 in the past and we had the same gpu card at the time (3060 and after 3070).,"he always had a little more performance than me playing warzone, pubg and other games.","not much, something like 10% and a better 1% low.",but clearly faster.,not to mention that he was using 2666mhz memory (oc) and i was using 3200mhz.,"8700 it's a very impressive cpu, performance is in between ryzen 3600 and ryzen 5600 (non-x).","i think it's the most impressive core i7 made until now, even more impressive than core i7 3770 or 2600.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'll give it a try.,only game that gets close for me is hunt showdown it gets to 90% on a single core but over all nothing above 57% total,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well the way rimworld ticks work is based on the host system.,so if the host has a better cpu then you do by a far measure.,it will always cause you to fall behind in ticks in the later game.,we have the same issue with a friend of mine on an older cpu.,i'm being the host and running 8700k while he is on like 4 gens older i5 cpu.,game runs fine until about 4 hours in then he starts falling behind in ticks and mine remain current.,its all based on who is host and if the people connected have hardware good enough to keep up with the host.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what resolution do you play on and what gpu?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4 years old will do it indeed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nice !,[gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|heart_eyes),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ohh okayy .. thankss:3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there will always be another generation.,the cycle never ends :/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that might just do it for me, yeah!",this really is a great chip.,"i ran an e8500 for a while, then a 2600k for a *long* time before bumping up to a 7700k, then finally an 8700k, which is where i got stuck it seems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it was a tough choice, but ultimately went for the 7700x because of the upgrade path going forward.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"*cries in 7700k*

seriously, still salty i bought it in early 2017 after amd showed their hand and then intel just decided to release a second series of cpus that same year, this one blowing the last gen away.","still using the thing, and now that i upgraded my gpu, im bottlenecking half the time.","to be fair ive owned it for like 6 years by now, and i couldnt upgrade it until i upgraded my gpu anyway because i wouldnt see many performance differences on the old 1060. 

hoping to go for an i5 13500 next christmas, or whatever the best deal is for the money by then.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
naive question: could you use a hair dryer to rid it of the water before printing?,should be well below the 60 degrees it takes to deform.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i see.,but what about putting it into a cardboard box and all?,so that as little air as possible gets to it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to be fair the 8600k was better than the 7700k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
every game i run on my 8700k + 2080ti at 1440p tops the cpu at 60-70% max.,i've yet to see a game bottleneck on my cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it depends on the number of frames - my 7700k was fine until i was using a 75hz monitor, very few games and scenarios made it a bottleneck.",even cyberpunk maintained 60ish with ray tracing (3080).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah mine's still running strong for all the things i currently play (not much), but i want to try vr flight simulator and i'm starting to feel the itch.",this might be the year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"leaker on twitter, very reliable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"when i first started printing, bed leveling was my bane.",even with a printer that has abl.,damn glass was warped from the start.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ah, ok. what printer?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah.,same here.,will just save up for a whole new system.,the 3070 should last a good while as well.,perfect still for 1440p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
good call on the 9900k.,yeah that might be a good shout actually ðÿ˜œ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're right!,i guess it depends what you're happy with.,"i spend my money elsewhere, so i typically hang onto the hardware for a long time.","sitting on 64gb of ddr4 ram right now and a recently acquired 3080 ti, feels like the cpu is the last thing holding me back from another 6-8 happy years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if it works like am4 you should be able to put 3 more gens in there.,not a bad move.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i bought a 6600k around the same time, probably without enough research to know that the 7000 series was coming right around then.",got a good deal on it but dealt with the same issues until i recently upgraded to a 12700k with the microcenter deal.,"can't complain about something that lasts 6 years though, they were good quality cpus, just lacked the cores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the worst thing is, if you would have bought that awful ryzen first gen instead, you could have upgraded all the way to the 5800x3d today.","the 7700k was a great cpu, but the timing was so bad.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just retired my 7700k for a 13700k.,going from 4 cores to 16 feels ridiculous.,my only complaint is the heat.,even with a 100mv undervolt it still thermal throttles in cinebench.,79c in full load gaming tho and thatâ€™s good enough for me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can just put it in the oven.,dries out perfectly.,i got a little heated chamber that dries it automatically from amazon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you intend to stand over the filament roll and blast air on it for solid 5 hours... you could.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"theoretically yes, but companies do sell dedicated filament dryers for exactly this, and they're rather cheap",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there's little ovens you can get to remove the humidity, but no biggie.","filament is cheap, you just buy more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i keep mine in a sealed rubber-made style bin with lots of silica gel granules that keep mine suuuuuper dry and ready to go.,"bin has pla,  pla+, petg, and abs rolls in it..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they probably wouldn't work either.,it may be better than just leaving it out in the open but you could seal it in a tupperware container and it would last longer.,most people just buy a food dehydrator or a filament dehydrator box.,several companies make them and they arent very expensive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
jsut because you aren't seeing 100% cpu use does not mean you are not cpu bottlenecked.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"warzone 2 will, unfortunately.",i had to go from a 9700k @ 5ghz all core to a 13700k in order to improve my frametimes.,"bf2042 was *unplayable* without restricting the game to 70 fps, since it was rendering my keyboard unusable with all 8 threads at 100%.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i had a warped z-plate, a warped build plate and the springs had uneven tension.",the frame is also wiggly.,anything that sticks to the bed is a miracle at this point.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
monoprice maker select (not the mini).,i don't believe they make it anymore.,prussia i3 clone with some cheaper parts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yer thats what im on is 1440p aswell, mind i would like 4k next",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's the plan!,getting the zen 5 3d next year should be glorious.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
eh the 7600k never really lasted very long.,by the time bf5 came out like 1.5 years later it was already showing its age.,"i knew with zen coming out that the market would soon change, and i originally waited for zen and wanted to upgrade to a zen processor with 6-8 cores.","but then amd pulled an amd, the performance was very lackluster and underwhelming in gaming, and the cpus punched well under their weight class otherwise.",it was a common problem with amd cpus up until around 2020 or so.,"amd would offer more cores but their cores would be worse, often a generation or several generations behind intel's, and often would do well on synthetic benchmarks, but fall apart in gaming for whatever reason.","having come off of a phenom ii and putting up with crap performance for years as a result, i just went intel.",but i knew thw 7600k wasnt gonna last long so i jumped on the 7700k on a microcenter deal.,it was the best move i had at the time and felt like i bit the bullet on that.,seeing intel come out with coffee lake like half a year later made me salty as hell.,because i couldve waited a little longer and jumped on that.,i prefer jumping on upgrades when getting massive price/performance jumps and i ended up biting the bullet on the last of the quad core generations with the next generation coming out prematurely.,"with gpus, i always seem to luck out and score big.","i bought the 1060, i had a 760 before that, a 5850 before that, just upgraded to a 6650 xt a few weeks ago.",with cpus?,i always seem to buy at the worst times.,"i always miss those ""legendary"" upgrades by less than a year and end up dealing with crap performance relatively speaking as a result.",i bought an athlon xp in 2005 just months before dual cores were a thing.,i bought my phenom ii the year before sandy bridge came out.,and i bought kaby lake before coffee lake came out.,i always seem to get screwed and miss the best processor deals by not much.,only thing that really saved me this time was going for the 7700k but if i had the 8700k i wouldnt be upgrading probably for another couple years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if you only care about gta5, your have few options:

1.if youre using windows 10, try running windows 7 and disabling bloatware, it may free up some cpu resources and improve things

2.e8400 can be oced even on stock cooling (but better cooling = higher oc)some people reached 4ghz and it can actually have pretty big impact on performance

3.if you have 4gb ram (common for ddr2 systems) it may be the problem, so if your mobo can take 8gb its an option, also using debloated windows 7 will free up ram

4.you can get core 2 quad (something from the q9000 series with 12mb l2 is the best option) and oc it

&#x200b;

5. you can just upgrade your pc, if you want something modern and not expensive am4 is a great platform, it has many different cpu options (from slow excavator apus, extremely cheap old ryzens like the r3 1200 which is slightly better than my old i5 3470 in perf, and all the way to something like a 5800x3d which is equal to 12900k gaming perf, or a 5950x which is a quite modern 16 core beast)

&#x200b;

an r5 5600 is a great budget cpu, its still doing great in games, decent single core perf and ipc (zen3 based) and 6c/12t is plenty for modern games",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

undervolt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
100c at 192w - you need a new and proper aio 360/420mm.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what kind of cpu cooling do you currently have ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sorry but your going to want to upgrade your aio to either 360-420mm aio.,"while the aio you have is a good one, 240-280 would be good for a 13700k.",not a 13900k.,if your throttling before 200 watts then your rad isn't big enough.,"&#x200b;

what you can do is try to disable unlimited power (if you havent already changed that) since it comes out of the box enabled.",but even so i think you will still thermal throttle.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did u just change your cooler or cpu?,did u take off protective plastic?,just a thought.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a simple 0.1v undervolt in bios will helps a lot, prob will improve temps by min of 10c.","other things you can try is checking for proper contact between aio and the ihs (and if you can, use the thermalright contact frame), replacing thermal paste (i recommend krytonaut extreme), delidding cpu (not recommended unless you either donâ€™t care about voiding warranty or want to do extreme overclocking), check for proper fan setup (are there proper airflow in the case?","), etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1. check your cpu cooler - did you forget to remove any plastic covering ?,many people do that.,"2. if you are using stock cooler , then maybe change cpu cooler.",3. get the thermalright - antibend mechanism.,4.  most likely you arent installing your cpu cooler correctly.,5. if all doesnt work then you better undervolt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"something is definitely wrong, got a 13600k in the same case using a deepcool assasin iii cooler and it is super cool.","the thermal exchange doesnâ€™t seem to happen, reseat/check all connections",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
get the thermalright cpu contact frame.,i put that on with a noctua dh-15 air cooler for a 13700k and was able to push the power between 205-210 watts while maintaining at 95 degrees.,i also used a special screwdriver that stops at .6 nm of force so i know the force is equal across all screws.,screwed half a turn each screw in an x patterns to get equal mounting with the paste as well.,drew a line of paste down the die (roughly the size of a pea but spread out across the line).,"and then undervolt, start with -.05 and keep testing going up until itâ€™s unstable.",iâ€™ve seen online people getting between 5-20 degrees drop depending on the stability of your cpu.,i was able to get roughly 10 degrees cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that aio is not the problem.,thats one of the best performing ones out there.,op could try for a better mount/paste spread or undervolt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
arctic liquid 240 mm aio,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and 12100f is even colder, your 13600k is too hot because of that.",/s,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it still isn't capable of handling that 253w under 100c on r23/cpu-z loads.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its one of the best aios if he has the 360-420mm aio.,a 240-280 aint really going to cut it on a i9 with power limits disabled.,hell even 253w limit he will probably thermal throttle.,theres not enough surface to cool the coolant with that many watts.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"try to mount again the cooler on the cpu, be sure to apply well a good thermal paste.","if itâ€™s not solved, try undervolting a bit your cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"depending on the cpu, it is.","also, what do you expect op to then?","going open loop is significantly more expensive and complicated, while barely helping for temps.",the only upgrade from there is phase-changing cooling or some sort of cryo cooling-like solution.,"or ln2, while youre at it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the pro z790a and z690a is very different with tons of upgrades so it makes sense.,the z790p is the equivalent of z690a.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, 12900kâ€™s almost always max out at 6600-6800, very few hit 7000, and only a few have ever reached 7200 stable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"my point exactly, officially the motherboard only supports up to 6000 for 12th gen (as seen in the list), he ""may"" try to get lucky with 7200, but if it doesn't work he can still replace the cpu in future to make full use of the 7200 ram sticks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
battery life should be a bit better.,"i don't know how much it'll matter with c++ as far as performance goes, i think both should be fine.","but for perspective, the 12th gen i3 1215u often beats the 11th gen i7 1165g7.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"good for the price, but drivers will take time to mature.","this is intel's first line of dedicated gpus in years, so you will see some driver related bugs/issues that should slowly get better over time.",for instance they did a recent driver update that had something like a 100% performance increase in dx9 games.,"might be off by a bit on that, but the idea is it was a major improvement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's about on par with the 3060ti for gaming.,there are some settings to tweak in the bios to get the idle power usage under control... but it's not a bad card.,the 750 has a better bang for the buck.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

well a temporary fix to your issue is uninstalling all the wifi drivers first(in device manager).",then simply restart windows.,windows should then assign generic drivers to your wifi module.,quickly install the windows 11 update then.,make sure then to use this tool to update wifi and bluetooth drivers to the newest version.,"[https://www.intel.in/content/www/in/en/support/detect.html](https://www.intel.in/content/www/in/en/support/detect.html)

"afaik, m.2 is just a form factor, and pcie lanes for add-in cards and storage come from 2 places in your system: the chipset and the cpu.","so what i think is happening here is that the chipset indeed does not support nvme, but your motherboard simply runs a few of your cpuâ€™s pcie lanes to the m.2 port.",.,"also, motherboard manufacturers can sometimes bend the rules a bit.",a recent example: b660 and non-k 12th gen processors both state no overclocking support.,"but asus made a b660 board with a external cpu clock generator, meaning it can change the base clock of the cpu individually, making for the same effect as changing base clock multiplication values like â€˜normalâ€™ overclocking.","intel changed their wording on what overclocking is, and forced a non-revertable bios change that allowed non-k overclocking on these boards.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nvme ssds just use standard pcie lanes.,"dedicated m.2 slots can, however, also support sata.","the only real requirement is bios support to boot from the nvme drive, which was not universal back then, and even some early boards with m.2s could not boot from them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the short answer is that some board manufacturers are more likely to utilize available pci express lanes in creative ways.,"the b150 only offers eight lanes from the chipset itself, which most vendors have split off into something such as an x4 slot, an x1 slot and an extra set of sata ports.","on your [specific board](https://www.gigabyte.com/us/motherboard/ga-b150-hd3p-rev-10/sp#sp), gigabyte has routed four lanes to a pci express slot and also wired those same lanes to the nvme m.2 slot.","using one will preclude the use of the other:

&#x200b;

>1 x pci express x16 slot, running at x4 (pciex4)  
>  
>\* the pciex4 slot shares bandwidth with the sata express slot and the m.2 connector.","when the sata express slot or the m.2 connector is populated, the pciex4 slot will operate at up to x1 mode.","&#x200b;

so the m.2 slot effectively steals three lanes from the x4 expansion slot and the fourth lane from the sata express port.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i just built a system using an asus z790-based motherboard and it's as others have said.,the extra ports hijack some of the pcie lanes normally assigned to other things like pcie slots.,"if you look at the motherboard manual, there will probably be stipulations about what you can and cannot do with nvme in conjunction with pcie slots.","on the asus board i used, it advertised 5 nvme slots, but only 3 were on-board and the other 2 were on a pcie daughtercard.","there were certain features and combinations of drive types specified in the manual for each slot, so you need to read the manual carefully to make sure you can do what you want to do (especially if you also plan to use multiple pcie cards).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
on my motherboard the top m.2 slot goes through the cpu and the lower slots go through the chipset.,not sure if that applies to your motherboard but i've known it on the last 2 motherboards i had.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">on the wiki page it says that pcie m.2 is not supported by the chipset

not sure what that is supposed to mean.",nmve is a software protocol run over pcie and m.2.,is a physical connector.,"the chipset doesn't ""support"" nvme (the os does) nor m.2.","(the motherboard does that), only pcie (the thing nvme runs on).",that is why you can use nmve disks on retro hardware that predates the original nvme 1.0 spec.,">while on the specification page of the mainboard it states that it's there, which i can confirm since i'm currently typing this on the pc with an pcie m.2 ssd in said m.2 slot on said mainboard and windows 10 running from it.","whats happening is that your os supports nvme and your chipset supports pcie, so you can use an nvme disk.",does it boot from nvme (without a sata disk installed)?,maybe that is what they don't support?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the chipset that controls all the ioâ€™s used to never be on â€˜the chipâ€™, itâ€™s a new thing intel started doing after many failed chipset manufacturers created substandard equipment.","meaning the motherboards always have done the interfacing in the past, so they still can if inclined.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"just to clarify, i took a look at his manual and the m.2 slot is getting its lanes from the chipset (shared with sata express and a secondary pcie slot).","the 6700 only has 16 cpu-based lanes, and it doesnâ€™t look like theyâ€™re shared with anything on that board.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"bios will contain basic drivers for certain basic hardware features as well

i used to have a laptop (g751jy) that had a m.2 pcie drive (not nvme, not sata3, pci-e only) and i was able to use some tutorial and tools from the ami bios company to inject nvme drivers in the bios, flash it back and now i could use nvme drives in it

at its core, a bios is an operating system and while limited in data can receive new features with updates",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gigabyte got pretty creative with those 4 lanes.,but that table in the manual is super confusing.,"like, iâ€™m not sure why installing an m.2 sata ssd should not only disable sata5, but also drop the x4 slot to x1â€¦ while not installing a m.2 sata allows the use of sata5 and x4 lanes.",must have been a design compromise.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that applies to 11th gen+.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i can only tell you what the websites say.,"wikipedia has a table with ""b150"" and ""pcie m.2"" marked as ""none"".",windows 10 boots from that nvme.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the 12100 is a very capable cpu and a very good choice for budget builds.,itâ€™s on par gaming wise.,"the lack of 2 extra cores makes it a little less suitable for streaming, video editing and other multicore demanding tasks.",intel made good progress in their 12th gen cpuâ€™s even exceeding amd per core.,the 5600 is definitely no slouch either.,the choice will depend on your budget and use case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the i3-12100/12100f is basically the entry level cpu for gaming.,it's $100 and works well enough.,"but the more recommended cpu is the i5-12400/12400f, which is on sale for $155 and performs like a 5600x in gaming.","[newegg via ebay sale](https://www.ebay.com/itm/294691315265?mkcid=16&mkevt=1&mkrid=711-127632-2357-0&ssspo=ok6nawekspa&sssrc=2349624&ssuid=d4vhplbfqke&var=&widget_ver=artemis&media=copy) i would get the 12400f, especially if you plan to keep the cpu for several years and want to play aaa games or do any productivity tasks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a 5600x and can confirm it will be better than the i3 also don't pick i3 because they are kinda not good for anything a bit more extreme.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12100 is a lot slower in games than 5600 not sure what people are talking about here.,even the 12400 is often beaten by the 5600.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it has two less cores at only 4 vs 6, so the 12100 will be worse in most modern games that use 6 or more cores.",if a game is older and uses only like 4 cores the 12100 could be about the same as a 5600 in a lot of titles.,"they are both good value, but intel motherboards often cost more than amd for a board with similar features.",we don't know what the 13100 will be.,it might be 4 big cores with 4 little cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hello op.,i apologize for the necro but i am in a similar position as you right now.,would you mind telling me which choice you ended up making and if you are happy with your decision please?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in real life you wonâ€™t feel any different.,in my opinion the intel i3 12100 is more stable and less â€˜smaller issuesâ€™.,intel 12gen motherboard also can upgrade to a 13gen cpu.,but amd next gen requires new motherboard.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

so far the 13th gen i3 series is rumored to be 4p+0e.,the regular i5's will be 6p+4e and the 13600k will be 6p+8e.,"so in terms of performance gains from 12th to 13th gen, the i3's are expected to be the least impressive compared to everything else in the upcoming lineup that gets extra e cores.","it will still be a respectable chip though for budget gaming, it's really solid for $100.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hwinfo shows that you got both thermal limited and power limited.,"you have to look at the max values column for ""core thermal throttling"" and ""core power limit exceeded"", i can see that both has ""yes"" there.",thermal limiting can be fixed by getting a better cooler or by undervolting if it's possible on your motherboard.,"power limiting should be easily fixed by changing pl1 in your bios settings, or in intel xtu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"since you have an msi board, you can easily undervolt by lowering the cpu lite load https://youtu.be/gcpuuujrqku",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
>  it is not power limited or thermal throttling.,the second picture you posted literally has hwinfo saying *core thermal throttling* and *package/ring thermal throttling* saying ***yes***.,"in addition, *package/ring power limit exceeded* is also reporting ***yes***",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i tested it again at 125w power limit to avoid thermal throttling.",the score is a bit low compared to some reviews online with around 31k in r23.,that's weird.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what cooler do u use?,even with intel power limits it needs good cooling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
weird thing is it shows throttling at only 93?,perhaps op can expand core temperatures to see whatâ€™s going on in there.,"and it is power limited, to 253 watts.",a 13900k can pull way more than that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this.,"second screen tells all, pl1/pl2 = 253w, cpu package power 259w.",the board was definitely power limiting after it hit that peak.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am using the stock power limit which is 253w.,is the score too low for 253w?,i expect it to be around 38k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i set to mode 7 and got about 1k more in r23.,but starting from mode 6 the score drops significantly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to my understanding hwinfo needs to be updated for 13 gen since they donâ€™t start to throttle till 100c so its not actually throttling even though it says it is but i havenâ€™t read to much into yet i could be wrong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hwinfo has 2 sec loop for sensors, and for that time in between core gets to 100 or what was limited and already lifted itself to 94.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"without undervolting, yes it is too low.",most people will undervolt though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
check out this early leaked benchmark of the 13900k.,the leaker also scored 35k at 253w.,"those 40k scores are at unlimited power, or in this particular case 350w.","https://videocardz.com/newz/core-i9-13900k-breaks-40k-points-in-cinebench-r23-with-unlimited-power-and-5-8-ghz-clock

are power consumption and temperatures better with mode 7?,"you are almost there, 38k is the default cbr23 for the 13900k, it probably still reach 253w and clock down a bit, try to unlock the power limits.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hwinfo works perfectly fine on my 13900k and z690 unify-x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
see op's screenshot.,he's on 7.34 which is the latest version as of today.,"enhanced support for meteor lake and many z790 chipsets were added back in 7.32.

i canâ€™t imagine a cinebench run hitting 100 for less than 2 seconds but then never topping 93 after that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,i tried to unlock the power limits and it thermal throttled at around 300w.,can get close to 36k in r23.,it seems the voltage is too high with a b660 board.,i saw about 1.3v in p cores.,so i am planning on getting a better aio and gigabyte z790 aorus master.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes it works but says itâ€™s throttling even though itâ€™s not but like i said i could be wrong just seen several people say it doesnâ€™t throttle till 100c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, you don't get what i said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
could be the cooler ramping up.,like on initial load the fans will be spinning really slowly and all of a sudden the cpu sees 100% multicore load and temps briefly hit 100c.,"after that the cooler ramps up and stays up, so the temps stay under 100c.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you need to run hwinfo as a high priority task, or it won't monitor temps correctly in cinebench",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it throttles at whatever the bios decides to set it as.,some boards come auto with 100c limit and some are 90-95c.,just set it manually if the limit is too low,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you tried the contact frame?,combine that with a mild undervolt it should get you under 100.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

maybe you havenâ€™t completely cleaned the previous thermal paste residue before applying the new paste?,coz 100 is too much.,itâ€™s the boiling point of water.,if you were to keep a drop of water of the ihs of the processor the drop would evaporate just like if was on a frying pan.,chances are the life and performance will be drastically reduced if it runs at those temps for a while.,take it to an expert or do whatever jt takes.,get this solved asap.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"update: received the thermalright contact frame today, got it installed, and idle temps immediately dropped 8 degrees celsius.",ten-minute loop of cinebench that previously hit 100 degrees by the second or third pass now completed the entire loop hitting a maximum of 93 degrees.,i feel confident that my issues are largely resolved to my satisfaction.,thanks to all who gave helpful suggestions and pointed me in the right direction!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have not.,"just watched a video on it, and that seems promising.",tom's hardware's review uses my same msi board which may evidently be more prone to bending/uneven contact.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would the contact frame help with that?,"if so, that's what i'll pursue.",(i'm assuming pic is of uneven contact on the ihs?),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pl1/pl2 are at 241w.,there's a bios setting to select your cooler type and it adjusts accordingly.,"i have it set to tower air cooler, the most conservative of the 3 options which does the 241w limit.",the most aggressive sets 4096w.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

sorry for my poor english.,im also fully agreed that you have cpu bending.,i got this exact problem previously with 13900k.,if you are set the aio with thin thermal grease layer (classic style) - it will raise to 100 even at slight load.,if the layer was really thin - you can set drop of thermal compound in middle of cpu to fill the bended part.,"it will help, but anyway - order the frame soon.",i have also 280mm aio and it keep temperature controlled about 91-92c at 270w load (with frame).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's not a super big issue since the fix is cheap and some don't even have to do it - but regardless it exists in some form.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you removed the power limits in your bios?,"load temperature of modern cpus is directly proportional to how much power you allow them to consume, and for how long of a duration, by adjusting your bios settings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5c is minimum.,people have seen 10c too - not sure about average.,"it's not just temp reduction but the ""bending"" part in the long run.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

we'll see how the noctua goes, if it's struggling i can always fit another fan.","i suspect the workloads it'll see during video editing will be mostly transient so the cpu won't throttle too much, and during gaming i'm not too concerned over a few frames.","i'm not 100% i'm right, but i get the impression this generation of cpu behaves more like gpus in that its ability to shed will usually be the limit of its sustained performance and that they're designed to run that way given that they throttle at 80degc",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

buy a new cooler and set the pl1 and pl2 to a lower power limit.,how high you set it will depend on your cooler.,your cooler is rated to 130w max.,the cpu can pull 185w+.,maybe see what the pl1 and pl2 are called for your mainboard and set them to 125w and see what the temperature does.,then when you get a new cooler adjust the pl1 and pl2 levels to reflect the new coolers ability.,might be base frequency boost in mainboards overclocking section.,try 125w for your current cooler?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you might also play with lowering pl1/pl2 using xtu till to get acceptable temps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes its possible but i dont know how.,many pc specialized tune shops do that frequently some â€œfine bios tuningâ€ to maintain lower temps and not lose the performance.,often on 13900k.,bios oc and tuning is a rocket science for me too,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

my only worry is that the deepcoolak620 seems to be cheaper and offer more cooling.,but im guessing the noctua is more quiet then?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

dunno it lets me on my motherboard what model do you have?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if itâ€™s hitting above 100 regularly, then thatâ€™s likely the issue.","depending on the cooler type selected and cpu, when set to â€œautoâ€ asrock was allowing the cpu to get as high as 115 degrees before throttling.",this was purportedly for â€œextra performanceâ€ despite no other board maker doing this.,"when users questioned intel on it, they kinda got called out as technically voiding cpu warrantyâ€¦ so updated asrock z690/z790 bios versions will apparently stick to the official throttling spec of 100.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
noctua is pricey but high quality.,great cooling and lasts forever.,grab a second fan for the back side if you have room in the motherboard.,i usually set the cpu fans on my all-core workhorse machines (ryzen 5900x) to \~70 to 80% and they are great.,"also, i am a bit concerned that you only have 1 exhaust fan.","with heavy load you will need to send that heat somewhere or it just circulates in the case and can also cause the components (cpu, gpu, hdd, sdd) to overheat.","with high wattage cpus and gpus, i prefer large atx tower cases with 3 or 4 intake (120mm or 140mm) on the front and bottom of the case.",and 3 or 4 exhaust fans (120mm or 140mm) in the back and top of the case.,:),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the shop was wrong: the 13600kf is about a 150-190w chip in all-core workloads.,you need *much* more than a single-tower cooler to keep that cool.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
asrock z790 pro rs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'll grab some extra fans and put them in the top.,im using a lian li lancool 2 mesh.,for a case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this and/or give undervolting a whirl in the meantime.,my 13600k 5.2 p-core and 4.1 e-core never pulls over 145w at 1.12v under the heaviest loads.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™ll cool mine with fanless noctua,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes but i need a 12th gen to update bios,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can i use i911900k with 4070ti because i have that cpu and i am thinking to upgrade to a 4070 but i was  wondering  about the bottleneck is it a problem ?,?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

">then i tried reducing the cpu lite load to mode 9 and this helped ... but it is effectively an undervolt, and it reduces the cpu performance a bit.",it is not effectively an undervolt if the performance is reduced.,that would be an underclock.,"if you check hwinfo at the time then you would have seen that the ""effective clocks"" is below what it should be.",i've seen this kind of thing happening several times already (undervolt causing performance loss instead of crashing) but i have no idea what causes it.,maybe some kind of undervolt protection that hasn't been disabled properly?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this sub is full of really awful advice.,"if you keep all the bios settings as default on the msi mobo, and just reduce litelode, it will greatly reduce temps with almost no impact on performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"as a person who has worked on chip mems & nems for years at bnl long island and ibm watson research center ny, let me say this: 13500 and 13600k are **not the same chip** with just different frequencies.","13500 has a lower quality than 13600k at the chip level, for example, there is a significant difference in qa quality, e.g.","uniformity of dopant concentration of the silicon body in fets, causing different leakage currents, and uniformity of thickness control of the gate materials in fets, and there're many other indexes that can affect two seemingly same chips to perform differently... all these will result in the former (13500) generating more hard errors and requiring more energy and time for auto-correction, making it less efficient in handling data processing tasks, while the latter (13600k) will generate fewer errors and work in a more effective way.","in the game, you will see that the latter has a higher fps than the former, even when the two chips are locked at exactly the same frequency and equipped with the same caches.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'm in the same boat my friend.,"the 13500 has a beautiful price compared to the 13600k however, it is an alderlake die.","it has less l2 cache, and only supports ddr5-4800.",and the intel slides showed that raptor lake has a nice power efficiency increase at lower frequencies.,so... do i still want the 13500 to replace my 6700k?,not as much... i need to see the power draw benchmarks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yes it is meaningless for that, because you can change the power limit to whatever you want, on whatever cpu you get.",e.g.,"if you get a cpu with a tdp of 65w and you want the power limit to be higher, you can literally just go into the bios and change pl1 from 65w to whatever you want.","some motherboards even do this for you by default, so you get more performance.","if you get a cpu with a tdp of 125w and you want it to be less, you can change pl1 to 65w.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

your first sentence is correct.,"it's a max function of all core and ring vids, so assuming you use a dynamic overclock, the e-core vid can determine the effective voltage.","without undervolting my e-cores, my all core load voltage was determined by the e-cores @55x p-core with vf tuning.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it might still have it's place depending on pricing since the 4070 ti is $799+.,"since the alchemist+ line seems to be lower than current top of the line, it might even be $299.",calling it alchemist+ seems to be a revision at least.,perhaps some showstopper issues like rebar being a requirement can be improved significantly with this.,being a revision a year later might also mean performance improves.,so a775/a755 with $249/299 pricing and 10% better performance maybe?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it will likely fill in the budget to mid range segment that nvidia 100% is taking advantage of (in a negative way) and amd to a lesser extent by forcing people to pay way more money for any tangible performance gain.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

raja literally said they would have a 4090 competitorâ€¦.but intel just doesnâ€™t have the ability or skill to do it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"but enthusiast sounds like it means a ""high end"" card, an 80 series class at the least.","225 watts seems way to little to compete since amd and nvidia have way higher tdps at that range usually, so unless battlemage is way more efficient than nvidia's and amd's competitors at the time, i highly doubt it would compete in that category.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so intel is typically good at making memory controllers.,"arc does not use in-house memory controller, it uses a third party one.",reminds me of when they used powervr and third party the drivers were atrocious.,when they moved to their in-house gen graphics it improved vastly.,"they also said they overlooked things when it comes to rebar and thought the impact would not be that big, so it's something they are likely going to address in the future with a combination of software and hardware.","arc also seems to have compatibility issues when it comes to rebar-less systems, so that's something they can address too.",part of the reason is because it only matters for dgpu systems.,"so they were in the igpu mindset for so long, they simply did not know;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, i don't think the prices are sustainable.","maybe if they had nvidia level of volume, but even then the die is quite large.",i doubt alchemist+ at $249-299 will fare bad against competition.,sure the performance of amd/nvidia parts are higher but have they made big perf/$ gains?,it's doubtful whether they did at all!,rtx 4070 ti is $799+!,ada increased in prices 30-50% across the board.,"rtx 3050's msrp was $250, so you are looking at $329-379 for the successor.",based on rumor specs i doubt rtx 4050 will even beat 3060 ti.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

alright well you research the materials of water and materials of a cpu and let me know how similar they are ðÿ˜‚ðÿ˜‚,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
luckily the cpu is not made of water.,boiling point of water isn't any kind of universal temperature standard.,if you dropped ethanol on it that would boil like it would on a frying pan at nice 78c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that article isn't very relevant anymore since current silicon transistors and their electrical properties are very different than the old planar 45nm ones that cpu has.,also the processors and their power gating systems are very different.,but even that test had them running the cpus at continuous 100% load for years.,that kind of workload is not realistic in any consumer device.,you can multiply the x axis values they had with probably at least five.,that would mean you will have the cpu degrade to require +0.025v operating voltage in like 10 years if overclocked.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i don't think they are more fragile in any meaningful way.,the last generations of planar transistors were in huge trouble because that transistor geometry couldn't work well with so small features.,"introducing the fin geometry improved the electric properties of transistors immensely, allowing a lot more precise control.","especially leakage currents were a huge problem in planar transistors, creating the whole ""race to sleep"" idea.",they leaked so much that for overall power efficiency it didn't really matter much how much power you used for processing as long as you could power gate it as soon as possible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

personally the thermal grizzly one would not fit on my z790 board.,the screws that came with the motherboard are too short secure the thermal grizzly frame.,while the thermalright one works just fine without issue.,it did drop my temps about 5-8c.,possibly that would help the op on this too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

just lower the cpu frequencies go to bios and select core ratio offset mode and hit the -5 section or -6 then set pl1 and pl2 to 150w and you good to go you might need that performance in the future and its good to already have it in reserve than going to buy it again you never know what should come.,no reason to sell it you would lose some money on it either so just simply keep it my boy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i second this.,if you've already bought it then it's better to have it and not need it versus needing it and then not having it.,as the person above me suggested i would heavily power limit and then set reduced clocks on each separate step.,you could even go as far as undervolting the cpu as well if you wanted to.,there are many ways to work around saving as much power as possible and reducing the thermal footprint of your current cpu instead of selling it for a loss and then back-peddling to a lower end sku on an older generation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have undervolted by 0.150 as this has been recommended by others which dropped the temps on my end aswell.,you make some good points and maybe there's more settings that can be tuned.,will look into the cpu frequencies in bios,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when cpu isn't being stressed everything is running smooth at 30c and on low quality games at 35-40c which im happy with.,but when running more intense games fans are spinning up (which they should ofc) but  both heat up my room and makes a little too much noice for my taste.,maybe you're correct that this in fact is about cooling not the cpu.,i have ryujin ii 360 aio mounted on the side (intake fans) with perhaps not the optimal placement for cables running to cpu.,thinking about switching this to top side with exhaust fans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thanks man i have a feeling it will be fine on your ryzen rig but getting some hard evidence as to such would likley ease plenty of future buyers minds when making the decision on whether its worth it to give the gpu a try.,please keep me updated and thanks again for working with me to get to the bottom of this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
can confirm works fine on any system gpu not even required to be installed (did whole process from my phone) master key from retailer gets you cod bundle + 3 software if you choose to sign up for intel gaming access during registration you'll eventually get an email (landed in promos for me in gmail) that includes another master key this time for the other 3 games.,hope this helps!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not even on your receipt?,yes they are a participating seller so they should have provided you a code.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have a 12900k, but i donâ€™t *think* gaming access would know as i donâ€™t think it has permission to see that.","at any rate, the email with the three other games didnâ€™t mention the cpu and only mentioned it was a bonus for buying an arc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the new games came as a code in an email, and it was redeemed at the same place as the cod code.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my store didnâ€™t even know they were getting them.,there were only 5 total â€œlaunchâ€ stores and mine wasnâ€™t one of them so honestly i wouldnâ€™t be surprised if they didnâ€™t know about the promotion-there is a way to submit a receipt on intelâ€™s site but it seemed broken.,this current promotion thing is running through february which is good.,hopefully if i can drive there today iâ€™ll what they say,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
got the email from intel.,they give you a â€œmaster keyâ€ (their term for redemption code) and that adds the promotion to your intel account and that shows on the â€œdashboardâ€ there.,iâ€™m going to go to micro center today to figure out what they need to do to give me the promo for my 770. iâ€™ll make a new post with screenshots and clear info on how it works.,"the 3 additional games are gb: spirits unleashed, gotham knights, and the settlers pc standard edition.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ok man well still a small bit of cloudiness is still possible til we for sure see someone with a non new intel cpu and an arc gpu get the same but i have a feeling you're probably right and either way (for me atleast) it won't matter as i too have a 12700k.,i hope this info helps others who have questions finally kinda understand how it all works and what qualifies thanks again for helping me get to the bottom of it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
interesting.,i have the intel gaming windows app and i don't see the new games mentioned anywhere.,just the cod bundle.,i registered with the gaming thing after redeeming my cod bundle and reading you could get the other three.,the whole thing confuses me honestly.,"outside the app, i don't see where to even sign in on the web.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if they can't help you there's an option on the site to submit a purchase verification thing and likley that will get you a key if you can't get mc to figure out out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
any word back from mc?,i'm in the same boat with a a750 and did not receive a master key for my purchase.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i got my master code from newegg and used it of the intel software offer page and it mentioned signing up to get the 3 other games i clicked yes / continue on that page and finished the survey saw the cod + pick 3 bundle in the dashboard but i can't find anywhere or anything else about the other 3 games not on this site nor the intel gaming access site....

not sure what i'm supposed to do or what i'm looking for.",am i supposed to to go someplace else to get them should i be looking for an email is there more steps i didn't mention i need to do?,any help would be appreciated if you have in fact gotten access to the other 3 games please share any details and anything i missed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got both sets with a amd 5950x and a 3090 in my system.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so here's what i've just found out after going through the process.,"get master key from retailer

enter key and begin sign up process

when asked to join intel gaming access program for 3 more games say yes and continue through the page to confirm that you want to join and finish survey.","you'll eventually finish and land on the dashboard with the cod bundle listed and not much else to do for now as cod can't be activated til 28th but you can pick your 3 software (i only picked one so far)

after some time you'll eventually get an email from intel (landed in my promo section in gmail) that says ""welcome to arc insiders"")

open this email to find another master key this one for the remaining 3 games

hopefully this finally spells things out as clearly as possible for everyone.","no you don't need a intel cpu installed you don't even need your arc gpu (heck i did all of it from my phone)

no need to download any app app or sign in on anything else.",let me know if anyone has any questions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yah i just replied to someone else in a long post and said that-i saw it but last night that button for submission seemed inactive.,iâ€™ll try again,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
drove back to mc tonight.,they are clueless.,someone in the general product area basically said if itâ€™s not on their website somewhere then itâ€™s something thatâ€™s not currently active.,"i ended up having to buy something anyway so then i talked to somebody up at the customer service desk when i checked out, and they said typically when things include codes for promotions, that it filters through all of their systems and the code and instructions print out on the receipt or you get an email, because the purchase triggers them needing your email thatâ€™s how things in the past have worked.",there was a previous intel gamer days promo this summer and the codes for qualifying cpu purchases were on the receipt.,i think we need to reach out to intel or maybe mc over their support email links and see what they say.,the intel dashboard and account set-up for the promo has a way to submit proof of purchase but the buttons to upload seemed non-functional.,"the promo period seems like itâ€™s going to last for three months, so what i worry about is that micro center wonâ€™t be involved with the promotion until way past a possible return date and the employees basically just said that because of their price protection thing that a manager may be able to basically return and resell the product, which would then trigger any possible code on the receipt once it was active in their system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thereâ€™s no number to call them over the phone so if i canâ€™t make it there tonight i wonâ€™t be able to go until thursday unfortunately.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
youâ€™ll get another email from intel.,it will  contain another key to use then another promotion-box shows up on your dashboard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you mean you didn't even have the intel gpu installed?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i appreciate the write-up.,i don't remember being asked about the gaming access program though.,hope that doesn't mean i don't get it.,did you get the 770 or the 750?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i did this but its been many days and still haven't a gotten email what am i doing wrong?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the update.,i opened a support ticket with intel and submitted a copy of my receipt.,will update you once i hear back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i did this but its been many days and still haven't a gotten email what am i doing wrong?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got all the games before my a770 even arrived.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"750

check under account - - settings - - intel partners and see if you see ""arc gaming access program"" listed as a partner.",that might tell you if you did or not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
please do.,thanks!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
itâ€™s possible they are no longer offering the additional promotion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
and can you elaborate... did you get just code with the code given and then also signed up for intel gamer access program?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i got the 750 as well, from newegg.",which account?,just the one on softwareoffer.i tell.com?,that's the only one i have and settings just shows edit user details.,sorry if i'm a little dense.,this whole thing has been odd and frustrating.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
okay so initial response from intel indicates that they are investigating the issue with certain retailers.,they will reach back out soon with more information.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you need to update the bios with flash stick,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"b0 stepping should be cut-down raptor lake, which will likely consume quite a bit less power.",c0 stepping will perform better due to higher clocks and extra cores,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
unless you are planning to overclock them what does it matter?,"if people are stressing out over non k steppings, just buy a 13600k and be done with it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"do 13400s with b0 stepping even exist, though?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so i bought 13500 and it is c0 stepping,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm upgrading from 12400f.,i think no matter of stepping i get huge difference.,right?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's what rumors said.,i don't know if it exists.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.club386.com/here-are-all-the-intel-13th-gen-core-raptor-lake-cpus-being-released-some-surprises/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they're present in motherboards cpu support, so they most likely do exist.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes i'm aware of the rumour, yet sadly at the moment it seems unfounded.",i've only seen evidence of c0 stepping on existing 13400 cpus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i found this!,"[https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/230501/intel-core-i513400f-processor-20m-cache-up-to-4-60-ghz.html](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/230501/intel-core-i513400f-processor-20m-cache-up-to-4-60-ghz.html)

it indeed lists a b0 and c0 model, albeit apparently it's referring to tray versions?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i've only been able to find 13400s with c0 stepping in those lists, could you share the one where you found b0 stepping please?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

very interesting thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you have a new i7 or i9?,get a contact frame.,"it makes sure there is no cpu bending/ warping, can only reduce temps and get better boosts.",the ilm issue is present on z690 and z790 boards.,only very few motherboards actually changed/fixed it.,get a contact frame.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is this also worth it for a 13600k?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you in contact frame sales?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do you happen to know what motherboards have changed it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,donâ€™t care what frame you get but their cheap and effective.,just helping other people out since it helped me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i unfortunately do not.,i know some were msi but i do not know what versions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got one but haven't installed it yet.,i just want to see if a contact frame will get me any decrease.,"my pc doesn't run hot though, so i could see myself putting off the install for a while.","maybe i'll get lucky next year and score a 13900ks 6ghz, which would be a great time to do the contact frame.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ah ok. i'm getting the new msi edge z790 tomorrow so i was curious if it would have it fixed or not.,"but i have the contact frame, i'll just install it just to be safe.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but they did not and by buying asus' motherboards you're also buying a ticket lottery for ram overclockability.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think the zen 4 x3d chips will take the gaming title (with a few outliers in which intel might show a few modest wins).,intel will still be very strong in multi-threaded productivity focused workloads.,"i'm thrilled there are valid options from both camps, suited for different use cases.","it's keeping the two companies (somewhat) honest, at least in terms of pricing.",we need this kind of competition in the gpu space.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on games.,simulators the extra cache will win hands down.,fps/rpg more mixed.,that's assuming you're running 13th gen on decent (6400+) ddr5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it will put amd ahead in gaming, but by the looks of it, not by much.",seems like 10% is what's advertised.,"not to mention the unholy price tags these cpus will get, 7800x3d will likely be $450, with the 7950x3d probably close to $1k.",add to that am5 is still expensive for a decent board and you only have the option of ddr5.,"for an x3d setup, you'll be paying a lot more than even a 13700k setup for a measly 10%.",a 10% where you're already hitting ridiculously high frame rates with the 13700k.,"anyone claiming intel is dead is a moron, intel will be infinitely better value going forward.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm hoping the same as i have before, i really hope they perform well and stack up really close to 13th gen. always been an intel guy myself (turned off of amd during the fx era, know it's a new era for them and they've been performing well), and had recently jumped up from a 9900k to a 13700k.","while i personally would always choose an intel chip, i've always smiled over towards the amd side ever since the ryzen 2000 series, due to them finally putting intel in a choke hold to where they needed to finally bring more cores and power down to the consumer chips.",this 7000 x3d series excites me because look at what happened last generation and how the i5 ended up.,it only makes me look forward to 14th gen and then the next generation of ryzen chips to see where we'll be.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well rumours have it that meteor lake desktop will not be ready for 2023 but a raptor lake refresh will come later in the year.,who knows intel will probably take that crown back.,would make sense for them to come back with an raptor lake refresh as zen 4 x3d is kinda like a zen 4 refresh.,this tit for tat battle is great for consumers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think a bit different:

- 13900ks ( will still be used by majority of people who wants the single thread benchmark crown or very low resolution) but the platform overall is dead - so keep an eye on this.",- 7000x3d - should be the option to go for majority of peopleâ€¦ why?,"- am5 - cheaper mobo are going to release and you have upgrade possibilities in the next 4-5 years
- gaming - majority of games will benefit from the cache
- work load - the cache basically makes the 7950x3d ( similar with the threadripper spectrum) which a lot of people will benefit from - gaming and working stations
- ddr5 prices are decreasing every single day.",i think it is a good time to jump on a new platform which is to last for the next years to come.,at the end of the day you do you - but the arguments here shows that amd is the way to go.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i am guessing they will match the 13900k while being slightly faster than 13700k and 13600k, but who knows",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[removed],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not enough for beating 13900ks with high clocked ram speeds,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i agree with that last statement.,i kind of thought intel was done for a while and amd had taken over completely and i only just recently returned to the hardware side of things.,then i learned intel had gotten back on their feet and their 10nm finally paid off and alder lake and raptor lake were giving zen 3 and 4 a serious run for their money.,"iâ€™m glad that when i decided to get a new cpu it was close between intel and amd on my decision, and iâ€™m pretty happy now going with the i5 12600k after that awesome microcenter deal after thinking iâ€™d never own an intel cpu again.",competition is always good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"at this rate, it's intel that will save us in the gpu space.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">i think the zen 4 x3d chips will take the gaming title

i mean, they definitely will.",anybody who thinks otherwise is fooling themselves.,"even with the bigger clock reductions this time, it's still gonna add a ton of performance in quite a few games.","it's also likely to come at a notable price premium too, though...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fair point!,yeah i'm running the g.skill 6400 cl32 (f5-6400j3239g16gx2-t).,also like i've discussed in other comments.,resolution is also important to take into account.,at 4k for example all high end cpus are gpu limited.,i personally play at 3440x1440.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13th gen on tuned b die does pretty well also,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you think with a raptor lake refresh there is a shot intel will keep lga 1700 for a 3rd generation?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am curious about this refresh as they appear to be already pushing things pretty hard and not leaving a lot on the table with this type of die/node to keep things compatible with the socket and chipset and whatnot.,"maybe higher single core boost, maybe more traditional cache?","also, it feels like meteor lake desktop is suffering from just a natural bumpiness from switching their entire methodology from monolithic to chiplet and they have to push through the veil to get to the new era, whereas amd kind of already pushed through prior.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you forgot the most important factor: price.,as if x3d parts will not come with a price premium.,rumor is that the 7800x3d will be $500.,you can get an entire system of 13600k minus the gpu for that.,the majority of people have a budget and should buy the best bang for their buck.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i wasn't talking about the platform as a whole, i was simply asking about performance directly compared cpu to cpu, money and the rest not being an issue.",all i care about it actual performance in games.,"as i said in another comment here the thing to keep in mind is that as soon as you go higher in resolution, the cpu becomes less important and gpu becomes more important.",i 100% agree with what you are saying when it comes to the am5 platform having a better longevity.,"so objectively 100% agreed, it's the better choice!","however, personally i don't really care about how long something is supported as i don't update my cpu often anyway, i just get one of the higher end ones in whichever is the latest generation, and have it for 4-5 years and then change the whole platform after that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"personally, if i was buying a 13900ks, the dead platform would be irrelevant to me.","by the time i'd need a new cpu, it wouldn't matter anyways.","it should last 3-4 years, if not a bit more in some circumstances.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
platform cost of am5 is pretty terrible.,equivalent intel boards are priced better.,the cpus themselves are fairly evenly matched for price:performance.,"i'd be happy with either, but at the moment i favour intel because their motherboards are priced more fairly.",the only thing you lose out going intel is motherboard longevity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
heres hoping intel and amd combined can compete with nvidia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"arc a770 owner here, we're fighting the good fight!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i 100% expect them to be better, ofcourse.","the thing is though, how big of a difference will it be at high resolutions?","after all, there's a reason all cpu tests are done at 1080p, to actually show the difference clearly.","i'm running 3440x1440 currently, where it's more gpu demanding than cpu demanding.",this of course happens even more at 4k for example.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the two gaming focused cpus aren't particularly terrible for pricing:

- ryzen 7 7800x3d â€“ $449 us

- ryzen 5 7600x3d â€“ $349 us

it's the the am5 platform cost that continues to be amd's biggest obstacle, not the cpu prices themselves.",am5 motherboards are a rip off.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"generally agree -- though microsoft flight simulator though is even cpu bound at 4k:

[https://asset.watch.impress.co.jp/img/pcw/docs/1402/702/g33\_o.png](https://asset.watch.impress.co.jp/img/pcw/docs/1402/702/g33_o.png)

at 4k -  5800x = 50.4 fps,  5800x3d = 62 fps,  12900k = 59 fps

and that's with a 3090ti.",so a 4080 or 4090 will be even more bottlenecked.,"also these are averages, so minimums would show an even larger difference.",(for other games in the future -- a 4090 can generally render something as fast at 4k as a 3090 at 3440x1440.  ),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes.,no way anyone would go for it otherwise.,single cpu gen on a new socket?,ya no.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if they can squeeze some extra cache in the refresh cpus, may be able to fight back against 7000x3d.",it will be so disappointing if it ends up being just a minor mhz bump like the ks ripoff models,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">however, personally i don't really care about how long something is supported as i don't update my cpu often anyway, i just get one of the higher end ones in whichever is the latest generation, and have it for 4-5 years and then change the whole platform after that.",i've done the same for my last couple builds and it has worked really well.,"i can somewhat understand the appeal of buying low-mid tier parts and upgrading more frequently, but i've never understood those who buy high end models then update like every 1-2 years.",even 3 years imo is kind of borderline -- because the jumps simply aren't particularly large like gpus.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"even though framerates sometimes actually go down a hair due to single core base freq, i find myself unable to drop down to the x7 tier of cpu's (either vendor) from the x9 because i just can't let go of the idea of having the most overall performance and cores.","i think it comes from being around computers so long, the notion that performance is so precious, it must be squeezed out of everything to it's own end (even when a dead silent fanless laptop can now browse the web and do most daily stuff nearly instantly)

however, there are starting to be some cracks, i am getting sick of how loud my cooling solutions have to be for top of the line everything.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but am5 can be used next gen and won't be pricey as it is now.,probably... think about intel: intel's next platform (14th gen + ddr5) will be cheap?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
big fat agree.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ill be all over them if they make a tinyass sub 75 watt card with 8-16 gb of vram.,"currently if you want more then 4gb of vram in an lp card you need to spend 400$+ and buy 5-7 year old parts, and those cards cap at only 8gb.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
obviously more cache is better but it's tradeoff and last gen it sacrificed too much elsewhere to make se sense for my use pattern.,so i'd definitely want to see some actual benchmarks first.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's true, but a buddy still saw quite crazy gains in all games going from a 3900x to a 5800x3d.",he's at 3440x1440 with a 3090ti.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"> the thing is though, how big of a difference will it be at high resolutions?","yeah, that's a fair point when the system is gpu limited.","the only real benefit in these scenarios is the improved 1% lows, so avoidance of stutter.",this is where the added l3 cache of the x3d will really show its advantage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i'm wondering if ryzen 7000x3d would be enough to make the 4090 not a waste for 1080p.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there will be no ryzen 5 7600x3d ...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this guy is confused,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"aye, there are definitely games that would require a different set of tools so to speak, to perform as good as possible.",i'm just generalizing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s awesome.,i was wondering if i made a good choice buying a z690 motherboard considering it wonâ€™t have the longevity of an am5 board but this gives me a solid upgrade path if so.,though to be fair i wonâ€™t be upgrading my i5 12600k for some time.,i need a new gpu first.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and no prices were announced either, did they cross a dimensional portal or something?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ever since i heard about the refresh rumors, this is exactly what i plan on doing with my 12600k.","hard to bet on a rumor but if we actually get 3 generations of cpu on lga 1700, that'd be amazing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
undervolting is disabled on 12th gen mobile with the sole exception of the i9-12900hk.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
will it be able to in the future?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's locked as mitigation for a hardware vulnerability (plundervolt) and as far as i'm aware intel has not said if it plans to fix it in existing hardware (or even if it's possible) or what future gen can we expect to be released with a fix.,"i'm as disappointed as you, i have the same chip and i used to undervolt all my previous laptops.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"theyve been available since launch in the uk, i found my discounted 12100 already.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
should i get 13700k instead of 13700 for undervolting?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no news here in malaysia, sad, was hoping to get a i5 13600 by the next two weeks",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you plan on undervolting your cpu go for the 13700 non k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
which is kinda bs since malaysia's neighbours (indonesia and vietnam) have been selling these cpus since last month lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that's 13600k, not 13600, although i do see some 13500 for sale now",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"grab it, the 13600 is not worth it over the 13500 (unless they have the same price).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are they the same performance?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"about 200mhz diff, same core count tho.",the difference is less than 5%.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"alright then, i just need a big jump on speed compared to my i5 10400, that cpu has some problems handling modded skyrim, which is single core heavy so every mhz counts a lot",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so now the site is down, weâ€™ll done intel",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
we're all in the same boat... smart intel decided to release codes to everyone at once rather than rolling out before release and allowing people to preload.,now the servers are overloaded and no one can get in.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

did they give you a code to redeem or automatically placed the game in your battle net account ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"3060ti is just better, but for 1080p either one will be more then enough.",i suggest choosing a desired fps and then looking at benchmarks for specific games.,"if both meet the mark, go for the cheaper one.",p.s.,make sure you have an ssd instead of a hard drive.,it's a massive difference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there is a small performance difference but so small you wouldn't notice unless you're benchmarking.,"if you see the ti version on sale get it, otherwise get the normal version.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
both cards will net you over 100fps at 1080p with a few expectations.,all depends on the game.,"the 3600 will be a slight bottleneck to both cards in a game like fortnite using performance settings, but both cards will bottleneck in cyberpunk.","sooo, get the rtx 3060 for 1080p - 1440p and the rtx 3060ti does fine at 4k using high settings and has more rt cores for ray tracing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
saw the benchmarks for both of them with the cpu that i have and the difference is only 10 fps.,the 3060 is 100â‚¬ cheaper than the ti.,"also, i have an ssd.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3060 then, 10 frames is nothing.",and if you use vsync (which you should unless playing a shooter) it shouldn't matter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm i reading it right?,"they compared ""tdp""s after explaining how each company uses the term differently and even showed how amd's doesn't reflect package power at all?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it would be interesting to see the clock frequencies as well.,looks like intel is sticking to predefined curve and aggressively limiting the clocks while amd allows the cores to run at a higher frequency.,zen 5 changed the optimization to be temperature based rather than voltage based tuning which might partially explain the discrepancy.,the discrepancy in efficiency between both processors definitely will be lower in the 3d graph compared to 2d.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they used ppt.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">the catch here, however, is that the amd platform as a whole was far more lax in sticking to its programmed ppt values, as evidenced by ycruncher power consumption.","despite setting the 7950x to 65 w, we still measured 90.3 w under that workload.",so they claim but it is suspicious that they saw the same power consumption you get from setting tdp to 65w.,this is also the first time i've read of ryzen not respecting ppt values.,"edit:

here's a little compilation of articles looking into the power scaling of both cpus together on cinebench r23 mt.","7950x_x000d_

"i'm not saying it doesn't happen, but i've been running alder lake on windows 10 since january this year.",i'm yet to have a game or heavy workload loaded onto an e core.,"i spent quite a bit of time first couple months monitoring every process and thread, where it was loading etc.",it all worked fine to the point i don't bother monitoring it anymore.,i've never had a frame drop or anything like that in the middle or a game or anything.,i may have just had a good run as people have reported it happening - i think it's not as common as people lead to believe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
where does it handle them improperly?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just move to windows 11 already.,"window management, direct storage and hdr support are far superior to w10 and it'll be supported for longer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"windows 10 is leaner than 11, so any performance you get in the scheduler is lost due to the heavier requirements.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i do not believe it ever will.,intel write a piece of software for windows 11 only.,there are no reason to write support for an outdated platform as windows 11 is now the current version,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
windows server 2022 on a msi motherboard and core i7 12000â€¦ install hyper-v and hangs on rebootâ€¦ disable all the e cores and it works like a champ.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there is literally zero reasons to stay on windows 10 anyway.,win 11 had its problems at the start but now is far superior.,you might not like some changes in the ux at first but you get used to it pretty quickly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you will need windows 11 to handle e-core properly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well it's working for me, if i'm not mistaken i5 12450h has 4 e-cores... if that's the case then they're all working just fine",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i bought a new laptop ...it has windows 11 the exp was so frustrating i downgraded to ten.,i would not install 11 if they paid me likely not getting a ecore rig for another windows generation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not even 11 does...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"there was no big difference in the beginning, so what could be fixed:

the only real problem was with drm failing in some games, and afaik, those game have been patched.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
any difference in what?,"i heard that version 20h2 (iirc) was the update that ""fixed e-cores"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ok, good to know, thanks!",i guess i will stay on win 10 and if it is an issue i will either drop the e-cores or head to 11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have heard that windows 10 will sometimes schedule demanding processes onto the slower e-cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in computers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no point downgrade system to 11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
direct storage is the same on both.,they both have direct x 12 ultra.,hdr on anything less than a hdr 800-1000 screen is a complete joke.,it is basically jacking up the brightness.,maybe you own a gaming monitor that has hdr800 or better...not sure if any exist.,last time i checked they were all hdr 400.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this appears to be the case in the review linked above.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is win 11 really fine to switch?,"i have heard some bad things about it, and i am not sure if i would get used to the ui very well.","i guess i have the option of just trying it out but idk

is there a way to dual-boot 10 and 11 or does that make no sense to do and i should just switch to 11?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
win 11 is one big pile of crap atm.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the fact that their customers use it is plenty of reason to do just that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i see the opposite.,"there are literally zero reasons to ""upgrade"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"apparently not, since all the benchmarks show windows 10 winning 50% of the time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"what does ""the experience was so frustrating"" mean?",like what bothered you about it?,"i have built my new pc and win 11 runs fine, no issues for me...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"e-cores are a great idea imo, you can have all your game threads running on p-cores and then the e-cores in the background do all the other stuff like the various stuff windows does by default that would otherwise eat into your game's cores.",i have had framedrops before from windows background processes and being able to avoid that issue would be great.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
e cores have already been around for a substantial time - this is the first time we've seen them in desktop pcs.,i think they'll be around for a long time - especially in oem builds and laptops and the like.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
quite the other way around.,cpus may get further disaggregated and have even more sets of specialized cores.,this is happening soon as intel is adding ai units into meteor lake.,amd is also jumping in making a core denoted zen 4c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
where is your source for that lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"well i have heard that some important processes get put on the slower e-cores with windows 10, and that's why it isn't really ""fixed"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"iâ€™m pretty sure you meant 21h2 instead of 20h2, but no, it has not and will not be â€œfixedâ€ in windows 10. it generally works fine, but works better and smoother in 11.

"w11 is a solid upgrade over 10 though, especially as a gamer with better hdr, vrr and video scheduling support.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
windows 11 is a good os i haven't had any issues with it other than having to click show more when wanting my normal options right clicking on something.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ok heres a big autistic rant enjoy!",so i was bought a asus gaming laptop for xmas zephyrus g15 with a ryzen and a rtx 3060..i downgraded because it was ryzen and didn't need windows 11 for e cores.,"there were a couple issues i had compared to our custom gaming desktops which all run windows 10.

printer failure issues on my home network was probably the biggest one this is the sole reason i gave up in frustration because i spent 3 hours trying to get a printer that works on 3 other pcs all windows 10 pcs to show up on my new windows 11 laptop.",i even called epson they told me in the end it was a known issue with windows 11 that was causing over 80 of their products to be unable to work via wifi  i basically had no choice but to downgrade.,they had a work around in this wonky printer troubleshooter but 45 minutes of reinstalling drivers and troubleshooting everytime i want to print is not viable for my job.,"printer was brand new epson et 3850 it also failed to work with my other work printer which is a brother mfc j49dw

they are not gonna believe you.. the black plastic cover is gone so you installed a cpu..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i once bent 1 pin assembling a classmateâ€™s computer.,we managed to get it running by straightening the pin with a toothpick.,"if the rma wonâ€™t take the computer back, you could try this.",donâ€™t throw it out until you have at least tried it.,"just be gentle, and donâ€™t bent too far.",if you start bending in both directions multiple times it might break off.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
try the rma but they will most likely say user fault.,"if they send it back without replacement, you can try to fix it with a toothpick or needle.","it's already broken, what could be worse?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i used tweezers (just the edge, didn't actually ""tweeze"" the pin) to straighten a few.",it wasn't 100% straight but everything's been fine in the pc for over a year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i was able to bend back around 4 or 5 pins on my lga 1151 socket using an empty mechanical pencil, the tip was able to grab the pins much easier than a toothpick",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
did it come this way?,or did you do it?,"if it arrived like this, then its the rma fault or wherever you bought it from.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
happened in my builds couple times (at my fault) i used toothpick/needle to gently straighten them to the same angle as others were.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"straighten them out using a toothpick, or buy a new mobo.",rma is out of question.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
u could try to straighten them urself.,i had this once and went to a local electronics repair shop.,they had proper equipment and a magnifying glass.,they fixed it in a few minutes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i remember upgrading my dad's cpu and tried to do it quickly by not disconnecting it.,bent a couple pins.,"i got it back on and it didn't post, so i reset the bios.",had to take a picture as it was an awkward position.,"i used i think my razor knife and bent them back, took a moment, took another picture to review.",again i was still strapped for time and i quickly fixed it.,it posted just fine.,i later tried tooth picks and fixed it for a couple other people since then.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bro the year 23â€™ is off to a bad start .. ðÿ‘€ the random pin in the middle wtf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

just bend back....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"return it, ask for new one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i see more damage in the socket than just 3 pins.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"bent pins are 99% will be ""users fault"", unless you make a video of unboxing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but... but... you can't bend tree random pins even if you drop a screwdriver in the socket!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
im a bit scared to do so.,how fragile are they?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

not fragile.,just... tiny.,a good eye and a steady hand.,we have one guy at our office who can do it.,"all of us others are blind old farts)

most motherboards are overvolting 13th gen chips in some cases to beyond 1.4v which is completely uncoolable and leaves them running at 100c all the time.,"theres 2 opinions:

1) this is totally fine.",2) this is not fine and you should undervolt.,"my 13600kf requests 1.409v at stock and hits 100c on a 420mm aio on open frame case, bearing in mind it only runs at 5.1 ghz.","with manual voltage, it runs 5.4 ghz at just 1.25v.",now the trend that i am noticing is funny.,everyone with knowledge that manually overrides the stock voltage even on a 13900k has them working perfect with a nice overclock on top at 1.25-1.3v.,some really nice 13900ks out there with 6.0 - 6.2 all core at around 1.3v.,people that have decided to leave their chip running at stock volts and 100c lose stability when undervolting - because their chips have already degraded and they don't realize it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

just save money and try to gather more for future updates.,"to change something, you have to replace everything.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why not instead make use of your current hardware and just upgrade your cpu to something like the i5-10500/600?,"your gpu isn't that good, so unless you plan to upgrade alongside your mobo and cpu, you should stick to 10th gen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there's about a $30 price delta between an i3 and i3-10400f.,if you don't mind the time hassle of reselling.,it's probably worth it for quality of life the extra four threads get you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
150w upgrade.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would look for a used i5 10gen and do the gpu first.,if you look at the tflops troughput of the 2 latest gpu versions and take your 1660s with only 5 tflops you can guess what will become a real issue very soon.,but always keep in mind the screen refreshrate makes a huge difference.,60fps @ 1080 is way cheaper than reaching 144fps @ 1080p.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i have 16 gb, and i mostly play gta 5 and then edit videos on davinci resolve.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on what res and settings you want.,"if you play on 1080p and mainly older games, absolutely upgrade the cpu as you would barely get any improvements by upgrading the gpu.",but if you play in higher resolutions and with more demanding games at maxed out settings then it would be better to upgrade the gpu.,the 1660 super is still pretty good though.,if you upgrade your cpu then youâ€™d also notice an improvement outside of gaming as well so that might be something to consider.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

but because i wanted to have a setup exe from intel, i also did:

the ak620 is already overkill for the 13400. iâ€™m using the ak400 (which is half the size of the ak620) with a 13600k and it stays under 90c even with pl1=pl2=181w.,no need to worry about temperatures if you have a good air cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no.,your only recourse is to download intel xtu and manually turn down the pl2 to a level that's manageable.,intel xtu is an amazing software that does bios-level changes from windows,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"pardon the noob question, but will xtu work on all motherboards?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you can use it to adjust the voltage of the cpu but not the multiplier to make it faster.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 13700k is basically an improved 12900k, so the 12900k will be faster than the 13600k (about 27k in r23 vs 24k).","so long as the 12900k is priced about halfway between a 13600k and 13700k, it's a good deal.",the fact that it's cheaper than a 13600k for you definitely makes it a good deal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"well, it could work at idle and medium loads...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"that would explain the load temperature, but not the idle temperature.","55c at idle usually indicate poor airflow in the case, poor application of thermal paste, poor seating of the heatsink on the cpu, or high ambient temperature.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thermal throttling for a few minutes won't do any harm to the cpu, and some laptops get insanely hot on a regular basis.",you need to do the test to understand if the cooler is properly mounted.,"if it maintains decent frequencies then it probably struggles going idle for some reason, while if it drops really low then it means the cooler isn't making good contact.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you can set pl1/pl2 maybe a 60w - using xtu, with this, you might be okay till your new cooler has arrived.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
exactly this!,also check your fan curve.,cpu temperatures don't mean anything without a fan speed attached.,"if your motherboard has a weird curve, it might not be asking for enough fan speed at idle.",literally any cooler should be able to handle 5 watts of tdp.,and take the side panel off the case during testing to make sure that case airflow isn't an issue.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
55c at 0.7 idle is beyond anytihing.,suggesting to run an all-core high might damage something.,because thermal throttling expects to be at least some cooling that works.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks, i already checked fan speed and increased too but its not helping.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no it should still be ok. i once tried to run my cpu without the pump connector inserted and it got so hot it shut down as soon as it loaded in windows.,if they're only getting 55c at idle and can use the pc normally it means that there is at least some contact and the cooler is somewhat working.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"not worth paying for a whole new motherboard, your not missing out on much.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have run a few cinebench r23 tests actually.,"the multicore score is around 23.5k something, maximum voltage underload is 1.3v, max temp is 83c, everything is on auto.",i can also tweak some voltages with my board and it actually reflects the change in hwinfo with lower temperature as well.,i understood it is ideal to match the k chip with z mobos but unfortunately the non-k versions are not launched yet where i live and i got a pretty good deal on the kf version so i just went with it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
weâ€™re all obviously multi-millionaires around here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"your chip is running fine then, some motherboards overvolt these chips to 1.4v+ which is the ones running at 100c and those need to be undervolted.","this is especially problematic if it happens on a b660 as most cant reduce the loadline voltages, but yours is running ok so no need to worry.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

isn't that bad for gaming?,i have heard to turn off the e cores and hyperthreading.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
turning off the e cores and hyperthreading will make it show up as an 8 core 8 thread cpu.,leave it on unless you're having specific issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hyperthreading was bad for gaming about a decade ago before programmers learned how to work with it properly.,that's why you can find such claims with google.,it hasn't been true for years though.,e-cores were never really bad.,some games don't like them but those are a minority that is going away.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the gains by turning off ht and e-cores, if any, are minimal and game dependent.",and you could worsen performance of your computer's other functions.,just run everything with ht and e-cores on (stock) and call it a day.,are there any games you're having issues with?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's pretty much wrong.,as a developer there is hardly any possibility to optimize for hyperthreading as scheduling is managed by the os.,if anything then the opposite is true.,in most cases better optimized software benefits less from hyperthreading.,and hyperthreading still hurts performance of many applications.,cpus just got fast enough to not notice them any more.,in my opinion/experience hyperthreading mostly mostly benefits synthetic benchmarks and often doesn't affect real world performance by a significant margin.,"fun fact: for this exact reason most super computers don't use smt/hyperthreading,
both amd and intel recommend disabling it.",on epyc systems there are presets for bios options that optimize for certain applications.,for cpu intensive/hpc workloads smt will be turned off by default.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
umm not really.,i mainly play tarkov and that game is very weird with frames and hyperthreading.,i use a program called (process lasso) to disable hyper threading for that game only.,my streamer i watch has a ryzen 7 5800x3d.,with the same 3080ti gpu.,and he's getting like 20 30 more frames then me.,i thought the i7 12700k was better or on par.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in game programming the major change is the shift from being limited by single large thread to more on computational throughput.,hyperthreading can be detrimental when you have many threads but need one of them to be super fast.,no modern game works better without hyperthreading.,and with slower cpus hyperthreading is even more important so itâ€™s absolutely not about â€œcpus being fast enough for us to not noticeâ€.,supercomputers can use hyperthreading depending on what they are doing.,in supercomputers case often you need more memory bandwidth per thread so hyperthreading would be detrimental when the number of memory channels stay the same.,i guess sometimes you might also want synchronization between threads which would also mean hyperthreading isnâ€™t good.,but if you just need computational throughput but less data throughput then hyperthreading is useful in high performance computing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the increase in fps is because the 5800x3d has a massive amount of l3 cache compared to most other cpu's, and some games and programs respond really well to that increase in cache, and other games you'll see no benefit.","tarkov is one game that really enjoys the extra cache, hence why they get better fps than you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i use a noctua nh-u12a on my 13700k.,i idle around 32c and top off at about 72 during heavy gaming but average around 66. i have 2x 140 intake fans and 1x140 exhaust on the case.,iâ€™m getting better temps with this set up than i did th my old 9900k and a 240 aio.,maybe try reapplying thermal pass and reseating the cooler.,this is a silly question so take no offense but iâ€™ll throw it out thereâ€¦.,u do have the lga1700 mounting bracket correct?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13th gen is hot.,if you are confident itâ€™s mounted correctly there are some things you can try.,idle should be under 40 really.,gaming mine runs up to 70c (depends on game) but cod cycles around 52/54.,iâ€™m on a 360 aio and 5000d airflow case.,i also set max power in my msi unify motherboard to 300w.,i also undervolt with -ve .1 offset and i can even do +2 turbo offset and i get 5.7ghz all core stock and very small 6ghz reading on hwinfo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
up to 100 degrees celsius is okay for cpus but should not become the norm.,if it sits around 90-95 degrees under load it is okay but not ideal.,if your cpu always runs that hot something is wrong.,maybe check if it really just runs as fast and hot as it needs.,it could be that the power setting in windows is set to maximum performance which makes your pc always run on full load.,you always want to have that setting set to balanced and never change it.,modern processors know better how to handle the load and will adjust themselves accordingly.,make sure that your thermal paste is applied properly and you cpu cooler is sitting tight and pulling in air from the front and blowing it out at the back.,in a common setup you would want more fans pulling in air than pushing out to reduce dust.,so 2 or more at the front blowing air though the length of the case to the cpu fan and from there to the single backside fan.,more can be better but just make sure that more fans or faster ones are pushing more air inside.,so right now you desperately need an exhaust fan.,if you have a lot of fans then it is usual to have for example 3 at the front and 3 at the bottom for intake and three at the top and one at the back for exhaust.,just make sure that you have a linear and unobstructed airflow like coming in from the front and bottom going diagonally to the back and up.,your cables should be out of the way and hidden on the backside.,warm air always flows higher than cool one so that way you are not working against the principles of physics.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

a mild undervolt and a contact frame will work wonders.,i almost never see over 75c when gaming/normal tasks and the max i see is 85c in cinebench with a 13700k.,before the undervolt and contact frame my temps were crazy lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you have an msi board, you can easily undervolt by lowering the cpu lite load https://youtu.be/gcpuuujrqku",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yes, you are the issue of this.",replace nh with a 280/360mm aio.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you could get a better cooler as once you use these cpuâ€™s they really are hot.,if youâ€™re using a 13700k or 13900k the minimum iâ€™d recommend is 360mm aio so that the cpu is really taken care of.,like the others suggested you could also undervolt it.,personally iâ€™d get a good aio and undervolt it for longevity.,thatâ€™s just my preference.,nhd-15 is a good air cooler but it only equates to a 240mm aio which in my opinion doesnâ€™t cut it for these cpuâ€™s if youâ€™re just purely gaming then this does not really matter.,"if you run benchmarks, synthetics, heavy workloads then go get a good 360mm aio like an arctic liquid freezer ii.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yes for sure at the point where we are today the cpu is just gonna lower the performance based on the cooler capacity and if the mb really shots too much voltage it can be undervolted by a lot but again it will be at performance cost at some point,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"usually you can enter your pc's bios by pressing either f2, delete, or tab as soon as you turn your pc on.",there is usually a prompt for this on the screen before windows loads.,inside the bios you should be able to see the manufacturer and bios firmware edition.,"once you have that written down, then search online for that manufacturer to see what the latest firmware version is for that particular model (ie.",if there is a newer version than the one you have).,if there is an update there should be some instructions on how to update the firmware.,also check on the website of whoever built your pc (for example hp have their own bios firmware updates).,be careful updating the bios as doing it wrong could brick your motherboard (where the bios is installed).,the intel tool really should work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"as crazy as this sounds, your temps are too low now.",you have undervolted the cpu to the point that it is now throttling quite a bit of performance.,your cb r23 score is within 5 percent of my 13700k.,"a stock 13900k runs at almost 40,000 in cb.",you'd probably be better off setting a temp target of 90-95c instead of 77c unless you just want to run your cpu gimped.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most of the credit goes to this guy.,https://www.reddit.com/u/_patrol/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
honestly very little of my normal activity requires that much power.,have very few cpu intensive games and encoding is the rarity.,"fps remains consistent, thermals are under control, and honestly, still probly repaste with kyronaut for posterity sake(using stock corsair paste from the h150i).",hard to see the benefit provided by the extra heat.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"for example, world of warcraft barely utilizes cpu maintains 100-200fps.",overwatch 2 350-400 fps.,"havenâ€™t tested something like fallen order yet, but it caps fps at 144 so donâ€™t expect much change there",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all at 1080p fyi.,itâ€™s very much an overkill build.,"but give me room for more later if i want, custom loops, etc.","unless thereâ€™s a visibility performance gain outside a bench score, iâ€™m pretty happy with the thermals.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most 120mm aio coolers are worthless for cpus that use over 100 watts... and your i5-13600k uses 125 watts and boosts to over 180 watts in turbo mode.,you likely just need a better cooling solution.,you could try a push/pull fan setup on your aio... which is placing a fan on both sides of the radiator in a push/pull configuration.,this might make a small difference to hold you over until you can come up with something better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah the real solution is buying a new cooler - a 360 aio - and a new case to fit it.,or buy biggest aio that fits in the case you have now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
probably your cooler.,see what the cooling rating is on it.,you can get a cheap ak620 air cooler on sale or other cooler.,won't look as good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pull your cpu cooler off and check the thermal paste spread on it.,also make sure that your aio is pushing liquid through it and hasn't suffered from a faulty pump.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i forgot to mention that right now the ambient temperature here is of about 23â° c and if you see my bios pictures, the cpu was hitting 47â° c while doing absolutely nothing.","i think that the ideal temp for the cpu while idle should be something between 25âº\~35âº c, right?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you have to change your current aio to 240mm at least and force the cpu to not go further than 181w, which is stock.",you can also try to go with air coolers like nh-d15 or dark rock pro 4 if those aios is expensive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hey wartogh, it looks like you are having a cooling problem.",first - dont be afraid of 100c.,its normal for laptops.,"if youre running a high tdp load with a desktop i9 cpu, this is inevitable.",if youre hitting 100c in things like gaming and lighter tasks - then we have a problem.,"if thats the case, the first thing you want to do is to repaste the cooler.",taking it apart and putting it back together will solve the problem more often than you might believe.,"double check and make sure youre using the proper mounting equipment - using lga1200 mounts on a lga 1700 system might work, but performance wont be ideal.",make sure to test the cooler under power limited conditions before assuming its not working right.,"most non-sff coolers can handle loads of 200w, so test with a 200w power limit.","if youre still experiencing hot temperatures after checking all of the above, then its time to return the cooler or file a rma for repair.","*i am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.",please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/intel) if you have any questions or concerns.,*,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the responses so far.,so it seems there's nothing wrong with my config in the bios?,there's nothing more i can change or optimize in terms of uefi setup to lower my temps without loosing too much performance?,"if the answer is no, then i will keep this config for now until i can afford a new case and cooler",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ok well, sorry for not giving a full reply to this before.","there are two main conflicting issues with this problem:

a) these chips are meant to run at 100c and this is totally fine

b) these chips are being overvolted at stock bios settings.","not just from my own testing but all the results gathered from others, going over 1.35v under load on 13th gen is uncoolable with any aio setup, and custom loops don't fare any better.","the way to fix this is using ac_ll / dc_ll, e.g, my stock voltage is 1.409v.","dropping to lite load 1 (same thing on msi boards), it drops to 1.259v.",my temps go from instant 100c to 68c max.,"this is tried, tested and verified by everyone thats tried it, also at 1.25v my chip works flawlessly at 5.4 all core oc.","with the sheer scale of this issue affecting so many users with 13th gen chips, all kinds of information is being thrown around.","i am trying to extensively investigate this with intel and msi support, who both verified that the stock lite load voltages are set to 'worst case scenario', except even for a worst case chip they are still set far too high!","drop the ll values, and see the chip cool down instantly, or keep it running at 100c, those are the two options, do whichever one you think is right.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"voltage should be fine if you use cpu lite load mode 1-3, with playing with load line calibration so your system can be stable.","it will help lowering the voltage, watt and temp

but your temp are still high  
your case is not very good and your cooler too, these two combine doesn't help your temp

your case carbid 100r have a hdd cage disrupting one fan and with little airflow , + 120 mm aio isn't good enough  
also it doesn't support more than 120mm aio and an height limit of 150mm, which give you a limited choice of cooler

my recommandation : change for case which support 360mm aio (  ex: artic liquid freezer ii 360mm) or  
an aircooler height limit of minimum 165mm ( ex: noctua nh-u14s, d15, u12a)

if money is a problem,  the case can be brought second hand and same for aircooler",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
single 120mm aio is not what is expected to work properly with 181w.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sadly, but no.",you should have looked into this situation before jumping into it.,181w isn't a joke.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks for the response, my dude!","and here i was trying to figure how i would be able to save enough money asap to change the case and the cooler that i just bought, for something better.",so you are saying that even if i bought that 120mm cooler ak620 it would still hit 100â°c when going over 1.35v?,not even with those 240mm and 360mm coolers?,tomorrow i will do some research about this ac\_ll / dc\_ll to know how it works and how i can do it and i will try it to see how it goes.,"i don't pretend to overclock my cpu right now, so with my setup, do you have any suggestion on what values i may try to put on this ac\_ll / dc\_ll?","and after doing that, should i switch do lite load mode 1?","right now i'm running on mode 9 with turbo boost disabled, the cpu get between 34\~45â°c on idle and on 65â°c when i'm playing a pc game, but i'm losing a lot of performance (on gta 5 when my cpu was burning i managed to get about 140 fps, now i get like 85 fps, which is kinda ok for me since it's still over 60).","also, one last doubt: that cpu lite load stuff is an automatic undervolt that the msi motherboard do, right?","an undervolt that they know it will not brick my computer, i think.","if that's the case, can i / should i try to undervolt even more using xtu or throtlestop after going from mode 9 to mode 5 or bellow, or since i'm changing the lite load mode i shouldn't mess with undervolting anymore?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i recently removed my old 1 gps 8 port switch and plugged my pc directly to the moca adapter, as i feed my ethernet via coax to the basement where the modem and router are._x000d_  
to be fair i also upgraded my router a couple days ago so i could be the two things._x000d_

basically what it comes down to is the old networking equipment i had between my pc and the modem._x000d_

"out of curiosity, what switch?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what switch?,itâ€™s entirely possible the switch is the issue.,"at least with the i225-v, many of its communications issues (if not due to a marginal cable, also known to be a big problem even if the cable works fine with other nics) are hardware-based and relate to it â€œnot likingâ€ to communicate with certain other device, whatever that device may be.","so if youâ€™re connected to a router, adding a switch can help.","if connected to a switch, a different switch might help.",not saying this is ideal or even vaguely acceptable.,just trying to offer possible workarounds.,however if the i226 has entirely new hardware issues that donâ€™t have the same solutions (or any solution) then thatâ€™s pretty bad.,or perhaps all this is just sucky drivers and the hardwareâ€™s actually fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what is the switch?,has it been there all the time?,it may very well be the issue.,"the point is just that the intel nic doesnâ€™t like whatever is at the other end, and sometimes changing this solves the issue (more specifically with low speeds and disconnects / a network cable is unplugged errors than the other i225-v issues).","problem is you can change to something new that it still doesnâ€™t like, since there seems to be a fair amount it doesnâ€™t like.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"not necessarily, although the qvls list higher memory speeds than z690 as the manufacturers have had access to higher frequency memory kits as the ddr5 manufacturing processes mature.","perhaps some individual boards have better memory traces than their predecessors, but to my knowledge most of the support would come from the cpu's integrated memory controller.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

do you have one?,i've had an a770 since launch.,"no actual issues with the hardware, just issues with games.",they have slowly been ironing that out though.,i would make sure your mb has the latest bios and has resizable bar (amd smart access) enabled.,i have been running the a770 with an intel 12400 and a 670 chipset mb without issue.,"i haven't tried it with one of my amd systems yet, but to say it doesn't run on any cpu or mb is just plain false.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i installed the thermalright frame last weekend with 13700k following mike's instructions in gamers nexus video https://youtu.be/iyu1oskby-q?t=893.,works fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thermalright was first,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thermalright frame is easier to install since it has a hard stop.,just tighten it down in a crisscross pattern until all screws are snug.,the tg frame requires careful torquing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you're buying a high end processor, i don't see why not spend a couple bucks to make sure the thermals are at safe levels.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i got a thermalright frame because thermalgrizzly didnâ€™t have any available at that time and it was cheap, part works well enough.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i did a thermalright with my 13700k build.,wasn't hard at all to install.,just have to go slow.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"idk, my temps are too good without a contact frame i don't need one.",try without it then it's hot buy one?,(12700k),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i purchased the thermalright, it's amazing.",i used to hit 100c quickly in cinebench and 85c in cyberpunk.,now the max i see in cinebench is 85c and cyberpunk hits a max of 62c.,absolutely crazy difference.,"the thermalright is less than $15 shipped to your door, do it right and just install it from the beginning.",that's a 20c reduction in temps in game on a 13700k.,not everyone's experience is the same because it just depends on how bad your cooler contact is.,"if your temps are already decent, then you'll probably get minimal drops in temp.","like i said, for $15 i'd just put it in from the beginning and call it a day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"buy the thermalright version, i believe gn didn't see much difference in temp between the tr and tg frame, mostly just manufacturing quality.",i have the thermalright version and it looks good and works perfectly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got a bigger improvement in temps using an x pattern paste (compared to dot) than installing the tr frame,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with thermal grizzly you are making sure the employee's in berlin get their fair wage.,rather than support cheap labour in china that made that alternative.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, the 12th gen labeled ones also fit 13th gen.  same socket and size.",i've used both.,the thermal right one is fine.,i do find they are very worth it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have a thermal grizzly, did marker installed quarter turn and quarter turn.","temperatures idle 27 and roughly 45 under load, i have a 12700kf",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i bought a thermal grizzly one for my 13700k, but never tested before and after so i have no real way of knowing if it actually made a difference.","i just thought fuck it, really.",my cooler is a kraken x72.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the temperature differences don't seem as stark as with 12th edition.,you would generally get like 7-10c difference with 12th gen but i've been hearing it's only around 2-3c with 13th gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the thermalright does exactly the same job as the thermal grizzly but being a lot cheaper.,so even those are marketed for 12th gen they both use the same socket.,as a matter of fact i have one on my 12900k and 13900k setup.,so while the contact frame can help with temps.,this is due to the intel locking mechanism exerting a large amount of pressure on the chip this in cause makes it bend slightly so it means the ihs has an uneven suraface to make contact with an air cooler or aio cooling plate.,so by using the contact frame  you should have the best possible contact.,this should help with cooling.,now having said that it can vary on how much it can help.,it can vary depending on who you talk to.,in my case it lowerd the idle temps by 2-3 c and at full load 4-5c so not a great improvement but still an improvement none the less.,but this iwas not the reason why i bought it at least not directly.,the reason i bought it is becuase my ilm was bending my cpu so much there was bad contact between the pins and memory controller part of the cpu.,what this meant i could only boot my machine with 1 stick present.,any more than that it throw a fit.,it would let me boot into windows and immediately freeze and it took me ages and i do mean ages to figure out what was going on.,at first i thought it was my ram so i ordered another one.,"same problem, i thought it maybe was a compatibility issue so i use my trusty gskills whihc has never let me down.",same issue.,"so i bought a new motherboard nada, new psu nada again at the end i deduced it was something cpu related.",so i bought a 12700k to tide me over in the meantime while i rma'ed my 12900k as i thought the imc went bad.,i can;t remember if it was a few days later or a few weeks i saw the gamers nexus and derbauer vids but totally forgot about it.,then on a forum i frequent some guy was selling one brands new for like â£12.,by this time i forgot all about my 12900k and have been using the 12700k for a good few months now so decided to take a punt on it.,didn;t really notice much of a difference on a 12700k.,and just out of geekiness i decided to try my old 12900k.,well you can imagine what happened.,fired it up with the 12900k in the contact frame and it fired up.,i nearly fell off my chair.,booted into windows and it fine being stable using 4x8gb rams sticks.,before i could only get it to work with 1x8gb stick.,and all this cost me was â£12.,after spending â£100's on new hardware only to find it was a â£12 fix.,we shouldn;t really need to resort to this or fork out of own pocket again.,but intel doesn;t see this as an issue and tbh most people who are not into pc hardware/gaming would never be any the wiser.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4 sticks are known as 2dpc (2 dimms per channel).,2 sticks are known as 1dpc (1 dimm per channel).,"if you use 2 sticks in a 1dpc configuration, meaning 1 stick in slota2 and 1 stick in slotb2, you are using 1 stick per channel.","channel a, and channel b.",1dpc configurations are much faster and easier on the memory controller so you can overclock your ddr5 ram to 6000mhz.,lets talk 13th gen specs.,13th gen intel chips have official specs for 1dpc and 2dpc configurations.,the official supported speed (guaranteed stability) for 1dpc is 5600 mt/s.,the official supported speed for 2dpc is 4400 mt/s.,"this is basically the speeds you should run your ram at, as per intel's own recommendations for system stability.",so as you can see... 4 sticks (2dpc) runs slower than 2 sticks (1dpc) as per intel's own specs.,so you're not going to be able to run 4 sticks of ddr5 at 6000 mt/s and have stability.,"if you look at the msi z690 carbon specs in detail, you will see that msi confirms this.","here are the specs from [msi's website](https://www.msi.com/motherboard/mpg-z690-carbon-wifi/specification):

* *4x ddr5 memory slots, support up to 128gb*
* *supports 1r 5600 mhz (by jedec & por)*
* ***max.","overclocking frequency:***
   * *1dpc 1r max speed up to 6666+ mhz*
   * *1dpc 2r max speed up to 6000+ mhz*
   * *2dpc 1r max speed up to 6000+ mhz*
   * *2dpc 2r max speed up to 5600+ mhz*

msi specifically says max support is 5600 mhz (mt/s).",this is the max speed as per jedec standards for stability supported by the cpu.,"notice it says ""1r"".",1r is single ranked memory chips.,lower capacity dimms are typically 1r single rank chips.,higher capacity chips like 32gb chips are 2r or double rank.,"i wont go into the specifics of what this all means, just note that 1r and 2r sticks in 1dpc or 2dpc configurations perform differently.",2r sticks typically perform slower in 4 stick 2dpc configurations.,"if you put 4 sticks of 8gb chips, you might get better oc performance than if you put 4 sticks of 32gb chips.",but again overclocking 4 sticks beyond 4400 mt/s is risking stability for speed.,typically it's not recommended.,stability is far more important in a 4 stick (2dpc) configuration.,if you're concerned about speed and are more focused on the performance of the chips rather than having the max capacity of 128gb of memory.... you should only use 2 sticks of ram in a 1dpc configuration.,this will allow you to run your memory overclocked using xmp and generally that will be stable.,it's still an oc.,keep that in mind because any oc can lead to stability.,it's just less likely with xmp because they are tested by the manufacturers for overclock performance that the stated speed.,"any oc above the xmp's oc speed, may increase instability.",so how much ram are you adding to your system?,you did not state it.,if you're doing 128gb in a 4x32gb configuration... run them at 4400 mt/s.,anything faster is going to risk instability.,you could try to oc them up to 5600 mt/s as per msi's oc max spec for 2dpc 2r configs but you're going to have a hard time finding stability.,i can say that just from experience.,"it may be possible, but it's much more likely that it will appear stable, until you realize it's not :) so it's safer to run at the jedec standard speed and intel's max supported 2dpc spec 4400 mt/s for 2r 4 dimms.",lets say you are going to run 4 dimms for a total of 32gb.,"in that case, it's not worth it.",it would be better to buy a 2x16gb kit and run them in a 1dpc configuration with just the 2 sticks because it will be much faster and stable with an oc setting such as xmp.,you cant run xmp with 4 sticks unless they are matched 4 sticks sold with xmp settings for 4 stick configurations and that xmp setting will be slower than if it were a 2 stick pair.,"again overclocking 4 dimms is much harder than 2.

so lets recap.",the safest thing to do is stick to specs when running 4 sticks.,"run them at 4400 mt/s

if you want to oc with xmp, run 2 sticks, 1 dimm per channel.",this will achieve the stated xmp speeds and you can expect it to be perfectly stable.,you can not run 4 sticks with xmp unless those 4 sticks are sold together in a set of 4 and have xmp settings for 4 stick configurations.,this will be slower than running 2 sticks with xmp.,"if you buy 2 more sticks to go with the 2 sticks you already have... even if they are the same make and model, they will not have xmp settings for 4 stick configurations.",you will not be able to simply turn on xmp and have them run at the speeds stated.,the intel spec for guaranteed stability is lower than ddr5-6000.,it's ddr5-4400.,at best maybe you can oc them to 5600 but this will take a lot of testing to find stability.,"it maybe more work than it's worth because it may appear stable, but it may surprise you one day when it's actually not.",that is why 4400 is the official spec for 4 sticks.,"anything faster than 4400, is an overclock and can not be guaranteed as stable with 13th gen.

and finally... yes, you can buy 2 more sticks and add them to your existing sticks.",make sure they are the same exact sticks.,typically it's better to buy all 4 sticks in 1 kit because they are matched from the same batch when manufactured.,this helps them work better together but you can add 2 sticks to an existing kit without problem most of the time.,it's just better to buy 4 in one kit.,good luck :),,,,,,,,,

at stock subs (sg/dg vs. dd subs) 5600 mt 4 dimms at command rate 2t are about as fast as 2 dimms at 1t and worked fine on my z790 + 13900k.,at jedec settings 4 dimms where clocked down to 4666 mt from 4800 mt for 2 dimms.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

gonna save this thanks buddy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the clarification.,i was planning on going from 2x16 to 4x16 @ 6000mhz but if it wonâ€™t clock to that speed i wonâ€™t be bothering as id rather have the performance and the 4x stick was purely for the esthetic aspect as i prefer the look of 4 sticks over two â€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yeah it always looks nicer with 4. if you need more ram, instead of 4x16, go with 2x32gb ddr5-6000.","that will easily oc to the xmp 6000 speed and be very stable, while also giving you 64gb of ram.","if you do it with 4x16, you will give up the performance benefits of having 2 sticks.",this is why it's only really worth going 4 sticks if you need 128gb because you can do 64gb with 2 sticks and get better performance than if you had done 64gb with 4 sticks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the speed listed on almost every processor is the maximum single core turbo frequency.,"it is confusing and misleading i know, but that's why you need to look at the full specs of a cpu (especially in a laptop).","since laptops cannot handle high wattage (due to power and heat concerns), they only really boost a single core as most applications and even games are still single threaded.","if all of the cores boosted to 4.4ghz, it would easily pull like 100+ watts, which is just not possible in a laptop.",are these other people you're seeing getting better performance using a better gpu?,"again, the iris xe is not a good gpu, especially for gaming, and i am almost certain is your main actual bottleneck.","you should be able to play *some* games on it, albeit at a low resolution and minimum graphical settings.",but don't expect anything more,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"just to clarify the previous poster, the pcie 5.0 limitation is a cpu limitation, not motherboard or chipset.","all 12th and 13th generation cpus only have 16 pcie 5.0 lanes, so anything other than the pcie 5.0 x16 slot that wants to use them, ie a 5.0 m.2 slot, or a secondary pcie 5.0 slot, will force your gpu to drop to x8 (at whatever speed the gpu is - be it 5.0, 4.0 or 3.0).","additionally, due to bifurcation limitations, when you add a pcie 5.0 x4 ssd, you can only split the 16 lanes into 8/8 (and not 8/4/4), meaning 4 lanes go completely to waste.",and there is no way around that.,"basically, you don't really want to use a 5.0 ssd slot on any of these boards until pcie 5.0 devices are available.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that sounds about right.,it's the memory controllers on the z690 boards that struggle.,the maximum memory speeds that the z690 boards can handle is around the mid 6000s.,"but remember, for the ram's overall system latency (in nanoseconds, iirc) on intel builds, the equation is:

(1/ram speed in mhz)*cas latency.","so, for example, in my z690 carbon wifi, my ram is 6400mhz at cl30.","so, (1/6400)*30 = 0.0046875.  most of the higher speed sticks that are being sold right now (in the upper 7000mhz range) have a higher number than what i'm getting with my 6400mhz sticks.","so, we're still really good with the intel 12 gen z690 boards ddr5 support =d.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why would you say that?,"some of the only specification differences between h670 and z690 (besides overclocking) are that h670 has 12 pcie 3.0 lanes, instead of 16, and supports 2x gen2x2 and 4x 3.2 gen2 ports, instead of 4x and 10x.","w680, in these specs, matches up with z690 and not h670.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hi there.,we can work on a number of settings via intel xtu.,once you are happy when it all stable you can then finalise it in bios.,okay letâ€™s get started.,you say that you use a -0.95 that is cb23 stable.,try -0.09v instead.,next make sure you enforce all limits via bios and then in xtu set the power limit to 253w for pl1 and pl2.,next scroll all the way down to system agent voltage.,i have 2 z690 motherboards and both have different voltages.,on my first motherboard it says 1.35v so by using a - offset i set it to -0.1v.,this should give the sys agent voltage of 1.25v.,i actually got it down to 1.2v but it is imperative  you do each step individually rather than in one go so you can rule out which one was tripping you up.,on my second motherboard it is 1.25v so i use -0.05v.,now you might be able to get them lower but this is a base starting point.,what kind of temps are you getting?,what cooler?,are you using a contact frame?,after that we can work on load line voltages and what not let me know how you get on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
firstly stop using prime95 on 13th gen. its an obsolete tool and no longer relevant for modern cpus as they are not designed to run 100% load 24/7.,"you could even end up degrading the chip from putting too much load and temperature through it, 13900ks specifically are already pushed so close to their limit out of the box, and several users on ocnet have already had rapid degradation on these chips running just y cruncher or stockfish ai at barely much higher than 253w power limit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why do you care about getting it through prime95 without throttling?,itâ€™s a completely unrealistic workload.,at stock settings (with power limits removed) the 13900k can pull like 450w in prime95.,thatâ€™s completely stupid.,itâ€™s not something you should expect to be able to sustain for longer periods.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'd recommend you to watch buildzoid's videos.,you should approach this in the same way you approach overclocking.,"you're trying to get the max amount of frequency possible, but you now have a strict power budget.",i think stress test tools like linpack will be useful to see if the 'oc' (whatever frequency and voltage you have) is stable.,"yeah, they're not 'realistic', they're stress tests, not usual workloads",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thank you.,"might be a typo, but to confirm: i said i'm using negative 0.095 (not negative 0.9).",so you mean i should first \*step up\* to a higher voltage --***negative 0.090*** \-- and then follow your steps?,"i don't want to power limit to 253w because i don't want to limit performance, even if it's only a 5-10% gain by going up to 300w.",--but maybe you mean one can get max performance even with a 250w limit.,"i'm able to stay under 100c in prime95 for about 15minutes, but then i hit 100 and the chip throttles.","i'm using the standard thermalright contact frame and aio 360 (lt720), with a well ventilated case and no gpu card.","i'm looking for lower temperatures primarily to reach max performance on the 13900k, so i wouldn't want to limit power consumption unless it allows max performance.","(by ""max performance,"" i always mean max performance without any cpu overlocking.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's interesting.,i thought intel had said it is safe to use constantly even near tjmax.,so prime95 is no longer safe as a stress test on a new pc build?,and it's not safe to use the 13900k without imposing a 250w power limit?,what about occt?,cinebench?,are there any safe stress tests that i can use to run overnight on a 13900k build?,what would you recommend instead.,"and i assume you think the chip should always be operated with the 250w limit --disable ""enhanced multi-core performance"" or whatever it is called in msi bios?",p.s.,"i found this reddit on problems with prime95, but others seem to consider it a standard stress test:

the best way to probably combat the issue would either be to strickly adhere to intel's safe load voltage formula (1520mv - (1.1ohms \* current draw)) in avoiding degradation.,"i kinda wish it was simple as setting a current limit, but manually enforcing iccmax results in some weird behavior.",falkentyne & others on overclock.net seem to have had good luck following this rule & avoiding degradation.,"power limiting to 253-300w (iccmax.app is 245a on the 13900k & somehow the 13700k, so \~300w is the absolute most you should ever draw on either of those) should also keep it safe.",85c would also work as a nuclear solution as degradation becomes largely susceptible when above that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i'm not seeing 450w there actually, more like 300w.",but prime95 is only a measure or guidepost.,"the goal of course is not prime95 as such, but to get much lower temps under heavy workloads.","in other words, to get the lowest stable voltage so as to get the maximum sustained performance under all-core peak stresses.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sorry it was a typo.,the reason i ask you to put 253w as a power limit is there is not one aio that can handle a 13900k at unlocked power limit.,even modest watercooling setups canâ€™t handle it.,the only difference is that it takes longer but it still hit 100c and then throttle.,also 253w is the base tdp.,that is the stock value of a 13900k.,"if you are trying to get the max performance of a 13900k at 253w then that is more than doable and with temps you can get at a reasonable temp, that i can help with.",but if you want max performance with the limit at or over 300w then there are 2 primary concerns.,a) your cooler is not capable nor is any aio regardless of brand or manufacturer.,b) this beyond my pay grade.,i only have experience of 12th/13 th gen within their stock power limits.,you need someone else to advise you on this at your power limit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"on the power limit thing, i suspect intel sort of hinted 'it is not made to hit 300+ watts' with the 250w rating.",look at the older 12th gen i3/i5 non-k chips with 90/120 watt pl2s.,it is an unrealistic power rating as usually you see 60/80w or so when running stuff like aida64/cinebench.,even if people's motherboards give ridiculously high voltage/load lines it's still around 70/100w it seems like.,for these low end chips you probably need prime95 to even see it get close to the 'pl2'.,"heck even with my power hungry 11th gen chip, pushing 4.5ghz into 4c8t is still 'only' 100w or so in realistic workloads, just above the 'i3 rating'.","the modern i3s are running lower clock than 4.5, and with more efficient silicon, it really shouldn't be hitting 90 watts.",but then you look at the 13900k and it appears to easily hit/exceed the 250w pl2 while 'not even doing prime95'.,"if they are rated with the same load/algorithm, then they would be rating i7/i9s at 350-450 watts, wouldn't they?",this is why i am thinking intel secretly doesn't want users to try something like '5.3ghz prime95 all core'.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel have never said that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you should use something realistic as a measure.,thereâ€™s no point tweaking your setup around a load that you can never reach in normal usage.,"if your goal is to get â€œmuch lower tempsâ€, just adjust your maximum temp from 100c down to whatever your comfortable temp is.",then use a realistic load and undervolt that way.,using prime95 to get under 100c just so you can get lower temps in real situations is not a good method.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're not seeing because your cooling isn't capable of doing that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thank you, that's very helpful.",i guess i'll add the 253w power limit -- just have to find the right bios option.,"i suspect msi removed that limit because i answered yes to the only question it asked me when booting into the bios for the first time: ""do you use an aio?""",and i'll see what my benchmarks look after adding the limit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i meant only ""made to hit near 100c.""","thank you, intel really should have told or strongly guided these mobo makers to default to 250w limit on -- mine turned it off.","so to confirm, you recommend setting those power limits on?","this is a decent piece, on balance in favor of disabling mce (i.e.",in favor of the power limits).,makes sense to me.,[https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/articles/intel-core-i9-13900k-impact-of-multicore-enhancement-mce-and-long-power-duration-limits-on-thermals-and-content-creation-performance-2375/](https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/articles/intel-core-i9-13900k-impact-of-multicore-enhancement-mce-and-long-power-duration-limits-on-thermals-and-content-creation-performance-2375/),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i disagree, partly.","i agree with you prime95 is an extreme (though i do run things that have all cores running near max for a long time), but the test has the usefulness of showing whether there's any point to lowering voltage more in terms of maxing out potential performance.","my goal is not much lower temps for the sake of it, but much lower temps for the sake of ensuring that i can reach max performance when i need it -- i.e.",to avoid performance throttling caused by reaching tjmax.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you mean going beyond aio, thatâ€™s right, i donâ€™t think custom cooling is a practical option.",i will venture a guess that pulling 450w through a chip is not going to be good for its life expectancy or stability.,but i havenâ€™t seen tests on that.,"(the highest iâ€™ve gone is 330w max, and that hit 100c with a very good aio.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if i am using a 13900k system i would not use mce, likely even limiting further down from 253w too.",but it's also because i don't like how they clock the cpus so high out of the box haha.,"in fact my 11700f prebuilt system is underclocked from all core 4.4 to 3.0ghz too, which is even significantly lower than what the (bad) cooling can sustain in the things i do, simply because i find that it does anything i want it to, but now it's using 50-60w all core in stress tests.",250w is more than fine for a 13700/13900k.,"outside of benchmarks you will not even notice a difference, i am sure.","at such high power levels going down 0.1ghz is often worth 20-plus watts, and the performance loss is there, but negligible.","then you can still get the '5.5-plus ghz turbo', but will tamed temperatures and should be safe from any unlucky degradation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tjmax has never in the full history of intel chips meant 'run your chip at this temperature 24/7'.,"it means that is the safe temperature it can hit on maximum temps for short periods, usually the average can still be in the 80s, and when it does thermal boost it will hit 100c for like a second or two at most.","this is how every single chip from intel with tjmax has always operated, what gives 13th gen a free pass?",8700k had a tjmax of 100c as well.,users went straight to deliding any running over 90c at stock.,"intel actually refunded mine that didn't even hit 100c at stock, but ran at around 95c, even with a 100c tjmax they still considered that to be faulty and refunded it for me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
youâ€™re not getting my point: there is nothing you can ever do on your computer that will produce as much heat as prime95.,thatâ€™s why itâ€™s useless as a measure.,you should find something realistic and then tweak your system to avoid reaching tjmax *with the realistic load*.,not with prime95.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"prime95 is also impractical, so what?",you're sticking to it like a hungry dog to a piece of meat.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i didn't find any place to edit the power limits in xtu, though it shows them.",but they appear to be in the msi bios.,i'll ask on the msi board.,"i changed the msi bios option ""cpu cooler tuning"" from water (""pl1: 4096w"") to ""boxed cooler: pl1: 253w.""","that caused the xtu to show ""turbo boost power max"" and ""turbo boost short power max"" as 253w.","however i gather that 253w is the intel spec only for pl2 (on 137000/13900k): ""short duration package power limit"" (and prob.","corresponds to xtu's ""turbo boost short power max"").","the other thing, pl1 or ""long duration package power limit"" should be 125w (and probably corresponds to xtu's ""turbo boost power max"").","there is another msi bios option, now at auto, called ""long duration power limit,"" but i'd have to manually type in 125, and i'm hesitant to do that on the bios.","finally there is an ""enhanced turbo"" option, which is now at ""auto.""",i believe that corresponds to multi-core enhancement (mce) and i'll probably set it to disabled.,"after changing the ""cpu cooler tuning"" option to ""boxed cooler"" and raising my undervolt to a more conservative negative 0.050v offset, i re-ran cinebench.","the score fell from about 41000 to a little over 37500. my temps on the test are way down, to 72c.",so i no longer seem to have a throttling problem from temperature -- it's been transferred to power limits (watts).,"when i lowered the cpu core voltage offset back to negative 0.095v, my cinebench multi-score went up to 38600.

so i think now i'm in a position to follow the rest of your advice, apart from having to decide what to do about taking pl1 to 125 and disabling mce (enhanced turbo).",so you'd say the next step is for me to add a sys agent voltage negative offset of -0.050?,(and you also meant i should not bother yet with a negative voltage offset to cpu cache or other areas?),"to be clear, my negative 0.095 core voltage offset was stable, but i'm shy about pushing it out to  negative 0.100 and beyond.",and i was also wondering whether those other voltage offsets should be adjusted first.,if the best procedure is to keep on pushing core voltage down until i fail a stress test i can do that (though i'd want to go back up about 0.015 for a safety margin).,but iâ€™ll switch to testing with sys agent now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

>  
>not necessarily.","many intelâ® processors make use of intelâ® turbo boost technology, which allows them to operate at very high frequency for a short amount of time.",when the processor is operating at or near its maximum frequency it's possible for the temperature to climb very rapidly and quickly reach its maximum temperature.,"in sustained workloads, it's possible the processor will operate at or near its maximum temperature limit.",being at maximum temperature while running a workload isn't necessarily cause for concern.,intel processors constantly monitor their temperature and can very rapidly adjust their frequency and power consumption to prevent overheating and damage.,https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005597/processors.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it would be better to have a test that captured my maximum foreseeable cpu load in the future, but i don't have one, so prime95 is next best (for representing times when i max all cores near 100%).",it's not like prime95 is a giant torch or something--it's generating heat only as a side-effect: by running a huge number of calculations.,"while there are other tests, prime95 is surely a useful way to test max sustained performance of a cpu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"itâ€™s an extreme test, but itâ€™s a good measure of whether you can reach full fp performance on all cores, and also a good stress test.","but itâ€™s only one test, so iâ€™m more like a hungry dog taking any choice piece of meat, any prime meatâ€¦.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

-either large-sized/dual fan/dual tower air cooling
-or 240mm-plus water cooling.","if you cap it to 125w then i would feel like you wasted money on cooling, as even small tower coolers with a 92mm fan can easily handle it (i9's core count means lower heat density and is the easiest to cool).","and if you really want a very efficient cpu, chances are you will underclock both single/all core anyway (like my case),

yes but the last part is important.,default bios removes all power limit and throttling and does not run intel spec.,at intel spec you will only be hitting max boost very rarely.,"its not that the cpu has been designed to constantly run at 100%, but that aibs have decided to just let it.",enforce the correct tdp and undervolt with liteload not offset.,"im seriously shocked tbh that anyone here is ok with leaving their intel chips running at 100c, y'all have got to be collectively trolling me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thanks!,still testing but iâ€™ve followed your advice and set power limits on and lowered my cpu lite load from mode 9 to mode 5. now prime95 hits only 74 or so max after eight hour run (which is the worst case scenario!),and there is a real but to me acceptably small multi-core performance hit on max load (cinebench down from 40k to 37.5k).,"just to confirm, you would say the cpu lite load (thatâ€™s a kind of llc calibration?)",is a better method than core voltage offset?,with voltage offset i got to -0.095v stable but could have gone further.,"(fwiw, cpu lite load mode 1 was unstable, and i havenâ€™t tested other modes yet besides mode 5 and the default mode 9.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

in the bios its 1.44 @ 55x (e.g.","30mv higher without the undervolt)

oh something alot of people dont think about with the lf ii the pump is powered 
by the motherboard header you need to ensure that fan is at 100% once there is a load
on the cpu as in within a few ms of a large load

you cant just have the cpu fan header causally running at 50% with a large load on the cpu
as you pump will be in hardly doing anything mode..

i will paste a screenshot of my fan header setup later which may or may not help

there is always some delay to fan ramp i find this works well
silent until needed (this is under package temp not die temp so you have to set it about 10â°c lower than die temps
for it to ramp in a timely manner)

the load line is a protection and stability measure put inplace to

"llc means load line calibration 

so by definition its the load line
you get confused easily

ac/dc load line is something totally different that you keep harping on about and is a recent thing 

as i have already said that can be adjusted slightly depending on the motherboard design without going out of intel spec

the load line though cannot

load line is the cpu's load line from the vrm to the cpu (what you call llc that used to be called load line calibration in bios's and was abreviated to llc)

ac/dc load line is the vrm's load line / guard band from the psu to the vrm

two totally different things

that is correct.,"gents, all cores ""regular turbo"" will get you to 5.4ghz and with abt you'll be able to hit 5.5ghz keeping into account thermals.",i know it is a bit confusing - i had to build a decoder ring for it - but that is how it works for the 13900k.,"- lex h [intel]

"it can go anywhere from 0.8 ghz up to the highest frequency you can run it at before it becomes too hot or unstable, since it is unlocked.",but if you don't overclock then it will max out at 5.4 ghz.,window's power plans/power modes will control what frequency it is running at depending on what kind of load is present.,e.g.,"if you select ""power saver"" then it will run at lower frequencies most of the time except when there is heavy load.","""high performance"" will lock the frequency at the highest it will go, all of the time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"single core boost is 5.4, all core boost is 5.3.

if you choose to correctly tune the voltages, you can keep it running at 5.3 all core easy with low temps during gaming or other high load use.","if you decide to leave everything at stock, it will likely be running at 100c no matter what you do.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no it does.,"the people that arent affected are the ones with high bin chips which have a lower vid table, in general around 10-25% of chips.","so someone with an sp117 chip posted 1.36 maximum volts at stock, which would be around 1.31v load.",the vid table goes a lot higher for average and lower chips.,"each chip requests a different voltage and all motherboards go overboard by default, there isn't a single brand of motherboard that doesn't have this issue at stock, the only difference is the vid table on the cpu.","even still doesn't matter what the temps are, none of these chips need much higher than around 1.2-1.25v for stock speeds, they are all overvolted beyond that by every aib.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

how did it get that hot.,that cooler is overbuilt for the workload.,something might not be right with the card itself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"but, why on the cooler?",are you thinking conduction on the cover plate?,is it even aluminum?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this is a jokeâ€¦right?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
disgraceful.,you used the wrong stock cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i like that along the front part of the gpu the light is still blue (intel) while it suddenly turned red (amd) on the rear where the ryzen stock cooler was placed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what settings are you running that your card is that hot?,iâ€™m pushing mine hard and barely hits 70*c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my question is...does this work?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this seems a little unnecessary.,"the backplate coolers were primarily for gddr6x cards, specifically the 3090, since it had memory modules on the back of the pcb.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pat gelsinger is very disappointed in you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dawg the card is almost as big as a reference 6800xt.,unless your case airflow is bad this is super pointless.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that does nothing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"don't worry, i know what it feels.",[https://ibb.co/vqthp0q](https://ibb.co/vqthp0q),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

why a stock cooler on the gpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mayby a arc flash?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
there's something wrong if your card is getting hot enough to warrant this mod,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
before and after temps?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
anyone explain?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i saw this a few days back, got my a770 plugged in today, and when it started getting toasty i did the same xd",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my biggest gripe with this card is no manual fan curve/profiles.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you the only person in reddit who bought an intel gpu ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or his case airflow is garbage.,one of those fashion over function designs.,it's possible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because the card is 90 degrees,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
right*,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hell no.,the back plate is plastic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
upside down?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
judging by the psu shroud itâ€™s nzxt.,possible solid front case.,the be quiet fan is icing on the cake.,in all serious: the backplate is glued plastic.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lol bro cooled his intel card with amd cooler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i would rma it then, my overclocked card has hit a high of 81c.","although, my case is fully meshed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's about the fan curve target...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no need to worry it being 90 degrees c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yea i dont think its an issue with the card its probably case airflow.,you probably have the aio in the front and those being the only fans to bring in fresh already heated up air.,am i correct?,if i am wrong then you need to rma the card not strap that cooler on it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"its not plastic, but it doesn't touch the pcb at all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

*laughs in arc control*,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
look at the orientation of the cooler pins/screws... it's upside down ontop of the gpu backplate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they would never know, that's like thinking intel or amd have never given warranty replacements for gamer's overclocked processors, unless they are psychic and know what people do with them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thatâ€™s not what iâ€™m saying - if the temperature excess only happens in overclocked conditions, they will tell you not to overclock.","if you donâ€™t tell them itâ€™s happening under oc, they may not be able to reproduce the problem and will instead blame your chassis / airflow configuration.","op also hasnâ€™t shared their settings, so itâ€™s entirely plausible for this to be a user issue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

we can thank netburst/p4 and the shift away from absolute ghz to focusing on core count for intel relegating the name pentium to its low end products starting in the core 2-era of the late 2000s.,"imo, having both pentium and celeron as low-end cpus that only cost a few $$ difference has never made a lot of sense.","intel should have just retired celeron or, better yet, replaced both with core i1 when intel adopted the core ""i"" branding.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that's probably because intel already has a pentium silver line of processors.,"the difference between the gold and silver is the gold is based upon the core ix line, whereas the silver is based upon the atom line.","if that's not confusing enough, the same is true for the celeron lineup, except that to know which is which you just get to look up the part.","though i _think_ all the atom-based celerons start with ""n"", but i can't say for sure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's a replacement for the stock intel clamp that holds the cpu in place.,it applies equal pressure over the cpu so that the cooler has complete contact to ensure the best cooling.,the current stock intel clamp applies too much pressure to one side that can actually warp/bend the cpu lid so that the cooler has terrible contact.,look up the gamers nexus video on the contact frame.,"you can get them on amazon for like $14, it's a no brainer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yup iâ€™m getting a little lower than that on a 13900k without the contact mount.,his first mount was just garbage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but we don't know anything about the case cooling or the ambient temperatures of either the op or even yours for that matter.,important information that seemingly everyone forgets to mention.,it's one thing if we were talking about deltas but since we are mentioning absolutes then it's important to mention the other temperatures.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hey i also have a 12700k (deepcool ak620) and i'm trying to figure out if i screwed up the install somehow.,running at 70â°-80â° at a realistic (game) load and i get up to 100â°c with prime95 fft benchmarks.,what are your temps under load?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i don't use the contact frame, and i have a similar cooler.",i don't even come near thermal throttling point.,so you shouldn't either realistically.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

50c at idle means an air layer between ihs and the heatsink.,reminds me of this one where they didn't follow noctua's paste application instructions and dropped 20c at full load after a remount with the correct procedure.,https://www.reddit.com/r/intel/comments/y50aax/need_i9_12900k_undervolting_help/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is the normal behavior of laptops.,specially intel laptops.,if you really want you can change the thermal paste to liquid metal at your own risk of course to get a few degrees less.,you could undervolt if intel allows it on 12th gen h processors (i donâ€™t know) and honestly that would give you huge benefits.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

intel laptops are hot.,intel laptops with h cpus are particularly hot.,you need a laptop that's 3 fingers fat to accommodate a 115w i7 12700h.,monster performance comes with monster consumption that takes away from dgpus.,"op could have chosen amd h-class for less, but still very acceptable performance with the benefit of great thermals that leave headroom for the gpu to be pushed harder.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in 2018 (the last time i bought a laptop) things were a lot different.,i've never had temperatures like this before i needed a new one.,"now it seems like they're all hot (and with that, a truncated lifespan) and everyone just nonchalantly accepts it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that's the thing: research has yielded nothing but the utmost conflicting results.,i have never been able to unearth anything definitive about what a proper temperature range is supposed to look like for this (or any other) processor.,"also, core 3 in specific consistently reaches 100c",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not necessarily.,these chips are designed to get that hot but you wouldnâ€™t want to run them like that nonstop.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"throttlestop makes a good 10-15c difference, if not a tad bit more on my laptop.",then again my 8750h does underclock well.,"my laptop was throttling playing games in summer heat, hitting 98-99c, with full fans on even.",with throttlestop itâ€™s hovering in the low-med 80s instead.,"obviously different processors, different systems and so on, may not work so well for you.",itâ€™s worth a try though!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

pay better attention to what you read online.,"no, there is no way that the integrated gpu is ""decent"" for games.","you can play games that have low hardware requirements, but anything with decent graphics at ""normal"" resolution requires better graphics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have a laptop with the same exact specs and it is only good for older games that don't require much in the way of a gpu.,you could always go the geforce now route with your laptop for $10 a month / $50 for 6 months if you don't also have a gaming pc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
check [gameplay.intel.com](https://gameplay.intel.com) to see which games can be run and at what settings with your cpu gen. the 1% lows are really bad in igpus mostly due to driver issues so sometimes even lowering the settings may also not help much.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the only real difference is the number of cores.,frequency you can adjust to your liking and the 13600k will most likely outclock the 13900k thanks to having less cores aka lower heat output which translates to lower operating temps.,13900k is only better when you need cores for productivity/rendering etc and even then a lot of stuff can be done on a gpu and way faster.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

for gaming?,essentially nothing.,for work?,a whole lot.,went from a 12600k to a 13900k and saw my workflow vastly increase (that and adding more ram).,people who buy the 13900k for just gaming just have to much money to know what to do with it.,"also, the newest i5 has more e-cores so i'm sure it's a beast for productivity at its price regardless.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for productivity tasks i9 is much faster.,they can do the same stuff just takes longer.,for gaming a bit extra fps and maybe higher 1% lows.,the higher the resolution likely the less fps difference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"productivity performance aside, 13900k (and more generally i9 vs i5 in the same generation) is usually quite a bit faster in gaming performance.","these differences are always downplayed because people think same architecture=same performance, but the i9s usually have much higher cache capacity and higher boost clocks/better silicon to support those frequencies",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
most people that buy an i9 don't actually use it to its full potential and could have easily purchased an i5 (or in some cases an i3).,i went with an i9 on the 9th gen because my i5-9600k could not run my music production software (with all the vsts i need to have loaded) smoothly.,"for gaming, the 9600k moved my 5700xt at the time just fine.",could i have went to the i7 9700?,"probably, but i wanted to future proof a little more and i broke even on selling my 9600k.","when i upgrade my 9900k, probably on the 14th or 15th gen intels, i'll look at the i5 once more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 13900k would work better if you wanted to do 4+ player gaming on one pc with nucleuscoop.,though i'm pretty sure even it would struggle to run a full 16 player cod death match.,gotta have a xeon/threadripper for that sort of party.,even then those cpus can't typically clock as high as mainstream chips.,until game consoles start shipping with 16 core cpus standard no single game should really cause a 13600k problems.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yeah if u wanted to increase fps or the experience i think first u should upgrade the gpu to 4090 or 7900 second get a mon monitor which can run 4k 144hz a 100% pci p3, after u should buy a top-end keyboard and mouse finally upgrade you ram and lastly is the cpu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah but when u need more core epyc should be a much better choice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"aye, those top chips tend to hold stupid pricing used.",just check the insane pricing for second hand 7700k on ebay.,"used 9900k is also going for almost as much as a 13600kf, which is just nuts.",i can imagine 5800x3d getting a similar status.,wouldn't be surprised if it sells for $200+ still 3-4 years from now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but if for work u can connect to your companyâ€™s servers a i3 will more than enough.or if u really need one why donâ€™t a epyc or xeon those are facing to the professional,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how much core can a game use.mostly only 4 or 6 but not 12 or 16 and if u using a middle class gpu in running in 2k or high end in 4k\8k the bottleneck should be on the gpu but not cpu.if u pay for a 4090 are u going to play on 1080p?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i got one just for the case it came in.,absolutely worth it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you using cubase or protools?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah that what i wanted to point out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i get u but the is a special case i think 13600k can handle 3player  4core per person,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a i5 cannot sully use your 360 cooler or 1000w power supplyðÿ¤£,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it will drop someday... i.e.,"i have 11900k because for~225$ was worth to upgrade 11600k (in fact was really cool cpu), but sold at the same price :)))",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i get u but we are talk about the same gen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for 700,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah if u use a 360 or 280 cooler probably u can have more than 6hz on a i5 but not i9 u pro may need a 480cooler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am wondering have u change your gpu or what gpu are u using?and also we are talking about the same gen cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"so in that situation, we should consider a eypc or xeon but no a i9",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i quite argee with u.but using the cpu to increase cpu fps  is mainly for someone using 4090 or 7900,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no not really.,we're talking 10fps difference in gaming.,productivity is the only time it's worth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i pretty much agree with your point.just a low-end cpu can handle most on the game maybe i3 12100.but if looking for the cpu work i think we should consider the epyc or xeon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but i think we need to clear one thing the i series  target consumer is just normal people.if u need lot core u can connect to your companyâ€™s service or get a xeon or epyc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if your cpu can pay for itself and need multi core u should get a xeon it epyc or connect to your company servers.and obviously we are not talking about physical.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you want?,why does our opinion matter?,it would obviously give you more frames.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sorry are u talking about the topic btw although and gpu have be much more powerful.but the n still have advantages like dlss and more support to the professionals.u cannot even run a ai learning on the 6600xt but 3060ti.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
only if you play at 1080p  in which case that's your own stupid fault for buying a 4090 for 1080p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah we should be a clever consumers even u are using a 3080ti a 12400 is a pretty good deal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i definitely cannot play mmos and many modern day titles on a 1080p high refresh rate monitor (240hz) and hope to get more than 100fps with a 4 core system.,"such as wow, albion online, rdr2, elden ring, etc.",6 cores is pretty much the bare minimum here.,"an i5 is more than enough for gaming, i mean hell this thing has 14 cores!!!","for 320 bucks, and the 6 cores that handle gaming get to 5.1 ghz without overclocking and without liquid cooling.","i'd only really consider an i7 if i was also trying to stream on twitch on a daily basis at the highest possible quality, but i can and have streamed with the i5 at 1080 quality with very little performance loss (not noticeable).",i do not know any situation in which i'd pick an i9.,i don't forsee that becoming necessary even 5 years from now (im the type to rebuild every 5 years rather than upgrade every 1 or 2).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't think the 10 or 9 gen i9 is a good deal because it is still selling for around 300 is same as a 13600k what u wanted to point is most of us dont need 12 core or 10core,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
refurbished 9900k is going for 700+ bucks which is hilarious considering the 13600k mops the floor with it.,"someone in my discord tried to argue that his 10900k was better than my i5 13600k and his reasoning ""dude.. it's an i5 i have an i9"".",most gamers don't actually know anything about technology lol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

11900k is a special case and is worst than the 10850k,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
forgot to mention that.,"i kept the same gpu (2080ti)

i understand.","i was just noting that for purely gaming, the fps difference is very small from the 13600k to 13900k.",700 and 900 is just if you want better render times/if you stream a lot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

yeah if u play in 4k or 8k there will be no difference because the bottlenecks are all on the gpu but not cpu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
word.,i use cubase and have the addictive drums vsts/plugins plus a ton of others that i use.,"i did notice it worked better when i upgraded from a 3570k to a 10900k, and also the ram to 4000mhz 32gb.",i wasn't sure if it was due to vsts and plugins... i thought ram was most important but can see why the cpu would play a part due to the mem controller probably.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it doesn't matter.,there's almost no games that will benefit from more cores.,the clock speed and cache are really the biggest factors and the combination of all of those will give you a little bump.,"if money is of concern whatsoever, nothing over a 13600k should be considered for gaming.",it just doesn't make any sense.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

do you care about the things that nvidia is good at?,"ray tracing, or certain professional programm?","dlss is a little better than fsr, but do you care about those?","or are you just going for gaming, non ray traced?",these are questions to ask yourself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
either can be a good value depending on your needs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i can verify this statement.,upgraded to a 13700kf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sure, but the 5800x is a generation (or a generation and  a half if you count 5800x3d) behind latest and greatest and op is asking about 13600k or 13900k.",i expect there would be no real differences in gaming with a 4090 with a 13600k vs 13900k and a serious bottleneck would only exist at 1080p  and that isn't the fault of the cpu.,"also, the 5800x is only 6 percent slower on average than the 12900k at 4k in that benchmark, it's really only specific cpu intensive games (or games that traditionally run better on intel chips) so i wouldn't really call that a significant bottleneck, unless you happen to play mostly those games that don't run well on the 5800x.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for sure!,addictive drums is really good (and expensive!),definately a cpu/memory intensive vst for sure.,when you start routing a lot of plugins through your vitual mixer the mid tier processors do seem to take a hit with playback.,its even more noticable during mix down if you have a ton of tracks.,my songs will have 20+ tracks and i was at a snails pace on the i5-9600k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if u using a 3060ti or 6600xt on and those 3a games i mean not csgo or pubg(those 7700k and 1070 can already be 2k 144hz) there should be only around a 2% difference.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

does i3 even need a replacement cooler or is stock good,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"definitely a cooling problem then, that voltage is normal.",you should take the cooler off and check if you can see anything wrong with it.,maybe you didnâ€™t push the plastic pins all the way into the motherboard?,how does the thermal paste look?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh and check where youâ€™ve connected the cpu fan, it needs to be connected to the cpu fan header.",not the chassis fan headers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's pretty good, i don't think you will notice any practical improvements from getting a new cooler.",it's more than enough for the 12100f's power consumption and it stays pretty quiet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the cpu fan is connected to the proper header and the fan didnt hqve qnything wrong when i put in, ill check again later",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

so i just bought this mobo.,it's fine and it was kind of the cheapest that did what i wanted at the time.,i now regret getting it and wish i had shelled out a little more.,"there's a couple of minor issues, but the biggest thing for me is that the ethernet controller is poor - just google i225v issues and you'll see what i mean.","not the exact question you were asking, but just something else to consider!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you don't need to oc a 13900k.,lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i would worry more about the cooling.,still good to have a good motherboard tho,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what tasks require oc for 13900k?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this board was used by quite a few xoc people when z690 released and had quite good success with it while asus was still fixing their apex memory overclocking problems.,later of course the tachyon released and they got that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
don't know answer for the oc but i just want to mention that remember that you need to flash update the bios before installing anything on the motherboard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
fun fact about this board.,you can build/run open source coreboot firmware with a uefi payload on it.,dasharo/3mdeb enabled it.,cool for bios tinkerers.,"https://docs.dasharo.com/variants/msi_z690/releases/  note: check the cpu compatibility list though as i think, as of this writing, it supports the 12900k, 12600k and a few others.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"maybe check out the z790 variant of this motherboard, around the same price and a bit better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
msi z790-a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why overclock when these chips are already beasts out of the box?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" no, if you want to actually overclock a 13900k and memory significantly and have it be completely stable you need a beefier board, get the z790 ace.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you're gonna love msi :d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, if value comes into play for you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you're buying all new and going 13th gen, get a z790 board imho.","if not make sure this one is flashed with the right bios to support that chip or you can flash it without the cpu working..

edit: it does have a flash bios button so you should be able to flash it off a usb drive to get it 13th gen compatible if needed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this mobo is awesome but be aware that it overclocks cpu at default bios settings.,so don't worry if you get high temps warning at first startup.,ðÿ˜€,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
donâ€™t expect that processor to overclock that well.,and you better be using an actual water block not an aio.,they run extremely hot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™ll be honest with you, i have the 13900k and a 360mm aio and overclocking is out of the question for full multi core loads.","it instantly hits 100c and thermal throttles under full load, so overclocking only gets higher speeds on single core for me.",but 6ghz is coolâ€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have this motherboard and it is working great, i have no issues.","one thing to be aware of, you will need to first upgrade the bios using the button method with a usb stick if you do not have a spare 12th gen cpu to boot it with first.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itkxunuarie,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
overclocking is pretty much dead.,under volting is the way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"buy the pro or -p version if it has better power, vrm stages!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what cooler you use?,my temps are way higher with my ak620.,i'm suspecting of poor mounting honestly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i have the exact mobo that you have, also msi pro z690-a ddr4, and i was able to oc my 12600k to 5.4ghz all p-cores and 4.2ghz all e-cores, also using the bios.","i got a away with 1.400v, but i haven't done a stability test yet, as i only have a noctua nh-u12s redux and a poor airflow case.",so temps would instantly go over 100â°c with prime95 (max were 104â°c).,"to make matters worse, my cpu doesn't even thermal throttle at all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

my msi z790 edge has the same issue.,"ethernet is pretty much unusable, so i was forced to buy an usb-to-ethernet adapter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
exactly what other issues are there?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you mean the intel ethernet chipset?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™ve had this board and multiple with the i225 and none has issues both old and new variants.,with the latest firmware and drivers the problems donâ€™t seem to show themselves anymore .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> ethernet controller is poor - just google i225v issues and you'll see what i mean.,"> not the exact question you were asking, but just something else to consider!","sadly most boards use that i225v junk or the realtek rtl8125 which isn't great either, very few come with different lan.",i wish they would put i211-at or even rtl8111 on boards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

dont listen to this guy.,"p version is budget tier trash, a version is the cheapest board thats good.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

is your issue with internet speed?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i was experiencing slow speeds, but while i was looking for solutions, it's clear that issues with this controller are very very common.","after messing with the driver version and device settings, i'm just about ok for now.","my takeaway, next time i shop for a mobo, i'll do more research on the ethernet controller.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"i have a noctua d15 on a 13900k and i mean, ill just do with what i can get, there's no way i'm using watercooling on this machine.",oh it's worth it to mention i'm using a thermalright socket thing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i wouldnâ€™t expect to oc it much at all then.,even with good cooling you really need a lot to oc this thing.,i hit 100c fast in prime with mine on a kraken aio.,iâ€™m upgrading to ekb wb with 2 360 rads and a push pull config on each of them with thermal grizzly liquid metal on the cpu.,also get the cpu mounting plate as well to help with temps.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

lol... wtf you even talking about?,realize my original point?,where did i indicate my motherboard was lowering my temps?,reading ain't your strong point?,i clearly indicated that i set my volts to 1.350v.,which results in my avging about 1.32v for gaming.,there is a reason why your previous comment has this many downvotes?,"being salty, and being up in your own crap won't get you far in life?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think you got bad board.,i had no issues with it.,it has an intel 2.5gbps network card which are pretty good so it was probably an issue with the board.,i really liked the msi z790 edge.,the only reason i got the msi z790 carbon was for the ddr5 and because i liked the edge and it was similar but a slight step up in features.,both are my first msi motherboards.,"i typically buy asus or gigabyte, so i was pretty happy with it enough to stick with msi.",did you install any kind of contact frame?,just wondering because i know it can cause some issues sometimes.,yeah the edge looks great.,you might want to consider return or rma'ing it or perhaps trying simpler things like replacing the network cable.,it's possible you have a bad board.,again i had no issues with the intel lan.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is so true.,"once you hit the 175-200w barrier on a cpu, those noctua d15s are not gonna cut the mustard.","you have to go water cooling (at least 360mm rad) or undervolt, else it is just not gonna have it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the i226-v seems to be a new revision of the i225-v which is pretty infamous for its issues.,"it could be a hardware issue, but the fact that i can just disable the windows network adapter for a second points to a driver issue.",rma lottery is not worth it for me since i already found a solution (bought a simple usb-to-ethernet adapter).,i know that i won't be buying another motherboard that uses intel's i225-v or i226-v.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

lol.. you are too funny.,you're now confusing yourself; thus you totally not understanding my point to begin with.,"at the end of the day, i was just using my current system rig as an example.",just giving op a general idea to what he maybe expect?,thats why i included the temps info.,"otherwise, i wouldn't have mentioned my 13600k to begin with?",ðÿ¤¦â€â™‚ï¸ did i say what temps he was going to get with his 13900k?,those downvotes mean nothing to you?,"if more than 12 users indicate otherwise, then maybe there is something to it?",sometimes being pretentious doesn't help.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have the same behavior when running cinebench.,it hits 100c immediately at around 320w then goes down to 253w because of the temp i guess.,i'm using a z73 as cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hi op, i had the same issue with a cm 360 illusion aio.","switching to the alf ii 360 is what solved the issue for me (i think the cm cooler didnâ€™t have enough pressure on the cpu)

my 13900k will still thermal throttle after a while in all core stress tests, but that is when the cooler is saturated.",reaching 100 c in a second is definitely a heat transfer issue between the cpu and the cooler.,i would keep experimenting while it is fixed.,"you have a bad cooling setup that will impact your performance even during normal use; assuming you are using tvb there is thermal throttling happening way below the max 100 c. for example, with one core active i get 6.1 ghz if the cpu is under 61c, 5.9ghz above.","with two cores (more typical for my use) i get 6 ghz under 63 c, 5.9 ghz above.","with my old cooler i even reached 73 c with two cores, that drops them to 5.8 ghz.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it definitely will with unlimited power which comes out of box,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

if you are on asus motherboard there are a few things you can change that may possibly help.,use a negative offset.,start at -0.05v test for stability  then try -0.055v and so on.,"i run mine at -0.085 that the best i can do before it throws a wobbler, disable mce.",find system agent voltage and lower it if greater than 1.25v.,i have done my voltages with regards to loadline voltages but letâ€™s get you started and we can go from there.,how does this sound?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dont listen to giant dongs.,he is on a crusade yet wont listen when i showed him intel saying 100c is in spec under load and normal.,while changing those things might help.,it really only works for msi that actually has been overvolting the chips.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for the reply.,yeah i might just give undervolting a try,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

every motherboard is overvolting these chips at stock bios!,"every motherboard is setting ac_ll and dc_ll too high, the only difference with msi is it is easier to reduce these using their lite load setting.",people who manually tuned their 13900ks also get stock speeds at under 1.3v and no longer hit 100c sustained in cinebench.,"if you bothered to contact asus support and asked the same thing, they would tell you the same thing - stock ll values are for worst case scenario, reduce / increase them on a chip by chip basis to what works.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"c0 stepping is alder lake architecture, while b0 would be raptor lake architecture.","i'm not sure how much ipc and/or other stuff improved from alder lake to raptor lake, but personally i couldn't find data pointing to a big improvement relating to architecture.","in other words, i think there likely isn't a noteworthy difference between b0 and c0 stepping 13400. though i'm still curious to see them compared.","when i wrote this post i didn't know that both b0 and c0 stepping models both exist, albeit up to now i've only been able to find 13400 c0 benchmarks.","probably b0 stepping models aren't as common as c0 ones, at least at the moment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
these will be neat little thin clients or microservers one day when they flood the off-lease market on ebay.,"8 little cores with skylake ipc puts the top one side by side with the i7-9700t, and the lower sku's are great (eventual) upgrades for the j5005's going around today.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i hope they won't go into notebooks or nucs nobody will buy.,last passively cooled itx board was from asrock more than 6 years ago.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they also have av1 hardware decoding.,these chips will be amazing in low powered media servers and nas boxes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that'll take forever.,you can actually get a current-gen celeron/pentium nuc type of computer for like $150 already so i think the lower tier gracemont replacements would be pretty affordable too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i'm starting to see jasper lake mini pcs for the ~$150 range.,supposedly they don't have pci-e slots anymore though.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they announced jasper lake boards, but those disappeared without a trace.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah.,"i really wish they had av1 encode, but that'll probably come in the next gen or 2.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2 and 3 years to be exact.,business leases on optiplex/thinkcenter/wyse usually aren't longer than that.,"at that 3-4 year old mark they flood ebay and the value bottoms completely out (look up j5005 and i5-8500t on ebay in wyse/tiny/mini/micro's)

if these launch in $150 units, in 5 years they'll be 30 like some j4105's.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
$150 doesn't make much sense when the i5-8500t mini pc's are the same price.,the only atom-core system i can find with pcie is the wyse extended with the j5005.,"(not counting all the minipc stuff on aliex)

not sure if dell continued that line for jasper lake",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

they're still lower power than i5s, and have the ice lake media encoder.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes but an optiplex with an 8500t has massively more cpu compute, and the thin clients generally lack nvme and a 2nd ram slot.",and under reasonable loads they use low power.,the encoder probably doesn't matter much.,"8th gen quicksync was already really good, and ice lake can't encode av1 which limits any forward thinking usage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i5 12500 is exactly what i was waiting for.,"the i3 12100f is as beast and works fantastic, but i did upgrade gpu from rtx 3060ti to rtx 3080 so faster cpu is something i want to upgrade next.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13500 looks like a banger.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but will they actually run at 35 and 65w ?,edit: some of us are actually interested in these low power products.,just wondering if the perf is worthwhile at that power budget.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wonder if they'll do an e-core only option for ultra low power applications, 0+8, etc...

edit - they are, it's the n300/n305 cpu.",https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/231806/intel-core-i3n300-processor-6m-cache-up-to-3-80-ghz/specifications.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just wish they had released an unlocked 6 core die.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11$ for 4 e cores.,anyone who needs igpu should just buy the 13500.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 13700 is the same price as the 13700kf on scan.co.uk ðÿ˜‚,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are the lower tier processors actually alder lake?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when are the new chips released?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are they even including box coolers?,150w means the current stock coolers will hit 100c instantly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i feel like those should be 6 cores now that the 400 line got the 6+4 cores.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"13100 i3 is basically the 12100. i don't think it's a new die, might have a tiny clock bump.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i feel you, brother - i got a 12100 as a temporary solution when my motherboard blew up in september with the plan of upgrading to a 13th gen cpu once they release something with non-insane power draws.",the 13500 and 13600 look pretty tasty!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i can feel a great performance right now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"unlike k-skus, out of turbo boost window, yeah.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> but will they actually run at 35 and 65w ?,"really, that depends on the motherboard it's paired with.",i imagine most of these 35w and 65w variants will come in pre-builts where the power limits are enforced in mobo settings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes, so long as you set pl1 and tau, or the board you use pulls those values off the cpu (most oem boards and some diy boards stock behavior).",but in many high end diy mobos it will default to 4096w pl1 and let the chip run unlocked.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[removed],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i am actually curious why intel left more p cores on the lower power parts.,isnt it more efficient to give more e cores on the low power sku?,like i5 13500t is 4+16 instead of 6+8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
they sort of already have this.,the gracemont e-cores are basically a variant of the tremont cores already used in the atom chips.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"they did with the 13600k, if you don't mind disabling e-cores.",i don't think rpl got a native 6+0 core die like adl did.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you can tell because their max ddr5 transfer rate is 4800 instead of 5600.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes they are based on alder lake dies.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"at this stage core count doesn't matter, these i3s also out performs lot of 6 core cpus in market.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4 core with hyper-threading was a exclusive feature of the i7s for 9 years.,ask too hard and you might get a 6e+0p.,:),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the 13500 / 13600 are the sweet spot, i usually go for i7 but with those i5 i feels no need for i7 right now.",i believe many with ddr4 systems will choose this upgrading path.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
this.,if you put a 9700k in a dell micro meant for a 9700t it'll force a 30 or 35w pl1 on it.,it forces a scaling pl2 value based on auto-sensed psu wattage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[removed],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i thought that was just because they were lower tiers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh no

"not sure why you are getting downvoted, but youâ€™re pretty much right on the money.",if a modern 4 core beats out a 6 core from 2-3 gens ago it doesnâ€™t matter.,"the reason why itâ€™s still a â€œ4 coreâ€ is because of yields, youâ€™re paying less money for less cores.",of course if people really have a problem they can just go with amds offeringsâ€¦,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i never said it can't outperform 6 core cpus, but i'd still like to see finally leaving 4 cores behind.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
until you get into a very cpu intensive game.,[look at that cpu usage.,](https://youtu.be/mi9utwtgm_m?t=40) you'll start getting stutters as soon as windows update start running or other apps start doing stuff in the background.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it doesn't matter at all though because raptor lake brought like 1% ipc increase.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tell your boss you need an extra day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel will probably keep future i3s with 4 large cores and add 4 small e-cores to go along with it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"increased boost clock, added e-cores, larger cache.",13400f is only $30 more than a 12400. iâ€™d say itâ€™s worth it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
raptor lake has more cache which does impact performance in some games a bit.,"also the better memory controller, but that doesn't really matter for a budget i5 as a-die is pretty expensive and alder lake non-k has locked vccsa so i'm assuming that non-k raptor lake(so 13700 and 13900) will also have that(might not we'll see) meaning high memory clocks ain't happening anyways.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that's hilarious.,there's no way,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"different view, i'd get the 12400. save a buck on same no of p cores.",if you're actually utilising the e cores you're probably losing 1% lows anyway.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it matters if you want to maximize performance in a sff build where low profile air coolers can be your only option.,"you can fine tune the bios to change ratios and rely on e-cores and less energy usage for %80 of your usage day to day then utilize the clock boost and cache, etc for gaming.",iâ€™m not denying the 12400 in any way but to most $30 is negligible and will just go with the â€œbestâ€ option when choosing between 2 things at that price difference,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"fair play, each to their own and least the choices are there (unlike amd where low end choices suck so bad to be essentially non existent, bar the x/non-x ""choice"" lol)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
why would u use e cores when they are less efficient?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
you have a misunderstanding regarding the e-cores and how scheduling is currently handled.,"the ""efficiency core"" term and people's conditioning based on smartphones is likely contributing to a misunderstanding.",intel's e-cores aren't really named as such due to energy efficiency.,"they also aren't really ""small"" cores in the sense that it's referred to with mobile cpus.","keep in mind the e-cores have a per clock perf akin to skylake (which was used all the way up to 10th gen as the ""p core"" basically).",it wasn't a solution really designed around lowering the power floor.,also the power gating is likely not designed to be able to power off as deeply as a mobile solution.,"you can see here for example at the bottom even at idle how a 12400 with the 6p die (h0) vs. 12400 with the 8p+8e die (c0) and a 12900k (same 8p+8e die) idle in comparison - https://www.hwcooling.net/en/the-same-and-yet-different-intel-core-i5-12400-duel-h0-vs-c0/5/

the scheduler also prioritizes the p-cores and only relies on the e-cores if p-cores are not available (which is followed last by the smt thread on the p-cores).",so unless you want to manually assign infinity for everything the scheduler is not going to do what you think it does.,it's not a like a mobile phone.,"fun fact, battery life on laptops intel's 12th gen cpus (which are hybrid) is generally worse than 11th gen non hybrid.",the 13400/f basically will only offer marginal per thread perf improvements.,the extra e-cores will offer significant mt perf in throughput scenarios (eg.,rendering) and some multitask scenarios (eg.,rendering in the background on the e-cores).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yah amd really priced themselves into a corner when the 7600x isnâ€™t competitive relative to a 13600 and now most likely the 13400. theyâ€™ll have to significantly reduce prices to compete if/when the 3d-cache cpuâ€™s release but i think the non-x variants are coming first.,"i imagine someone at amd today woke up, saw the prices for the non-k skuâ€™s and said, â€œfml..â€ ðÿ˜‚",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
efficient cores are less efficient?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

made almost the exact same jump from a 4770k to the 13600k!,was hoping to upgrade my gtx 1080 to the new 7900 xtx but not willing to pay more for the graphics card than my entire computer cost.,will probably settle for a used 30xx series or  6800-6900xt maybe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
congrats bro.,i just upgraded from my old 980ti and 6800k to a 3080ti and a 12700k.,the processor came after the gpu and holy smokesâ€¦ my frames nearly doubled.,enjoy the setup.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
same but to the 12th gen i7.,it quadrupled my fps across the board.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"my old 7700k died i think because i put liquid metal on it wrong, but it also lasted about a month and a half post liquid metal, so could go either way.","most common way is too much voltage for too long, which i definitely also did once i had the liquid metal on it just to squeeze it over 5ghz and see if i could hold out until am5/13th gen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"cpu's rarely die and are hard to kill, but overheating is an easy cause, along with (extreme) overvolting, or simple voltage surges during thunder storms.",cooled and fed voltages within their safe range: they'll last decades.,"modern cpu's even circumvent that overheating problem by having temp throttle gate sensors at hundreds of locations on the cpu die, preventing any one hotspot from developing, if, say, your fan fails, or the heatsink completely falls off the cpu.",; although modern cpu's are more sensitive to voltage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it just depends.,it can be a voltage spike.,it can be a flaw in the silicon.,i killed an 8700k by removing a cpu cooler and then reinstalling after applying better thermal paste.,"the cooler was fine the first time, ran it for over a year.",did the reapplication and screwed it back down.,dead.,the funny part was intel did not have any in stock and they sent me a check since it was under warranty.,"i cashed the check, bought a 9700k for $20 less than the check and it is still my backup system to this day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yes sure, its fine for stock speed, but you do have to undervolt these cpus still.","also if you don't want to overclock, you should save money and buy non k / non z.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you donâ€™t have to undervolt if the load line calibration is set correctly.,z series still gives you a much better vrm that will run cooler.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it seems it's actually cheaper.. in europe it's in stock for 225 euro so it's like $170 without vat etc..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nope the chipset is just another board feature among many.,the price of the board is determined by a combination of all the features.,the chipset doesn't really determine the tier anymore.,"it became this way when high-end chipsets became useless to most people, but they still want premium board features.",hence you end up with expensive h boards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

phases are not the only criteria.,"msi does indeed make some of the most capable vrms in b660 boards, but they also lack bios flashback making them a poor choice with a 13th gen cpu, as you will most likely need to install a 12th gen cpu to flash the bios to a 13th gen-compatible version.","thatâ€™s not the board i would personally choose for a k cpu, however it ought to do the job provided you have decent case cooling so thereâ€™s some airflow over the vrm heatsinks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

be very very cautious of b660 motherboards.,not many will be able to adequately power a 13600k.,"additionally, the majority of them lack bios flashback and will require a 12th generation cpu to upgrade to a 13th generation-compatible bios.",definitely check this before you buy.,cheaper z690 boards may have similar bios issues (including all asus prime and tuf models).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the b660 ddr4 is a smart move, especially if you have carryover memory.","ddr5 seems to have significant advantage, but at a price while ever better kits come out regularly.",so essentially you can buy time with a cheap b660 until ddr5 matures both in performance and price.,"then in 1-2 years you can sell the b660 at low depreciation, get a by-then discounted z790 and a good ddr5.","i chose an msi b660m-b, and have paid half the price of a z690 mobo incl.",bios update by the retailer.,"i have zero issues, board is stable and the 13600k easily runs at stock speed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"actually, check out the broadwell core i7 5775c.","it had intel iris graphics on board, but when a dedicated gpu the cache from the more powerful igpu can be used as an l4 cache which gave it 1% and 0.1% lows that often beat the 6700k and 7700k.",different technology but similar idea to the 5800x 3d.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"curious which settings you're using that you're seeing it ""demolishes"" a 13900k.",what are the fps differences you see?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intel probably doesn't see the need for 3d cache since the single threaded performance of raptor lake and presumably meteor and arrow lake is very good.,intel might only consider if a future variant of zen4 or zen5 has better performance than expected.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks for raising this question.,i have googled for a bit but cant find any material on this.,"seems like the slightly similar thing intel has is the ""hbm"" memory cache coming up in sapphire rapids.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"meteor lake onwards definitely looks chiplet focused now, but whether intel will implement 3d cache, no one knows.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tarkov is a very shitty game as far as optimization.,"it's funny how that game has been in active development since 2016 is still absolutely horrendous on high-end hardware, a la 13900k with rtx 3080+ cards.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well 5800x3d is losing to raptor lake in performance both in gaming and in other programs.,there is a lot of expectation from certain parties that the 7000-series 3d-cache cpus would be great for gaming.,"we do not really know how that will be, we do know that the regular 7000-series is really nothing special as it is ddr5 only and maxes out at pretty poor ddr5 speeds and latency.",the ram controller seems to pretty poor on those cpus.,on top of that 3d-cache is just more cache.,"it seems that cache is increasing each cpu-gen, but 5800x3d was the first cpu that purely went for that direction, while forgetting a lot of other characteristics.",that approach seems to have paid off for it.,it has 96mb l3 cache.,5950x also had 64mb of that same cache even without the stacking tech.,13900k has 68mb of l2+l3 cache.,"lets see how this game plays on, but for now it seems that all cpus are getting larger caches gen by gen. it does not seem to matter where the cache is located and instead of focusing on marketing like ""3d-cache"" we should focus more on the amount of cache and checking how much benefit it gives.","too much certain types of cache can lead to increased latency in some use cases, so just automatically always adding it is not the correct path to take.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i get well over 100fps with my 13900k, i think the examples you are seeing are not great examples lol.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i am not sure if ""3d"" cache is a good idea.","more cache is always welcomed, but why place it on top of the processor, hindering cpu cooling?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no it wont.,raptor lake is already being pushed about as hard as intel can push their cpu technology at the moment.,"some slight improvements on intel 7 are potentially still possible, but we're talking smallish clock bumps here.","and meteor lake is likely not gonna see a huge level of improvement in terms of such single thread performance, not to mention it's probably only going to be 6(p) cores rather than the 8 of raptor lake and potentially mobile-only.","there's just no way to compete with adding 64mb of cache on an existing, affordable chiplet like amd can do with zen 3/4.",adding another 40-60mb of l3 on raptor lake would mean needing an entirely new chip to be designed and it would be much bigger than current raptor lake chip(which is already very big for a consumer cpu).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's the 3d heatsink era.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
would be cool!,no idea if i'd actually bother upgrading though.,"i mainly play games and well, the cpu doesn't matter nearly as much as the gpu anyway.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intels lack of answer to amds 3d vcache was the reason i went with a 7950x for this upgrade cycle instead of a 13900k to get on the platform and wait for the vcache chip.,this is my first amd chip since an x2 4400+ and seeing how long amd supported the last socket seemed like a nice change of pace from what i had grown accustomed to.,"i will admit though, buying this chip and 6000mhz ram is kinda boring.",iâ€™m used to being able to get faster memory down the line etc.,it is refreshing that intel is no longer producing carbon copy cpus any longer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes but the 5800x3d just combines it into the l3 cache efficiently just becoming a massive l3 instead of an extra l4.,would be nice if intel can do the same.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"one of the issues amd ran into with the 5800x3d was that the 3d cache acted as a thermal insulator for the cores below, that was a big reason why the 5800x3d was clocked a few hundred mhz lower than its not 3d counterpart.","if you stacked extra cores, not only would those cores serve as an insulator themselves, theyd serve as a physical heat source for the cores on bottom.",i can't see stacking cores as a practical design.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50%+ in tarkov with a 5800x3d vs 12900k.,"in warzone where cache isn't as important the 12900k/13900k are much better, just depends on if the game is cache sensitive or not.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yeah i googled it first as i don't normally make posts and couldn't see much if anything relating to it.,"intel have gone with some interesting design choices with the p+e cores so would be interesting to see what they do about adding more cache, seems it's a struggle to fit it on the die.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the way i see mtl potentially including extra cache would be a layer of cache in the base die.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i don't even want to see how absolutely horrendous will intel's 1st gen of chiplet cpu be.,expecting the performance being all over the place in some workloads falling back to comet lake performance.,intel seems very incapable in terms of implementing cutting-edge technologies.,first chiplet-like thing from intel was supposed to be sapphire rapids but those cpus already got delayed by two years because they have huge issues with making them work properly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"yes i agree it has bad optimization but it's the game i play most so having the 5800x3d is completely worth it for me, it's insane how the cache helps so much.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in tarkov?,i've watched streamers with 13900k struggle to get 80+ fps on streets whereas i've been hitting 120+ no problem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"amd's implementation of 3d cache doesn't place it over the cores, but over the cache already there.","as for ""why place it on top instead of off to the side"", presumably it's for latency purposes - there's a very small latency penalty for tripling the size of the cache.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
for latency reasons?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"have it as an option for gamers, 5800x3d does run much hotter than a 5800x while having lower clocks but the 3d cache makes up for it, worth the extra money if primarily gaming.",imagine a slower 13700k/13900k with extra cache it'd be amazing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">more cache is always welcomed, but why place it on top of the processor, hindering cpu cooling?","as somebody else already mentioned, amd cleverly places their cache chiplet over existing cache only, so it doesn't cover the cores.",but you are right that placing the cache on top is ultimately a less ideal way of doing this.,"it makes sense when you want to offer the ability to have a chiplet that can be used standalone or have a stacked cache chiplet, but if you really wanted to optimize the design, you'd put the cache chiplet under the core chiplet, and you'd put all the l3 cache on it, where you could not only use more cache if you wanted, but you'd also get to shrink the core chip by quite a lot(current zen 4 chiplet is like 50% l3).",the downside is that these become inseparable and you can *only* sell it as a stacked product.,"this seems to be what cdna3 will be doing going by amd's own illustrations, though it's a very obvious solution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7950x doesn't have 3d cache,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would be curious about the performance implications of using a much larger l4 cache or adding less cache but stacking it for extra l3.,"one way might not necessarily be better than the other, i'm guessing it depends on how *much* more extra l4 cache they can add compared to how much extra l3 cache they can stack.","it also would depend on how much extra cache games could utilize effectively for the l4 to be large enough to yield performance benefits, for example if the l4 only added a marginal amount of capacity but the game requires a large amount of information that couldn't fit into the l4 regardless, then all the addition of l4 would be doing is adding latency.","but then that would also depend on how they use their l4 as well, ik intel at one point used their l4 as a victim cache for their l3?","it's a shame there aren't more tests for the impacts of l4 on the 5775c, other than the (imo flawed) anandtech testing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the only way i can see stacking cores as a practical design would be:

a large server processor made up of entirely atom cores where the clock speeds are going to be extremely low anyway 

p cores and e cores on the top maybe?","but tbh unless drastic new ways of cooling chips becomes available, i don't really see much benefits from stacking cores on top of each other.","the perhaps best benefit of stacking cores would be to increase performance by decreasing latency, but you would also see a huge decrease in clock speeds because of thermals.","imo it doesn't really make much sense when you could also just expand horizontally with chiplets, even if the power/latency cost is larger.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> because they have huge issues with making them work properly.,"sapphire rapids is a pretty ambitious overall design, and i've not seen any indication that chiplet packaging has been responsible for the issues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
?,they already had chiplet cpus 10+ years ago.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">as for ""why place it on top instead of off to the side"", presumably it's for latency purposes - there's a very small latency penalty for tripling the size of the cache.",the reason is because it's necessary if they want to make it an optional part.,"ideally you'd put it on the bottom, but now you've got to completely rework the connections.","this is what i expect will be done in time(and what amd's cdna3 seems to be doing), but only once cache stacking becomes standard rather than a higher priced option.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i would assume the reason is because its cheaper.,"amd outsources cpu construction to external companies, so number of cpus per waffer may be important.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but like practically?,it seems like outside of gaming there are few applications that benefited from this design and the gaming market isn't *that* huge to justify designing and manufacturing entire line of chips.,we'll see i suppose.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">have it as an option for gamers, 5800x3d does run much hotter than a 5800x

i dont believe it does from what i've seen, though they could be using higher binned chips to achieve this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you put the cache next to the cpu, there is no need to slow down the cpu.",i would expect (if intel decides to add more cache) that the extra cache will not be stacked ontop of the cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"iâ€™m aware, my plan is to sell the 7950x and replace it with the 3d vcache chip when it launches.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"after the packaging master class which was ponte vecchio (a legitimately impressive jigsaw puzzle of silicon), i have higher hopes for potential future chiplet cpu designs.","sapphire rapids' issues seem to be more institutional than tied to specific process troubles, although i think everyone is eager to finally get them out the door and into general availability.",emerald rapids deserves full attention.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i had an older laptop with that one haswell variant with the 128mb l4 cache.,that thing was a monster that could punch well above its weight for long after it was considered modern.,literally every application i ran noticably benefitted from it compared to other devices i had with similar chips.,it's really amazing what a big cache can do.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

intel has been losing money recently and it needs to refocus on its main line of product or more profitable markets.,"also, intel has been selling some divisions or shutting it down, so, i think that it is fair to think that there is a big chance for intel to cancel the project entirely or partially or at least changing its scope and objectives.","moreover, intel has been investing heavily upgrading it manufacturing sites (ohio, arizona, ireland and israel) and reopening some that were shut down in the past (like costa rica site, intel has been hiring people very aggressively and paying a lot of money to them); that is a very very big cash burning machine and of course it increases intel debt, so, that is another reason to decide to shut down non profitable projects and focus r&d money in the products that will give them the money back asap.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

also losing money doesn't mean they're considered a failure.,it's common for a company entering a field they're not usually in to lose money initially because they're investing into developing their knowledge and reach into the market.,"in fact, they pretty much always start off losing money unless lightning strikes and they can get off the ground with a massive runaway success, which these cards sadly were not but that doesn't mean things can't improve.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
funny enough with apos testing the intel hardware encoder is the best on the market right now quality wise.,but from a performance standpoint even the a380 is an impressive little card.,and fr what i see in that i feel intel might be able to damn near catch up in 4 or 5 generations.,and if they keep the encode prowess i'll keep a card in my system for encoding and maybe even as my 3d gpu because even the software end their controller panel and overlay are really impressive as well.,it's a lot of work that can pay off well.,i saw arc in person at dreamhack dallas.,i'm for it.,have an a380 in my system and intend on picking up an a770.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"not really, if they aren't competitive and they use/waste wafers on tsmc then all we get is more expensive gpus as a response.","if intel is taking say 5k wafers a month thats 5k wafers of amd/nvidia gpus that can be produced, worse as intel is making so much larger chips for the same performance lets say if amd got 100 gpus of a given performance off a wafer, intel would be getting 50, further reducing supply which further increases cost.","these chips on intel's node and not effecting tsmc supply, sure fine.","intel chips that are competitive and using tsmc supply, the end user hasn't gained.","intel making more competitive chips that make nvidia/amd drop prices to compete, great.",intel are currently making chips that really just reduce supply/increase cost right now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"if they can only catch up in 4 generations they'll cancel the project tomorrow (internally, externally when they've shifted what stock they can).","as for performance, it's horrible outside of encoding.",it's a 157mm^2 on a more advanced node that gets spanked by a 6500xt that has a 107mm^2 die size.,it gets destroyed (2.5x faster) by a 6600 that is a 235mm^2.,those are 2 year old architecture chips on an older node that are going to be replaced by rdna3+ shortly and amd is just beginning to get back into stride with gpus after years of underfunding.,rdna2 was a huge leap forward for them and rdna3 is set to be similarly large.,intel is a couple years away from the next gen and will only be selling chips that are incredibly uncompetitive from a die size perspective.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
your economic model feels too simple to assess the viability of a product line.,"sure, people are buying it, but how many are being sold and for how much profit.",how does that profit compare with the money spent developing the card?,what is the projected cost for the release of next generation and how much does intel expect to make from them?,those are the questions that will decide discrete arcs future.,"not just, it's sold out currently.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

this is incorrect.,"youre treating being correct about a multi-label multi-classification (labels are not mutually exclusive, classifications are, so ram speed is a label, the individual speeds that ram can have are classifications) problem as a binary truth operation.","itd be binary truth if the question was ""will intel produce a new graphics card"" because then its a coinflip they either will or wont theres only 1 label and 2 classifications, but predicting the exact sku of that gpu requires at minimum 2 labels (1 for will the gpu exist at all, the other for the name) and the naming label has a near infinite number of classifications (1 for each possible sku variation) so the chance is far far lower than 50%

being correct about hardware specs isnt a 50/50 chance, because the specs themselves are a composite object of many many smaller probability entries.","being correct about the specs inherently requires you to be correct about the memory bus size (which has what like 4-5 different possible answers so you only have a 20% chance of being correct there), frequency (hundreds/thousands of possible variations, lets go conservative and say 1% chance), memory size (again theres what 4-5 different configurations used atm so 20-25% chance) etc etc

the chance of you getting every single last element of a specification correct with just those requirements is 0.2\*0.01\*0.25 so 0.05%

if you are looking at it as ""i bet you mlid is correct"" then yes, you ""technically"" have 50/50 odds because hes either correct or hes wrong, but the actual statistical chance of him being correct if his answer is completely randomised is closer to that 0.05% (much much lower in practice)

so getting anywhere close to 50% accuracy rate implies he has some sort of advantage weighting the odds in his favor very heavily since thats 3 orders of magnitude larger than the statistical average

edit: if you need a visual example of this in action.","consider firing a gun in an fps

you have two states, you either hit something or you didnt, so you could naively think that the average hit rate is 50%

the reality is that given a 1 pixel by 1 pixel hit scan weapon and a screen size of 1920/1080p your chance of hitting anything on the screen is actually size of the object youre trying to hit in 2073600

so trying to hit a 20 pixel target would be 0.00096450617% if you just fired randomly, to hit an accuracy anywhere close to 50% you have to be intentionally weighing the odds in your favor by aiming manually instead of firing randomly.",\#math,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

140 mm btw,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i think if i end up going for the air cooler i would have to get some low profile ddr5 ram to fit under it.,"the problem with the nh-15 is that i dont think there is any ddr5 ram that actually dose fit under it perfectly, think you will have to move it up just a bit",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

z790 offer much better ddr5 support and most have full w11 compatibility out of the box.,with a 690 you're looking at a need for an upgrade within the next 2-3 years at best.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ok, sure, but are you going to invest in that much customization?",because the out of the box experience is just not going to be that nice otherwise.,"also, most of the nicer looking options have a trade off, like the nzxt boards being only available with older chipsets right now or those maskings for the radiator likely affecting performance (which, i assume, you'll need every bit of for 13th gen).",i'm not saying these are bad options but you need to consider if that's what aligns with your priorities for the build.,"personally i feel like if you're going with 13700k/kf right now you are one of these 2 people:
1. someone who wants to be on the bleeding edge, regardless of anything else.",2. someone who needs a new pc asap for some reason and wants to future proof their build.,if you're in the 1st category you can go for the looks because you will most likely be upgrading your platform again in the next 1-2 years anyway.,however if you're in the 2nd you might need to consider function over form.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my $.02 - you would be fine with an air cooler on a 13700k in real world scenarios.,my 13600k is at 5.4 on an h150i and it's overkill for day to day usage.,i average about 60 after an hour stress testing with occt extreme large data set.,that's a realistic workload of \~130w.,in normal usage and gaming i am usually in the 40-50s.,220w on a 13600k is only going to happen if you're throwing something like prime95 small fft at it.,great tool if you want to find overclock instability in a short time but (in my opinion) i don't think you need to buy a cooling solution just to pass a stress test that puts double the power draw you would ever see in your actual usage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

for reference my 240mm afii is good enough for cooling 200w without hitting much of a sweat.",highly recommended aio - i've been using them since the i7 2600k days and have nothing but good words about them.,would highly recommend an aio if you've got a gpu that dumps air into the case (rather than a blower one),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ah ye it seems to do the job + its quiet its going to come down to how it looks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the non-led versions of corsair vengance and kingston's basic ones have a low enough profile that they should fit at least in the second slot.,i believe nh-15 also has the option to attach the front fan at different heights (to a degree) so you might be able to clear the memory regardless though it may slightly affect the cooling efficiency of the tower.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thatâ€™s completely false, the excellent ddr5 speeds raptor lake can hit are mostly because of the improved imc, and thereâ€™s absolutely no difference between the windows 11 support of the two chipsets (whatever the fuck *thatâ€™s* supposed to mean).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

i've got the money to splash on the build but im waiting for the new amd cards to drop plus what i really want is for the new nzxt board to drop before the end of the year and that would be perfect for me.,thus then this build should last at least 5+ years,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"your $.02 was amazing :) its what i figured really, im not going to be doing anything crazy then just gaming and working on chrome etc so i think its perfectly fine - i guess i just need to see what i like better , the look of an aio or an air cooler ;) the only problem with the  nh-15 is how i cant show my ram off unless i go for something like nh-d15s or deepcool ak620 but i also would love to see some reviews on how loud they get when you game/ just work on chrome etc",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's not about the chipset itself.,the motherboards are newer so they are coming out with better compatibility for the new tech.,they support wider range of ram which is important if you will ever (and you probably will) need to replace your dice.,it can be surprisingly difficult to get ram compatible with a 4+ year old mobo if it wasn't chosen with that in mind.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so iâ€™ve only tested my 13700k/u12a in bf 2042 as rhat hits the cpu pretty hard.,iâ€™ve found that with the fans on full blast that the cpu got up to 78c and then tapered off in the mid 60s.,this is with mce on in the bios too so definitely not too shabby.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mines still not that good right now so iâ€™ll send a picture or whatever is easiest of them.,also iâ€™m gonna try to under volt my cpu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that sounds like a good plan.,"one thing to note is that the length of time a rig can last largely depends on longevity of components and maintained support from manufacturers, mainly for the motherboard via bios updates.",my longest running build got over 8 years and it was thanks to a combination of advance cpu tech (future proofing from intel at the time) and great support for the mobo (asrock).,"the things that aged the fastest were the gfx (duh) and the ram, i've even had hw failures on both of these components.","now, gfx is easy to replace but ram can be tricky due to compatibility.",i don't know how nzxt approaches it but make sure your choice has a large variety of compatible dice to ensure it will remain available for as long as you plan to use this pc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it's incorrect.,"in an example of 13900k: 5.5p and 4.3e - if under load they reach those clocks without thermal issues - they will stay at them, but when they get throttling at 5.3 for example - they will stop and start to lower clocks to reduce temps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thats literally what i said.....,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
heâ€™s right.,if the 13900k can run 5.5p and 4.3e on all coresâ€¦ the cpu will hit 100c no matter what you do to cool it.,"render for one minute and the cpu may not hit 100c but if youâ€™re rendering a 3d animation for 6 hours, not only will it hit 100c, it will throttle to maintain as much performance as it can without going over 100c.","letâ€™s say it another wayâ€¦ if you run these cpus long enough on all cores, it will reach 100c even with throttling and excellent cooling.",you can set the pl2 to stock and the chip will throttle earlier and use only 253w.,the chip may not reach 100c as fast as unlimited pl2 would but the chip can still run fine up to 100c.,the 100c is the hard limit where it absolutely must throttle to avoid 115c.,so the chip is designed to run up to 100c safely.,"if it wasnâ€™t, it would shut itself off at 100c not just throttle.",remember the 13900k is unlocked and intel expects customers to run it overclocked if they choose.,itâ€™s why intel provides software to do it :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dude.,in your motherboard which is enabled by default is called intel adaptive boost or abt.,which i confirmed with intel is not an overclock and in spec since itâ€™s another boost technology made by intel.,that is how you get your 5.5 on all p cores and 4.3 on e cores when under load.,you have absolutely no idea what your talking about,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
check your pump and repaste probably not making proper contact,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"but how can this be called ""designed to reach 100c""?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"also intel actually told me that the all core 5.5 or whatever is not guaranteed, that is a turbo boost and it is within spec for them to throttle lower?",so why are they telling me one thing and you another thing?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes but it doesn't need 1.4+v for that!!!!,the mobo voltages are set far too higher than what is actually needed!,default lite load setting is set far too high for 13th gen's vid tables!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"not the issue, already did that, and 100+ cases of this can't all be 'user error'.","no boxed cooling can keep a 13th gen under 100c at 1.35v under load, no one elses results with any aio are better than mine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
..... because when under full load or stress.,the cpu does not throttle and has boosting technologies to make it so it does not throttle until it hits 100c.,"if 100c was hurtful to the cpu then intel wouldve made the cpu throttle at 90-95c

&#x200b;

they basically took what amd did with the 95c target and did it 5c more.",now if your able to cool it.,great.,you got really good cooling.,but the cpu will protect itself once 100c or more is hit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depends on if your thermal throttling.,if you are then you will go down to 5.4 with the boost technology enbaled.,if you disable it then you will be at 5.2-5.3 all core.,and e-core will be around 4.1-4.2 ghz boost.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that is only a select brand of motherboards.,i have asus and i dont have any overvolting or overheating issues except when under extreme full load.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well no one should be thermal throttling at stock or hitting 100c with water cooling or even a 420mm aio on open bench.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"happening right here as well on an asus board:

https://www.reddit.com/r/intel/comments/102h7tz/13900k_145v_by_default_on_z790_maximus_hero/

1.45v at stock and 100c.","from everyone's testing not just mine, even a 420mm arctic aio on open bench isn't enough to run these chips under 100c at 1.35v.","they are overvolted and dangerously so at 'stock' settings, end of discussion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
yes i know that.,"asus have another feature  that someone pointed out prevents this:

'you should ask msi to tell you what the llc impedance values are or, better yet, tell them to link dc ll impedance to llc impedance like asus does.'",so i've sent that to msi.,"in any case, 100c at stock cpu settings is not normal ok?",if people are getting that they need to report it to their mobo aib.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"rog strix z790-e here, you might be surprised if you start to monitor voltages at not the full load.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
no.,thatâ€™s a different subject.,the 13900k can still reach 100c at lower voltage.,many here probably are using cpu lite load to lower the voltage to a better voltage level.,for example iâ€™m using mode 7 on the msi z790 carbon with a 420mm aio.,i can still hit 100c if i render all core at 5.5p and 4.3e.,itâ€™s not throttling but itâ€™s also not at 1.45v.,itâ€™s 1.28v at vcore and the core vid is 1.318. and iâ€™m at 90c while rendering cinebench r23 during a single multi core pass.,"but if i run a 30 minute cinebench, eventually temps will creep up and the chip wonâ€™t throttle until 100c.",again even at 1.288v.,iâ€™m undervolting.,but youâ€™re right motherboards do seem to be overvolting but that is why everyone says itâ€™s fine to undervolt including msi themselves.,to be clear iâ€™m running pl2 unlimited and chip is happy to run to 100c no matter what pl2 or cooling you have.,it has nothing to do with voltage being too high.,that is a separate issue which can be easily addressed by the user via their bios but really itâ€™s not that bad either because the chip may ask for more voltage than it needs and some boards have overbuilt power delivery and will give it unless you control it.,itâ€™s an unlocked chip and some of these boards are for drag racing cpus not just stock spec use.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe you should not talk so much about a cpu you donâ€™t even own,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you looking at vid or vcore?,you should be looking at vcore.,and everything is normal on my end.,1.3-1.4v depending on load is completely fine for 10nm.,if this was 14nm like skylake cpus then yeah you should be worried,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i do own one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"at the instruction level there are three things that can be done to cause faster performance on a specific cpu: use instructions only present on that cpu, schedule the instructions optimally for one cpu but not another, and (if malicious) detect which cpu you're running on and be deliberately slower if it's not the one you want.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
latencies and throughputs of individual instructions differ between different processor models.,you can optimize for one and then make others slower because an implementation of a given algorithm makes better use of said processor's architecture.,same for tweaking routines such as memory clears where you'd set threshold dependent on the sizes of l1/l2 caches.,same for setting pause durations for spinlocks/mutexes/whatever.,"same for using things like jump tables (their performance differs depending on the branch predictor used) etc, there's myriad of ways.",one could make a compiler emit an optimal code for a particular cpu model at the expense of all others by tweaking all of those and other things.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"also on a multi-core level, the more complex the core-layout is, the more the optimal use of threads and their allocation to different cores differs.","as an example, the current heterogeneous nature of intel's processors vs. ccx, ccds and io-die hierarchy).",on intel it might be best to only use p-cores.,on amd it might be best to only use cores on one die.,optimizing for this is usually done by hand and not automatically by a compiler (as opposed to many instruction-level optimizations mentioned above).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
">use instructions only present on that cpu

how is this possible?",shouldn't the architecture be the same for intel and amd?,"(x86-64 arch, so same machine language instructions)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thanks!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nearly every new generation of x86 cpus adds additional instructions.,"in the case of powerful new instructions like avx-512, a benchmark that is able to use them could be tremendously faster on a cpu that supports them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"you can support cpu's that don't have a given instruction by ""gating"" it behind a runtime check.","i.e run a comparison ""do i have aes-ni""?",no?,use slower fallback.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"thanks, what software component does this ""runtime check""?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
software library provided by the compiler typically.,could also write it yourself but no point.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the compiler can inline it.,"when it's an assembly routine a person writes it by hand, typically it's a simple memory read and a fused compare with jump (3 instructions, but cmp/test + jmp get macro-op fused so execute as 2 instructions).",loads are usually 3 clocks if from l1 and the fused cmp/jump takes 1 clock.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is it the loader?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
so in every executable there is a subroutine that does all these checks to see if the instructions used are available?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"no, only for instructions that are special and not included in a given ""architecture level"".","most apps nowadays assume you have sse2 and won't run without it, there are no dynamic checks for that as it would drastically slow things down.","for example, you would have to check if you have sse every time you do a 16 bit write/load, which would be ridiculous.","the checks for things like aes-ni,avx512, erms, popcount are right before the code that uses them (a few instructions before.","so when you call the function using them, that's where that check runs).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

there's a pentium 5?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i think tejas was supposed to be pentium 5 until  intel cancelled it in 2004 in favor of core 2.

edit: intel abandoned naming their mid-range and high-end consumer chips pentium in the mid-2000s with the core series when they started to emphasize core count and stopped emphasizing clock speed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
prescott probably would have been labeled pentium 5 had it and the 90 nm process node performed as intel had expected.,intel made massive changes to the core between northwood and prescott and it was a die shrink.,pentium iii got a new new number solely for the addition of sse to the pentium ii deschutes core.,"prescott increased the pipeline from 20 to 31 stages, had larger l1 and l2 caches, significant improvements to branch prediction, a new sse revision, and a new 90 nm process node.","had it hit the high frequency targets intel expected, it would have been a lot faster than northwood and worthy of the pentium 5 name.",unfortunately it drew more power and produced more heat than northwood at the same clock speed while performing slightly slower in most tasks.,"itâ€™s impressive that intel even managed to make a 31 stage core competitive with a 20 stage core at the same clock speed, but without a big clock speed bump over northwood, prescott couldnâ€™t be branded as pentium 5. so intel stuck with pentium 4, and cancelled tejas a few months after prescottâ€™s release.",at this point intel knew netburst was a dead end.,two years later core 2 put the final nail in the coffin for pentium as intelâ€˜s premier consumer cpu line.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"pentium 5 isn't real

i think the closest would be the xeon 7140m.,"it is for socket 604, on a cutting edge 65nm process node, with blazing fast 800mhz fsb.",the ultimate of the netburst architecture.,"16mb of l3 cache +2mb of l2, 2 netburst cores clocked at 3.4ghz with hyperthreading, up to quad socket multiprocessing.","with a whopping 150w tdp and incredible 200+ watt maximum thermal dissipation, this cpu is truly a beast.",always wanted a quad socket rig of these for the lol's but i cant justify installing 240v just for it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"back then, i'm glad for that change in focus oby intel because there was something wrong when a 2 ghz amd athlon 64 ($140 on sale) runs as well as a 4.5 ghz pentium 4 ($200 on sale).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it would be *really* interesting to see how computing would have turned out if the laws of physics were just a tad different and prescott and tejas hadn't had their infamous heating issues.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"my best netburst system is a dual xeon 5080 with 32gb of ddr2 fb-dimm, basicly two pentium d extreme edition 965s in one mobo.",4 cores 8 threads of pure netburst power.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

you can combine 2 120 outlets in series to get 240 that's what i do,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the scary thing is that intel was intentionally making their pipeline as long and inefficient as possible so they could crank the clockspeeds up for marketing/bragging purposes.,ignoring that the actual performance was terrible per cycle and thus needed to be clocked that fast to not-even match amd processors at half that speed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tejas never came out.,"this is xeon tulsa, from mid 2006 i beleive.",i think it actually co-existed with core-based xeons on other platforms (socket 771?),at the time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

type z590 into slickdeals.net there have been a few really good sale finds on those boards in the past couple weeks.,there's a pretty good chance you'll be able to replace the board with something comparable and have money left over from the check you get,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

no uhd 770 on these adl-n lake cpus?,hard pass for me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
that would make it a gpu with an integrated cpu.,really want to see some benchmarks.,"the n5100 i have in a laptop is pretty impressive, a node shrink and newer cores could make it actually great.",but the leaked multi-core benchmarks were pretty underwhelming and the single channel memory is rather concerning.,"e: they apparently want $309 for the n305, what the hell",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"hey, thanks for chiming in.",so what kind of igpu performance can we actually expect from a i3-n305?,and what socket is it using?,if it is 1700 can we slap it on a \*790 chipset board?,thanks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it will run fine at stock settings.,"if you can pair it with a big top down cooler(nh-c14s, is-60, axp100, etc) for better vrm airflow, you'll get better temps/performance out of it, at least at stock power limits.",source: https://www.techspot.com/review/2426-intel-b660-motherboards/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12th gen k's on b660s are fine for a non oc build.,13th gen k's on non msi b660s take a huge l for not being possible to fix the 1.4v+ at stock settings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
how much would a slight to moderate undervolt generally effect performance on games?,iâ€™ve been told little to none,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
couldn't hurt to try.,the actual power limit values seem to matter the most.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
iâ€™m really only going to be running games at 1440p aiming for 60fps.,itâ€™s a couch gaming machine for the living room so no high frame rates needed.,"do you think the motherboard will be fine, even without a undervolt?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"if you're aiming for 60fps only, the cpu literally doesn't even matter.",may as well get a 12400/13400 or 12600k which supports faster ram instead.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
thatâ€™s a relief.,as long as i can keep the temps in the 60â€™s iâ€™ll be happy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 13500 is listed on best buy's website in the us- so it's coming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"it's available in uk

must have been a recent add.,i was looking everywhere this morning.,thanks for the heads up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i compared the cpu's and the ark page let's you export a great table in csv with a full comparison breakdown.,"i may do a separate post and highlight it, but honestly the 13600 (non-k) which is up for spec but seemingly also not available is the best option.","the 12500 is nearly better than the 13400 except lacking e-cores, but the standard clock is much better and it has more xe cores and 770 instead of 750 igpu....after looking at all of it basically you might as well try and find a 12500 or just get a 13600 and skip everything in between.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i donâ€™t understand your logic.,the 13500 exists.,iâ€™m not asking why intel isnâ€™t making one.,they made it.,theyâ€™re just choosing not to make it available in north america.,why?,what benefit is it to intel to sell it in indonesia?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"because 13400, the entry level raptor lake is already priced at the level of flagship alder lake i5?","13500 will not sell in its supposed price tag, which will exceed 12600k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the 13500 is 6+8 core config opposed to the 13400(f) and 12600k 6+4.,so it's very different from the past non-k skews and might have a place in the market for ppl wanting more cores.,"also might outperform the 12600k in some applications, because of the cores.","yea the pricing of 13th gen is pretty high, [especially in europe](https://i.imgur.com/pi7hxot.png)(not the cheapest retailer and some of the 12th gen pricing is all over the place, but it's the one that had 13th gen non-k listings, also curiously no 13600), but that for all the skews not just 1 of them.",so it's pretty weird if it's not sold in america.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
maybe.,but they raised alder lake prices today.,the 13400f is $209.,at $259 a 13500f is realistic.,thatâ€™s cheaper than the 12600k.,"if they want to push older inventory of alder lake, raising prices doesnâ€™t make sense either",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
is there even a 13500f?,only 13500 was announced.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i meant 13500. though i would assume lower f-skuâ€™s will become available at some point,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the 6900xt works perfect no artifacting what so ever,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
agree that it could be either but a bad motherboard seems more likely.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

so the 4080 and 12700 should run demanding games fine until i inevitably upgrade?,this is a long term pc so i will upgrade the cpu eventually but until then i want to be sure that i will have a comfortable experience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"did you slot the new proc on the same mainboard with the same ram, or upgrade the whole platform to, presumably, z790 and ddr5?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
if you're getting a 4080 why not go for the best cpu you can get?,the zen 4 3d chips will be faster than current 13th gen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with a 4090 in mw2 4k resolution iâ€™m 10-13 percent bottle neck with 12700k.,so a 4080 with 12700f would probably lower but will still have a little bottle neck.,at the end of the day when games are already giving you 200+ fps i donâ€™t think it matter much but if ur playing at 4k with 4080 and ur barely going up to 70-80 fps depending on games ur playing then it may be worth not being bottleneck depending on the user at that point if u want more ðÿ¤·ðÿ»â€â™‚ï¸,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"both 4080 and 12700 should have plenty of grunt for these games, though make sure you go at least 32 if not 64gb of ram, looks pretty ram hungry",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh no, im only getting 280 fps instead of 300!!!!","there will always be a bottleneck in a system, people need to quit worrying about it.",just build a system that will play what you want at fps and quality you want and not obsess over bottlenecking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"yup, i plan to have 32 gb ram, thanks!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gpu can handle 300 fps and cpu can prepare 250. this is what bottleneck looks like and if a consumer doesn't give a f about this - why he even bought that card?,he was able to purchase a lower-tier card that can perform exactly the same but with full utilization.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
because there will always be a bottleneck!,"now you bought a better cpu, it can handle 350 fps, but your card can only handle 300 fps.","why even buy that cpu, by the same logic it's bottlebecked??","you should buy hardware based on what resolution and fps you are targeting, along with considering if you run any professional applications, and how much headroom you want.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"tried to point out, that no one really cares about your karen attitude, in regards to what they bought/received.","youâ€™re like that kid driving a honda civic, telling the guy in a ferrari that he should have bought a bugatti.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"'difference is minimal'

do you even timespy extreme?","https://i.imgur.com/gmgbbv8.jpg

look at how much higher my cpu score is with just 5.7 ghz on 1 core and ddr4 vs a 6.0 oc with ddr5 6800.

comparing all the cpu results, it takes 7200 tuned hynix m die to match my cpu score with 13600k / 13600kf.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"nah, not really.",itâ€™s infinitely more classy to have a lot of money but still spend it wisely than to have relatively little money but spend it frivolously.,"that guy who bought the ferrari probably canâ€™t actually afford it, and maybe shouldâ€™ve taken some advice from the guy who drives a civic and knows the market much better than he does.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

dam maybe i should run some time spy since i have tuned b-die,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
obviously the guy driving a civic have no idea of the needs of people driving ferrariâ€™s.,thinking otherwise is just being ignorant.,perhaps the better approach would be to ask for financial advice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hi!,i looked up the error code and found this thread which contains a very detailed process on how they fixed it from user afsanchez001.,"https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/error-code-0x8007025d-shown-while-trying-to-clean/897417a4-dcd7-4be4-92c6-25f35959c735

lemme know if this helps!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
just finish installing windows.,which version did you have?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
well i don't know.,the same way i get win10 running on core 2 duo?,uhm.,silly comment.,i didn't see the second screenshot.,d you have another pc at your place?,to try installing from the old media to a new hardware.,"and if it works, just replace the disk and w10 will run on the original hardware.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"try making another usb using rufus .. and download the iso only through microsoft.. it's most likely the iso burning issue .. because windows 10 work on cpu's much older than yours , this is not a compatibility issue at all , rest assured ..but the iso probably is ..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it should work fine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
okay i'll do this!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
are you using ventoy if yes use rufus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"idk, i got it running on a second gen i3 and it's somewhat o.k.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

extract the iso to usb.,worked for me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it's not the cpu model at all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have you tried the regular windows usb installer?,it works for me on any machine (even cpus from 2006).,"go here and click ""download tool now""

formatting the space in bios if you donâ€™t get that far in the windows set up is also an option,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
do i need to be connected to network?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
all the computers in my highschool have these with windows 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what are some things i can try to get it running?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
windows 10. it errors at 90% initialization.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
copy that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
windows support with ventoy is very hit or miss,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i get as far as the initialization screen where it reached 90 person and gives me the error everytime,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to create the new installation media?,"yes if you're redownloading an image, no if you're just remounting an image you already have to a usb

to install it?",no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i get that error when there is a problem with the image, reflashing the iso using rufus should do the trick.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
when i tried to use ventoy with windows it broke,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
partition the i5 in bios and format everything else if this is a clean install from wipe.,although i donâ€™t know what your deal is as itâ€™s much better to do it on the hdd and ssd if itâ€™s not super old.,"if this doesnâ€™t work, youâ€™re gonna wanna flat install the manager to a usb then install from there.",if you need too.,reboot and crash during install of windows and itâ€™ll send you to the fix screen upon reboot.,"where you can try the various fix, reinstall, wipe files left over/check on other partitions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
my computers just didn't boot the isos or fell back to bios mode,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

isn't b660 a non overclocking board?,im pretty sure that means you cant do anything with voltage or underclocking at least if i recall correctly.,if someone more knowledgeable can correct me then feel free to do so.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i have an msi b660 board with a 13600k.,"no undervolting here either, not without a loss in performance :(

i instead used xtu to set a power limit of 170w.","iâ€™m using a dark rock 4 air cooler, in cinebench r23 it scores 22500 around 80â°c-85â°c, and in gaming in the mid 60s.","not the coolest thing in the world, but itâ€™s plenty fast.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
update: i think i've figured it out.,running bench loops now.,i'm not sure if i'm really stable yet.,i will try and post another update with links to screen shots.,i am finding some old threads and different sites and have cobbled together an understanding (i think).,update 2: i posted back over in the r/asus sub [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/asus/comments/102i9vi/my_settings_for_improving_thermals_with_a_b660i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).,that post has a link to screenshots and captions.,any questions about it just ask.,hope this helps someone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

thanks for replying-i guess i was assuming i would still be able to lower the voltage or change values.,i donâ€™t want to oc.,i want to do the opposite.,i can see now that i may have missed a fundamental understanding of the difference between the b-series and z-series boards.,although iâ€™m still surprised that kind of definitive answer didnâ€™t turn up with all my googling.,smh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
> isn't b660 a non overclocking board?,im pretty sure that means you cant do anything with voltage or underclocking at least if i recall correctly.,tdp and voltage adustments were available on all kinds of motherboards including laptops for ages.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i built in a fractal ridge and have a low profile cooler.,i really donâ€™t want to spend $250 more just to adjust the voltage to keep the tempâ€™s down.,i am not concerned with performance so much as thermal performance.,i donâ€™t understand why companies would take away the same tweaking options especially when most people like me donâ€™t want to oc but rather just lower voltage to reduce temps,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
with msi you can lower the cpu lite load for undervolt https://youtu.be/gcpuuujrqku,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[removed],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"unfortunately, b660 boards do not support voltage adjustments of any type at this moment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
what i donâ€™t understand is why is there a menu option called â€œai tweakerâ€ with all of the same oc menus and items except the 2 or 3 key options for me to offset the voltage?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"on a z-series motherboard yes, but not on a b-series.","lowering the lite load on my board doesn't even seem to lower the voltages, but it does decrease the power draw.",nowhere near as effective as a good undervolt :(,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

iâ€™ve been able to finally.,you can change the amperage as well which is actually an interesting way to set a power limit.,the asus board seems to default at a value of 312. i dropped it to 250 and it was so low that it kept the total package power well below the p1 value i set.,it also set the voltage well below the max limit + the offset.,my cb score was hilariously low.,i dialed it up and tweaked a few things and got better performance and my max temps were good enough.,iâ€™ll make a new post with some pics when i have time,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
it might do something with intel's vulnerability intel tried to retroactively mitigate with disabling undervolting.,https://plundervolt.com/doc/plundervolt.pdf and i think it's not the only one.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
see my post and linked screenshots of what i set in my bios [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/asus/comments/102i9vi/my_settings_for_improving_thermals_with_a_b660i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
